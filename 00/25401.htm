    <title>Problems with Outlook upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b mick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Outlook upgrade</h2>
                    <p>i kept getting a banner in my outlook 365 to upgrade. I didn't want to upgrade since my outlook worked just fine but the banner would not go away. I would click it off and it would pop back up when I went to my next email. so I decided to upgrade, bad idea
 and really not happy about getting spammed constantly whether its a free upgrade or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>since upgrading&nbsp;I have to manually send receive, it will only work offline so I am missing pictures in many emails even old ones. I no longer have a window to see what account the email was sent to or who was CCed. there is some little pull down I have to
 do now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 Hotmail accounts and I am finding missing emails that are not being pulled into outlook now. and they are not in my junk folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what other bugs there are but this has cost me a day of work. Tech support tells me the only way to go back to my old office is to reinstall it. causing me to loose more work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thing that ticks me off the most is it worked just fine, I already lost over a week of work because of a windows 10 upgrade crashing my computer. but outlook kept spamming me to upgrade and I was getting sick of it. why do you have to cram this stuff down
 my throat and then have it buggy as ****</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. the problems I was having was in the new outlook. </p>
<p>
</p><p>for the record I use IE11. not a big fan of edge. I can hit my Hotmail account through IE11 and see the email that is not being downloaded into outlook 2016, I can also see the email on my phone. it was actually an email about a family crises update so was
 really important. it wasn't in my junk folder either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow the offline fixed itself, I didn't change anything and now says connected and shows all the pictures in email now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the missing email was a fluke, but now that the other part is fine I really want to view CC and To bars in my outlook email. without having to use that pull down. is there a setting for this? its important for me to see who was CCed on scanning emails
 without having to click another button, </p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your help</p>

            <p>The upgrade Outlook mail is very slow to load. </p>
<p>The finding of a recipient is slower and more difficult.</p>
<p>I can no longer access my second Outlook account on my computer.</p>

 reactivate Windows 10 after hardware&nbsp;failure- do I have to - Microsoft Community</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have have four machines that have been upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp; Three are upgrades using Windows 7 licences (<em>Cronus</em>,
<em>Purple</em>, <em>Laptop</em>) &nbsp;and one came from Windows 8 one (<em>Ares</em>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine <em>Ares </em>had a major hardware failure about a month or so ago. &nbsp; It was long since upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 as part of the insider programme, so it was using the&nbsp;<strong>VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T</strong> key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine had a new motherboard and this came with a new built-in video card AND built in gigabit Ethernet AND new RAM. &nbsp;So, when Windows 10 came back to life it decided it needed to reactive. &nbsp; &nbsp;However this was during the period of time prior to launch
 when this was not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told, several times now, that it WOULD reactive when Windows 10 was launched. &nbsp; This has not been the case and I have tried everything short of reinstalling (which I don't want to do) to try and get it to activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's only the nag message and not being able to change the Desktop background image, but I would like to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            <p>Who told you 'several times' it would re-activate after a mainboard change ? - it will not ! - they were wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to clean off the machine and re-install win 8.1 - or , revert to win 8.1, make sure 8.1 is activated (if the old one was oem you are screwed) and then update the system to win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was OEM win 8.1, then that will not activate on the new mainboard so you will need to buy a new copy of win 8.1. If it is retail win 8.1 you should be able to activate 8.1 with your original key, THEN update to 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The link to the "who told me" is the one in the above posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wasn't an OEM Windows 8 key, it was a purchased-for-full-price Windows 8 licence direct from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really want to have to totally reinstall a machine that already has lots of stuff on it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other three machines have Activated, why shouldn't this one?</p>

            The windows 8.1 key does not activate windows 10 and all those pre-release keys have been disabled. Win 8.1 must be
<strong>installed and activated</strong> when doing the upgrade. The only way to get the
<strong>free</strong> upgrade is to reinstall win 8.1, install all the updates which can take many reboots and do the in place upgrade again. A Clean install will install win 10, but you will then have to purchase the license.&nbsp;

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - Timestamps</h2>
                    Afternoon all,<br />
<br />
I have a group mailbox currently in Lotus Notes - We wish to move this to Outlook 2010 (Our own work accounts are already done)<br />
<br />
In Lotus Notes you can open an email and Timestamp it - then deal with the issue.<br />
<br />
Are you able to Timestamp the emails in the inbox within Outlook 2012? (its to show what time this email was worked on by an individual)<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this explains my issue in full and thank you for taking the time to read this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Mark.<br />

-victoria--</a>. What is the exact model of your Lumia phone? Make sure that your date+time is set up properly. Go to Settings&gt;date+time&gt;Set automatically and time automatically&gt;Off. Also, your Time zone, Time, and Date are accurate and correct where it is
 required. For your connection concern, are you using a cellular data&nbsp;connection or a Wi-Fi connection? Does the other devices can connect&nbsp;to it&nbsp;properly? We'll wait for your response.

<h2>            Samsung SGH-I780 &#40;WM6.0 Pro&#41;</h2>
                    Hi, I have a Samsung SGH-i780 with WM6.0 Pro.<br />
<br />
After restarting the phone, i couldn't start any programs installed to the memory card.<br />
<br />
Instead of calling the card "Storage Card", the system sees it as "Storage Card2".<br />
<br />
How can I revert this change?<br />
<br />
Rebooting with and without the card does not help.<br />
I would preffer to avoid doing a hard reset, as I got loads of stuff on the phone (apps mainly) that were rather hard to come by and finding their install cabs will be problematic.<br />

            Ok, problem sorted out.<br />
I had to connect via activesync, manualy delete a folder called "Storage Card" in the / (root) directory of "My Windows Mobile Device". I could not rename "Storage Card2" to "Storage Card", but after i ejected the card and reinserted it, it apeared correctly.

            Check your credential manager and remove any stored password for office 365 and one drive.
<br />To do this go to search and type credential manager.
<br />From there look for any onedrive or office16 stored credentials and delete them.
<br />Then reopen your app and it should ask again and hopefully this will update it in credential manager.

<p>Thank you Sarah! I had to log in a couple times after I went into Credential Manager, but it appears to be working for now (fingers crossed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears my issue is that I have two Hotmail accounts (one for business and one for personal) and it kept referring to the wrong account that is tied to my credit card that charges my monthly subscription.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will reachout again if I have more problems.</p>

            Hi CE.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This might be remedied by changing your Windows 10 sign in to the same Microsoft Account that holds your Office 365, either by converting a Local account or changing your existing MS Account:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch-microsoft-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Something going on with your profile.
<br />Try creating another profile\account on that machine and see if the problem still persists.
<br />Follow the instructions in the link to create a local admin account.
<br />Then when you login add your Microsoft account to your account and then launch office a couple of time to see if it keeps prompting you.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>your question is not clear. It looks like you have cells coloured with conditional formatting.&nbsp; What do you want to do next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The colours of a conditional format cannot be copied to other cells, unless these cells also have conditional formatting rules applied.</p>

<h2>            Location of downloaded files on Windows 8 phone</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my Windows 8 phone (HTC 8X), I opened an e-mail message with an mp3 music attachment; the attachment downloaded onto my phone correctly, and I can click on the name of the attachment in the e-mail itself and play the file flawlessly.&nbsp; However, it does
 not show up in the Music folder, and I don't want to open the e-mail every time I want to play the file.&nbsp; I connected my Windows 8 phone&nbsp;to my computer and looked at all the folders that are displayed for the phone, but none contains the downloaded mp3 music
 file (yes, I have the box checked for showing all files, including hidden files).&nbsp; So: where is it located, and how can I move it to&nbsp;the Music folder on my phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any&nbsp;advice and counsel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the forum entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feature you would like to have, is not available on the windows Phone 7 or 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Music files that are in an attachment or on the <span>
skydriven</span> can not be saved on the phone directly.</p>
<p>The download you see is a streaming like feature. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can request the feature on the following link. </p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>I'm a member of the Searchnu Support Team. I'm here to help :)</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>From the URL you provided it looks like Searchnu was installed on your PC when you&nbsp;</div>
<div>installed iLivid- a download manager which includes Searchnu as an option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When the software was installed onto your pc it offered two basic installs, typical installation,&nbsp;</div>
<div>which lists the add-on features such as searchnu default search, and Custom installation,&nbsp;</div>
<div>which allows you to select the add-ons that you wish to install. There's no need to worry if you did the typical install - this isn't a virus,nor malware, and there's no need to Perform a virus scan against it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Please visit iLivid's support section where you will find detailed instructions for uninstalling Searchnu</div>
<div>at:http://www.ilivid.com/faq.htm</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>If you followed the instructions and still can't find a solution to the issue,&nbsp;</div>
<div>please don't hesitate to let us know and we will walk you through it :)</div>

    <title>Correct accidental usage of Caps Lock key doesn&#39;t work when Caps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> infotrust  say:</h3>
<h2>            Correct accidental usage of Caps Lock key doesn&#39;t work when Caps lock is used in another program</h2>
                    I have a client using Outlook 2016 and is having an issue where they use another program and have the Caps Lock key on. After 10-20 minutes of having the caps lock on, they will switch to Outlook and send an e-mail. When typing in outlook the first letter
 will be lower case and the rest will be uppercase. I have found that if you hit the caps lock key multiple times and leave it on as if they did by accident, then it will correct it as it should. I have tested this on my personal laptop with Windows 10 and
 Office 2016 and I have been able to re-create the same issue.&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you for your prompt reply. I have attached the link for the problem i was able to re-create. The only problem with using the program that you requested is that it didn't show anything i typed, so the second attachment will show the final screenshot
 for what i typed. In between the 2 sets of things i typed i hit the CAPS lock key twice. Hitting the key twice seems to fix the stickyness issue of the key. The only thing that doesn't show in the recordings is that i hit the caps lock key 15 minutes prior
 to doing anything. I have verified the setting multiple times and the boxes are checked to fix this issue.

            <p>We've had the same issue with the Office 2016 apps at the company where I work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my testing I've found that if I turn on caps lock without the Office 2016 app (Outlook, Word, etc.) having the focus then the "Correct accidental usage of cAPS LOCK key" setting in AutoCorrect options has no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the&nbsp;Office 2016 app (Outlook, Word, etc.) <em>does </em>have the focus when I turn on caps lock&nbsp;then the "Correct accidental usage of cAPS LOCK key" setting does what it is supposed to do and auto-corrects what is typed and turns off caps lock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would consider this to be a bug in Office 2016. &nbsp;Prior versions of the Office apps did not act this way and always auto-corrected as you would expect regardless of what window had the focus when you turned caps lock on.</p>

            I have just upgraded from Office 2013 Professional to Office 2016 Professional.&nbsp; The cAPSLOCK autocorrect worked in Office 2013 but has not worked since the 2016 upgrade.&nbsp; I have tried running a Quick Repair and a Full Repair (through Control Panel) but
 neither has resolved the issue.&nbsp; I have created a completely new profile and tested with this, the problem remains so it is a Machine not a User issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not been able to recreate Vardhaman's scenario on my PC; whether or not Office is in focus when
 CAPSLOCK is turned on, the autocorrect does not work.&nbsp; I have a colleague who has a new PC with Office 2016 installed from new.&nbsp; He can recreate Vardhaman's scenario;&nbsp;Autocorrect works provided CAPSLOCK is turned on when Office is in focus but does not if
 it is turned on before Office is opened or if another programme is in focus when it is turned on.&nbsp; Both our PCs are unning Windows 7 Professional SP1.

            <p>We are also experiencing the same issue since upgrading to Office 2016. The auto correct of the CAPS lock either doesn't work at all or works intermittently in that when typing a sentence it may correct some of the incorrect usage of the CAPS lock but not
 others. This was working fine with Office 2013 but not since upgrading.</p>
<p>

 suggests it is not hardware related.

            <p>Yes, that is a typical problem.&nbsp; At the service desk, ask to speak to the manager. Over the years, I have seen at least 2 reports here of specifically Best Buy managers stepping up and giving refunds in situations where they didn't have to in the name of
 customer service.&nbsp; Maybe you'll get lucky too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use a brute force method. Contact your credit card company and ask for a refund because the product is defective.&nbsp; Maybe we can get the credit card companies to force MS to improve their product quality.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you can't get satisfaction from MS, take your problem public.&nbsp; Find one or more ombudsmen to help you.&nbsp; Someone in the media (online, print, radio, tv, provincial, BBB) who has a "customer rights" focus. ie Leo Laport does on online/TV show with a customer
 service element.&nbsp; Getting someone with the ability to publicize your bad customer experience on your side is a good way to apply leverage to big companies.&nbsp; It is a known fact in advertising that unhappy customers complain to more people about their problem
 than happy people share their good experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The flip side can be the memory of exceptional customer service can survive a long time.&nbsp; Almost 30 years ago a<strong> Maynards Hardware
</strong>store did an exchange over the phone on a $700 purchase. They helped arrange cheap shipping and were willing to wait till 'whenever' we were in town (couple hundred miles away) to bring back the exchanged item.&nbsp;
<strong>Exceptional</strong>!&nbsp; And, note, I did mention that a couple of Best Buy managers have stepped up to help customers on this forum.

            <p>While, like is the same in nearly all software applications, there are a few issues with Office 2016, if your installation of it is as unstable as you make out, you should try a few of the troubleshooting steps that are suggested, more in the individual
 application forums than in this forum, which is for peer support with programming (i.e. automation) of the various Office applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of the issues that do occur are actually the result of interference by third party applications, rather than with the Office applications themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your issues are with Word, you could start by looking at <span>
the KnowledgeBase article "How to troubleshoot problems that occur when you start or use Word" at:<br />

            <p>Thanks for updating us. We suggest to soft reset the phone by pressing and holding the power and volume down buttons at the same time until the phone restarts. Once the phone is up and running again, try to open store app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the first workaround didn't resolve the issue, back up the phone and perform a hard reset. Go to
<strong>Settings&gt; System&gt; About&gt; Reset</strong> <strong>your phone</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Backing up the phone is very important before performing a hard reset as the phone will be wiped out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Office 365 will not open after the latest update</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to open any of my office 365 programs, Excel, Powerpoint, existing documents... &nbsp;When I click the icon to open it gives me an error message that says "the application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000022)." &nbsp;I have tried uninstalling the
 program and reinstalling from the microsoft website which did not work. &nbsp;I recently did the update to Office 365 and I am running Windows 10. &nbsp;I cannot figure out how to uninstall the update to office that I just did as I'm pretty sure that's the reason the
 programs are no longer working. &nbsp;I am paying for a monthly subscription and I use this program for work and school so I need it to work properly asap. &nbsp;Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Typically, one would open the Details form from the double-click event of the List form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Design the list form, then find the double-click event in the Properties window, click the … button and enter this VBA one-liner:</p>
<p>docmd.OpenForm "Functions",acNormal, ,"ID=" &amp; Me.ID<br />
</p>
<p>(I'm guessing at your object names; change as needed)</p>
