<h2>            Disable bluetooth auto connect</h2>
                    <p>My computer always automatically connects to my Bluetooth audio device. Is there a way to keep Bluetooth on (so I can still use my Bluetooth mouse) but manually connect to the audio device, only when I want? I can't use the audio device with my phone when
 my computer is on :-( </p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that this was also a problem in windows 8:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/win-8-dont-want-bluetooth-to-autoconnect/5b17b980-54ea-4831-a21e-4a8d532ddc5e</p>

            <p><span>Hi Brekkie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Bluetooth works by pairing devices. Once pairing is confirmed, it automatically connects to one another when both devices are on.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To manually connect your devices, follow these steps to remove the pairing on your computer by deleting the audio device pairing:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Select <strong>
Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Devices</strong> &gt; <strong>Bluetooth &amp; other devices</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select the paired Bluetooth device that you want to remove &gt;
<strong>Remove device</strong> &gt; <strong>Yes</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can always connect your audio device to your computer if you want to use them again. You can post your suggestion in our

<h2>            delete frames from middle of videos and join</h2>
                    I have 3 videos (MP4) I am trying to join in Movie maker. Before I join I want to remove some unwanted frames. Some are at beginning or end of a video. Some are in the middle. How do I delete and how do I join the edited videos?

            <p>Add the clips you want to edit into Movie Maker.&nbsp; If you want to trim items from the beginning or end of a clip, use the Trim facility to set the Start / End points of the clip.&nbsp; If you want to remove something in the middle, use the Split facility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine you have a clip that looks like the following:</p>
<p>GGGGGBBBBGGGGG</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You like the good parts (G) but not the bad parts (B).&nbsp; So play the clip until you are just before a bad part.&nbsp; Now either choose Video Tools | Edit | Split, or just press
<strong>M</strong> on the keyboard.&nbsp; That will split the clip into two parts.</p>
<p>GGGGG|BBBBGGGGG</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now play it until you are at the end of the bad part.&nbsp; Again, press <strong>M</strong> on the keyboard to split the video clip again.&nbsp; The result will be the following 3 clips:</p>
<p>GGGGG|BBBB|GGGGG</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right-click on the middle (bad) clip and choose <strong>Remove</strong>.&nbsp; The result will be just the good parts of your movie.</p>
<p>GGGGG|GGGGG</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To now save this as your final movie, choose <strong>File </strong>(Alt+F) and then
<strong>Save movie</strong>.&nbsp; Give it a new name and that video file will only have the good parts joined together.</p>

                    I have a video library that I want to be able to sort using Tags, but it seems Windows Media Player does not allow batch editing of file properties, particularly files of different type. How can I edit many different files at once from within WMP?

"It is possible to select and edit the tags for multiple tracks at the same time. For example, this would be handy if you wanted to change the genre for the whole album. Simply highlight as many tracks as you like, and then right-click and select the Advanced
 Tag Editor as before. Be careful about doing this, as your changes will be applied across the board, and if you make a mistake, you can mess things up in a hurry. Unfortunately, there is no "undo" button in Windows Media Player, so use the function conservatively."</p>

<h2>            Lost&#47;deleted e-mails, can&#39;t restore previous version of Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>A problem with sending e-mails with Windows Live 7&nbsp;has turned into a nightmare.&nbsp;My internet provider tried for hours last night to resolve this, which ended with trying to close and re-open my&nbsp;account. Now all my folders &amp; important e-mails have been&nbsp;"lost"
 or deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried desperately to get them back.&nbsp; I have gone to my&nbsp;"computer" and found windows live, right clicked and found "restore previous version" but the restore button is grey and can not be used. I could only copy and put that version in a folder, but
 can't do much else with it or see the e-mails. While it was copying it showed 563 e-mails being transferred which sounds about right but I cannot view them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do now?</p>

            <p>You'll have to be much more accurate with your descriptions if anyone is to be able to see what's happened and how to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I have gone to my&nbsp;"computer" and found windows live, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live what? There are 37 folders on my computer whose names start with Windows Live. You are looking for your store folder, the one that contains the file called Mail.MSMessageStore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>right clicked ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Right-clicked on what? You're looking for the account folder that you deleted yesterday. It will by default called
<em>Domain (user), </em>but you might have changed this. It will have sub-folders called Inbox and several others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>found "restore previous version" but the restore button is grey</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>If a previous version is available, it will be listed in the <em>Folder versions
</em>window with some details which might include the folder name and the date and time it was saved. You should select the newest previous version that pre-dates the accident, then click
<em>Open </em>to see the messages it contains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then copy the entire folder or some of the sub-folders to an empty folder on your desktop. Depending on how&nbsp;many messages are involved, you may find it simplest to drag messages from the desktop folder into the message list in Windows Live Mail.
 Work offline while doing this to avoid interference, and take your time while doing it. Allow the program to settle down after dragging each batch&nbsp;before moving another one. When they've all been dragged to where they should be, close the program down and
 wait ten minutes before re-launching. Again, wait a few minutes before doing anything with messages other than reading them.</p>

            <p>Let's just skip all the comments up to "restore previous version" and start there.</p>
<p>Yes, I found and saved/copied the newest previous version and that is what is in a folder on my desktop as explained in my previous e-mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My internet provider went into my computer tonight and we viewed what is in that folder and all we can find is application extensions, THM files,&nbsp;a DAT file&nbsp;and 3 file folders named "en", "fr" and "proof" which have the same type of files in there as well.&nbsp;He
 believes this is the right&nbsp;location but cannot find the type of file folders that would have saved my e-mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you suggesting a different area to look for these files? </p>
<p>A step by step explanation would be very helpful.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't. That sounds like the program files directory, most probably </p>
<p><strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Live\Mail</strong></p>
<p>depending on the bitness of your Windows version.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>EDIT: &nbsp;I found Mail.MSMessageStore and an error comes up saying "windows can't open this file"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>No, it&nbsp;wouldn't be&nbsp;able to. That is the index file for your message database. The folder you found it in is the store folder. Note that there will usually be two copies, not necessarily identical, one of them inside a
<em>Backup </em>folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look in the previous version of the store folder - by default known as <em>Windows Live Mail</em> - for the account folder you're missing.&nbsp;As I wrote earlier, it will by default called
<em>Domain (user), </em>but you might have changed this. It will have sub-folders called Inbox and several others. This is the folder you should copy to your desktop.</p>

    <title>Missing Bluetooth - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josephfitzpatrick1998  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Bluetooth</h2>
                    <p>Today while trying to connect my bluetooth speaker I ran into trouble connecting, and found that my bluetooth settings were missing. I have a Toshiba Satellite running windows 10. I had previously used a different bluetooth speaker which worked without any
 issue. I could close my laptop and the speaker would automatically link to my laptop when I opened it. However, my current problem arose after closing my laptop. Three times now I have linked up my speaker and laptop, closed my laptop, and opened it to fin
 the bluetooth settings are just gone. The first couple of times I was able to fix it by just restarting my laptop. The third time though, That didn't cut it. I tried u[dating my driver, but Windows can;t find a more up to date version. I also tried uninstalling
 all bluetooth software and reinstalling it by restarting, but that didn't work either. What's next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: The bluetooth wasn't working when I went to bed the other night, and I didn't use my laptop until I got back from school the next day. I didn't turn my laptop off, I just left it to hibernate all day. When I got back from school that day, the bluetooth
 was working again. Now 4 days later, I'm having the same problem. I closed my computer without disconnecting my Bluetooth speaker, and the settings disappeared. I have closed my laptop without disconnecting multiple times without this problem occurring, yet
 the problem doesn't arise unless I close my laptop without disconnecting. Though, like I said, it doesn't happen every time.&nbsp;</p>

I have managed to solve the problem with the help of the software suppliers as the other methods did not help in this case. Many thanks for your help and suggestions.<br />

<p>So it is:&nbsp;<em>Required storage device has been removed. The console is restarted.</em></p>
<p>And that repeat all over again. I though that it's something with my DVDs, but no - they are working on my computer, so... I hever had these problems before. What is going on? What I should do?</p>

            <p>Sounds like there's a problem with your Hard Drive. &nbsp;Pull it out and then put it back in to make sure it's firmly connected.</p>
<p>You could also try clearing the console's cache to see if that helps.</p>

<p>A final thought would be to remove the hard drive entirely to see if the DVD will play then. &nbsp;If there are no problems when the hard drive is removed then that is probably where the problem resides.</p>

<p><span><span>Hello shalba1,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Did
 you make any changes to the computer before having the issues with Windows update?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What
 exactly do you mean when you say Media Player attempts to open commands and downloads?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you review the updates and find out what updates are failing with what error codes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Go to Windows Update in Control Panel. (Click the Start button, click All Programs, and then click Windows Update.)<br />
In the left pane, click Check for updates. You can review or select from any available updates before installing them.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can check what are the recent updates failing to install and what are the exact error codes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I also suggest that you reset the Windows update components. You can refer the below article that will give you information on this:</span></span></p>

<h2>            screen time not accurate</h2>
                    <p>for some unexplained reason when i allocate screen time for my kid, XBOX cuts short the time without any reason or notification. for example i allocated 2.5 hours but the kid told me he play less than 2 hours and complained about it, since i assumed he was
 not telling the trouth, BUT when the weekly usage report came i noticed that the play time exactly what the kid told me....</p>
<p>called customer support, the answer roughly " what you want from me? if you want your kid to have 2 houres give him more.....", way to go MS....</p>

<p>Sorry to hear that you were talking with a Support agent that didn't take your issue seriously. If the Family time restrictions aren't working properly then he should be filling out a case report for you and escalating it to a higher level of Support.</p>

<strong>I don't think time limits is working, because the time in the device usage report does not match what I observe in real life.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If your child uses multiple devices, then keep in mind that each device tracks their allowances separately. &nbsp;For example, a child who is limited to 1 hour, but can sign into 2 Windows PC's, could use each PC for 1 hour, for a total of 2 hours of
 usage that day.</li><li>Time limits are enforced based on when they are signed in (even idle time), but idle time is not counted in the device usage report.&nbsp; For example, if your child's allowance is 2 hours, and they sign in and don't do anything,
 the child would be locked out after 2 hours, but the device usage report may show as little as 1 minute of usage</li></ul>

<p>Based on OK Fowl's post which includes information I wasn't aware of, I'd monitor the usage for another week or so to try and see if it is the idle time that is throwing off the report time and apparent early termination of game playing time.</p>

    <title>Could not reconnect all network drives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pembers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Could not reconnect all network drives</h2>
                    I am using a WD NAS drive which comes with 'Discovery Software' for mapping the drive automatically. The drive is connected through a Netgear Gigabit wired switch. Vista (Home Premium) recognises the drive and shows it in 'Computer'.<br />
At start up I SOMETIMES get a message saying 'it was not possible to reconnect all network drives'. In 'Computer' they are shown with a red cross. Clicking on the cross immediately reconnects the drive. This does not happen every time I start the system but
 sufficiently to be a nuisance.<br />
None of the previous threads seem to apply and I am not sure if I should apply the 'hot fix'.<br />
Would appreciate any advice.

            Hello Pembers.<br />
I have been struggling with the same problem in Vista and RC 7.&nbsp; I think I have found the cause.&nbsp; I disabled my firewall in F-Secure Internet Security and the problem went away.&nbsp; I believe that no network activity is possible until the AV/firewall is fully
 functional (towards the end of Windows boot).&nbsp; Windows tries to open the mapped drives, but the firewall has the network blocked for a few seconds... or more.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I don't know if the good folks at Microsoft can come up with a way to delay the connection of the network drive until after a firewall has been fully functional.<br />

<p>I assume you are referring to the .temp files / folder created by windows and apps, you cannot stop them from being created, as they are files required by windows and various apps, when they temporarily require data to be created / stored for the running
 of the process, some apps will automatically delete these files on completion of their task, some unfortunately do not. They do not normally create any problems and they are essential to the smooth running of windows / apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can delete them by using the the 'Disk Clean up' feature </p>

<p>Thanks for your response, but I am concerned with "tempstate" files.&nbsp; The path is "C:\Users\(myname)\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft." &nbsp;&nbsp; with different variations such as .Microsoft Edge or Windows.Cortana &nbsp; etc.&nbsp; . Some files are empty and some are huge
 which slow down my computer.&nbsp; I've found very little reference to these files on-line and find them on my computer only by doing a search for them. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I need to get some saved games from my Xbox 360 but they are in a second profile, and that profile does not have a gold account &amp; so I don´t have access to cloud storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However on my Xbox One both profiles are there &amp; the second one benefits from the Gold of the primary one.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Unfortunately that does not translate back to Xbox 360....</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So how can I get my saved games from that second account?</span></p>

<p>Hi, you can't, It's because of the profile needing gold on the 360 to access the cloud. &nbsp;Maybe Microsoft should do away with that restriction, otherwise a lot of gamers will have to start their games again on the Xbox One.</p>

                    <div>Hello! I hope you're having a better day than I am! lol So I brought this gaming PC a few months ago and its been working extremely well until now! It has been crashing, Blue screening, and doing bad things so I decided to switch out the ram. I've never
 done it before but I thought it would be easy. I got the same exact RAM as it had before, installed it, started up my PC than I came to a screen getting me a whole brunch of options and an error: CMOS Checksum Bad</div>

</div>
<div>Maybe I should have let a professional install my RAM! :( I have a MSI 790FX - GD70 Motheroard. So if you could PLEASE send sometime using your amazing brain to help me solve this issue, that would be great! Thank you and have a nice da</div>

<h3> acr hardvibes  say:</h3>
<h2>            FREE monthly game Dead Space &#40;xbox one backward compatible&#41; not in my list of games anymore</h2>
                    <p>Ok&nbsp;what happened? I got the&nbsp;game this year (it was one of the monthly games you get for FREE with xbox live gold). It is STILL installed on my xbox one, so I tried to fire it up but a message pops up saying&nbsp;I need to access with the account the game was purchased with. THIS is the account I got the game with. &nbsp;Like I got Grid 2, Borderlands etc...</p>
<p>I know how to check all the games I got, it's at this address <a href="https://account.xbox.com/it-IT/MyGames/Xbox360?Page=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.xbox.com/it-IT/MyGames/Xbox360?Page=1</a>&nbsp;, ALL of the other games I got are here, except Dead Space. Why?</p><p><br /></p><p>P.S. my XBL gold expires in 2018 so this is not the problem.</p>
