<h2>            Critical Error  start menu not working</h2>
                    I get this message when I click the start; Critical Error&nbsp; start bar menu not working we will try and fix when you restart...restart now is only option, restarting does not fix it. Note only start menu is mentioned, not Contana.

            <p>Hi Vanessa..thank you for your quick response but confusion reigns... two things; you suggest I check if the issue occurs in a Local Account or a Microsoft account...can you tell me how I determine local or Microsoft please?.... I performed a SFC scan as
 suggested and this was the result;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/acf1b672-c457-419d-9529-73c67369cba6" /></p>
<p>At this point in time I am not comfortable with proceeding further as per your instructions. Are you able to advise me if I am able to perform the 'roll back' to 8.1 option?, I am unable to access 'Settings' as my start menu is not working.</p>

            <p>Vanessa....two weeks have passed since my last communication via this forum....although I have been successful in reverting back to a previous version of Windows I did so reluctantly....I
<p>Judging from input from other Windows 10 users in other Microsoft Community postings it now appears that I am far from being alone with this 'Critical Error' issue...I would appreciate some feedback....is this problem being treated as a 'bug' in the system?,
 is it 'operator or equipment error', i.e, something to do with me or my laptop??....the silence however is quite unexpected.</p>
<p>Kind regards.</p>

            Tonight...August 31st I received a very strange email from the Microsoft Community Team...it said in part;
<p><span><em>We noticed that the question hasn't been marked as Answered yet and we were wondering if you resolved the issue.</em>
</span></p>
From this I take it that no one from the Microsoft Community Team actually reads any responses to these questions....I feel like a fool as I honestly thought differently. My issue has not been resolved and I have had follow up at all, my introduction to Windows
 10 has been a very sad experience, at least I am not alone though I get little comfort from that.<br />

            I appear to be in a similar boat to&nbsp;a lot of people with this Critical Error Message and have tried the points mentioned above i.e. Running the SFC and subsequently the DISM Tools put as yet I am no further on and cannot seem to find a thread that appears
 to have resolved the issue?

            I need more information before I can answer.&nbsp; Exactly what file are you trying to open (full path and filename including extension)?&nbsp; Are you logged in as a standard user or as an administrator (and is it the same username as that in the file path)?&nbsp; Are
 you the owner of the file or was it created by someone else?<br />

            Hello B.r.i.a.n,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Here are the steps to modify ownership and permissions:</strong></span></span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li><span>Right-click the file or folder, click
<strong>Properties</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</span>
</li><li><span>Click <strong>Advanced</strong>, and then click the
<strong>Owner</strong> tab.</span> </li><li><span>Click <strong>Edit</strong>, and then do one of the following:</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>*·To change the owner to a user or group that is not listed, click
<strong>Other users and groups </strong>and, in <strong>Enter the object name to select (examples)</strong>, type the name of the user or group, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to take ownership of the contents of the folder, select the
<strong>Replace owner on subcontainers and objects</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>
OK</strong>, and then click <strong>Yes</strong> when you receive the following message:
</span></p>
<p><span>You do not have permission to read the contents of directory
<em>folder name</em>. Do you want to replace the directory permissions with permissions granting you Full Control?</span></p>
<p><span>All permissions will be replaced if you click
<strong>Yes</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: &nbsp;</strong><em>folder name</em> is the name of the folder that you want to take ownership of.
</span></p>
<p><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>
OK</strong>, and then reapply the permissions and security settings that you want for the folder and its contents.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Additional considerations:</span></span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>An administrator can take ownership of any file on the computer.
</span></li><li><span>Assigning ownership of a file or a folder might require you to elevate your permissions using User Access Control.
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />

Hope this helps you with your file/folder issues. Let us know either way. Make it a great day!</strong></span>

<p>Hey I'm having the same problem, no response to my post yet either, but I found this article on their support site, check it out if you haven't already. It didn't solve any of my problems but there's a survey on the page that they say they will forward to
 the proper support team, has only been a few days but hoping for a response :) Good luck! I got all of the achievements throughout the legendary campaigns until Halo 4. Didn't give me Requiem or the Halo 4 game ending or MCC completion achievements!! Was waiting
 for it and nothing ever popped :(, hopefully these guys get back to you as well:

<p>Also, in an old thread i found some folks actually got help with this, the support crew needed the info you give in the survey (date and time and name of achievements you missed)</p>
<p>Here's mine:</p>
<p>Requiem (sometime between 12/20/15-12/23/15, probably closer to 12/22-23)</p>
<p>Herald of Reclamation (12/24/15 around 1am)</p>
<p>Veteran (12/24/15 around 1am)</p>
<p>War Hero (12/24/15 around 1am)</p>
<p>Legend (12/24/15 around 1am)</p>
<p>Wake Up John (12/24/15 around 1am)</p>
<p>I Need a Hero (12/24/15 around 1am)</p>
<p>The Legend of 117 (12/24/15 around 1am)</p>
<p>Lone Wolf Legend (12/24/15 around 1am)</p>
<p>Also "Librarian's Gift" (12/24/15 around 1am)</p>
<p>Maybe one of our threads will get a response :)</p>

 but it didn't respond.&nbsp; I tried again yesterdaya and it took nearly 3 hours to load up to its normal state and then my Kaspersky internet security&nbsp;seemed to flash like crazy with a warning to fix now.&nbsp; I clicked on fix now and it ran an update which seemed
 to work.&nbsp; I then logged off and back on to see if this had been the problem with the slow logon earlier but it went back to taking ages just to log on and clearly didn't look right.&nbsp; However I left it to run and it came up with the message - Logon Process
 has failed to create the security options dialog. X Failure - Security Options.</p>
<p>I have another account to log on my laptop with and could access the internet where I have browsed various support pages to help but nothing seems to work.&nbsp; I tried to system restore by f8 at logon but it saidI&nbsp;the system restore failed due to an unspecified
 error.&nbsp; The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error (0X8007045D).&nbsp; I ran scannow and was given windows resource protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.&nbsp; The CBS log gave me three errors but I don't know how
 to resolve this further.</p>
<p>I am using the internet on safe mode through another account than my normal one however this account is being non responsive now unless i am in safe mode.</p>
<p>Please can anyone help?????</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps with another computer if necessary).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause. The rest either must be done from safe mode with networking or from a different user account if that works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;logon or security (Start / Control
 Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To
 fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>B</span></strong><span>oot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem
 occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If other accounts are working and yours is the only one with real problems, then it may be corrupted.&nbsp;<span>To
 fix this use </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and
 only if you can still boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

<p>This a complete scam, and one that's become very common lately. . Do not believe anything such a caller says, do nothing he tells you to do, and hang up on him immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;let them into your computer,&nbsp;you&nbsp;are now at grave risk for what they might have done there (installed spyware? Identity theft? Stolen passwords?), and I strongly recommend that you do both the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Reinstall Windows cleanly</p>
<p>2. Change all your passwords, especially those for financial institutions and online stores.</p>

<h3> danfultonxe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro System Firmware Update 2&#47;24&#47;2016 won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro running Windows 8.1 with all updates current. Several days ago, I noticed in Windows Update that a "System Firmware Update - 2/24/2016" was waiting to be installed with a restart. I restarted then checked Update History and found that
 the update had failed and was again waiting to be installed with a restart. Since that day, I have tried 12 different times to install this firmware update and each time it has failed. Today, the update is no longer available in Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reviewing the Update History, I do not see where this particular firmware update has ever been successfully installed. It does not list any previous install failures, it just isn't listed at any time in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In researching this issue on-line, I wound up&nbsp;at the Windows Download Center (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49038</a>) and found "All current software, firmware,
 and drivers for the Surface Pro" available. There were four files available for download:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DataEraserSetup.msi (399.2 MB)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surface Pro\Surface Pro 1 - January 2015.zip (372.8 MB)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surface Pro\SurfacePro_Win10_150723_0.zip (149.6 MB)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surface Pro\Windows8.1-KB2969817-x64.msu (343 KB)</p>
<p>I chose the last one since it appeared to be the one matching&nbsp;my system. I do not know what the first one is for. When I downloaded the last one and tried to install it, I received an error message saying that this file was not applicable to my machine.
 ??????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that these firmware updates sometimes take multiple times to install since they are released in "batches" but it seems strange to me that this one has never&nbsp;appeared until now, several months after the publish date of 3/25/2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone shed some light on this and give me some help on getting this firmware update installed?</p>
<p>

            <p>For me it turns out the culprit was the "PCI Simple Communication Controller", it was lacking a driver, and Windows Update couldn't find one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did a quick search on Intel's site for the generic one, since I'm using the Surface Pro, I took the 3rd Gen Core one:<br />
</p>

</p><p>After the install, I did the Windows Update again, and then the firmware update succeeded.</p>

    <title>Need help upgrading from IE8 to IE10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grace444  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help upgrading from IE8 to IE10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
</p>
<p>Is it possible to upgrade from IE8 to IE10 and if so, can someone post clear (dummies, lol) instructions for doing that? I'm using 64-bit&nbsp;Windows 7.</p>
<p><br />
I tried several things already, per this thread but could not get&nbsp;IE10 to install:<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie8-windows_7/how-to-upgrade-from-ie8-to-ie10/dd2b1d87-297e-4694-8538-eed16d4a0a3e?msgId=713260a4-491c-4cfc-bdcf-e3c4d01cca6c">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie8-windows_7/how-to-upgrade-from-ie8-to-ie10/dd2b1d87-297e-4694-8538-eed16d4a0a3e?msgId=713260a4-491c-4cfc-bdcf-e3c4d01cca6c</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I'd like for the tool bars to be similar; is there a way to export/import tool bar settings or to set the same or similar settings in IE10 or will they automatically be copied?&nbsp;I have backed up my Favorites in case I need to import them.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Edge custom print scale gone&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> disgrunt&#91;ed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Edge custom print scale gone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Internet Explorer had a custom print scale feature in the print preview. This was super handy, especially when the default printing would spill just a line or two onto the next page. In Internet Explorer I could just custom scale the print size
 down a few percentage points, and it would print one less page.&nbsp;The custom print size feature was so useful, that I would often paste an URL from Chrome into IE, just so I could get the print size I wanted. However, in Microsoft Edge, it appears this custom
 print scale feature is missing, and all I can do is scale the print size in huge 25% increments or accept the default "shrink to fit" scale. Is there a way to custom scale the print size in the new Microsoft Edge browser? (Or did Microsoft, in their infinite
 wisdom, decide that users don't need this useful custom print scale feature?)</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Default Browser Selection Issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Default Browser Selection Issues</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue with making IE my default browser in Windows 10 and I'm looking for some help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into settings/System/default apps and change the browser settings from Edge to IE and I thought this was all I have to do but this change is not covering everything.&nbsp; For example, If I go into&nbsp;KeePass, my password vault program, and click a link associated
 with a password protected web site like the Microsoft Community Forum, the page that opens&nbsp;is opened in IE as it should. However, if I'm reading an email newsletter like "Today on CNet", in Microsoft Outlook 2010 and click on a link in that newsletter, I get
 a this prompt <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/574e10db-1a70-4558-9358-bc6d94601e51" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>asking me if I want to continue using IE or whether I want to switch to Edge or whether I want to look in the App Store. As you can see, there's a check box on the prompt that asks me if I always want to use the selected (highlighted) app, but if I check
 it, the next time I&nbsp;click on a similar email link&nbsp;I'm still prompted to select what browser I wish to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now.....&nbsp; If I change the default browser back to the Edge&nbsp;and click on a link in an email the prompt shown above does not appear.&nbsp; It's only when I attempt to change the default browser to IE that this problem presents itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>. Can anyone tell me how to fix this issue?</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply but the link you provided does not solve my problem.&nbsp; I can set Internet Explorer to be the default browser as noted in the article you sent however once I do, if I go into Outlook 2010 and view a HTML-based email with links to a
 web page (i.e. like a newsletter from CNet) and you click on one of these links, the prompt shown above appears that asks if I want to keep using this app (Internet Explorer) or use Edge or visit the app store.&nbsp; Even if you check the check box to always use
 this app, checking the checkbox does nothing and the next time you click on the link you get the prompt again.&nbsp; The only thing that works in Outlook 2010 that doesn't involve a prompt is to leave Edge as the default browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that apparently I'm not the only person that has this problem as I'm finding quite a number of posts on forums seeking the same solution as I am.&nbsp; Apparently, this is a bug either in Windows 10 or a bug in Outlook 2010 that's the cause.&nbsp; In one of the
 treads I've read elsewhere the person was able to install Chrome as the browser and make it the default instead of IE and the prompt never occurs.&nbsp; If, however, he attempts to make IE the default browser, the prompt will appear every time.&nbsp; Hope this explains
 my problem a bit more.&nbsp; I don't want to install or use Chrome as my browser and want to use IE.</p>

            <p>Here's the definitive answer to this problem and if the moderator of this forum reads this they can mark this as the solution for other readers.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, this is an issue that only impacts people that <strong>(1)</strong> are using Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 on
<strong>(2)</strong> Windows 10 who <strong>(3</strong>) only wish to use Internet Explorer 11 instead of some other browser like Edge, Chrome or Firefox.&nbsp; Apparently, this issue is also considered to be an Outlook issue not a Windows 10 issue because other
 applications that launch the default browner via programed links or through hyperlinks in documents work normally whereas&nbsp;attempts to launch Internet Explorer&nbsp;via HTML-based email links fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround is documented in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3094186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3094186</a> and involves adding two registry keys and placing 1 of 2 strings of data in as the default value data for the subordinate key.&nbsp; One string will open a new instance of IE each time the user clicks on a link
 in an HTML-based email.&nbsp; The other string will open an instance of IE if IE is not already open and open a new tab in IE if IE is open.&nbsp; The latter sting that opens a new tab, is, in my opinion, is the work around that best matches how Edge works if it is
 the default browser instead of Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Note however that this is not a "perfect" fix as users may notice a command window momentarily flash open and immediately close when IE is not open.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note also that this work around may have to be removed
 if the user decides to return to using Edge as the default browser instead of Internet Explorer however I have not personally confirmed this need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that because the KB article specifically stated that the work around is for Outlook 2007 and 2010 users it is "assumed" that Outlook 2013 and 2016 users will not experience this issue if they attempt t use Internet Explorer as their default browner
 in Windows 10.&nbsp; That being said, this is only and assumption at this point since I have no means of testing any other version of Outlook other than Outlook 2010.</p>

            Followed the link to MS support page. In addition to above there is a single click option, then just follow instructions. I selected the run option and it downloaded and installed then run checker which did the fix after creating a restore point. Well
 done. NB I have Office 2007 installed.

            <p>Thought I would provide some additional input regarding this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my September 28, 2015 reply I provided a hyperlink to KB3094186 which provided a registry change that would allow you to open Internet Explorer as your default browser if you were using an earlier version of Outlook as your email client.&nbsp; After using
 this work around for several months I became dissatisfied because there's a limitation to the size of the hyperlink that you can open from within an email.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example I would get a email from Amazon.com and it would have a ridiculously long hyperlink and
 when I&nbsp;would select&nbsp;it in an email the hyperlink would truncate and I&nbsp;would either be taken to a&nbsp;different page or I&nbsp;would get a page not found.&nbsp; To get to the page I&nbsp;wanting to visit I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;right click the hyperlink, copy the link, open up a browser session
 if one was not already open,&nbsp;paste in the copied link and then press the&nbsp;ENTER key which pretty much defeats the purpose of the fix.&nbsp; In addition, I&nbsp;don't know if Edge became faster or Internet Explorer became slower but I noticed a huge performance issue
 opening pages while using IE as my default browner.&nbsp; As a result,&nbsp;since I don't like Chrome or Firefox, I decided to&nbsp;once again make Edge my default&nbsp;browser even though I feel a bit exposed to threats since Edge still does not allow extensions that can interface
 with my security&nbsp;software.&nbsp; Note that switching back to Edge did not require me to remove the additional registry value needed to make Outlook work with IE so I left it in.&nbsp; It's also worth noting that ZDNet published a test this week http://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-the-best-windows-10-web-browser-the-benchmarks-are-in/?tag=nl.e539&amp;s_cid=e539&amp;ttag=e539&amp;ftag=TRE17cfd61
 that shows that Internet Explorer is pretty much the worst browser you can be using on Windows 10 so my advice is now to&nbsp;drop IE as your browser and switch to Edge or to Chrome if you need the extensions.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I too found that the KB3094186 workaround regularly failed, but the reason was not because the hyperlink was too long, but because it contained special characters such as ampersand (&amp;).</p>
<p>That workaround requires the creation of a Registry Key containing a command such as the following (which is to open the link in a new tab):</p>
<p>
</p><p>cmd /c start %1</p>
<p>
</p><p>The %1 parameter contains the hyperlink to be opened.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that the Windows command interpreter will interpret any characters within that parameter&nbsp;that it recognises as special.&nbsp; This includes removing ampersand characters and everything that follows it.</p>
<p>To solve this I modified the command to&nbsp;include double&nbsp;quotes around the parameter to stop its contents being interpreted.&nbsp; Here's the command that is now in my Registry Key named "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\htmlfile\shell\opennew\command":</p>
<p>
</p><p>cmd /c start "Hyperlink" "%1"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I also had to provide a Title immediately after the start command, otherwise it would have treated "%1" as the Title and simply opened a command shell (I chose "Hyperlink", but anything within double quotes will do).</p>

            <p>&nbsp; NOW I have to fix windows?&nbsp; Why don't I just sign up for Linix and write code all day?&nbsp;&nbsp; Until a recent upgrade I never saw that choice: Which browser did I want to use?&nbsp; And, BTW the only selection that works is Edge.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; So I consider this strictly a marketing ploy to promote Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; Don't you just love big brother?&nbsp; The genius that thought up this choice has gotten his/her promotion and moved onto other challenging promotions like Charmin's new product selection:
 when you go to get a piece of toilet paper, a bull charges in and offers you their personal selection of toilet paper (approved by a committee of Microsoft employees) and two pictures of other toilet papers.&nbsp; And won't let you use the one that is there!&nbsp; The
 one you all ready have selected.&nbsp; the hyperlink that used to work until Win10 fixed it.&nbsp; Get this off my blankety-blank computer!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, we'll be asked what FONT we prefer when MS gets tired of paying patent rights to whomever.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This promotion also pushes up the the number of users for Edge falsely and I think will cause Europe and the EU to haul MS into court.&nbsp;

<h2>            XP Dell Wireless 1395 WLAN MiniCard driver compatibility issue with currently installed Vista Home Edition 32-Bit Service Pack II</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, my OS is Windows Vista Home Edition 32-bit Service Pack 2 - installed over XP by the original owner without first unintalling XP.&nbsp; Although my device manager lists the Dell Wireless 1395 WLAN MiniCard as working properly, Windows Solutions says it has
 stopped functioning properly because the installed driver is not compatible with my current operating system (just one among numerous issues).&nbsp; Although I can get online wirelessly most of the time, IE and Google Chrome often freeze and a few minutes ago I
 got a blue screen - not for the first time - that shut down Windows.&nbsp; I didn't note the error message information other than that a fatal flaw occurred that necessitated Windows' shutting down, so am not certain whether the two problems are related or not.&nbsp;
 I attempted to find a compatible driver for what I assume is a WLAN mini-card for the original XP&nbsp;OS&nbsp;on the Vista compatibility site, but there were no drivers listed for the Dell Wireless 1395 WLAN MiniCard.</p>
<p>I have the Vista installation CD, but not the verification code necessary to reinstall it.&nbsp; Would it be listed somewhere on this computer under any of the program or system accessories (info about)&nbsp;available to administrators?</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity, there is a rectangular&nbsp;white USB device imprinted with the name "Biogear" attached to one of my ports, although it isn't listed among any of the devices on my computer and, since the laptop's original owner is deceased, I can't ask
 her what it's purpose is&nbsp;or what program it was meant to facilitate. I tried to remove it and it came apart (the casing detached from the portion inserted into the USB port) without affecting my ability to get online wirelessly.&nbsp;&nbsp;An internet search turned
 up a line of&nbsp;golf clothing and some articles in German...&nbsp;Any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks, Lara</p>

            If the original owner installed Vista over XP you must reformat and do a clean install of Vista or you will continually have multipling problems. If the original owner did a upgrade from XP to Vista this is OK. However the problems you are having suggest
 the original owner installed Vista over XP. The verification code&nbsp;(if found on the computer) will not be for Vista but for XP. As long as your operating system is installed you can retreive the Key with a Free Key finder software, do a search and you will
 find them on the internet. Also if you have the CD and you request a new Key from Microsoft you will get it for a very small fee, I do not know current fee, used to be $10.00 USD. Since you are not the original owner (and the original owner is deceased) both
 these options might not be totally legal, unless you can provide proof of purchase or the deseased person was a family member.

<h2>            Charged for subsription with auto renewal off&#47; disabled.</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying for the last few days to find someone to actually talk to about this problem to success. Any phone number I find just refers me to the stupid chat bot that does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way my problem is that I only ever use the Xbox Live redeemable cards and only have a credit card on my account because the service refuses to allow me to not have one since I original signed up for it. This has happened a few times where the auto
 renewal would be reset to an on state but I always caught it before it could charge me. I do not know why it resets and previous attempts to contact microsoft about it have resulted in nothing. My account is now essentially suspended and I refuse to pay $34
 charge that could not be at the fault of myself. I would be more understanding if as example I was to attempt to purchase a digital good without enough credits in me account and THAT charged me but this isn't remotely like that.</p>
<p>I am nearing the end of my rope trying to get this dealt with and becoming more irate the longer I attempt to deal with this.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 install probelm on Asus F7F laptop</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a strong intention to install Windows 10 32 bit on my Asus F7F laptop. MS also expects to replace WIndows 7s with 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 install conditions &nbsp;are adequate (2 GB RAM, 160 GB HDD, 2 piece 1.7 GHZ processor). So when I start the install I can see the blue window on the install screen and the progress circle then the install process shuts down without any error message,
 button and any interaction possibility. &nbsp;Is it expected to fresh the laptop BIOS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to overcame the situation? Thank you for your support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>KR,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Laszlo.</p>

            I had this same problem with a wireless mouse. Turns out I needed to move my USB plug closer to the mouse (it was on the front of my computer behind me). It may be that Windows 10 processes those signals differently, but it works now!<br />

<p>on the old brain going from iPhone to Windows PC with 3 different photo programs.&nbsp; I'm afraid after all these years</p>

<p>Thanks, Bill.&nbsp; I'll give it a shot when I get home this evening.&nbsp; Not being a total computer geek, it makes it hard</p>
<p>on the old brain going from iPhone to Windows PC with 3 different photo programs.&nbsp; I'm afraid after all these years</p>
<p>(1994) and various versions of Windows, it's time to bail from my Windows 7 (don't like 10!) and make the switch to
</p>
<p>an Apple product.&nbsp; I'm tired of all those I inquire about their Apples telling me about all the problems they DON'T have,

<p>Thanks again.&nbsp; Much appreciated.</p>

                    <p>Recently update Windows 10 and when the update was finished the HP Desktop machine entered a Power Save Mode on screen.&nbsp; It would not shut down, only unplugging power would shut it down.&nbsp; Will not start in Safe mode either.</p>

            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the HP computer?
<br />
<br />1b. Where or from whom did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1c. Was the computer sold to you as a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else computer or as a used (refurbished) computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. What, if any, third-party anti-virus application (i.e., not Windows Defender) might be installed?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.

            I recommend downgrading to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />You can downgrade to Windows 10 1703 by downloading the ISO at <a href="http://windowsiso.net/windows-10-iso/windows-10-creators-update-1703-download-build-15063/windows-10-creators-update-1703-iso-download-standard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsiso.net/windows-10-iso/windows-10...</a>

<br />
<br />Perform a clean install:

            1. Did you intentionally choose to install PC Matic?  Have you purchased PC Matic?

<br />
<br />2. Have you ever run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool and/or the Norton Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />Chances are (99.99%) your HP computer came with a McAfee (or possibly a Norton) free-trial preinstalled. Doesn't matter if you never used it.
