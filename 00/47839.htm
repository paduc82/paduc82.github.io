    <title>Surface RT unable to install apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> normanstock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface RT unable to install apps</h2>
                    <p>I have Surface RT and now find that 1) I cannot instal any apps from the store as "my internet connection is too slow" and 2) it has been unable to check for updates for over 30 days.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Internet connection is not slow - Surface is sat&nbsp;on top of the Wi-Fi router and I have fibre connection giving 75meg download 20meg upload.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some suggestions on the net include update 2808380 but can't see how to get other than Windows update - which isn't working. Catch 22.</p>

<p>Hi, I have the same problem although sometimes when the install starts, it just sits there saying 'pending'. What is going on, Microsoft ? I can't even get a response on MS Chat.

<p>hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand it, Microsoft no longer supports the Surface RT. I have two of them, one of which I did a reset to factory defaults on and now it won't update or install any apps. The other still works fine, but most apps are no longer supported. Installed
 ones will still work but that is about as far as it goes :-(</p>

                    I have all my music stored on a network share&nbsp; \\Server\Music.&nbsp; I have this share added to my Windows 10 Music Library.&nbsp; Groove music can see this music and play it just fine.&nbsp; But when I ask Cortana to play the music she just brings up&nbsp;a web search.&nbsp;
 When I ask Cortana to play music stored on my hard drive, it works just fine, jut not the shared network drive.&nbsp; I don't have enough room to put all my music on the local drive.&nbsp; Can anyone advise how to fix?

            Well, that pretty much stinks. &nbsp;I can't imagine the number of people that keep their music on another server and Cortana won't play the music? &nbsp;Come on Microsoft, this is amature hour, not being able to conect to shared network connections. It's a technology
 you designed and it's been around for years.

<p>I saw my friends saying "hey alexa play <em>songname</em>" and "hey google play
<em>songname</em>" and it worked and everyone loved it. How do you envision Microsoft staying competitive on the market? After a year this bug is still not fixed. What's worse, now you're trying to get me started paying for Groove: now I see the following message:</p>
Looks like you'll need a subscription to play Iron Tusk by Mastodon on Groove.

            This is one of the known issues I am seeing with the update as Recovery partition should be hidden and is accidently assigned a drive letter. 
<br />Right-click Start&gt;Command Prompt(admin) 
<br />Type in the following: 
<br />diskpart 
<br />list volume 
<br />select volume 3 
<br />Replace 3 with the number of the volume which is assigned a drive letter. (In hundreds of MBs)
<br />remove letter="G" 
<br />Replace G with the Recovery drive letter.
<br />
<br />Don't worry, removing a drive letter would not cause any harm to your device.

Hello,<br />
<br />
Windows Live Mail is not displaying HTLM emails from my university message center properly. I get a blank body and a .htm attachment instead. I have done a lot of testing, so bear with me here:<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is evident only in Windows Live Mail and Windows Mail. It shows up on my desktop, my laptop, and a virtual machine I created just for the purpose with no security software (email scanners!) installed. The messages display fine in Outlook and Thunderbird,
 and they display fine from the Hotmail web interface.<br />
<br />
Truly, it seems the problem is limited to emails coming from that one address: the University Message Center. I have added that address to my contact list and made sure it was not on my Block List to no avail. When I forward those emails to myself, they display
 fine.<br />
<br />
To answer the question before it is asked: No, "Read all messages as plain text" is not checked.
<br />
<br />
If anyone has any suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            This is probably a consequence of the HTML markup of the sent message. Messages composed in some newer Office applications (Word) seem to demonstrate this behaviour. It's not entirely clear why it happens, but the reason you can read the message normally
 in a <em>Reply</em> or <em>Forward</em> window is that WLMail inserts its own HTML tags that compensate for the ones omitted or misplaced by the composing application. There's nothing you can do about it as far as I know other than reverting to earlier versions
 of WLMail and/or Internet Explorer (which is used by WLMail to display HTML).<br />
<br />
Reading all messages in plain text would enable you to see the plain text part of the message if there is one. Most mail clients send both a text part and an HTML part for HTML messages.

            Hello Firedog,<br />
<br />
Thank you for the reply. A few questions:<br />
<br />
When I go to reply to or forward one of those messages with the blank bodies and .htm attachments, they remain blank,. When I forward one to another address from WLM, they appear in the other account as blank with htm attachments. If I forward them from the
 web interface, however, they show up properly.<br />
<br />
Also, viewing as HTML doesn't display any alternate text for these emails only. I do see the alternate text on non-University HTML emails however. Viewing as HTML appears to have absolutely no effect on these University emails.<br />
<br />
Finally, why do the messages display properly in WLM when I forward them to myself?<br />

            Sorry, I seem to have misread your original post; I had not taken on board that the messages are displayed as a blank body and an .htm attachment. That is what you would expect to see if
<em>Read all messages in plain text </em>were selected and the message contained no text/plain part. Does the message display if you press Alt-Shift-H? What do you see if you press Ctrl-F2? And if you double-click the attachment?<br />
<br />
&gt; <em>viewing as HTML doesn't display any alternate text for these emails only<br />
<br />
</em>Viewing as HTML shouldn't display alternate text for <em>any</em> messages. The alternate text is only there to be used in clients that either can't, or are configured not to, display HTML. To see whether the messages are multipart with both text/plain
 and text/html parts, you would have to examine the message source. In WLMail, select a message and press Ctrl-F3.
<br />
<br />
&gt; <em>why do the messages display properly in WLM when I forward them to myself?<br />
<br />
</em>If the reason for their not displaying is malformed (in WLMail's/IE's opinion) markup, then it may be that they display properly after being forwarded to yourself because WLMail has inserted the missing tags. I'm not sure which the vital ones are, but&nbsp;it
 may be one or other&nbsp;of &lt;!doctype&gt; and &lt;html&gt;. Try examining the message source of one of these messages as originally received and as received after being forwarded. You could also try dragging the .htm attachment into a blank IE window to see whether IE can
 display it. <br />
<br />
Are you fully up-to-date at Windows Update? In particular, do you have KB2647516 installed?<br />

            <span><i>&gt; Does the message display if you press Alt-Shift-H?&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
No, it does not. No (visible) difference.<br />
<br />
<i>&gt;&nbsp;</i><span><i>What do you see if you press Ctrl-F2?</i><br />
<br />
I get a text document with the contents as below:<br />

Yes.<br />

I have copied/pasted into a Word document, which I have uploaded here:&nbsp;https://rapidshare.com/files/2998413440/Ctrl-F3.docx<br />

            Hi <span>JKing09</span>,<br />
<br />
For investigation, please provide us with the following information.<br />
<br />
- Does the issue happen when other Windows Live Hotmail accounts are accessed on the same PC via Windows Live Mail?
<br />
- Does the issue happen when the account is accessed in another PC using a different Internet connection via Windows Live Mail?<br />
- Were there any changes that were&nbsp;done to your Windows Live Mail prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<p><span>Thanks,<br />

<span><i>- Does the issue happen when other Windows Live Hotmail accounts are accessed on the same PC via Windows Live Mail?&nbsp;<br />
</i></span><br />
Yes, and no. 99% of the HTML emails I receive show up fine. However, the University emails show up blank on every account they are sent to, be it either of the Gmail addresses I tried and the Hotmail address I tried.<br />
<br />
<span><i>- Does the issue happen when the account is accessed in another PC using a different Internet connection via Windows Live Mail?<br />
</i></span><br />
I have tried several different computers within my home network, all of which display the same problem. I haven't been able to try a Windows Live Mail installation on another network. My home router is configured pretty loosely, however; I don't have any content
 filtering set up or anything.<br />
<br />
<span><i>- Were there any changes that were&nbsp;done to your Windows Live Mail prior to the issue?<br />
</i></span><br />
None that I am aware of. I didn't see a single problem until I started getting emails from the University. Again, only the University emails exhibit this problem.

            Hi <span>JKing09</span>,<br />
<br />
Does the issue happen when you try to access your account thru web based email using a web browser? In the meantime, please try to reconfigure your account to Windows Live Mail and refer to this Solution Article for the steps:<br />

The emails always display correctly in the web-based interfaces. Whether I had the emails sent to my Gmail or Hotmail addresses, they always displayed correctly in the browser and incorrectly in Windows Live Mail.<br />
<br />
<span>I have confirmed my Hotmail and Gmail accounts are properly configured.</span>

            @Jonathan<br />
<br />
I've had a look at the message source you posted. The message has been composed in Word, but I couldn't&nbsp;immediately detect anything in the&nbsp;markup&nbsp;that would by its absence or presence cause WLMail/IE to fail to display it.<br />
<br />
When I saved the message as a text file with the extension .eml and tried to open it with WLMail, I saw what I suppose you also see - the header bar containing the subject, sender, date and addressee, along with an .htm attachment, and a blank body.&nbsp;The attachment
 opens normally in IE.<br />
<br />
The one thing that looks odd is the primary Content-Type (in the message header): multipart/htmlmessage is not as far as I can see a standard one (i.e. registered with IANA). A multipart message doesn't have to contain more than one part, but the type is usually
 used in the message header as multipart/alternative, comprising, say, a text/plain part for display by clients that can't handle HTML and a text/html part for those that can. To find out whether this could be the reason, I changed the Content-Type in the message
 header to multipart/alternative. The message opened normally.<br />
<br />
My conclusion is, then, that messages with this non-standard MIME type will not be displayed in the normal manner in WLMail.&nbsp;This should be configurable in the composing application. I would&nbsp;expect it to be possible to generate a multipart/alternative message
 with text/plain and text/html parts, or at least a text/html message in a single part. In any case, the 'fault' - if fault it is - lies with the sender.&nbsp;<br />

            Noel...I can't say how much I appreciate it. Through the process of elimination, I figured that either the sender was somehow being blocked by WLM, or else the message was composed with something incompatible with WLM. I had no way of testing either option
 further, but yet the question still remained, why would messages forwarded from the web interface display properly?<br />
<br />
<span>I will email the University help desk with a link to this thread, and see if they can tell me anything about how the emails are being composed. They told me that they were unable to find anyone else with the same problem, so I
 wonder if WLM just isn't used that much.<br />
<br />
If you can explain why they display fine in WLM if I forward them to myself, it will satisfy my curiosity. Otherwise, I'll be content in knowing where the problem is coming from, at least.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much!</span>

    <title>Windows Explorer crashes opening a folder in a folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Explorer crashes opening a folder in a folder</h2>
                    This problem has bugged me with Vista from Day One: I open a desktop folder to get to a set of folders inside it.&nbsp; I click on the folder I want, it opens, then the monitor goes pale as if it's locked up/not responding.&nbsp; Vista says it's checking for the
 problem then Explorer is restarting.&nbsp; This also will happen occasionally with folders I didn't create (like My Computer).<br />
<br />
NO applications are running.&nbsp; CPU usage is 98% System Idle Process (if I have task manager open first).&nbsp; I can stop everything in the background and it still happens.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming this is one of the issues corrected with Windows 7 but I'm not getting it free.&nbsp; I may as well buy a NEW laptop instead of installing Win 7 to a pristine but 3-year old machine, either losing every program I've installed (I know, "<em>only potentially</em>
 ") or needing to reinstall and update each of them, losing Windows programs no longer bundled (I lost Chess Titans to a Vista crash and can't get it back so what's dumped for Win 7?), etc.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I sound annoyed but I am.&nbsp; I won't say the 3-letter "M" word here but I'm about to consider it at home.

            I know this topic is old.. but here is how I fixed same problem you guys are having...
<div><br />
<div>I have my own website where I post my baseball card collection.. anyway I got me a new PC and I put all my files on a back up hard drive.. when I installed Vista on my new PC, I then moved my files back to my new PC.. well I was having trouble opening
 one of my folders same as above.. so I used filezilla, what I use to transfer folders and such to my website.. well filezilla let me open the folder and inside I seen where I had created a "God Mode" quick launch folder for windows and for some reason when
 I backed up my old PC this got placed in the folder with my personal stuff and this was causing my problem.. so I deleted it inside the filezilla app and it let me open my folder now and saved all my images and videos that I had saved inside this folder along
 with my website theme etc.. I guess maybe if you have this problem what I am saying is use a 3rd party app to see if you can view the files inside and maybe determine what is causing this folder not to open and if not to important maybe you can delete and
 see what happens! Good Luck.. just a thought, it did work for me but everyones situation may be different!</div>

<h3> vmaxdd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why it it so hard to find a replacement power cable for a Surface Pro 3&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I left the power cable for my Surface Pro 3 on a place.&nbsp; Since then, I have been to countless re-sellers and a 'flagship' store in Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Austria.&nbsp; I am still searching for a cable!&nbsp; Today, at the flagship store in Sydney...the
 assistant told me to 'just order one on-line'.&nbsp; She started to show my how easy that would be, until she got to the product and saw that it was out of stock.&nbsp; She didn't know what to do from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may be missing something but can it really be this hard to find a replacement power cable?&nbsp; I am constantly on the road and have had to buy the docking station to cart around with me every where I go.&nbsp; Crappy battery life hasn't helped this situation either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since buying this Surface Pro 3, I have had to have it replaced once (wouldn't turn back on) and now cannot find a power cable for it.&nbsp; Instead of running to buy the Surface Pro 4...I am now thinking of dawdling back to Apple.&nbsp; One of the reasons I left
 Apple in the first place was due to their stupid policy of changing connectors every five minutes but at least they had them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried to complain to Microsoft about this...but also like many others, just keep going around in circles on their 'support' pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate...I am not the most technically proficient so may very well be missing something.&nbsp; Is there a way to find a power cable??</p>

<div>the new power adapter for the Surface Book/Surface Pro might work. The listing</div>

<h2>            Surface Book with foreign keyboard layouts</h2>
                    I've just got a Surface Book and I'm happy about it, although I have one small problem.<br />
I'm Italian and the Surface Book is not on sale in Italy, so I've bought one in the UK. While setting up the system I've kept the OS in UK English and set the keyboard with the Italian layout, exactly as I did with my own built desktop and a Dell laptop.<br />
On the surface though I'm not able to type characters that need Alt Gr or Ctrl+Alt, like the @ or the #. If I try to type @ I get absolutely nothing, if I try to type # I get '<br />
All other keys work as intended for the Italian keyboard layout, so I don't really know what's wrong. Of course with the keyboard set to the UK layout I don't have any problems.

            Problem solved, I deleted UK English as primary language and set it to Italian instead, now the keyboard does all Italian keys.

            I saw that post, but the problem is that I have a Wired connection wich is pretty weird that the Bluetooth would interfere, but the second I connect the headphones to my PC my internet connection just dies. If it's only the bluetooth dongle everything
 works fine. I'm going to try connecting an xbox controller to see if it's a diferent story.<br />

            Hi,
<br />The error was BCC124 which indicates faulty hardware. I see the processor has some issue:
<br />BUSLG_GENERIC_ERR_*_TIMEOUT_ERR (Proc 0 Bank 4)
<br />A generic timeout error was observed in the Processor.

right click to format the device does not open the reformatting tool<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;but it opens if i format a different USB<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ive tried "HPUSBDisk-2.2.3" but it failed "there is no media in the specified device"</p>
<p>Disk management show: missing from volume list but it does show in disk list, 0MB allocated space, Status(online), Partition style (MBR)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the only actions allowed on this device was view properties and change drive letter path(changing this does not help)<br />
<br />
Im not sure what to try next to fix this USB but the data on the drive is unimportant<br />
any help would be great thanks<br />

            This is a Windows Vista forum - so I assume you are using WordPad or Notepad?&nbsp; Or is this an email you are putting together without attachments?<br />
<br />
Type less.&nbsp; Abbreviate more.&nbsp; Pick out the unnecessary parts.<br />
<br />
If you have a pure text only document given where you have posted and the assumptions that have to be made because of it - then those are your choices.<br />
<br />
If you have some version of some word processor installed (like Microsoft Office Word 2000, XP, 2003, 2007 or 2010) and that is what you are asking about - it will depend on the version of Word you have, etc - but the general advice above still holds true with
 the addition of "stay away from fancy formatting".<br />

</p><p><span>PROBLEM:</span></p>
<p><span>When I logged back into the Surface Pro this morning it would on give me access to my Surface Pro via my "Microsoft Account" and not my "Local Account". The local account no longer existed. If try to setup a "Local

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case I would suggest you to sign in with your Microsoft Account and then switch it to a local account instead. In this way, Microsoft Account credential will remain and you can use various other apps through those credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Login&nbsp;to Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>2. Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt;<strong> Your account</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Select <strong>Sign-in with a local account instead.</strong></p>
<p>4. Provide your current Microsoft Account Password.</p>
<p>5. Follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>6. You can leave the Enter Password option empty, however, it is highly recommended to keep a password on your system to keep it safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hello Jesinta</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to create a "Local Account". But what annoys me is that the"Microsoft Account" took over my "Local Account". I was wanting to change my "Local Account" back from the "Microsoft Account".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to create another Account using the "Microsoft Account" login having very minimal setup, but Microsoft never gave me the option. As I said it TOOK OVER my "Local Account". I did not even have to go into my account setting and say login in next
 time using my "Microsoft Account" it automatically took over with now warning or popup messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I sound annoyed I am as I am now losing trust with Microsoft as what will it change next on my account without me knowing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for passwords, Internet logins like Outlook.com have at least 25+ characters. My Local computers have around the 10+. Now I am having to type in the 25+ character password every time I want to log into my local computer. Yes, I am paranoid about security.
 This is why I do not like changes WITHOUT my consent.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Bluetooth audio not working after resuming from sleep</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm getting really mad with Windows 8 as the bluetooth support is full of bugs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Logitech Wireless Speaker Adapter (Bluetooth audio) connected to a Sony Vaio SA (Atheros 3012, I think). It was working fine on Windows 7, and it works absolutely perfectly on iPad, blackberry,... (name any other platform here).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But it doesn't work on Windows 8. When the PC wakes up from sleep, it can't play anything on it. The device is connected for sure (green light on the device and it appears in the control panel). But it's impossible to &nbsp;play any sound. The only solution
 is to restart. There is no error message, nothing. I tried all available drivers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've seen many people with similar issues on the forum. Apparently, bluetooth stack is broken on Windows 8, but is there any hope to have that very basic feature fixed? At least in Windows 8.1?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ben</div>

            Hi, Rohit.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for the party line on troubleshooting Windows issues but I'm sure you've already noticed any problem worth posting about is one the troubleshooter can't solve. &nbsp;The only power option that makes the bluetooth audio problem go away involves disabling
 both sleep and hibernation and his drivers were working just fine before the machine decided to try to wake up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem is really easy to demonstrate. &nbsp;Try this:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Find a Windows 8 laptop.</li><li>Connect it to a bluetooth "stereo" speaker.</li><li>Set that as the default audio device.</li><li>Open something commonly used to play sound.<br />
(I suggest using Chrome to play a music video from YouTube.)</li><li>Shut the computer's lid.<br />
(The audio stutters. The bluetooth device signals disconnection. The PC shuts off.)</li><li>Open the computer's lid.<br />
(The windows reappear. The bluetooth device signals reconnection. The music won't play.)</li><li>Now you're in the state Ben posted about.</li></ul>
<div>Try your tools then. &nbsp;You'll find the Control Panel / Sound / Manage audio devices panel can start but not stop its test of each audio device and that no sound is heard. &nbsp;You'll find apps going unresponsive if they try to play sounds. &nbsp;The service manager
 can't finish stopping the audio services in an attempt to restart them. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The mixer icon in the systray may say no audio devices are installed but the device manager says they're just fine and working properly. &nbsp;They can be removed and reinstalled and the problem persists. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's nice that MS finally included support of the more commonly used bluetooth profiles but that support is, as stated above, too buggy to use.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks in advance for looking into this again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Duncan.</div>

            <p>Hi Duncan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important</b>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these
 steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps. If you aren't logged in as an administrator, you can
 only change settings that apply to your user account:</p>
<p>a. Press <b>Windows key + R</b> and then type “<b>regedit</b>” without quotes and press
<b>ENTER</b>.</p>
<p>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>b. Locate and click the key or sub key that you want to back up.</p>
<p>c. Click the <b>File</b> menu, and then click <b>
Export</b>.</p>
<p>d. In the <b>Save</b> <b>in</b> box, select the location where you want to save the backup copy to, and then type a name for the backup file in the File name box.</p>
<p>e. Click <b>Save</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press <b>Windows key + R</b> on the keyboard.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type "<b>regedit</b>" without quotes and press <b>
Enter</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Now open the following path: <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tosrfusb\Parameters</b></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Double-click on the: "<b>EnableSystemWakeup</b>" entry and set the value to "<b>0</b>".</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Reboot and test the issue.</p>

<p>Asus running 8.1, my old Asus running windows 7 the Logitech Bluetooth adapter worked perfectly. It still works perfectly with all my other devices, but not with Windows 8.1. Like everybody else I removed and reinstalled the driver, to no avail.</p>

<p>I had this problem (win7), and seemed to have solved it. I noticed that if I was playing music when I put the system to sleep, it continued playing fine after it woke up. (This is using a bluetooth "speaker" that connects to my stereo system. The problem
 I had was that after a sleep/wakeup, the audio would be garbled.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote a small .bat script to keep the system continuously playing a silent .wav file in the background, and launch this at boot. (There are many ways to accomplish this; my solution used a powershell command I found googling, as well as a handy .wav file
 with 5min of silence that some fellow had shared for another purpose) -- </p>
<p>
</p><p>:loop<br />
<br />
powershell -c (New-Object Media.SoundPlayer "c:\path...\5minsilence.wav").PlaySync();<br />
<br />
goto loop</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>

            I have had the same issue for a week now. been trying to get into contact with customer support but everytime I schedule a call back, they just hang up on me when they call me back. It would be great to get some help with this situation instead of having
 someone who cant understand English and knows less about computers then I do call me just to hang up on me 3 minutes later. And to top it off they don't even call me back. so I end up waiting 2-3 hours to talk to someone and its all for not.

            <p>Hi Rosa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you trying to reinstall or&nbsp;repair&nbsp;Windows 7?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried all the troubleshooting from the Advanced Boot Options?</p>
<p>3. What is the make and model of the PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the computer is on an endless loop, please try to get into Advanced Boot Options and disable automatic restart. This will help in showing up the error on the screen.</p>
<p>Refer to the article.<br />
<strong>Advanced startup options </strong>(Disable automatic restart on system failure).<strong><br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode#1TC=windows-7</a><br />
(You can also try to use the 'Repair your Computer' and Safe Mode options and check if it helps).</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Please provide us more information on the issue you are facing to help you better.</p>
