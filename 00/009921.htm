<h2>            Transferring Office 365 Subscription License</h2>
                    <p>We have recently started using our own Microsoft Admin portal that is tied into our on premise Active Directory. We had purchased a few stand alone Office 365 licenses before we started using the Admin Portal. Is there a way to transfer those stand alone
 Office 365 licenses into our portal for re-assignment to our users so we can manage them along with the rest of our licenses within the Admin Portal?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternately, if the above is not supported, could we simply cancel the current subscriptions and then re-purchase those through the portal?</p>

            <p>Hi KFLKel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Office 365 doesn’t support transfer licenses among different Office 365 tenants. You just need to cancel those subscriptions and purchase corresponding licenses in one Office 365 tenant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Toby</p>

    <title>Bug&#58; email attachments with same filename - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim_mackey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug&#58; email attachments with same filename</h2>
                    hi, i'm using a nokia lumia 800, windows phone 7.8.
<div>If i get an email with several file attachments all with the same name, e.g. "image.jpg" the mail client gets confused and thinks they are all the same file. &nbsp;I can download all the attachments, but when i open them, the first photo is displayed each time.
 &nbsp;this bug is very easy to reproduce, just send an email with 5 different photos attached with the same filename and try to open them up from the phone. &nbsp;you should see that the phone is unable to differentiate between the photos. &nbsp;i have observed the same
 behaviour via Windows Live Mail and Gmail. &nbsp;I can confirm that the phone email client displays the correct file size for each of the attachments, however once they are downloaded, the next time you open the email, the file size is identical for all 5 attachments,
 which seems to confirm that the phone has replicated the first attachment rather than saved each one correctly.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hello Tim_Mackey:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum with your experience when sending multiple attachments with identical names.&nbsp; I have done a bit of testing and did get some contradictory results.&nbsp; Please let us know if you went about this differently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went on to my PC and found&nbsp;five pictures in differing folders and named them both Picture1.jpg.&nbsp; I then signed into my hotmail account and composed an email with both of the photos attached.&nbsp; Upon the attaching of the photos, one was renamed to Picture1.jpg(2),
 Picture1.jpg(3)...&nbsp; The name of the save file remained the same but the client would not even allow me to send these files with an identical name.&nbsp; I sent this email to the account on my phone, also a hotmail account.&nbsp; When I received the email with attachments,
 they appeared as Picture1.jpg, Picture1.jpg(2)...&nbsp; Upon opening the photos,&nbsp;the proper pictures were downloaded and I had no issue seeing each individual picture as sent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I created a test Gmail account and composed and email, attaching the same two pictures.&nbsp; Gmail did not rename the files in anyway.&nbsp; Both showed up with given name.&nbsp; I then sent this to the same Hotmail account that is running my phone.&nbsp; When I opened
 the email, I noticed that both attachments still had the same names I gave them, Picture1.jpg.&nbsp; I then opened the attachments one at a time.&nbsp; The individual photos opened and displayed as they were sent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional things I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&nbsp;downloaded each photo and then viewed it as well as downloading both photos and then viewing them.&nbsp; In both cases, I got the same result.</li><li>I sent the same email with attached photos to&nbsp;secondary emails on my phone, an @outlook.com &amp; Gmail&nbsp;and received the same result.</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you performed different steps.&nbsp; If you do not mind, try to confirm that the above process works out the same for you as it did for me.&nbsp; If you have not already done so, try adding multiple email clients to the phone and verifying that
 this is not a specific issue with the client that is receiving the email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing back from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Mark,
<div>thanks for the detailed reply, sorry it took a week to get back to you.</div>
<div>i tried your steps sending from gmail and hotmail and observed the same behaviour you reported. &nbsp;however when i send from outlook (2010) i can reproduce the incorrect behaviour i reported originally. &nbsp;this issue was originally brought to my attention from
 photos sent from an iphone, so it seems to depend on how the sending email client packages up the attachments. i am hoping that windows phone can be updated to handle all scenarios where this problem might arise. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>i would be happy to send you one of the emails that reproduces the behaviour on Windows Phone 7, maybe you could send me a PM with an email address i can forward to? &nbsp;alternatively, i have also been able to confirm that if i receive the Gmail email (attachments
 with same name) in outlook and forward it on again to the windows phone, the incorrect behaviour is observed. &nbsp; i expect it will never be an issue from hotmail/live accounts because that service ensures unique attachment filenames.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>best regards</div>

            <p>Hello Tim:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying and clarifying.&nbsp; Based on the new information this does seem to be related to the way that Outlook packages the photos and names the pictures.&nbsp; As we have seen that the phone can differentiate&nbsp;photos with identical names, the Gmail
 example, it is unlikely this is something on the phones end.&nbsp; I am not sure that this is something that can or will be corrected on the Windows 7 phone.&nbsp; It very well may need to be addressed on the Outlook end of things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From here I would suggest the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the following user forum and make a suggestion that this be addressed in a future update or product,
<a href="http://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions</a>.</li><li>Contact Office support to see if there are any settings within Outlook that can be adjusted to prevent the photo file confusion,
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010</a>.</li></ol>
<p>In the meantime, I guess we suggest trying to give the photo's unique names or using another mail service to send these types of emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>

            hi Mark, unfortunately it's not an outlook bug or behaviour, as i have confirmed it happens when the email is sent from at least one other mail client (iphone). &nbsp; in contrast, to emphasise that it is a windows phone 7 issue, every other email client i
 have tried is able to correctly open the attachments in the offending email, therefore it is not a 'problem' with outlook as such, or even the email itself. &nbsp;i'm sure outlook is not breaking any RFC email standards in the way it packages up the email.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>as with 99% of users, i have no control over the sending email client, i just receive the email and expect that my own email client can handle it. &nbsp;in this case it's disappointing that WP7 can't. &nbsp;i note that WP7 correctly displays the file size of each
 attachment (i.e. different) but is unable to differentiate them when opened. &nbsp;i can't say any clearer that this has to be a bug win WP7.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>i will follow up with the windows phone support link.&nbsp;</div>
<div>i appreciate your assistance.</div>

                    <p>I've been using the web-based Outlook for a long time with no complaints. In the last month, however, I've noticed that it takes about a minute for a new message to leave the Draft folder and go to the Sent folder. At the same time a gray box appears at
 the bottom of the page telling me that it is "Sending".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try and compose a new message in this time interval, it will often clobber the first. So I just have to sit there and wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting old emails also seems slower.</p>
<p>

            HI Arnie,

Clear browser Cache and Cookies on your browser and Restart computer.&nbsp;
You can try the following procedures below:&nbsp;
The first step to troubleshooting is to clear the browser cache/cookies:&nbsp;

If using Internet Explorer -  Hold the  CTRL+SHIFT keys down and press DELETE on the window that opens leave defaults checked and Press  Delete&nbsp;

Google Chrome -  Hold the  CTRL+SHIFT keys down and press DELETE on the window that opens leave defaults checked and Press Clear Browsing Data&nbsp;

For Firefox- Hold the  CTRL+SHIFT keys down and press DELETE on the window that opens leave defaults checked and Press Clear Now&nbsp;

Now restart your computer using the Restart option.
Once your back up open your browser and Log into&nbsp;https://outlook.live.com/&nbsp;;

If that doesn't work open outlook in a private browser as it could be an adblock or antivirus causing problems with sending or deleting emails.

            Hi Arnie,
<br />
<br />We are only Moderators on this site we are not employees of Microsoft. 
<br />It is a web based application if issues are occurring then it could be caused by your browser add ons, your antivirus program, and or your internet settings besides the outlook.com services being slow. You can check outlook.com status below
<br /><a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a>
<br />If the suggested information above does not help resolve the problem I would reach out to outlook.com support. 
<br />To contact them, please log in to Outlook.com then click on the ? icon at the top right side of the screen. Click on Help, This  will open an area where you can type in your concern and then send it.
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

            Hi Arnie,
<br />
<br />I would absolutely love to resolve your problem but if the issue is on the backend server then I cannot do anything to support you I am very sorry. 
<br />If your computer and internet is running slow clean it by doing a disk clean Temp files can slow down any windows process.

<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>
<br />Reboot your router - see your ISP documentation for how to do a reboot. 
<br />If that does not help again reach out to outlook support as I do not have a way to access your back end database whereas they would.

            <p>Completely removing Office and reinstalling does work, but seems to be a rather heavy handed way of fixing it given that it has to be a manual process involving several locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if simply de-activating and revoking Keychain entries would have worked too.</p>

    <title>Boot loop, can&#39;t log in. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lakeguy55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Boot loop, can&#39;t log in.</h2>
                    <p>&lt;p&gt;I am (or was) running the latest Insider Pre-release. As of this morning, I cannot log in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>Windows appears to boot to wallpaper screen for login. Icon in lower right shows network connecting, but trying to login or doing nothing, results in another reboot. It appears Windows is crashing somewhere between prompting the user to login and full operation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying an auto repair results in an error that auto repair couldn't complete. See file System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt. Log file show's a series of successful tests, ending with, "The operating system version is incompatible with Startup repair "</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting a system restore from point before prerelease upgrade (on 4/4), results in error stating restore could not access a file (doesn’t say which one) and I should disable my anti-virus and retry. Unspecified error 0x80070005. I'm only running Defender,
 and can't get to it anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying sfc /scannow at command prompt results in "Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't figured out how I can get to safe mode.</p>
<p>

            <p>Do you have install media for your version? If you are running build 16170, you might be able to create install media using a utility that has been developed and then use DISM to fix the corrupted component store. You would need to point to the files that
 were processed by Windows Update to do the upgrade, which will now be in a subfolder under Windows.old. I put a link to the conversion script below. You might need to join the site to get to the link.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you can get briefly to the login screen, you could also use SHIFT-Restart to get a boot menu, which includes
<strong>Go back to the previous version</strong>. You could go back to the public release (build 15063) and ensure that it is without any corruption with
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>. If sfc can't fix any issues that it finds, you could use DISM.</p>

            <p>There is a separate "Go back to the previous version" that you can access from the blue boot menu. Use SHIFT-Restart to get to that menu, or you can also try powering on and as soon as you see the computer logo with swirling dots, hold the power button in
 for at least 5 seconds to force power off. Do this 2 or 3 times and the next boot will open the Repair menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than choosing a restore point, see if one of the sub-menus has "Go back to previous version".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system still can get to Safe Mode, there are various ways to fix it, but going back to build 15063 using the boot menu might be the simplest. You could also try Safe Mode with Networking and see if it works.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If for some reason you can't go back to 15063, you might still be able to create install media for build 16170 to repair it, by using the utility from My Digital Life forums to recombine the files that were used for your upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have disk space, another option is to install a clean copy of Windows 10 build 15063 alongside your existing Windows. You might then be able to use that copy of Windows to repair the current one that has issues.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Since you no longer have the option to <strong>go back to the previous version</strong>, kindly verify if you've already performed a
<strong>clean install of Windows 10</strong>.<br />
<br />
We're looking forward to your response.

            Hi
<br />
<br />It's hard to tell from what you've copied alone. Rather than following the link, you could type onedrive.com in your browser and then log in to your account.
<br />
<br />Also, if you hover over the link in the email, in the bottom left corner of the browser you should see the address it will try to take you to. If it's different than the URL seen in the email, then it's 100% a phishing attempt.

            <p><span>Hi JAFMR,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We understand that you don’t want to receive any messages from a person/contact, and you’ve already entered that contact to
 blocked senders list, and you keep receiving a message. So, we have provided you steps on how you can create a rule for incoming messages. Please be guided by the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Sign in on your account.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select
<b>Hotmail</b> located on the upper pane of the page. Then, you can see <b>
Options </b>on the upper right corner, select it and go for <b>More Options.</b></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under
<b>Customizing Hotmail</b>, select <b>Rules for sorting new messages</b>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now you can set up rules to automatically handle messages as they come in. But in your case, select the
<b>New</b> button.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Then, you can now create a rule in organizing your incoming email.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Once you have entered the appropriate rule you wish to, click on
<b>Save</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            You can download an ISO of Windows 10 from the Windows 10 media creation tool site just make sure you download the same version that you had on your system Home or Pro 32 bit or 64 Bit, you can install it and when it asks for the key you can just skip
 it as you had a previous version of Windows 10 on your system, when it goes on line it will look on the activation servers and match your systems ID and it will activate, here is the link for the ISO &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10/</strong></a>

    <title>Excel 2013 print preview does not match what is in the Excel document. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve&#64;m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 print preview does not match what is in the Excel document. Is there a fix.</h2>
                    <p>I have a user that created an Office 365 Business/Excel spreadsheet. The user inserted shapes specifically "lines" between two object. On the spreadsheet it looks great, but when a print preview is selected the shape "Line" is not in the exact spot between
 the two objects. Its off just enough that the "line" is not between the two objects and is now on top of one of the objects. The print job looks like the print preview that is incorrect. I tried printing to several different model printers and changed print
 drivers, but I get the same result. I also ran a repair of Office 365 that did not correct the issue. Would anyone have any ideas or suggestions?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks<br />

<h2>            Trojan&#58;Win32&#47;Powerssere.Alreg cannot be removed by Microsoft Essentials</h2>
                    <p>For the last week or so, I have repeatedly used Microsoft Essentials to scan my system (both quick and full scans) and the program has repeatedly reported that my system has the following malware installed, Trojan:Win32/Powessere.Alreg, and highly recommends
 that the it be removed by Microsoft Essentials. I let it perform this action, the program shows that the removal was successful. However, when I reboot or start up the computer the next day, and I do an anti-virus scan, this same malware is reported to be
 on my computer. Obviously, Microsoft Essentials is not removing the file, or it is getting reinstalled every time I reboot the computer. I have attempted to find a Startup program that might be doing this, to no avail. As far as I can see, no new Startup programs
 have been installed. Also, I have scanned the computer with other anti-malware programs, and none of them have so far picked up and reported this specific malware file. My question is, why does Microsoft Essentials repeatedly show that the file has been removed,
 only to have it immediately show up again? Any help is appreciated</p>

    <title>How to calculate percentage in a column with multiple rows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hughcc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to calculate percentage in a column with multiple rows</h2>
                    <p>With Excel 2007, I’m trying to create a 10-row spreadsheet that in Column A shows a representative’s sales figures. Column B is to show what percentage each salespersons’ sales is of total sales. For example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Column A Sales&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B %</p>
<p>1. $100&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>
</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =A1/A4</p>
<p>2. $300<span>
</span>=A2/A4</p>
<p>3. $200<span>
</span>=A3/A4</p>
<p>4. SUMl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100%</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This works fine but when I copy the formula and paste it into Column B’s row 2 and 3, the formula created is =A2/A5 and =A3/A6 and I get an error since A5 and A6 aren’t populated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I set up a formula that can be copied and maintain the cell containing the Total dollars?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your help will be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

            Relative and Absolute Cell References<br />
<br />
A relative reference means that the row or column reference is relative to the referencing cell and, when the formula is copied to other cells, the relative cell references are shifted such that the distance or offset between the referencing cell and the referenced
 cell remains the same. An absolute cell reference means that the row or column reference is fixed and does not change when the formula is copied to other cells.<br />
<br />
With the A1 reference style a dollar sign is used to create an absolute reference. For example, the cell reference A$1, when copied to other cells, will always reference row 1 but the column may change if copied to another column. The cell reference $A$1 will
 allays reference cell A1 regardless of where it is copied.<br />
<br />
Whether a row or column is an absolute or relative reference makes no difference in how the formula is calculated or the result it produces. They only have different effects when formulas are copied to other cells. For this reason, the decision as to whether
 cell references are absolute or relative should be made with regard to whether or not the formula will be copied to other cells. While entering each cell reference in a formula, consider how the referenced cell should be treated as the formula is copied to
 other rows and columns. If the referenced cell's row should be the same then make the row an absolute reference by placing a dollar sign in front of the row number. If the column should be the same then place a dollar sign in front of the column letter.<br />
<br />
Note that relative references are not shifted when a formula is moved by either cutting and pasting or by dragging. Relative cell references are only adjusted when cells are copied.<br />
<br />
Formulas can also be copied and pasted one at a time without changing the cell references by editing the cell and copying the formula in the formula bar, editing the destination cell and pasting the formula text into the formula bar.<br />

<p>
</p><p>My Hotmail keeps filling up. I use it for business so I missing important emails when it refuses to take emails. The posts are unclear as to solutions. How much space do I have on Hotmail? How can I check? Can I buy more? Can I buy unlimited? It says size
 automatically increases...yet it takes days and increases by small amounts so it fills up again in short period of time. Do I need to give up Hotmail? PLease be specific and answer all questions. I notice when you guys answer you are not really responsive.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I buy ad free Outlook, how much more additional space will be added to my Hotmail?
</p>
<p>Can I request a large increase in space?</p>
<p>Can I dump all my emails easily to my computer and access them later through Outlook?</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I saw someone complaining that they bought One Drive extra space and saw an answer from Microsoft &nbsp;that One Drive and Hotmail did not share space. I do not know what is true. Also, you say click to see...where would I click to see that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, sorry, don't mean to second guess here...but if I get Office 365 that will increase my Hotmail storage space to 200GB? Can someone at Microsoft confirm this...I cant buy and then return if its not true....Thanks guys.</p>

 Hotmail? Will ad-free increase that storage space? Why is the inbox not automatically growing as promised? Will Office 365 solve this specific issue? Feel like Im being blackmailed. What will it take to end this madness...lol. Thanks for help.

    <title>Excel for Mac changing Date Created when updating file via SMB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unclewainey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel for Mac changing Date Created when updating file via SMB</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody, have any of you seen an issue where Excel changes the Date Created of a file to the current date and time when saving changes to a file server connected via SMB?<br />
<br />
So far I've confirmed the issue is happens with:<br />
<br />
Excel 2016 15.39 and Excel 2011 14.7.7<br />
Connected via SMB3 and SMB1<br />
Mac server (10.12.6) and Synology NAS (DSM 6.1.3-15152 Update 8)<br />
Computers saving the file running 10.11.6 and 10.12.6<br />
<br />
Issue is not present (Date Created does not change) when using:<br />
Word or PowerPoint<br />
Connected via AFP<br />
<br />
Also, the Created date under File -&gt; Properties… -&gt; Statistics stays correct. (I'm guessing that's a separate entry within the file rather than in the metadata.)</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Assigning Tempvar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidmcewen_canada  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assigning Tempvar</h2>
                    <p>I wish to assign a Table's Record ID to Tempvar to use it in other parts of my application.</p>
<p>Using the SetTempVar&nbsp; macro, I tried assigning the tbl_Tablename.ID&nbsp; to the variable name, but Access 2010 will not accept it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SetTempVar will accept static data (e.g. a number), but I can't seem to get it to accept the record ID from the table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am surely not the first to stumble onto this, but can't seem to find the appropriate help anywhere I've looked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone point me to an article or example?</p>

<p>Hi Tom. Thanks for your swift reply. Your response makes perfect sense - the ID in the table is numeric - Auto-assigned as advised by Access. I tried to assign TempVar using the macro SetTempVar using the table name in the expression after I used another
 macro to get to the last record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like this SetTempVar </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{Name}&nbsp; LastrcdID </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{Expression}&nbsp; =[tbl_Mytable]![ID]</p>
<p>
</p><p>The response when I step through is that it doesn't recognize MyTable in the expression. It doesn't make sense to me either. If I assign a number in the expression, it accepts it, as you suggested it should.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the simplicity of your suggestion, assigning it in VBA, but I have shied away from getting into VBA since Macros have served me very well so far. Guess it's time for me to roll up the sleeves!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Deleting saved passwords</h2>
                    I wanted to know how I would be able to delete saved passwords that were saved on my internet explorer.&nbsp;Would I be able to view the login usernames along with their passwords, so I won't be deleting them all? I wanted to be able to pick and choose.

            I assume that you mean the stored usernames and passwords to log on to different web sites.&nbsp; There is no built in way to selectively delete them.&nbsp; In Internet Options, Content tab, AutoComplete Settings button, there is an option to delete the Autocomplete
 history; but it will delete all of it.<br />
<br />
One thought I had to selectively change passwords is to visit the site for the password that you want to remove and intentionally enter a wrong password for that username.&nbsp; IE will tell you that it's different than the stored password and ask if you want to
 replace it with the new [wrong] one - choose 'yes'.&nbsp; Then, you've stored the wrong password.&nbsp; Alternatively, most sites allow you to change your own password.&nbsp; You could log in and change the password, then the old stored one will also be wrong.

            Hi J_whit,<br />
<br />
as my colleague MVP Steve said, Internet Explorer hasn't a built-in feature to view/delete the autocomplete passwords.<br />
You can use <strong>IE PassView</strong>: <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/internet_explorer_password.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/internet_explorer_password.html</span></a><br />
View and delete any stored data for particular sites.<br />
<br />
<strong>Using IE PassView</strong><br />
IE PassView doesn't require any installation process or additional DLLs. In order to start using it, just copy the executable file (iepv.exe) to any folder like, and run it "As Administrator" (right click the .exe file -&gt; "Run As Administrator").
<br />
After running iepv.exe, IE PassView scans all Internet Explorer passwords in your system, and display them on the main window.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,&nbsp;

<h3> kcombswa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2010 Import Wizard Default to Documents Folder instead of folder assigned in Access General Options</h2>
                    <p>Is there a fix for this? I saw a previous post, but based on the answers, this problems looks like a bug to me. I checked and rechecked to make sure that the path I want to use is set in the "Default Database Folder" in "Creating Databases". Is there another
 way to do this - other than having to write code to do it.</p>

<p>AFAIK there is no documented way to change the behavior of the Import Wizard on this point, unless you write code, using a File/Open dialog and DoCmd.TransferDatabase or one of its cousins.</p>
