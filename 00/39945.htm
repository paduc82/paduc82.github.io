    <title>internet browsers not working on my Windows 10 PC - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            internet browsers not working on my Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 over a year ago with relatively few problems. &nbsp;But in the past two weeks I've been having trouble with my preferred browser, Chrome, not connecting to sites. &nbsp;This happened at first occasionally when I tried to link to another page.
 &nbsp;The spinning icon would just spin, not even returning an "unable to connect" error page; I have to use Task Manager to stop Chrome and restart it again. &nbsp;In the last two days it has gotten much worse. &nbsp;Today it's impossible (I'm sending this from another
 computer). &nbsp;I'm having the same problem with both Chrome and Edge. &nbsp; &nbsp;Now after I use Task Manager to stop the browser, I can't restart it without completely restarting the computer; and even if I've only used one browser (Edge or Chrome) the other browser
 won't start after the first one crashes.&nbsp; After a reboot, the browser may or may not open, but if it opens I only get a few links before it crashes again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now &nbsp;Task Manager won't even close the application - I have to use a computer restart. &nbsp;Other applications come up fine - but I just opened File Manager, and when I clicked on Help it reached to the internet and crashed again, and I was unable to close the
 File Manager window even with Task Manager; yet other noninternet applications continued to work.</p>
<p>I get my internet from a wireless router, &nbsp;which is working fine on another computer 6 feet away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My computer is a Lenovo all in one, AMD E450, 4GB RAM. &nbsp;My computer gets automatic Windows updates. &nbsp;I haven't installed anything new lately, except possibly some software associated with a recent webinar I viewed.</p>
<p>How can &nbsp;I get this fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's some more info. &nbsp;I just rebooted in Safe Mode with Networking, and my Chrome worked fine (Edge, for some reason, is not available from the "Built-In Administrator").</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response, but I'm still having the same problem with my browsers crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the System File Checker and found no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think DISM is available on my software.<br />
</p>
<p>The Clean boot appeared to solve the problem (after an hour the browser still hadn't crashed), so I started to turn off various combinations of start-up applications to see which were on when the browser crashed. &nbsp;Unfortunately I've realized that how soon
 the browser crashes is not consistent - it doesn't crash the first time I link from it, but it always crashes eventually between 5 minutes and 2-3 hours. &nbsp;Since after the browser crashes I can still use other functions on the computer, I've been using those
 opportunities to try different combinations of start-up applications before restarting the computer to reset the browser. &nbsp;Ultimately I realized that under every combination my browser still crashes eventually, and when I retried the clean boot the browser
 crashed anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem doesn't seem to be one of the start-up applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the years on various computers I've had browsers hang, and I'm used to closing them out and restarting them and they work fine. &nbsp;This problem is different - when it hangs, I can't close it without using Task Manager, and once I've closed the browser
 application I can't start it up again until I reboot. &nbsp;Again, this happens with both Chrome and MS Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any new suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the issue is happening to both Firefox and Microsoft Edge, we would like to recommend that you try to reinstall Firefox on your computer, please be advise that reinstalling Firefox will delete all the browsing history and data. For the Microsoft Edge,
 we would recommend that you perform a repair upgrade using a Windows 10 ISO file. For more information about repair upgrade, you can check the article below:</p>

 10 ISO file</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>Firefox is still working, though it sometimes shuts down my computer - so far, only when I haven't been at the computer.&nbsp; Earlier today I opened Chrome instead of Firefox, and Chrome crashed within an hour in the same annoying fashion I'm trying to fix -
 and after I shut it down using Task Manager, I couldn't open Firefox until I rebooted the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'll try reinstalling Chrome and use your suggested repair upgrade on Edge and see if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll report back.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem first raised with Google Chrome then with Microsoft Edge with tabs locking up saying "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">unable to respond/ connect" and then having to use Task Manager to close the applications.
 It has become progressively worse. I can carry on using applications like Word, Notepad but not the browsers unless I wait 10 minutes or so or have to Restart the computer. Sometimes I can carry on using Spotify or Windows Media Player (as if I am still online)
 but mostly they do not respond saying can't find internet connection..</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The BT Hub 4 I'm using has a constant BLUE light indicating all is fine. I did a few speed checks and all seemed OK. Have changed the filters too.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I asked BT to test the line and they said there was a fault with the broadband even though the Hub was connected. If the fault was on my property an expensive bill would be added so I declined to try
 and monitor the situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My broadband results today are
</span>38MB Mb/s download / 4.6mb/s upload so I cannot see there is a fault and the phone line is working OK.</p>

            <p>Right click the Task Bar, select Task Manager, on Startup tab disable anything other than your anti-virus which for best performance should be free lightweight built-in Defender.&nbsp; All others are freeloaders on system resources and have no need to start with
 Windows unless you yourself decide you need them to do so.&nbsp; You can google any you're unsure of to know what they do for sure.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Hotkey Listener would depend on this to be running if it is indeed what is interfering.&nbsp; However it may be needed by a motion controller, so test it.</p>

                    whenever I'm doing anythingf on my computer and stop mousing or using the keyboard, the computer goes into sleep mode, like every 2-5 minutes at most. I've been to the area where you set sleep times and set never etc, but still does it.

<p><br />
I just (Aug. 2013) got a new Microcenter build with Win7 Pro 64 bit and an Intel I7 processor.&nbsp; I installed Lotus Smart Suite&nbsp;9.8 (so I can run Freelance and Notes) and immediately lost my internet connection, i.e., neither IE or Firefox (both latest versions)
 could connect thru my DSL modem, while others on my network could.&nbsp; Nor could I ping ('run Ping' ...).&nbsp; Given that there are comments on these boards that Autorun may not work and that running 'setup.exe' might, I'm worried that I can't safely try either.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
 problem&nbsp;was bad enough that the MC staff reloaded drivers and now I cannot even login (I think the keyboard wireless&nbsp;may have been killed.). MC is&nbsp;now re-installing the OS as they don't know anything else to do.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; Could I safely install XP mode? so I can retreive my emails and presentations without killing the entire machine again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Unless you can persuade Hammacher Schlemmer to write 64 bit drivers for you, it's not going to work.&nbsp; I doubt they will, it's a discontinued product.&nbsp; IF you can find Vista 64 bit drivers, they will work, but I don't see anything on their website.&nbsp; You might
 want to drop them an email or call Customer Support.&nbsp; The page specifically says compatible only with 32 bit operating systems, so I guess it's time you either use XP Mode, install a 32 bit version of Windows 7 or get newer hardware:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hammacher.com/publish/74597.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hammacher.com/publish/74597.asp</a></p>

            <p>Okay, last night I had a nice support chat with an MS rep who had me download "Media Creator" and use that to reinstall Windows 10. This morning, casting to my smart TV&nbsp;worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I had to leave the house, and while I was gone a Windows Update ran. And, you all guessed it, attempting to "Cast to Device," the cast window opens and "Connecting to Network Device" cycles endlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried updating the display driver using the formula above. As soon as I clicked "<strong>Uninstall</strong>," the screen went black and stayed that way. After several minutes, I power-cycled the computer, and all was well when it restarted -- except that
 casting didn't work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked Windows Media Player, and it had again shut off streaming, so I turned it back on, restarted the computer, checked WMP to see that streaming was still enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Casting to my Smart TV still does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas, suggestions, helpful comments?</p>

<p>The updates for Windows 10 you have installed is the 2nd part of the Windows major update and also know as Redstone 2.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the troubleshooting steps didn't resolve the issue, we suggest contacting the Smart TV manufacturer to install the most updated driver.
</p>
<p>

            Same problem for me. No dependancy of driver of TV. It is only a major bug due to the recent update. As usual Microsoft shows all its lack of professionalism and precision. But you are able to run regression tests when you made software changes...I am
 discouraged from this attitude and to give the fault to somebody else. The problem is due only to Windows update, please try to demonstrate to be competent and solve it...

            <p>I got an automated e-mail from Microsoft asking if this issue had somehow magically resolved itself yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It hasn't. Everything I've written above still holds true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is Microsoft's responsibility to investigate what Redstone 2 broke in media casting, create a fix for that damage that Microsoft caused, and push it out as a Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen no sign that Microsoft has any interest in meeting any of those responsibilities.</p>

<h2>            display driver failed but has recovered, cuases major FPS drop in wow, other games slow to a crawl</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to have no problems at all. i dont know if it was a windows update, or what that has caused my problem but i would like someone to please help me out. I can play on wow, and suddenly i will drop from 47fps to 7 or less. then after 3-5 min,
 it will come back, but it happens again. i was playing a non-online game once that booted me and showed me the error "display driver failed but has recovered" and i've been researchin on how to fix this. i have updated my graphics driver to the newest one,
 even a beta one and nothing. i've rolled it back to original. nothing. only thing left i can think of is it was a windows update that messed with my pc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My graphics card is a Nvidia Geforce 9100, i have 7g of ram, and a 2.3gx4 Amd processor. i played everything just perfectly before now, but now, i cant seem to fix this so i can run anything. PLEASE HELP ME!

<p><span>Hi Gamerguy1984,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the Operating system installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>This seems to be a known issue related to drivers with the Graphic card, as I was researching on this issue
 I found out this link below with similar issue:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=99637" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=99637</a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you uninstall the drivers related to Graphic card and manually download the drivers from the
 manufacturer’s website and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link to download the drivers:
<strong><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</a></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link to update the drivers:
<strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></strong></span></p>
<p><span>I also suggest that you perform clean boot to check if any of the non Microsoft applications are conflicting
 with the computer, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to perform clean boot and check if you have the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>User Account Control permission:If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>5. Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>6. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer
 to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration Utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the step 7:
<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong>, from the article:
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows7:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I also suggest that you uninstall the game and re-install the game and check.
</span></p>
<p><span>You may run virus scan as well, run online virus scan from the link below:

<p>When I open WMP, it's just a blank rectangle that does nothing for hours (I tried leaving it alone, hoping it would solve itself)</p>
<p>I tried the troubleshooter, but all that did was reset the settings to default which didn't do anything.
</p>
<p>I've never had this kind of problem before and have no idea what to do.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6db5ff6-407d-4b75-a55d-e9e077a8b32f" /></p>

            <p>Hi Leon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have occurred because of the system files. In order to assist you further with the issue could you please confirm whether you have made any changes to the computer prior to the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a work around try to disable and then enable Windows media Player from the Windows Features and see if the issue persists. Follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows key + X and select Control Panel.</li><li>Select Programs and Features.</li><li>Click Turn Windows features on or off. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</li><li>Click on Media Features.</li><li>To turn Windows Media Player off, clear the check box. Click OK and then restart the computer.</li><li>To Turn Windows Media Player ON, click on the checkbox once again and click OK. And then restart the computer.</li></ol>
<p>If that does not fix the issue, I would suggest you to perform <strong>System File Check (SFC</strong>), and then check if this helps. Follow the steps below to perform the SFC scan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows Key + Q to open Charms Bar.</li><li>Type<strong> cmd </strong>in the search box.</li><li>On the left pane, right click on the<strong> cmd </strong>option and select “Run as Administrator”.</li><li>Type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit enter.</li></ol>

 see any such option anymore. Has this option been removed? Or can I contact costumer support for this?</p>
<p>

</p><p>Merging an old Skype account to an existing Microsoft account is no longer available. You can only merge your Skype account to a newly created Microsoft account. This is done by logging in to this link:
<em><a href="https://login.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live.com</a></em>. After logging in to that page using your old Skype account credentials, you will be asked to add an email address. Instead of adding an email address, click

            uhmm, to clarify, its been updated since windows 10 first came out, but anniversary update and after had the "no audio after reboot" issue,&nbsp; on newer drivers (of that time) and the latest update completely breaks audio (no audio after reboot on latest,
 and max volume with no effects on the stock drivers+effects enabled)&nbsp;

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and older hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

            If the drivers worked in the Previous version of Windows 10-downgrading is a good idea.
<br />As a side note, you can consult Sony forums too on about what they  say about this issue.

<br />Sony Laptops have always been problematic with Windows10-one way or the other.

<p>it semi worked, theres a certain set of drivers btwn 2014 and 2015 tht work, before which are too old, and after which are too new and cause no sound upon reboot issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the issue itself is pretty tricky.</p>
<p>i'd have to hard-reboot (long press the power key) and the sound comes back on, but after going into connected standby for a few hours, the sound goes away again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I'm getting the standard MTU error, but I'm at college so I have no control over the internet so i cant change the settings or restart the router or do any of the things the support stuff says to do. The thing is, two of my friends who live 2 doors down
 from me (on the same college controlled internet) just plugged their xbox into the ethernet jack in the wall and it connected with no problem. So obviously our ethernet connection works for live, but for some reason its not letting me connect, can anyone help?</p>

<p>If in your environment &nbsp;you can't control anything other than the XBOX, if somebody else in the environment has &nbsp;their setup working, check to see your XBOX is set up the same way. &nbsp; &nbsp; IP address, mask, gateway, DNS servers. &nbsp; If you can, use the DNS server
 issue topics and pages linked here on the forums, and try DNS Benchmark from GRC to make sure the servers you're using can be connected to and are stable. &nbsp; Also check your XBOX time, date and time-zone settings. &nbsp; &nbsp;In short, check everything you can that
 you have control over to see where any inconsistencies and issues might be.</p>

<p>To access the Windows&nbsp;Store and to download and run apps, you need an Internet connection, a screen resolution of at least 1024 x 768, and a Microsoft account.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to any hotspot requiring a login &#40;any with a captive portal&#41;</h2>
                    <p>It's as if captive portal bypassing is being attempted at every hotspot login. Is there a way to disable captive portal bypassing? It's not the ISP, since other users are connected and online, and often I'm even able to log on through my mobile device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if having restored my computer to factory settings awhile ago eliminated the information the bypassing was based off but since my computer was linked to my microsoft account and wireless connections were saved the computer is still trying to bypass
 based on expired or invalid information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wireless card driver is up to date and I've done all system updates. I can connect to other networks, just not ones with the popup login. I've tried disabling adblocker and I've tried making internet explorer my default browser, but neither of these fixed
 it.</p>

So I followed the link, and can't seem to find computer configuration, administrative templates, or generally hotspot authentication anywhere. I went into the registry and found the directory up until HotspotAuthentication, which I'm unsure if I'm supposed
 to create (I've never created a key in regedit before). I'm guessing I am supposed to create it, but since I can't find the group policy setting to manipulate I haven't gone ahead and backed up the registry and edited it.</p>

<p>When you say the videos are imported directly from the camera, do you mean you are adding them directly into your project while the camera is connected to the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, that's the issue. Movie Maker doesn't actually "import" your video. It instead just references the media wherever you tell it to find it. If you are telling it to retrieve the video directly off the memory/SD card of the camera, then every time it
 needs to preview that clip it will be doing it dynamically over the USB cable to the camera's memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You want to make sure you first import/copy all those videos onto your PC's hard disk. Then work from there instead of from the camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next question is about the exact model number of the Canon IXUS. It's possible that the video format isn't 100% compatible with Movie Maker. I could tell you more if I knew the model number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they do turn out to be a problem, look for a video conversion program that can convert to .wmv to .mp4. I can't specifically recommend one here so you'll have to do some research to find one that works.</p>

<p>No, I upload them up to my computer first and work from there. The model number is 510HS; it's this one, (http://www.shopper.pk/images/product_images/cameras/Canon%20IXUS%20510%20HS-1.jpg)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I will start researching for video conversion programs.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Whenever I attempt upgrading to Windows 10 on my desktop computer, I always get the error "c1900201" after downloading. &nbsp;I tried using the Media Creation Tool to use my USB drive as an installer, but it doesn't give me the option to keep my data when I launch

</p><p>1) I was attempting it first through the Get Windows 10 app, then I tried the Media Creation Tool (x64).</p>
<p>2) Well, it wasn't the Technical Preview; it was the full version of 10. &nbsp;I was using Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried Andre Da Costa's suggestion of installing via the ISO, however the issue with that was that
<em>I lost my entire C: drive data.</em>&nbsp; (It said that the Windows install might've been in an incompatible location, which irritates me considering it hadn't moved from the default location. &nbsp;:/)</p>

<h2>            AVerMedia H789 PCI-E Driver IR remote</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to install the driver for&nbsp;AVerMedia H789 PCI-E Hybrid DVB-T. so I can use my remote. right now its listed in device manager under other devices, 'unknown device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press update driver in the driver manager: When Windows encountered a problem installing the driver software for your device. windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched for the driver and found it:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.driversguru.com/driverdetail/2156801-Original+AVerMedia+H789+TV+Tuner+Driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.driversguru.com/driverdetail/2156801-Original+AVerMedia+H789+TV+Tuner+Driver</a>.
 This is the real driver instead of the annoying Driver Turner tuner AVerMedia links to every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I install this driver I get a error, 'your system does not meet the operating system requirements. update had been cancelled/ (9998)'. Same problem when I install it with compatibility mods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has a solution or tip?</p>
<p>Any reaction is appreciated ;)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error 9998 displays when the computer has a different Operating System than is required by the update. For example, the update applies only to computers with Windows 7 and the computer has Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This <a href="http://www.driversguru.com/driverdetail/2156801-Original+AVerMedia+H789+TV+Tuner+Driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
driver </a>that you installed is not a real driver. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Uninstall the driver that was installed. There's a driver available on HP's site which you could try using in compatibility mode. It seems to date from 2009 which makes it compatible with Windows 7.
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;softwareitem=pv-78532-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you do here is to right click the installer and go to Properties. Then, click the Compatibility tab and choose to run the installer in compatibility mode for Windows 7. Click Apply/OK and then run the installer.
</p>
<p>Refer to the article:<br />

<p>You probably need to supply more detailed information for <em>someone</em> to be able to really assist you. Like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the make and model of your PC, </li><li>was it running W10 or did you upgrade to it from an older version of windows,
</li><li>does it totally freeze requiring a restart or does it just freeze for a short period of time and then recover by itself?
</li><li>does it freeze when you are doing something specific like playing a game, or does it freeze after a long period of usage?</li><li>Is there any error message reported before or after it freezes?</li></ul>
<p>Any relevant information could assist. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, a couple of stock things to check are the usual DSIM and SFC scans to see if there are any obvious OS corruptions. See -

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026529/windows-10-using-system-file-checker</a> for details</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to check is to make sure that all your PC drivers are correct and up to date with the latest supported drivers from your PCs manufacturer support website. So go to the support site for your specific PC ( make and model ) and check you have
 the latest supported drivers installed on your PC from them.</p>
