<h2>            Word 2013 trying to open document and stuck on &#34;Connecting to SkyDrive&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had a problem with Office 2013 (specifically Word 2013) when trying to open documents. This started happening about 1-2 weeks ago. Whenever I open a document, I get the Word Splash screen and at the bottom of the splash screen it reads "Connecting to
 SkyDrive". It gets stuck there. There's no error. </p>
<p>I can connect to SkyDrive without a problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've discovered what is causing the problem and thought I would post it here in case anyone else is having the same issue. In my SkyDrive settings, there is an option named:&nbsp; "Use Office to sync files faster and work on files with other people at the same
 time". When this option is checked is when I see the problem I described above. If I uncheck this option all works as expected.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running SkyDrive Version 2012 (Build 17.0.2003.1112) on Windows 8 Enterprise with Microsoft Word 2013 (15.0.4420.1017).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the fact that I've got my files stored locally on my computer and synced to my SkyDrive in the Cloud and that I'm opening the files from my computer causing the problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            E51 streaming question</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
My first post here. I have an issue when streaming audio on my E51. I am using an internet radio application. When the backlight goes out the audio streaming also stops. I have searched the setings but failed to find a method of preventing this. I'm new to
 Nokia ( ex SE user), so I'm on unfamiliar ground.

<p>I'm having the same problem.&nbsp; It streams audio fine until the power saver activates, and then it stops.&nbsp; If I hit a button as soon as the light turns off, it will usually keep going.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another post, I read about two people who were having the same problem, but they were able to fix it by downloading Light Control, an app that lets you have more control over the power saving settings.&nbsp; I downloaded a couple of versions of this app, but
 it won't work on my e71.&nbsp; I haven't been able to find a version that does work on my e71.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, still unable to successfully stream internet radio for more than 60 seconds or so.</p>

                    Since the latest windows update, the skype app, skype for web or my phone app (android) do not display an accurate phone log.&nbsp; I have a phone number and phone subscription and my phone calls are not displaying accurately in any call log.&nbsp; The chat log
 is correct.&nbsp; I am answering the calls right on my computer, but the calls do not display in the logs on all platforms. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times.

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the exact Skype app that you’re using? Skype has 3 versions on Windows 10 and each of them has a different user interface.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I have this also and I've asked about it here to only receive illogical replies. I uninstalled the Windows Store Skype (latest version as of end of November, `17) and installed the Classic Skype 7.40.0.151 as a workaround till Skype acknowledges they have
 a major issue with call tracking/logging. </p>
<p>
</p><p>UWP Windows 10 Skype and Skype for Windows 10 Phone version 12.9.604.0 no longer track incoming calls to a Skype number. According to someone who replied to my post about this, if the call didn't cost you anything, it's not tracked. This is utter nonsense.
 It's broken, illogical, and not the way it used to be. Though I do not expect to go to my Skype account and view my call log showing how much each call cost me to show incoming calls, I do expect the app to show me who called me, when they called me, and how
 long we talked just like it HAS ALWAYS DONE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my Skype number for my business. I used to be able to look at my call history to do billing. I had all the information I just mentioned until some update in November.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOW, I can even miss a call from someone who called me from their cell phone to my skype number, and not even be able to tell I missed a call unless they leave me voicemail OR I start up Classic Skype on my PC because it's the only version that's still smart
 enough to work as anyone with half a brain would expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Totally unacceptable software/dev/company behavior here.</p>

            I am using 12.9.604.0 which was uninstalled and reinstalled yesterday from the Microsoft Store.&nbsp; However, the issue is consistent across Skype for Web and android in my account.

<p>I have noticed recent issues with being signed in on multiple devices though it didn't matter before. It doesn't matter now either as there is<strong> almost</strong> nothing that will show these missed calls. But yes, I have logged out and even used /remotelogout
 and /showplaces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me describe it like this. I get a call from a cell phone to my Skype number while only logged in on my Windows 10 Phone with Skype 12.9.604.0. Since the ringtone is broken on this version, I don't hear the call. The caller gives up but doesn't leave
 a voice message. When I look at Skype on my Windows phone, it shows absolutely nothing happened. I log out. I look at Skype UWP on Windows 10 Desktop. No activity. I log out. I start Skype Classic 7.bla.bla.bla.
<strong>There's the call</strong>, time, and number!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I say it doesn't matter if I'm logged in elsewhere or not. It's the fact that the client is not pulling this information from the Cloud. The information is there! My Skype Classic wasn't even running, nor left logged in at the time of that missed
 call yet it pulls the record from the Cloud when I start Skype. No other version of Skype is doing this because they're busted. That's the only logical deduction.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think someone should look into this.</p>

<p>Good idea, unfortunately it did not work for me. I did figure out the reason it did not work. The Office 365 for 2016 I have is not complete and therefore does not have the quick access toolbar loaded for use. I would have to pay the monthly subscription
 fee to unlock the rest of the features.</p>

            <p>You could do it with OneNote - use the hyperlinks in OneNote to connect ideas.&nbsp; You could even use the
<a href="http://www.onenote-tips.com/tips/linking.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Wikilinks feature</a>&nbsp;to create new pages and link those.</p>
<p>If you want to draw boxes and lines you can do it, though OneNote isn't perhaps the most elegant solution for that and occasionally the lines can get moved awkwardly if you add things above or around them.</p>

<h2>            e-mail appears stuck in outbox but is sending over and over again to my contacts</h2>
                    <p>I am currently running windows 10 with Outlook 2013 - my internet provider is of no help to me. E-mails that are large 1MB and greater appear to get stuck in my outbox but in essence are being sent over and over again to my contacts - I have to manually
 go offline and delete out of the outgoing folder - getting tired of this... Also around the same time another thing happened...when I send regular e-mails say to about 20 contacts - I get a message that something has been exceeded and they did not get sent.&nbsp;
 I have gone into admin command prompt and ran scan now - "Did not find any integrity violations" was the response after the scan was complete.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The problem that was successfully corrected by using Online Repair was that Outlook would not open.</p>
<p>

            <p>I didn't get an error message.&nbsp; It was just that nothing happened.&nbsp; When I explored further I found advice as pasted below to start Outlook in SafeMode.&nbsp; I did that all the way to the end.&nbsp; The problem was due to four add-ins that were active without my
 knowing.&nbsp; Unchecking them of them and then re-activating the only one I needed solved the problem.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p><p><strong><span>Suggestion</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Start Outlook in safe mode and disable add-ins
</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes add-ins can conflict with Outlook. Starting Outlook in safe mode, which starts Outlook without
 add-ins loaded, can tell you if an add-in is the problem. </span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Start Outlook in safe mode</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Choose
<strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Run</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Type
<em>Outlook /safe</em>, and choose <strong>OK</strong>. </span></li><li><span>In the
<strong>Choose Profiles</strong> dialog box, accept the default setting of Outlook and choose
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></li><li><span>If prompted, enter your
<em>password</em> and choose <strong>Accept</strong>. </span></li></ol>
</li><li><strong><span>Disable add-ins</span></strong><span>
</span>
<ol>
<li><span>In the upper-left corner of Outlook, choose
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Add-ins</strong>. </span>
</li><li><span>At the bottom of the
<strong>View and manage Office Add-ins</strong>, make sure the <strong>Manage</strong> box shows
<strong>COM Add-ins</strong>, and then choose <strong>Go</strong>. </span></li><li><span>As a precaution, when the
<strong>COM Add-ins</strong> listing of your current add-ins opens, do one of the following:
</span></li><li><span>After you've captured the titles of the selected add-ins, clear all selected check boxes, and then choose
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Choose
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Exit</strong>. </span></li></ol>
</li><li><strong><span>Restart
</span></strong>
<ol>
<li><span>Choose
<strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Run</strong>, and in the <strong>Open</strong> box, type
<em>Outlook</em>. </span></li><li><span>In the upper-left corner of Outlook, choose
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Add-ins</strong>. </span>
</li><li><span>Select the check box next to an add-in you want to re-enable, and then choose
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Repeat all steps until you've re-enabled all of the original add-ins and revealed the source of the

<h2>            Time Card Formulas</h2>
                    <p>Hi! This is what I am trying to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have timecards I need to put into Excel....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time In 6:48</p>
<p>Time Out 17:00pm</p>
<p>Most times 1/2 lunch is taken out</p>
<p>And I need it rounded to the quarter hour after 8 minutes - Example = total hours for the day 10:08 would be 10.25
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am used to doing the basics but this is out of my league.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no cell with a formula for 30 minute lunch. ( I put it into E5 to try your formula)</p>
<p>Expected results with lunch and rounded should be 9.75 ( but with the formula is comes out as -10.25)</p>
<p>=ROUND((C4-C7+(C4&gt;C7)-TIME(0,30,0)*(E5="y"))*96,0)/4</p>

<br />
You are repeatedly subtracting TimeOut (C7) <u>from</u> TimeIn (C4).&nbsp; It should be the other way around, as in all of my examples.&nbsp; The formula should be:<br />
<br />
=ROUND((<b>C7</b>-<b>C4</b>+(C4&gt;C7)-TIME(0,30,0)*(E5="y"))*96,0)/4<br />
<br />
You did write (C4&gt;C7) correctly.&nbsp; It effectively adds 24 hours if TimeIn &gt; TimeOut, written as 24-hour time.&nbsp; For example, if TimeIn is 17:00 and TimeOut is 1:00 (8-hour shift from 5pm to 1am), C7-C4 would be -16:00.&nbsp; By adding 24:00, we get 8:00, which is
 the correct elapsed time.<br />
<br />
However, I suspect the corrected formula above will give you 10.25 instead of 9.75.&nbsp; That is because you are putting ":30" into E5 instead of "y", which I specified in my original example.<br />
<br />
I did suggest, alternatively, that you can put <b>the time 0</b>:30 into E5, not the text ":30".&nbsp; And that can be the actual time for lunch, e.g. 0:45 or 1:00.&nbsp; If you put
<b>the time</b> in E5 instead of "y", you can simplify the formula as follows:<br />
<br />
=ROUND((<b>C7</b>-<b>C4</b>+(C4&gt;C7)-<b>E5</b>)*96,0)/4<br />

How did you buy Office? That will tell us what your options are to finding your Product Key.&nbsp; If you have the appropriate trial installed (ie as part of the windows recovery) there is no need to download the installation file. You need the appropriate product
 key to either activate the trial, or download an installation file.<br />
<br />
PS: Gloria, it would have been better if you had started a new question. Mixing your issue in with the similar unresolve issue of the original poster is confusing.<br />

    <title>How to use Styles of another document&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> klam_chowder  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to use Styles of another document&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I want to use the Styles from one document in another document.</p>
<p>Several authors are writing sections which I&nbsp;will to incorporate&nbsp;into a final report. I have set up the Formatting &amp; Styles for the final report. The authors all use their own Styles. Usually&nbsp;I just insert the author's section and format their work within
 the final report.</p>
<p>However, one author knows he needs to make some minor additions/revisions to his work but given the deadline, it does not make sense to wait until he is finished before I add in his 60 pages. I do not want to give him the final report and have him work on
 his section from within it because he may accidentally ruin my formatting for the rest of the report and I also will not be able to work on the rest of the report while he has it.</p>
<p>I want to work on his report in a separate document using the Styles of the final report. Then I can format his report until he is ready to make his revisions, then I can e-mail him his section, he can make his changes, e-mail it back to me, and then I can
 incorporate it into the final report with the formatting already fixed.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long explanation, I wanted to explain this awkward situation. Any suggestions, much appreciated!</p>

            <p>Those with only basic Word skills tend to format everything with the Normal style and superimpose manual formatting. This makes for a document that is very difficult for third-party editors to work with. When presented with that, you are going to have to
 reformat the document(s) to match your template. One way to do that is to open both a new blank document from your template and the document containing the text. Copy the text to the clipboard and use edit paste special &gt; unformatted text, to paste the content
 into the blank document with the format at the cursor. You will then have to apply styles as appropriate. Even then you will probably have to use the replace function to remove blank paragraphs between each required paragraph. If the writer has used footnotes
 etc, they will not be brought across and will have to be added later. It is going to be a mammoth task much of which could have been avoided by someone (the client) taking the bull by the horns and providing the writers with a standard template for this task.<span><br />

            <div>I wouldn't advise pasting as unformatted text. Instead I usually just Select All and apply my base style (Body Text, usually, or Body Text First Indent), then copy/paste. Footnotes and endnotes will be preserved, and you can then run through and apply
 heading and other styles to the few paragraphs that need them.</div>

<h3> shindy---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            C6-00 to flash firmware</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I need your help. My Nokia C 6-00 is a brand new in version rebranded for T-Mobile CZ.</p>
<p>It has as many faults and errors as there are stars on heaven. I need to remove one major - the email client in IMAP setup does not synchronize. It only add new mails, often crash, I even had to delete the mailbox and completely renew as it stopped "synchronize"
 at all. The problem could be improved (if not resolved) at 1.0.024. My latest approved version is 1.0.0.21. How could I flash the latest available firmware apropriate to hardware, not my operator wishes for setup of homepage and logo. It just bothers me so
 far!</p>
<p>Also just yesterday after regular use of facebook widget, the phone collapsed and after restart it can't get started again.</p>
<p>Flash for 1.0.021 did not help, separate install of Facebook widget doesn't exist for C6-00.</p>
<p>Any other advice than complete flash of the system to higher version?</p>
<p>Nokia, please talk!</p>

<p>Did you manage to remove the branding? Otherwise updates may or may not work. Once the branding is removed, you should be able to update to an unbranded version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know how to remove the branding. One way is to pay your provider some money for allowing you to remove the sim lock, and then you should be able to update to normal versions.</p>

<p>Sry, if I disapoint you, but as I have had no reply from Nokia and I did not want to break the guaratee, I selected the ugly way - went to a licensed service shop, claimed as many faults and errors as I could remember and checked that "if they do not replace
 the branded software by original Nokia unbranded, I am willing to pay for such unbrand".</p>
<p>There were several disputes over the theme, as I have consulted first the original shop of Nokia, original shop of T-Mobile, but finaly they helped me at main official service parter. The main concern was the continuity of guarantee, thus there was this
 long and **bleep** process.</p>

                    The MyPhone client has left my HTC Touch Diamond "off the hook" and totally drained the battery three times.&nbsp; The last time the damage was so bad I had to wipe my phone back to factory default and start over.<br />

When will the software be fixed.

<blockquote>&nbsp;totally drained the battery three times.&nbsp;</blockquote>
I keep it set to a manual sync because I'd not want to experience a possibility of running out of battery power.&nbsp; I use my device heavily and there are many days I am near the end of power because of high usage.&nbsp; If I had it set to anything other than a manual
 sync, I could face the possibility of starting a sync and depleting the battery.&nbsp; That said, I do believe that the software is smart enough to recognize if an interruption occurred and when it "re-sync'd", all would be fine.<br />

&nbsp;Not sure what happened to you ... can you delineate?<br />

I have had the unique privilege of chatting with and working with the MyPhone team.&nbsp;I can tell you that they are committed to providing the best possible experience and are working diligently on fixing any existing issue and at the same time, working on improving
 the interface.&nbsp; What has impressed me is that these guys want to know the issues that users are experiencing so they can address them.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
As users, we need to try our best to delineate the issue and what steps were taken to cause the issue.&nbsp; If the the MyPhone team can re-create the issue, they will&nbsp; (and have been) work on it.

    <title>Outlook 2016 Rearranges Favorites Panel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grrrrrrhk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Rearranges Favorites Panel</h2>
                    <p>I let Office do the latest update on 6/20/16, to 16.0.6925.1016 32bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Immediately upon restarting Outlook, my favorites panel was reorganised. 16 items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There didn't seem to be any pattern to the rearrangement, alphabetical or otherwise that I could see, just random.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I put it back the way I wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, and I do leave Outlook running, the favorites panel has been rearranged again.</p>

            <p>I appreciate the suggestion, but</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, it's actually easier to just put them back. &nbsp;If I had a hundred, this method might be better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my point, I consider this as a bug. &nbsp;Used Office 2003 for 11 years, no problems. &nbsp;Since I started using Office 365, I have had no less than 5 significant bugs surface. &nbsp;And there is no apparent feedback loop to MS. &nbsp;This one is relatively minor,
 but just demonstrates the apparent lack of QA again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this problem happens again, I'll try this and report back, if I remember and have to time to screw with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd rather see a bug report taken out and a subsequent repair.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So I tried it,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It DID NOT put my favorites panel back to what I had, didn't move a thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worse yet, it altered my layout by putting up a empty calendar on the right. &nbsp;Which I never had before.</p>

 requirements needed for the university version however i do not want it to be associated with my account. is there a way do deactivate it on my account to allow someone else to activate it?

            For my information, question Doug (not attacking your reply, just asking). How does cancelling the subscription help? It has been associated with the email address and I have not seen anything that says after cancelling the 365 product key can be transferred
 to another user.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Yes, Office 2010 University/Academic did allow transfers to another qualifying student. Does 365?<br />
<br />
Actually, in the 365 University License terms there is this clause:<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
<div>
<span>18. Assignment and transfer</span>
<p>We may assign this agreement, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you. You may not assign this agreement or transfer any rights to use the services.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>"Assignment" is a legal term for transfer. So it appears that MS can transfer your license to someone else, but you can't.<br />
</p>
(I am not a lawyer or legal expert, this is just my layman's interpretation. I am open to informed contradiction)<br />
<b>NOTE:</b> this may be a "leftover" of the retroactively reversed original license term that did not allow transfer of Office 2013 Retail licenses.&nbsp; I have not been able to find a revised MS License terms document yet.<br />
<br />
From what I've read the only thing that works with 365 when it comes to changing associated email addresses is to contact MS Support, have them cancel the product key and issue a new one.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you sure your computer is "too old", low powered.&nbsp; My 7+ year old laptop is still adequate to run 365/2013.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your computer would have to be very ancient and low powered.<br />

            That is true for all other Office 365 subscriptions. But the OP is talking about Office 365 University, which is a special case, 1-time payment subscription.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So, unless I'm missing something else (which at 4 AM is easy to do &lt;grin&gt; ) I don't think the user cancelling the University subscription will help with this problem, other than wasting their money.&nbsp;

            Ok, this was very helpful, it seems this will be more difficult than I hoped. To simplify things, what if I was to install it on another one of 'my' computers (for if it wasn't mine Microsoft may frown upon it...). If I was to do this how would the programs
 be associated with my account. Would I need to log on for any administration reasons aside from renewing my subscription after 4 years?<br />
<br />
I guess its not that my computer is to old, but my operating system is and I'm not that interested in changing that over.

            So it seems you are running a Vista or XP computer. Yes, that would prevent installing Office 365.&nbsp; (My laptop originally came with Vista, I "upgraded" it to Win 8 which is why I can run Office 2013 on it.<br />
<br />
The main reasons for logging in are to subscribe and to manage installations. Office 365 allows you to move the installation around to various devices as you like.
<br />
<br />
Yes, as I understand it, you as the owner administrator of the license can install it on ANY 2 computers you wish.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, Office 365 includes the "on demand" feature<br />

Managing Office 365 installations: activating, deactivating, and reactivating

<span>&nbsp; </span></span><strong><span>28 Nov 2012 9:39 AM </span>
</strong></p>
<p>Being able to install and use Office on up to 5 PCs at the same time is one benefit of your organization having an Office 365 subscription with
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg702619.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Office 365 ProPlus</span></a>. For example, a user could have Office installed on the following computers:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a desktop computer in her office</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a laptop that she uses when traveling</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a home computer</p>
<p>Even though Office is installed on three different computers, only one Office 365 license is used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do you manage to keep track of all these installations?&nbsp; What happens if the user already has Office installed on 5 computers, but needs to install Office on another computer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog post will cover both the user experience of managing Office 365 ProPlus installations and what aspects the Office 365 administrator can control. Why are we focusing on the user experience in a blog for IT Pros?&nbsp; As you will see, the Office 365
 user, not the administrator, actually plays the central role in managing Office 365 ProPlus installations. But administrators will need to be prepared to answer questions from users about such things as activation and deactivation, because these will be new
 and unfamiliar concepts for most users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we go through the user experience in this blog post, we will provide some administrator-specific information. And the blog post finishes up with additional information for the administrator to consider for managing Office 365 ProPlus installations.</p>

            I see. That does make sense. It is like any of the 365 business licenses.&nbsp; Although those licenses allow install on up to 5 devices, unlike Home Premium, those devices are intended to be used by the primary user.&nbsp; But I think, I'm not sure, that the license
 owner could install it on a computer under his own Windows User ID and it would still be legitimately available to other Windows User Ids on the computer.
<br />
<br />
Doug, or Connor, do you have access to a computer with University installed on it. I would like to get a copy of the University license terms to see how the differ from the other licenses.&nbsp; The can be copied from any office (university) app in the File tab
 &gt; Account command &gt; About ???? button &gt; "View MS Software License Terms" hyper link.&nbsp; Copy from there, paste in a reply back here (or skydrive).<br />
