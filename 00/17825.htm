<h2>            Using Formulas In A Word Table</h2>
                    
<p>I have used basic formulas in both word and excel, but I have NO idea of where to even start with this one...</p>
<p>In one column I have "time totals", ie 1.25 hrs, 0.5 hrs, etc.&nbsp; In another column I have "activity codes", ie 1 = number of maintenance hours, 2 = the number of Standby hours, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;want the formula to find all the code 2's in&nbsp;column one,&nbsp;add up all of the time for the code 2's from column two and put the total of all the time&nbsp;in a&nbsp;cell.</p>
<p>To make things even more complicated, I've been requested to see if MS Word will "add up"&nbsp;time values for them, ie, if Column one = 7:15 and&nbsp;Column two = 8:15, Column three would equal 1.0 hrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a formula for the cells in column three that would automatically
 fill in after column one and two are completed.</p>
<p>I sure hope someone out there can help me.&nbsp; I used the&nbsp;sum formula before and I understand the theory behind "if" and "and", but I've never used them before.&nbsp; I'm sure if someone can provide me with the above formulas, I should be able to figure out some
 others that I need.</p>
<p>Thank you VERY VERY VERY much!</p>

<p>The problem you're describing is far more than can be handled in Word by field coding (notwithstanding Doug's confidence in what can be achieved via my Word Field Maths tutorial). It could be done using vba, but it would be far simpler to insert an Excel
 Worksheet into the document and use that. Excel already has functions designed for just this sort of thing.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Android Switching Accounts</h2>
                    I have 4 Office 365 email addresses.&nbsp; I check on Desktop and Android using Outlook.&nbsp; When I reply to messages on ONE of them, it changes my sending address to another.&nbsp; Replies sent from the other 3 remain true to the original.&nbsp; I have missed this and
 several times sent from the wrong account.&nbsp; where is the setting that controls this and how do I fix?!?

<p>Hi Dean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for using Outlook and letting us know about your current experience. We really appreciate your support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you've met a issue that Outlook for Android changes your sending address on one account automatically.</p>
<p>As the other 3 accounts have no issue, we can identify that the issue may be related to this specific account. Because you are using Office 365 or Business account, you can try removing this account and re-add it to Outlook for Android to check if the issue
 can be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please contact us through the <strong>Help</strong> Section of the app (in the
<strong>Settings &gt; Help and Feedback &gt; Contact Support</strong>) so that we can assist you in the best possible way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to fixing this for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lance</p>

            I have already posted on this site re my own similar problem. I resorted to using Bluetooth to transfer pictures - have yet to try music transfers. USB Just did not work for me and as PC Suite is useless for Macs I do think that there should be a warning
 somewhere to Mac users before buying.

            to my knowledge, you should not be using the "printing and media" mode, to connect to the computer. I believe that works when connecting directly to a printer.<br />
<br />
I believe the only mode that could work with a Mac, is the "data storage" mode.<br />
<br />
(but then I don't have a Mac)

            I haven't even been able to get the USB cable to work with my mac. But I have solved the problem of transferring pix by using Bluetooth. I also use that to transfer music files, but they are going directly on to the Memory card and not into a folder. Then
 I have to transfer them which takes time. I would also like to delete some of the dross music that comes with the Nokia, but don't seem able to do that. Will give the cable another try however to see if it gives me more control over destinations.

            OK Here is how to transform Music to Mac.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.Go to settings and open connectivity<br />
<br />
2.Make sure USB is plugged in<br />
<br />
3. Go to USB data cable<br />
<br />
4. It should give you the options of Nokia Mode, Music sync, and Data storage.<br />
<br />
5. Select Data storage<br />
<br />
6.When you do this iphoto will pop up. Dont worry!! close the i photo.<br />
<br />
7. Look on Desktop and you will see the phone labeled as untitled.<br />
<br />
8. Click it and you will see the my music folder. Thats it!!!<br />
<br />
9. Now Drag the music from your i tunes Library to the folder.<br />
You can do the same with video and pictures<br />
<br />
<br />
My bad if spelling is a bit off im going fast.

ahmedmasy95.</a> The best way to transfer contacts from Nokia 3210 to Nokia 225 is thru its SIM card. To do that, if the contacts are saved on phone memory, copy all contacts from Nokia 3210's phone memory of the SIM card. Remove the SIM card from the Nokia
 3210 and insert it to the Nokia 225.</p>

<h3> remell  say:</h3>
<h2>            excel 2007 text column copy to access 2007 does not paste</h2>
                    I am opening an .xls file using Excel 2007 SP2, copying 25,000 rows of data, 2--9 colums, and trying to paste these into an .mdb file using Access 2007 SP2.&nbsp; It is pasting null/empty values in a "text" field.&nbsp; Both Excel and Access have this column defined
 as "Text".&nbsp; This process worked fine when using Excel 2003/Access 2003.&nbsp; I have found a work around.&nbsp; If I close Excel after the copy and "save the results" to the clipboard, then do the paste, it works.&nbsp; I could live with this, but have concerns that users
 I support are going to run into this issue.&nbsp; I've also found 2 KB articles (<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/958437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>KB958437</span></a>,<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967699" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>KB967699</span></a></span></span>)
 that say to uninstall these secutity patches and the problem goes away, but will return with the next Windows Update run.&nbsp; They also indicate the problem was resolved with Office 2007 SP2.&nbsp; I am not getting&nbsp;the specific error message described in these articles,
 just the paste failure.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any ideas on how I can get my copy/paste between Excel and Access to work correctly?&nbsp;

            I assume you are doing a 'paste append.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Are all fields or just some of them contain the Null?&nbsp; Are the column/field order the same, not just the display, but actual column/fields?

            No, just a Paste (ctrl-V).&nbsp; I delete all contents in Access before the paste operation.&nbsp; Around 23,000 of the 25,000 rows paste nulls in the "text" field, but paste the rest of the fields successfully.&nbsp; The column/field order is the same.&nbsp;

            Obviously the so-called star hadn't the necessary technical know-how to answer you. This is a problem not just with 2007 but with 2010 as well. When you copy &amp; paste into Access table or Form in dataview and if you column starts with some numeric values
 and some alphanumeric fields further down, Access assumes that this column should contain numeric only (not sure why such an assumption was made) and hence all subsequent alphanumeric values are not pasted. To work around, you need to format your excel column
 that contains a mixture of numerics &amp; alphanumerics to&nbsp; Text before you copy &amp; paste.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that was not necessary and a rude comment.&nbsp; Everybody doesn't necessarily know everything about every version of Access or combined Excel/Access.&nbsp; And while you may be right about what the problem is, putting someone down who is trying to help really
 doesn't paint you in a very good light.&nbsp; The Community Star award that Microsoft gives to certain users here does not denote technical expertise as neither does the MVP award.&nbsp; Both of them denote that the person has gone out of their way to help others with
 the Microsoft products.&nbsp; They do not have to know everything about them.&nbsp; Yes, they likely know a good amount about them, but rarely will you find any of them (and I include myself) who claims to know all about the program.&nbsp; There is always another thing to
 learn about it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it is good that you are helping this poster with their problem.&nbsp; But perhaps you can do so without putting down others.<br />

            <p>I've had good results using <strong>Paste Special &gt; Text</strong>, which seems to work around this bug (non-numeric values in a field, after an initial series of numeric, are silently discarded).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For large paste's (100k rows), this runs into another bug, where Excel 2013 hangs after the paste into Access.</p>

    <title>IFS function on mac verion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billiet  say:</h3>
<h2>            IFS function on mac verion</h2>
                    <p>Apparently the ifs function is supposed to be in all Office365 versions of excel. Just found that the ifs function is not supported in MAC version. Have made extensive use of this function only to find that #name? errors appear for all my collaborators using
 a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I need to revert to ugly nested "if" functions. Bloody **** Microsoft please get these versions in lockstep.</p>

    <title>how do i know if emails i receive are safe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mysmarple  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do i know if emails i receive are safe</h2>
                    I have been reading about outlook being able to detect potentially risky emails by either showing a green icon by the safe email and a yellow or red bar when a malicious email is sent, but I have never seen any of these things on any of my incoming emails.
 According to what I have been reading, this is already installed in windows 8. why is this not working on my outlook mail? also, I have been having to re-enter my password a lot to get into outlook instead of it being saved. why is that happening? thanks pam

 should get the product that I'm testing for free, just like the Windows.</p>

    <title>Changing hard coded dates in formula for a specific month provided by - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel jette  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing hard coded dates in formula for a specific month provided by user.</h2>
                    <p>in Excel 2010/2013, I'm trying to automate a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One column (H) contains dates in the dd/mm/yyyy format. Another column (I) may or may not have text.</p>
<p>A report is generated for a specific month. For this example, I'll set it up so that the reporting period is April.</p>
<p>I am using the following formula to gather the number of records for April and concurrent entries&nbsp;from the I column:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=COUNTIFS(H:H, "&lt;="&amp;"30/04/2016", H:H, "&gt;="&amp;"01/04/2016", I:I, "&lt;&gt;")</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will pick up all the April records as well as the records that have something in the I column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to be able to replace the date coding in the formula by just typing the name of the month in a cell and have this cell as a reference to the formula so that the only change to be done is the name of the month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OneNote has an OCR mechanism of its own which is able to find and index text inside any image so it can be searched for. In OneNote 2016 for Windows,<span>&nbsp;
</span>this OCR mechanism is in the operating system and fast. In OneNote for Mac, an OCR engine is deployed on the Microsoft servers. Generally, it will take up from several minutes to several days, even a long time to make copy text option available for

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you perform a soft reset. Press and hold the <strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and

Note that you should
 not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>

            If a soft reset didn't work, we suggest that you perform a hard reset instead. You can reset your phone under Settings:
<strong>Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; about &gt; reset your phone.</strong> Make sure to back up all of your files before
 performing a hard reset.
<p><strong>Go to Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; Update and security &gt; Backup &gt;More options &gt; Back up now.</strong></p>

            I have found out that the flickering was due to an update that was installed while I was sleeping .

    <title>Issue with Hierarchical Bullet Styles in PowerPoint 2007 not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hortenserogez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with Hierarchical Bullet Styles in PowerPoint 2007 not replicated in the placeholders...</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently trying to fix someone else's template that I have to use and finding the following issue:</p>
<p>- <strong>the Text placeholders I create within the slide masters do not replicate the bullet style I created in the Top Slide Master.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So to illustrate, here is the Slide Master bullet hierarchy I want to use and have created in the top slide master:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3af9fb73-ad2f-471c-a5d5-c3e4dee5a745" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3af9fb73-ad2f-471c-a5d5-c3e4dee5a745" /></a></p>
<p>But the probem is when&nbsp;I insert a Text or Content Placeholder it gives me this hierarchy:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b705947f-ce9f-4a1f-8040-7d2f29d445c6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b705947f-ce9f-4a1f-8040-7d2f29d445c6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And I can't work out what I do wrong that it ends up showing the Second level with the font size and indentation of the first, but the bullet type of the second, messing up the subsequent bullet levels!!!</p>

            <p>The Slide Master is the larger slide at the top. Below it are the Slide Layouts. Once inheritance gets badly messed up, it can be difficult to get the slide layouts to take formatting information from the master again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try opening the Slide Master, deleting the main text area, then using Master Layout and checking Text to reinsert it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't clear the problem, you may have to insert a fresh Slide Master, format it correctly, recreate the Slide Layouts, then apply the new layouts to the existing presentation.</p>
