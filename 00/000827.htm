            Someone else had that problem and repairing the installation fixed it for them. 
<br />
<br />So I'd suggest doing an online repair of the installation.
<br />
<br />The instructions to follow to do this are here:

            Many issues are being reported in Office during last few weeks.  You are definitely not alone.
<br />
<br />You should try following -
<br />
<br />A. I am assuming that your OS is up-to-date. If not, make your OS also up-to-date. The latest OS version is 10.13.4. This is reported to solve the issue.
<br />
<br />If your issue solved, no need to read further down.
<br />
<br />B. Try to update your Office again so that if any patch is released by Microsoft that would flow in. Sometimes you have to try many times before an update is recognized by your Office.
<br />
<br />C. Another option is roll back to previous stable version which you had preferably 15.41. To rollback -
<br />
<br />1. Uninstall the latest version of Office - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Install the previous stable version - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-history-for-Office-2016-for-Mac-700cab62-0d67-4f23-947b-3686cb1a8eb7#bkmk_current" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some standard troubleshooting steps related to Office on Mac which you can attempt. This I am leaving to you whether you want to try these or not.
<br />
<br />1. Start your Mac in Safe Mode to determine if some other program is conflicting
<br /><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201262</a>
<br />
<br />2. Create a new user account to test
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2439218/testing-your-user-account-to-troubleshoot-office-for-mac-applications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/243921...</a>
<br />
<br />3. You can try to troubleshoot by completely uninstalling it and then reinstalling it.

    <title>Image recover&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Image recover&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recovery needs Administrator account 9926, I tested out image recovery in windows 10 build 9926 on a fresh install.
<br />
My account is Microsoft account, Administrator&nbsp;account<br />
My account is added into administrator groups<br />
My Microsoft account has administrator check <br />
Restore from image returns<br />
<strong>(You need to be signed in as administrator, but there aren't any administrator accounts on the PC)</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to go to accounts and enable Administrator then restart the image recover process.
<br />
This needs to be fixed so the Microsoft account administrator can restore the backup without going through that process</p>

<p>Ok I think I may have figured out what is up. I use 2 drives for my system. SSD drive for windows and high end games like bf4. Then I moved my user folders to D, skydrive and all other setups to this D drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I made the image I included D:\ in the image. D:\ is where I have all my programs installed.&nbsp;The boot drive is not big enough for the restore. So it errors. I'm going to make a new image excluding that drive.

            <p>&nbsp;I did discover what the issue was. I created a image only using the one drive. My system uses 2 storages spaces, one for windows and origin/games, there other for programs and users folders.
</p>
<p>I am now going to try with the C:\ and D:\ again to see if I still get the disk is too small error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recovery works fine. lets see if I can restore both drives. since my system uses 2 drives. If not then Microsoft should see how we can make the image recovery work. I'll try one more time.

<p>
</p><p>It is my understanding that the recovery process doesn't work if the location of any of the system or user files has been changed... I'm pretty sure Win 8\8.1 is like this also....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've not actually tried it, but it has come up in a lot of the Win 8 forum posts.</p>

 I was restoring too. </p>

<h2>            How to turn off E72&#39;s voice control and email reader&#63;</h2>
                    Hi Nokia Experts here.<br />
<br />
I always accidently trigger the E72's voice control (the middle button at right side) and email reader (no idea which button for it) and cause unexpected actions. Annoying.<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me how to disable the two features, at least how to disable the hotkeys?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

<p>Email reader is the far right "envelope icon" upon right "rocking" softkey. If you go to Menu &gt; Ctrl. panel &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Personalisation - scroll down to One-touch keys &gt; Messaging key &gt; Options &gt; Open &gt; you can define whatever application you
 want for either short or longpress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As regards the "Voice key" between the volume buttons, whilst I don't think that it can be disabled it is certainly possible to remap it for other functions for use with open applications. For example upon mine volume controls zoom in/out in Camera and middle
 "Voice" button takes image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More detail can be found here but beyond remit of this manufacturer's sponsored forum as Magic Key by Leftup is an "unsigned" application:<a href="http://symbianguru.wordpress.com/2008/12/19/make-full-use-of-the-volume-mute-keys-on-the-e71/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://symbianguru.wordpress.com/2008/12/19/make-full-use-of-the-volume-mute-keys-on-the-e71/</a></p>

            I have actually already assigned Voice Recorder to the Long Press action of the Messaging key. The key works. Every time I press and hold the Messaging key, the Voice Recorder luanches with no problem.<br />
<br />
That's also why I have no idea how I did activate the Message Reader acciidently.<br />
<br />
It would be great if I could assign the middle button to take images. Unfortunately, most links from that blog article no longer work except the one jumping to Symbian-Guru.com Is Over. It seems there is no link there to download the unsigned the Magic app.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.

            Tried that. It seems this simply resets the device adaption to the previous speaker's voice, it does not disable or stop voice control. The middle button still works after removing voice adapts.

            If you right click on the task bar and select properties and then select the Tool Bar tab, you will find that the last item is Search On The Tool Bar. &nbsp;You can select to remove it or just make it the circle icon.

            Or just right click on the search icon and select <strong>Search</strong> for more options. It's a handy icon you use for search, not just Cortana.

<p>Hi, Sydney</p>
<p>
</p><p>In personal Skype, you can&nbsp;add up&nbsp;to 25 people (24 plus yourself) on the same audio call. If you will need to make video calls with all of your contacts, the maximum number of video streams will vary depending on the platform and device you are using.&nbsp;However,
 you can only share your screen with a&nbsp;maximum of 9 persons in the group&nbsp;call using your personal Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to make calls with a larger group, you can visit this support article for other options:

    <title>Internationalized Domain Name Registration in the Live Admin Center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seven7seven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internationalized Domain Name Registration in the Live Admin Center And for Outlook.com Email</h2>
                    I cannot seem to register internationalized domains both when entering their Unicode addresses and when typing in their punycode ASCII equivalents. I have heard other people have registered internationalized domains with Microsoft before though, so I was
 wondering if there were some sort of special instructions to follow for these domains. I would also like to know if there is full IDN support available for email (as in, emails sent and received via Outlook.com would display the correct Unicode address rather
 than punycode). Thanks.

Hi, I am also unable to add non-English character domain name through Live Admin.<br />
But could you confirm whether add encoded IDN/Punycode for the domain name work or not? Can this be a possible solution? Thank you.<br />

<h2>            PowerPoint crashes when I click on &#39;Design&#39; tab</h2>
                    This post answers my own question but I am not sure if this qualifies as a discussion or question. I figured the knowledge/experience I had in this issue might help someone!<br />
<br />
Setup:<br />
Windows 10 laptop with secondary monitor<br />
Dell Inspiron 5555<br />
Amd A10 8700p APU/CPU combo for processing and graphics<br />
<br />
I was working on PowerPoint a few days back when it crashed with the "Stopped Working" dialogue box. I found the error in Window's event viewer which mentioned an issue with amdocl.dll. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
First, however, I wanted to rule out an issue with the office installation. I did a repair through Microsoft's tools, but to no avail. I did a complete reinstall of Office 2016 and the problem persisted.<br />
<br />
I decided then to rule out driver out-of-date issue, so updated driver to 15.12 Radeon Software. PowerPoint still crashed upon clicking design tab or choosing template in new presentation. I uninstalled the driver, and the problem did not appear. Re-installed
 same driver, and problem re-appeared. Uninstalled, problem did not appear. I tried an older driver (15.11). It seemed to work for a little while. However, the problem eventually came back.<br />
<br />
In a bit of guesswork I decided that maybe something had removed the dll from PowerPoint's install folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16), or that perhaps something was already using but not sharing the dll in the windows folder. Using
 dllescort (free download) I got a copy of amdocl.dll and pasted it into the PowerPoint folder mentioned previously.<br />
<br />
And it worked! I just wanted to share this with anyone that may experience this strange and possibly rare error/crash. I will update if the error comes back. But, fingers crossed!<br />
<br />

            You, sir, are a lifesaver (and money saver). I had this exact problem and your process fixed it perfectly. Tried contacting Microsoft customer service. They walked me through the exact troubleshooting steps I had already tried from their website, then
 told me I would have to sign up for some $149 "service plan" to get my problem fixed. What an extortion racquet! For those who may not know, you can find a free download of amdocl.dll without using dllescort by just typing in a Google search. Just make sure
 you have some kind of safesearch or file download scanning program because mine indicated that one site was trustworthy while another was not.

<p>Unfortunately, I have not had the same luck. Much like you, I have taken every step that the Office website recommends, but with no luck. The templates and designs just do not work on my PP. I have been playing with PP and it seems like this feature is the
 only things not working. I took your advice and dled&nbsp;the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">amdocl.dll, and then placed it in this location,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16,
 but still no luck. Anyone else out there with this problem. Like others on here, I have contacted Microsoft and they simply take me through the steps that I have already gone through.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Anyone else know of anything different I can try? Anyone else with this problem? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated..... I am a teacher and have had this for a year, but can't make any presentations with cool designs.&nbsp;</p>

In other words, the column will change daily, but the row will stay the same.<br />

This code gives me the column I need from the other worksheet, but I can't seem to figure out how to use that info to change the formula.<br />

                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since I installed Office 2013 64bit on windows 7, 3 months ago, power point keeps crashing very often. It usually happens when I am moving elements. This makes working almost impossible, so I would be looking forward to some useful advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes &amp; Thanks</p>

I tried both downloading and reinstalling OneDrive and resetting the app as directed in a previous post. I am using Office 365 for Business on a MacBook Pro running macOS 10.14.4, and the probably started with that OS update. Now the OneDrive app will start
 to load, but as soon as I provide the login credentials the app closes.</p>

<p>Hi Timothy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting the question on our forum.</p>
<p>I have tried this on our side, I didn’t meet the issue on our side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you try safe mode to check the result, it can help us determine whether a background program is interfering with Microsoft Office for Mac applications:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2398596/how-to-use-a-clean-startup-to-determine-whether-background-programs-ar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use a "clean startup" to determine whether background programs are interfering with Office for Mac</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, I need to confirm if you install OneDrive via the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=823060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install OneDrive for Mac</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. Check if signing into other accounts also meet the issue.</p>
<p>2. The version of OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Qing</p>

            The problem has now resolved. Not sure which step was critical, since on a reboot I was able to launch the program. None of my previously set options were carried forward, however; I had to 'start from scratch' in setting synchronization options.

<p>Hi Matt.Y,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check whether it is added but have been disabled: Select&nbsp;File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins. In the bottom of the Window select&nbsp;Manage:<span style="font-weight: bold"> Disabled Items</span>&nbsp;and
 click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Go</span>. Also, reboot the PC to try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if the issue persists, please try repairing the Outlook client:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, may I know the detailed version of Outlook are you using?&nbsp; Have you tried adding another add-in to see whether it can be added successfully? if not, please try it on your side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your time.</p>

<p>You would need to reinstall Nuance PDF 2</p>
<p>And if MS Outlook was throwing a compatibility error, and disabled the add-in you would need to contact Nuance support to see if they have an updated version</p>

            You should backup using PC suite. PCsuite backs up all the data from the phone and memory card into the PC.<br />
Remove the memory card and start the phone.

<h2>            No Emails in Inbox, contacted support regarding the issue.</h2>
                    <p><em>---Original Title: Empty Inbox---</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my inbox this morning, and a few minutes later, it was empty. I use iPhone, iMac, and Windows to get to Hotmail and all devices were all showing empty Inbox.&nbsp;It was not in the "deleted" item or "trash" item. &nbsp;I was panic, due to many personal information
 in my inbox, as well as worrying that a hacker got into my financial information, I quickly searched for Hotmail support phone #. &nbsp;I found 1-866-510-8242. &nbsp;The guy with accent picked up the phone and said he was based in Scotland. &nbsp;I asked him to call me back
 and the number he was calling from was 44-20-3290-9515, he also give me other numbers 1-800-990-2258 and 1-209-980-7961 to call later if I ever need help again. I was asking questions about his legitimacy and he assured me he is legit and that Microsoft contracted
 out the service to his company which is IPACE SOLUTION. He told me that the hotmail server was running fine and my hotmail account was hacked by someone in Iraq. &nbsp;I was so panic, I beg him to help me. &nbsp;Again, I asked question if he was really legit, but of
 course he said he was. &nbsp;He diagnosed my iMac and found a virus I forgot what it's called that is infected iMac and Windows and is originated in Russia. &nbsp;I paid $250 for a 5 year plan for them to provide me with technical support. It was a red flag, but I went
 ahead anyway. And I gave them access into my iMac computer and the guy put some anti-malware software for iMac into my computer and I gave them password to my Hotmail account so they can recover thousands of my email. &nbsp;Prior to this, I knew how to recover
 the deleted items from Inbox, however, the ability was not there because the deleted item also shows "No Email". &nbsp;So the guy was able to retrieve many deleted items and put them back in my Inbox, but because there are thousands of them, he told me that he
 would complete the work by tomorrow. &nbsp;Again, he assured me that I have to just trust him. &nbsp;I have blocked my online banking capability and contacted my credit card company, just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please tell me what happens with my Hotmail inbox? &nbsp;Can you please tell me if this guy is legit and what should I do if he is not? &nbsp;He has my hotmail password now. &nbsp;How to clean up my computer if I do not know what he has done to my computer? &nbsp;Please
 help, I am desperate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eka</p>

            <p>Hi Eka,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only legitimate source to contact Microsoft Support is through Microsoft Community and through Chat support, if you&nbsp;come across issues regarding your&nbsp;Microsoft account.&nbsp;There are many phone numbers which you may come across claiming to be from Microsoft
 but these numbers are Scam. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to change your email account password and all the information you provided to the&nbsp;scammer.&nbsp;Install an antivirus or run Windows Defender scan&nbsp;on your computer to check for viruses.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also&nbsp;inform you that do not give your private information to anyone unless it&nbsp;is a legitimate query from Microsoft. If you&nbsp;have any queries regarding your account then contact Microsoft Support from this link. &nbsp;</p>

<div>This selects one or more cells that are 'connected' to A7. It is the equivalent of selecting A7 and tapping

.CurrentRegion</i>&nbsp;should only be used when you are <i>absolutely sure</i>&nbsp;there will be data in the first cell.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Set mytotal = mydata.Offset(mydata.Rows.Count).Rows(2)&nbsp;<strong>'WHAT'S THIS ONE DOING?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<div><br />
<div>This looks at range of cells offset to A7 by the number of rows in A7's <i>.CurrentRegion</i>. No number of columns is provided so it is defaulted to offset
<i>0</i>&nbsp;columns. From that offset range, the second row is assigned to the <i>mytotal</i>&nbsp;range variable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Use,</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Debug.Print&nbsp;mydata.Offset(mydata.Rows.Count<b>, 0</b>).Rows(2).Address</div>
<div>... before assigning or,</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Debug.Print mytotal.address</div>

<div>This could be a problem if the <i>.CurrentRegion</i>&nbsp;was more than a single column and shouldn't be left ambiguous like this. Use something like,</div>
<div><br />
<div>mytotal.<b>Cells(1,1)</b>.Formula = "<i>&lt;your formula&gt;</i>"</div>
<div>... or earlier as,</div>
<div>Set mytotal = mydata.Offset(mydata.Rows.Count).Rows(2).<b>Cells(1,1)</b></div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The range mydata is set with this</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Set mydata = ActiveCell.CurrentRegion</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now let's say that the current region for this was A1:I20 so in that range there are 20 rows. This line then set as new range called mytotal</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Set mytotal = mydata.Offset(mydata.Rows.Count).Rows(2)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The range will be the same width as the mydata range but offset from it by 20 rows from rows(2) of that range.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So 20 rows down from rows(2) is row 22 so this second range becomes A22:I22</p>
<p>Each of the rows in a defined range can be referred to with rows(n)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However doing that way isn't clear, I would write it like this</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Set mytotal = mydata.Rows(2).Offset(mydata.Rows.Count)</p>

            I looked a little deeper and realized that you wanted the SUM() formula across a number of cells, not just the first. However, while
<i>.Rows()</i>&nbsp;can be used sometimes, it cannot be used at others and this will come back and bite you in the rear at some point. Better to define the range with
<i>.Rows().Cells</i>&nbsp;instead of relying on VBA's fallback.&nbsp;Here is how I would write that.
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub AddTotals()</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim x As Integer, mydata As Range, mytotal As Range</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; For x = 1 To Worksheets.Count</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With Sheets(x)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set mydata = .Cells(7, 1).CurrentRegion</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set mytotal = mydata.Offset(mydata.Rows.Count<b>, 0</b>).Rows(2)<b>.Cells</b></div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mytotal.Formula = "=sum(" &amp; mydata.Columns(1).Address(False, False) &amp; ")"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mytotal.Cells(1, 1) = "Total"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mytotal.Range("B1:C1").ClearContents&nbsp;'(or mytotal.cells(1,2).resize(1,2).clearcontents)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End With</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set mytotal = Nothing</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set mydata = Nothing</div>

                    <p>Why can't I print from IE9 and Windows 7 and Comcast but can print from notepad. I cannot print Emails or web pages or parts of web pages. All I get printed is a header and a footer. Printing from Notepad works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer is an eMachinesEL1352 P01-A1, running Windows 7(fully updated), and IE9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem has been around for some time. It is time that I have an answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the usual work arounds found on the internet and no one has come up with and answer.</p>

            <p>Apparently the problem is conflict or incompatibility between Comcast and IE9.&nbsp; Comcast is telling everone to&nbsp;switch browsers to Firefox.&nbsp; This doesn't speak well for Comcast or Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Mac Office 2016 - Outlook should honor &#34;Do Not Disturb&#34;</h2>
                    <p>When I turn on "Do Not Disturb" in the notification panel (option click the notification icon in the upper right) I still get Outlook email alerts and calendar reminders. &nbsp;When Do Not Disturb is enabled I should not get any popups on my screen from Outlook.
 &nbsp;Every other app respects Do Not Disturb, it's only Outlook that I've seen that does not.</p>

            <p>I've experienced this same condition. But there is no consistency. Sometimes it just lets me swipe up, sometimes requires the pin. About 40% of the time, the iris scanner works perfectly.&nbsp; At one point, I started wondering if the iris scanning was successful
 just at the split second that I swiped upward for pin input -- but now I doubt that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I did not have a pin set until the new setup walked me down that path, I haven't been annoyed one way or the other by this bug-ish behavior.</p>

            You can set up how long does the phone needs to be in loc&nbsp;before requiring pin. The iris scanneralways shows up even when the phone is not locked
