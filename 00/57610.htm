<h2>            Limited account doesn&#39;t allow wireless adapter to load</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I created two accounts on my computer.&nbsp; One is the computer administrator, the other a limited account.&nbsp; Whenever anyone attempts to get on the internet through the limited account they fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem seems to be that the&nbsp;wireless adapter isn't loading
 on the limited account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently reformatted my hard drive and didn't have this problem before I reformatted.&nbsp; Limited accounts could access the internet before I reformatted and the wireless adapter loaded just fine.</p>
<p>Also, when I change the limited accounts back to computer administrator accounts they are then able to access the internet and the wireless adapter loads properly.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Sheila</p>

<p>This is a common problem with third-party wireless connection-managers. Note, this isn't the adaptor driver, it's the app with which you select your connection.<br />
<br />
Your simplest option is probably to disable any third-party manager and start the Wireless Zero Configuration service.</p>
<p>To do this, run services.msc</p>

<p>Anteaus,</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to reply.&nbsp; I haven't yet tried your suggestion.&nbsp; I'd like to avoid using the Wireless&nbsp;Zero Configuration (WZC) until it's my last option.&nbsp; There must be a simpler explanation as to why this is happening since previously I was able
 to connect to the internet with a limited account without the WZC.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>It is most likely that the wireless app cannot change a file or registry key where it stores its settings, owing to the limited rights. Figuring-out which could involve a lot of detective-work though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other option, if available, is to run the wireless app as a service, or run it under different credentials.</p>
<p>You might also want to try making the limited user a member of the Administrators group, connecting, then demoting the user. You may find that once the settings have been made, they work even thought the limited user cannot change them.</p>

<p>I just had this problem today.&nbsp; Connected a D-Link DWA-125 wireless adapter to a Win7 PC w/ 4 user accounts (1 admin, 3 standard) so it would connect wirelessly to a D-Link DIR-625.&nbsp; Installed the D-LINK software with admin account, and admin account connection
 worked fine, but standard accounts would not connect to the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution for me was to grant administrator rights to the D-Link Wireless Connection Manager software - (right-click DLWCM icon, choose "run as administrator.")</p>
<p>Next, I needed to access the admin account, change all the standard accounts to admin accounts, then access each and activate the connection.</p>
<p>Next, I went back to the admin account and changed the other three accounts back to standard accounts.</p>
<p>Next, to test, I accessed all three standard accounts and tested the connections, which were ok.&nbsp; I then rebooted and repeated the tests, and all standard accounts can connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to all of those who have contibuted here.</p>

<h2>            Windows Store doesn&#39;t auto-update apps</h2>
                    <p>Windows Store is unable to auto-update apps. You can set it to download the updates of apps automatically but you have to manually install them from every user... Common!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was expecting I wouldn't have to baby-sit the accounts of my family members on the 2 PCs and 1 notebook we have at home but I have to manually enter the store and update the apps every time there's one available...</p>
<p>Regular users don't find the live title number of the Store enough to click on it and the updates notification&nbsp;is very hidden at the top-right of the screen in a simple and small font, I think only the geeks are able to see it and apply them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft, why don't you provide an option for auto-updating? A lot of users are losing enhancements and new functions you're adding to the apps because of that. You should update the Store and set the apps to auto-update by default.</p>

<h2>            ASUS eeepc Won&#39;t boot in normal or safe mode, BlueScreen flash, automatic startup failure</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I am not a newbie to computers, but unfortunately I have no idea how to solve this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love my Asus eeepc. I have a new HP with Windows 10, (which I love more!) but the Asus has always been with me. I got it in 2011, and about three years later an error message appeared at boot, saying that bootmgr was missing. We took it to a computer repair
 shop, so they had to format everything, and now I don't have the F9 option to reset the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the computer starts up, but only stays on the desktop for 5 minutes before a blue screen appears saying that an important program terminated or exited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time I start up, it begins to load, saying "Starting Windows" but then a blue screen appears saying UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME and tells me to start in safe mode. I start in safe mode, but then it crashes saying a program exited and to uninstall it or
 it says #hs is missing from your computer. Any ideas? I do not have any system I=image and no restore points, and it's really annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can load the Windows install with command prompt, with X:\setup, but it says no devices found. I think I messed up on the boot from USB thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I have some help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter if I lose everything, there is hardly anything on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You did&nbsp;not say which version of Windows you have so I will post Windows&nbsp;10 <br />
though&nbsp;7 &amp; 8/8.1 are very similar.<br />
<br />
Start - Settings - System - Notifications &amp; Actions - Select which icons appear on<br />
the taskbar .make sure Volume is on - if already on Click OFF then back On. On<br />
the Taskbar near the clock lower right click the little up arrow and make sure the<br />
volume icon is not hidden.<br />

<p>*Restoring with system image</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I finally booted from a USB drive and now it has reinstalled windows. The resolution is stuck at 800x600 and it has no network driver. I have downloaded a media accelerator, graphics card, and network driver from Intel, so I hope it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I reinstalled windows, I used the product key that was on the sticker underneath my PC, but it says that the key was invalid for activation. I do need help with that because I do not want to use 3rd party software.</p>

</p><p>I have managed to Install the Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 3600 Series, and I tried Installing Broadcom Network adapter, but it says to connect to the router with a cable, and I don't have a cable. I downloaded Atheros WLAN Wireless Network Adapter,
 and will try and install it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, It says windows is not activated even though I have used the product key on the sticker underneath the PC. Unfortunately, I am afraid that it will disable everything before I can get internet access, otherwise I will have to do it by phone. It doesn't
 matter, But I'd like to keep things simple as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I hope it works, but at least the PC has stopped crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Will Full Version Windows 7 work on emachine El 1210</h2>
                    I have a later model emachine that I got in trouble with and can't back out.&nbsp; I attempted to do&nbsp;a restore with disks I later learned were from an older model.&nbsp; I lost everything.&nbsp; I purchased recovery disks on ebay supposedly for my model and ran them.&nbsp;
 They seemed to load all the way to the end where I got an error and I'm now back to square one.&nbsp; I am willing to purchase a full version of Windows 7 to get up and running but the cost of Windows 7 comes close to the value of the computer itself.&nbsp; My quesion:&nbsp;
 Will Windows 7 (32-bit) work on my EL 1210-09 e-machine.&nbsp; Thanks

<h2>            Windows Vista Home Basic keeps looping and won&#39;t boot</h2>
                    
<p>Windows Vista Home Basic won't boot to welcome screen. It keeps rebooting in a loop. Tried going into safe mode but that won't boot too. Safe mode loops and go back to the startup screen.</p>
<p>I have a dell notebook and I had just restalled the OS. I had Windows Update set to automatic&nbsp;download and install. PC worked great until the next day (after the time set for automatic updates). I am assuming that the started after some Windows Updates where
 installed. Unfortunately, I can't get into Windows neither by Normal nor Safe Mode.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 and USB 3 docking bay device - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 and USB 3 docking bay device</h2>
                    <p>Hey Guys &amp; Gals,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a computer crash and had to reinstall windows I tried multiple time and then took it to the shop as I could not manage to do it right.<br />
I am running Windows 8.1 64bit and the reinstall is only a few weeks old.<br />
<br />
Today I connected my usb3 docking bay to my system and put a new hard drive in it.<br />
I opened computer management and initialized the drive I picked gpt and simple partition and it tried to format and failed.<br />
i tried multiple time and it just wont work I got a western digital tool and erased the drive to start fresh.<br />
I then tried again and did same steps and it failed again. So i used WD tool again a erased the drive again.<br />
this time I tried mbr and not gpt and then tried again and the format fails within seconds again.<br />
I spent 2 hours trying and i just cant get it to work.<br />
I know i am doing it right as it worked on old system fine but the reinstall somehow has stopped it from working.<br />
<br />
I thought maybe format tool was broken but i could format a dvd and blu-ray fine as i tried to be safe and formatted a usb.<br />
<br />
I thought i had a bad drive so i got a different one and had same problem I could initialize it and pick simple partition but it fails to format.<br />
The one drive was 1TB one was WD blue and other was 2tb green.<br />
<br />
I thought maybe the docking bay was screwing up so I stuck some drives that have stuff on them in the docking bay and they were able to be accessed fine and was able to transfer on and off the drives.<br />
<br />
So I thought maybe a windows file was corrupt so I restarted in safe mode with command prompt and ran sfc /scannow and no problems were found.<br />
So I restarted and logged into system and then opened a elevated command prompt and ran sfc /scannow again and it found no trouble.<br />
<br />
I then tried to format new drives again and they failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there is an error and it says the following:<br />
"Virtual Disk Manager The format did not complete successfully."<br />
It then opens a new Microsoft windows format tab that says "You need to format the disk in drive P: before you can use it. Do you want to format it?"<br />
<br />
If I choose yes and it fails again.<br />
<br />
I have run sfc /scannow from troubleshooting boot and it finds nothing wrong.<br />
I alse ran it from elevated command prompt on reboot.<br />
I ran a dism repair command that microsoft told me to run and that did not help.<br />
I ran chkdsk /f c: and that did not help.<br />
I went to device manager and right clicked all usb's listed and hit update driver which one item updated to better driver.<br />
i opened bios and made sure xchi was enabled and it was/is enabled.<br />
<br />
<br />
On my pc I can open drives fine from the unit and put stuff on it or take stuff off it.<br />
It just simply wont allow a drive to be formatted by windows and i tried many drives since i posted my first post in the thread..<br />
<br />
I can initialize drives fine it is just trying to make a partition and format it fails on my pc.
<br />
The unit works on another computer running windows 7.<br />
</p>
<p>Is there some way to find out what is causing the issue and to fix it?<br />
It does not make sense to me as windows had just been reinstalled lately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Fred</p>

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to help you with your concern about your Windows 8.1 and USB 3 docking bay device, kindly answer the following questions first:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the docking device that you have? </li><li>Have you checked for the docking device's compatibility to Windows 8.1? </li><li>Have you tried running the Windows update while the docking station is connected to your Windows 8.1? Did it prompt you that docking device's driver needs updating?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the fast reply to my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The item is an Enermax EB311SC it is a 2 bay docking station using USB 3.</p>
<p>The bay worked before and is compatible.</p>
<p>No iu have not tried running windows update with the docking bay on with drive inserted. (But I will asap).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a computer crash about 3 weeks ago and had to have a computer store reinstall windows for me.</p>
<p>The docking bay was working fine before the crash.</p>
<p>I moved docking bay to another pc to test and it works fine on other computers.</p>
<p>I have also checked bios settings and XHCI is enabled and the EHCI is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current system has 5 internal devices 1sdd, 2hdd and a dvd and blu-ray drive, plus the external ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my current pc I can read and write to hdd's in the docking station fine but if i want to add a new drive and format it using the bay it fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I will add this note for you I have other usb3 devices that work fine cant format with them. One of the items is an external 4 HDD unit using usb 3 the drives are all used fine and I have not need to format using the 4 bay enclosure as it has working
 drives in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I ran Windows update with docking back connected and on and no updates were listed.</p>
<p>As Always I&nbsp; can see the docking bay drive in Computer Management under storage.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2nd Edit:&nbsp; Besides trying her on Microsoft I also posted at this web address&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; https://www.sysnative.com/forums/windows-8-windows-rt/24224-w8-1-x64-format-issue-hdds-works-usb-dvd-blu-ray-discs.html#post201345</p>
<p>On this site I included pictures so you can see all the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for responding Fred. For us to be able to drill down to the real cause of the issue, we just want to verify the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have your tried connecting the drives directly to your computer without the docking bay and check if you will be able to format them?</li><li>You have mentioned that you moved the docking bay to another PC to try it, were you able to format those drives on that other computer?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I can format them.</p>
<p>If I take them off USB 3 and put docking bays on USB 2 they format and work fine.</p>
<p>If I put them directly on sata connection they format fine.</p>
<p>Yes the drives format fine on other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will add the issue is combined with another issue thou I dont know how.</p>
<p>My 2 esata ports have ability to multiply and that worked fine until I had to reinstall windows.</p>
<p>Now the esata ports only see 1 drive out of each 4 bay unit where before each esata would see 4 per port..</p>
<p>And the USB 3 wont format hdd and ssd drives but can read and write to them fine as long as drives are formatted.</p>
<p>And they will format usb sticks fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now I have a question or two for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Inside my Bios there is an OS setting that is set to other but there is a Windows 8 Setting. So can that be part of the cause?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If it could be the cause would it be safe to switch it to windows 8 or would I have to reinstall windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) On gigabyte there are chipset drivers and I used them as well as ones on dvd, but I see AMD has newer chipset drivers. So If i tried to install the latest chipset drivers from AMD and not mobo site could that fix issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) If I did install latest AMD chipset drivers would I need to reinstall windows or would windows still work if I tried?</p>
<p>And if I tired them and they did not work and I wanted to go back to original mobo drivers would system restore work to go back to old ones?</p>
<p>Or would I need to do a fresh install of windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Last question for now, If I were to buy some esata cards and some usb 3 cards and install them would windows try to assign same drivers as now and would the new cards work or would I still have same issue as now with the new cards?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Fred</p>

</p><p>Thank you for prompt response. Any changes implemented in the BIOS should be consulted to the computer manufacturer. You may contact them to get the most accurate answer to these types of questions. You may also choose to post these inquiries into our next
 level forum called <strong>Microsoft TechNet</strong>. We have IT professionals and software developers who are the prominent audience on this forum. Concerns about the BIOS is beyond the support scope of the Community forum since topics discussed here are

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke to them and they say leave settings as is now.</p>
<p>So do you at Microsoft have any clue why the usb 3 ports will not work correctly now after the reinstall of Windows?</p>
<p>Also why now the esata ports dont work correctly as they did before?</p>
<p>As per my last message the issues at hand have only been an issue since having to reinstall Windows.</p>

<p>Hey Jesrael Bor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I contactd the pc maker again and finally got a tech who remembers my systems default build as they made lots of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems according to them that the bios setting for OS must be set for Windows 8 or 8.1 and not left at other os which is where it is now. and that that is the reason behind my issues.</p>
<p>What they can't is if it is safe to switch without needing to reinstall Windows again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Since You make the OS I was told to ask you is it safe to switch it fromt he other os setting to windows 8 setting?</p>
<p>They say it could screw up the Current windows install but they do not know for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Backup&#47;Restore Startmenu Layout, Icons, Titles&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,<br />
Im about to find a way to Backup and Restore the Win10 Startmenu Icons and Layout since.... dont now... the Release of Win10?!<br />
<br />
Overall i do <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> find any usefull Informations about that except "It is not working"<br />
But this Answer is not really satisfying to me ;)<br />
There must be a way to do that becasue the Laysout must be saved anywhere!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some answers are:</p>
<p>Backup/Restore</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(79, 79, 79, 1)">C:\Users\&lt;USERNAME&gt;\AppData\Local\TitleDataLayer\Databae</span></p>
<p>while logged in with Build in Administrator Account and restore it after New Installation.<br />
This way seems to be outdated!<br />
</p>
<p>Some other:</p>
<p>Backup/Restore</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(79, 79, 79, 1)">%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\appsFolder.menu.itemdata-ms</span></p>
<p>This also seems to be outdated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also some Powershell commands:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(79, 79, 79, 1)">Export-StartLayout -Path C:\StartLayout.xml</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(79, 79, 79, 1)">Import-StartLayout -LayoutPath C:\StartLayout.xml -MountPath C:\</span>Are
 not working properly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...</p>
<p>Where is a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>working</strong></em></span> methode to Backup/Restore all the Startmenu Titles?</p>
<p />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way to backing up/restoring Start menu layout, icons, or titles is the first option you mentioned and upon replicating the process, it still works. We would like to know if you have tried it already.</p>

    <title>O IPv6 no meu roteador sempre deixa de funcionar. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidsonribeiro  say:</h3>
<h2>            O IPv6 no meu roteador sempre deixa de funcionar.</h2>
                    <p>Boa tarde, gente!</p>
<p>Estou tendo uma enorme dor de cabeça, no que diz respeito ao IPv6, com a minha operadora (NET VIRTUA) e consequentemente no meu roteador.</p>
<p>A NET trocou o meu modem para um mais atualizado, após eu solicitar para que o meu XBOX ONE começasse a ter a opção de usar o IPv6.</p>
<p>No primeiro dia, com o modem novo, estava tudo perfeito. O roteador funcionando normalmente IPv4 e IPv6 e com isso o XBOX tambem rodando com IPv4 &amp; Ipv6. Mas uns 2 dias depois, este "novo modem" já não estava mais "reconhecendo o IPV6" (sou leigo neste assunto, então me desculpem algumas palavras ou expressões que não soube empregá-las direito). Então fiz todo o processo que qualquer atendente da NET me pediria pra fazer: Reiniciei, Resetei etc etc etc. Sem sucesso.</p>
<p>Liguei para a NET e eles mandaram um técnico. &nbsp;O técnico realmente viu que o modem não estava reconhecendo o IPV6 &nbsp;e então fez a troca e me deu um outro modem (**** TG1692A). Aconteceu a mesma coisa. No primeiro dia funcionou perfeitamente, mas depois de 2 dias a mesma novela. Parou de reconhecer o IPv6 e, como não poderia deixar de acontecer, meu XBOX agora só funciona com o IPV4 e notei que minha conexão, quando estou jogando PES2017 online, piorou um pouco.</p>
<p>Conclusão: Vejo que o problema é de BUGG na propria NET ou de seus modens.</p>
<p>Não tenho mais paciencia de ligar para a NET pois sei que ela pode trocar 10x o modem e tenho a impressão que este problema vai continuar.</p>
<p>Alguém aí pode me ajudar???&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>[Translation:&nbsp;</strong>Good afternoon guys!</p><p>I'm having a huge headache with regard to IPv6, my carrier (NET VIRTUA) and consequently my router.<br />NET switched my modem to a more upgraded one after I asked for my XBOX ONE to start having the option to use IPv6.<br />On the first day, with the new modem, everything was perfect. The router normally runs IPv4 and IPv6 and with this XBOX also running with IPv4 &amp; Ipv6. But&nbsp;a couple of days later, this "new modem" was no longer "recognizing the IPV6" (I am a layman on this subject, so I apologize for some words or expressions that I did not know how to use them properly). Then I did the whole process that any NET attendant would ask me to do: Restart, Resetei etc etc etc. Unsuccessfully.<br />I called NET and they sent a technician. The&nbsp;technician actually saw that the modem was not recognizing the IPV6 and&nbsp;then made the switch and gave me another modem (**** TG1692A).

            <p>Actually, MRT and MSERT are two different scanners although both are distributed by Microsoft. MRT is Malicious Software Removal Tool. MSERT is Microsoft Safety Scanner. It is not automatically installed during updates. It must be manually downloaded.<br />
<br />
Clicking Start &gt; Run &gt;&nbsp; mrt.exe &gt; Ok will open Malicious Software Removal Tool on any version of Windows. MSERT is an invalid command unless you have downloaded the safety scanner.<br />

    <title>mscorsvw.exe. is causing slow boot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            mscorsvw.exe. is causing slow boot</h2>
                    <p>Origina title: .NET 4 and KB2571181 <br />
</p>
<p>Further to my previous postings, my PC took 3 minutes to boot today. When I looked at the processes, mscorsvw.exe was present. I would use the hotfix to stop this running indefinitely, but that only applies to .NET 4, and I'M NOT RUNNING .NET4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I've done a restore to 21/12/11 which is the last known 50 second boot date. Since then ther've been many Software Distributions, any one of which might have re installed mscorsvw.exe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOW DO I STOP THIS PROGRAM FROM RUNNING? Even deleting it from the system didn't work as it re installed !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><b>Hi</b></p>
<p><b>mscorsvw.exe is</b> precompiling .NET assemblies in the background. Once it's done, it will go away. Typically, after you install the .NET Redist, it will be done with the high priority assemblies in 5 to 10 minutes and then
 will wait until your computer is idle to process the low priority assemblies. Once it does that it will shut down and you won't see mscorsvw.exe.</p>
<p>To disable the service</p>

</span></span></span>Click on <span>&nbsp;</span>start, select run</p>

<h2>            Retail windows XP to windows 8.1 to windows 10.</h2>
                    I originally installed a copy of windows XP retail just prior to the upgrade to windows 8.&nbsp; I paid to upgrade to windows 8/8.1 and then took advantage of the free upgrade to windows 10 pro.&nbsp; My question then is since the original XP was retail can I move
 my current copy of windows 10 pro to another computer?

            You can change hardware including motherboard but there is nothing provided to change the WIndows 10 Digital License to an entirely new PC.  
<br />
<br />What I would do is transfer by image or Clean Install Windows 10 to the new PC and then activate with the Windows 8.1 retail Product Key in Activation Settings while this method of fresh activating Windows 10 is still in an extended Grace Period.  This is likely to end on January 1st, but I wouldnt' waste any time as it's two years past the free Upgrade period now.  
<br />
<br />Other methods active until Jan 1st here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/download-windows-10-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/download-windo...</a>

            To the best of my knowledge yes you should be able to do that. The original license was Retail, all of the upgrades inherit the retail license rights, including the right to transfer to new hardware.
<br />
<br />How you are going to do the transfer to the new hardware is a different question. One I hope that Greg can address. I suspect you'll find that you can't actually install XP on the new hardware. 
<br />
<br />I agree with Greg, you should do this immediately to figure out what you need to do to make it work before the free upgrade period is over.

            I have found the solution. I uninstalled the unknown device from device manager. Then I deleted the bthport using cmd (administrator). Then using device manager I scanned for hardware changes and windows automatically detected the Bluetooth and installed
 the driver itself. But i want to know what was the main issue.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am glad to know that you were able to resolve the issue by yourself. This will help other community members facing the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main reason for this issue seems to be due to Bluetooth driver file or folder corruption.</p>

<p>Creo que hubo un mal entendido o yo entendi mal tu duda, de igual manera te contesto a lo que yo te entendi:</p>
<p>si tienes una cuenta de pay pal y la quieres agregar, pero solo te da opcion de agregar una tarjeta de credito??</p>
<p>intenta agregarla desde la pagina de xbox.com en el menu de mi cuenta en pago y facturacion y dale click en agregar</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>tarjeta de credito es la unica opcion que muestra pero aun asi te acepta, debito o cuenta pay pal..</p>

<p>espero haberte ayudado Saludos!</p>

<p>Sin duda alguna hay sitio en la que te pide que este confirmada tu cuenta de paypal, ya que para cobrarlo necesitas anclar una targeta de credito.</p>
<p>Si para depositar dinero tienes problemas existe varios métodos para ganar dinero en internet. puedes encontrar en :</p>

<h2>            0x80073D05 while trying to install the xbox app</h2>
                    <p>For some unknown reason whenever I opened the Xbox app it immediately crashes, so I tried uninstalling with a powershell command, then reinstalling. Reinstalling always fails with this error:</p>
<p>

<li>I have tried running WSRESET</li><li>I have run SFC /scannow</li><li>I have attempted to delete the xbox app folder in &lt;user&gt;/appdata/local/packages but have no privileges (even with TakeOwnership reg tool)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>All other apps are fine, I can install new ones just fine, and I've even installed the xbox (beta) app, though I don't know if it's appropriate to use this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This issue could be caused due to some incorrect settings or due to some corrupt app files. I would suggest you to try these methods and check:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 1:</strong>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>First, I would suggest you to reset the Windows store cache and then check if you are able to install the app. When you reset the Windows store cache, it deletes all temporary Windows store files

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If resetting the Windows store cache didn’t help, then I would suggest you to manually check if the Windows store service and the Windows update services are running. Refer to these steps:</span></span></span></p>

            <p>As I mentioned in my post, I've already tried Method 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The services are already running, I even tried restarting them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm only using Windows defender at this time, I have no software running that could be potentially causing this.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Like I said every other app, and the entirety of the Windows Store is fully functional, it's "only" the Xbox app that can't be installed correctly. I think some files left over by the Xbox app are corrupted which is why it can't be installed/run correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the folder:</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;name&gt;\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.XboxApp_*</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a single folder called "LocalState" and nothing else. I have no access to this folder and I cannot delete it, even with the TakeOwnership technique (using takeown and icacls commands in CMD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every other functional app has this "LocalState" folder but I can access all of them, so it definitely seems like this corrupted folder in the Xbox app may be the issue?</p>

<div>What is the extension of the file (the characters at the end of the</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To open any file, you have to have installed an appropriate program</div>
<div>for it. In all probability, you don't have it for this kind of file.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also be aware that attachments are very risky. You often see advice</div>
<div>not to open attachments from people you don't know. I think that</div>
<div>that's one of the most dangerous pieces of advice you see around,</div>
<div>because it implies that it's safe to do the opposite--open attachments</div>
<div>from friends and relatives. But many viruses spread by sending</div>
<div>themselves to everyone in the infected party's address book, so</div>
<div>attachments received from friends are perhaps the *most* risky to</div>
<div>open.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Even if the attachment legitimately comes from a friend, it can</div>
<div>contain a virus. I'm not suggesting that a friend is likely to send</div>
<div>you a virus on purpose, but if the friend is infected without</div>
<div>realizing it, any attachment he sends you is likely to also be</div>
<div>infected.</div>

<h2>            Windows 8 crashes after every sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hi, <br />
I am encountering windows 8 (32/en) crashing with restart &amp; minidump on every Sleep (HP 8440p notebook), sometimes also on startup. Windbg
</p>
<p>analysis says it is probably caused by qcusbnethp2k.sys. This is Gobi 2000 un2420 Broadband module driver provided by
</p>
<p>HP.<br />
Any ideas how to get rid of this issue?<br />
Thanks, S.</p>

            <p>The error does appear to be from the qcusbnethp2k.sys with no other third party driver involved in the crash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may be from a "corrupted" driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I might suggest is to uninstall the driver for the module using "Uninstall a program".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then install the driver from the following link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;softwareitem=ob-90426-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;softwareitem=ob-90426-1</a></p>

<p>This is the driver that HP has posted <a href="http://h30094.www3.hp.com/product/sku/10229411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> for the device.</p>

            <p>Thank you for reply.</p>
<p>I tried what you proposed (however, did you notice you've proposed to install older driver than it is available? You've proposed to install 1.1.190.0 dated 2010-12-03, I have had installed 1.1.240.0&nbsp;released 13 May 2011 before). Nevertheless I tried to install
 what you've suggested (driver works, modem connects),&nbsp;but still no change, same restarts occur on every sleep.</p>

            <p>Sometimes an older driver works better than a newer driver but in&nbsp;this case the problem appears to be the same.</p>

<p>Can you provide the minidump files from the crashes since changing the driver?</p>

            <p>I could not find a newer driver for the GOBI2000&nbsp;than 1.1.240.0&nbsp;released 13 May 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error may not be Operating System specific as similar errors have been reported such as in the following thread for Windows 7:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing you could try is to un-check "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" under the "Power Management" tab, as a workaround.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem may be a driver configuration issue which, if the case, may be helped by a "Refresh".

    <title>Can&#39;t enable dual display function on windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m_h2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t enable dual display function on windows 7</h2>
                    I upgraded my Samsung Q210 laptop from vista to Windows 7 but now I can't get the dual display working in order&nbsp;to use my projector. Previously when I had vista I would right click the screen... drop down menu... then click Nvidia control panel... the
 screen resolution would change and the projector would show the image. Now I have windows 7&nbsp;the Nvidia panel is no longer there.&nbsp;I've tried opening the display then screen resolution panel. I hit detect and identify but it only identify's the one monitor.
 No matter what I do I can't get it to recognise any external monitor or projector. I tried downloading driver updates but it says I have an up to date driver for my VGA card which it says is a standard VGA graphics adaptor..chip type nvidia.....&nbsp; appreciate
 any sugestions on what to do<br />

            That last line there tells me you are missing a graphics driver. You'll need to install the graphics card's driver in order to get it to output to 2 monitors. Please post the hardware ID for the graphics card, as samsung can't tell me which card you have... (go to control panel-&gt;system-&gt;click device manager link on left-&gt;find your vga card, shouldbe under display adapters-&gt;right click it, select properties-&gt;click detals tab, select hardware id in dropdown box-&gt;post hardware id here)&nbsp; My"> favorite threads | Computer tips
