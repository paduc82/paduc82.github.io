            I'm having the exact same issues only a little different. I was initially able to set up the account and it was great for about 5 days then just suddenly stopped syncing. I tried resetting the account and still didn't work so I tried removing and adding
 back the account but when i tried to add the account i get the message in the screenshot. I can add my other gmail account no problem so i'm really confused as to why it's not working for the original account. I loved the app for the short time i got to use
 it and would rather use it than the gmail app, but right now i've got no choice. PLEASE HELP FIX THIS!

<p>Gmail has recently stopped working with the Outlook App.&nbsp; Judging by the number of times Google tells me to install the Gmail App, I'm guessing they're stopping 3rd party support in order to drive more revenue.&nbsp; I plan on signing up for a new email address
 under Outlook.com and migrate my contacts to the new service.</p>

<p>Hi guys i had the same problem today while setting up an google email for a coworker in outlook mobile.&nbsp; Spent hours w google support and ended up figuring up myself on how to do this&nbsp; :) Good for me and all of you :) here is what i did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step1 try to add an account even if you already know it will not work :) be positive :)</p>
<p>Step 2 give the proper permissions</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7a6ec5b-ea28-4c28-9b7e-0f1fd9c5e09d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7a6ec5b-ea28-4c28-9b7e-0f1fd9c5e09d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Step 3 close the error message and do not do nothing.&nbsp; wait. be patient!</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e42e09d-a1ca-437c-a7af-6520521e9531?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e42e09d-a1ca-437c-a7af-6520521e9531?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Step 4 amazingly this button will show up out of nothing "Setup Account Manually" click in it! this is your salvation! :)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f443b973-6eda-4a66-8866-beadc8d14d38?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f443b973-6eda-4a66-8866-beadc8d14d38?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Step 5 go all the way in the bottom and add your account with "IMAP" only.&nbsp; I tried the others google and etc but IT DOES NOT WORK. Dont waste your time.&nbsp; I already did that for you. :)&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9976576-7430-4cec-936d-4d217bdcbf15?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9976576-7430-4cec-936d-4d217bdcbf15?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Step 6 add your credentials all the way using advance settings&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and voilá! it works :) hope it will work for you too and let me know if it did :)&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>Smart Dual SIM</u></a> is a feature introduced with the MediaTek based phones like the Nokia 220 Dual-SIM and Nokia 225 Dual-SIM. It allows you to create
 call-forwarding rules from SIM1 to SIM2, or from SIM2 to SIM1, or both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is standard GSM call-forwarding and call waiting services. According to my own tests, this does not happen on a per-call basis but statically once. It got called ‘smart’ because the phone tries to read your numbers from your SIM (might fail) and offers
 a one button click for that. Furthermore, because this are standard GSM services:</p>
<ul>
<li>it does not work if one of your SIMs does not offer these services</li><li>you are able to do the same with a Nokia 208 manually.</li></ul>
<p>Creating such a call-forwarding reduces the issues involved with a Dual-Standby handset because with this no number is blocked when one number is active. On the opposite, with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_SIM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>Dual Active</u></a> phone, both SIM are registered all times and therefore directly available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, both Nokia 20x and Nokia 22x are Dual-Standby. The Nokia Series 40 and therefore the Nokia 20x offers switching of SIM2 without removing the battery: Nokia calls that ‘Easy Swap’. The Nokia 22x does not allow that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did that answer your question? As explained before, please, consider the Nokia 208!</p>

<p>Sorry for bothering you again. My situation is that by the first SIM (SIM 1) I will only receive calls. By the second SIM (SIM 2) I will now and then call to selected phone numbers and after the call I will immediately return to SIM 1 to wait new coming
 calls. Thus the SIM 1 is the "default" SIM. I want to compare the phone models, which one is the easiest in use and the quickest in switching between the SIMs. For example, how many buttons I have to use in switching between the SIMs?</p>

            Sorry for hijacking the topic, but I have a very similar question. In short, I need the simplest and cheapest phone that accepts 2 SIMs in a way that:<br />
<br />
1. both are simultaneously active and registered to their respective (different) networks all the time the phone is on<br />
<br />
2. a default SIM for placing outgoing calls can be set<br />
<br />
3. if a call is active on either of the two SIMs, and the other one receives an incoming call at the same time, the caller should receive a busy signal or something similar<br />
<br />
Besides this, the only other features that are important to me are SyncML and Bluetooth (for handsfree talking and address book syncing with computer).<br />
<br />
(I must say that I've read Abi99 post very carefully several times, but still don't understand what this-or-that feature means exactly. :( )

<p>With both phones, if there is no active call (or data transmission) both SIM are able to receive calls:
<strong>Dual SIM Standby</strong>. Optionally, with both phones, you are able to select one SIM for making calls in general:<br />
A) Nokia 225 » Settings » Connectivity » Dual SIM » Call » Always ask » Off<br />
B) Nokia 208 » SIM manager » SIM » Call<br />
A one-time setup, no keys involved.</p>

<p>Not available in MediaTek (108, 220, 225), or Asha Software Platform (230, 50x), or Nokia X platform (Android). Therefore you have to go for a Nokia Series 40. I recommend one with a USB port and UMTS because otherwise you end-up with a dual-band phone which
 does not work accross the ocean (USA or vice versa). There, <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?idMaker=1&amp;idDualSIM=3&amp;idBluetooth=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Thank you. Would it be safe to assume then that *all* Nokia dual sim phones work like that? For instance, even such a simple model as 108 dual sim?

            On the other hand, you can just use simple date arithmetic:<br />
<br />
INT([EndDate]) - INT([StartDate])<br />
<br />
The Int function caters for the possibility of a value containing a non-zero time of day, something you cannot discount with complete confidence unless specific provision has been made in the table definition to disallow such values.

<br />
Not without going to a lot of trouble writing your own functions.&nbsp; Realistically, you will need to call the DateDiff function for other intervals.<br />
<br />
I've no idea why you are getting the error.&nbsp; It might help if you were to copy the query's SQL statement and post it here.&nbsp; It may be that the error is not in the function call per se, but in the query, arising from some other error in it.<br />
<br />
You might also try pasting the following into the debug (aka immediate) window (Press Ctrl-G to open it)<br />
<br />
? DateDiff("d",#2013-07-01#, #2013-07-10#)<br />
<br />
It should return 9.&nbsp; If so it will at least show it is possible to call the function successfully.&nbsp; Then try a very simple query:<br />
<br />
SELECT DateDiff("d",[StartDate],[EndDate]) AS Duration<br />
FROM [YourTableNameGoesHere];<br />
<br />
to see what happens.<br />

            <p>Hi Ken</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thabnks for your help. </p>
<p>So far I have established that when I type the function into a query I get repeated errors as already mentioned. However if I go to SQL view and type the function in
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>test: DateDiff("m".[enddate].[startdate])</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get the correct result. In SQL View I can change the call from "d" to "m" to "y" and again I get the correct result. If however I flick back to design view and alter "d" to say "m" an error occours and the only remedy is to delete the function and start
 again by writing it in SQL view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible there is somthing wrong with my setup? </p>

After the error and changing nothing, did you switch to SQL View to see what it looked like there?

            <p>I encountered the same error: DateDiff reporting an error when the syntax was correct. The fix for me was to make sure the modules would all compile, using Debug | Compile. I had overlooked adding PtrSafe to a Declare statement, completely unrelated to the
 DateDiff, but after I got a clean compile, DateDiff would work, too.</p>

    <title>Nokia X6-00 Connection Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew1210  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia X6-00 Connection Issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I've owned a Nokia X6 for past year, and have had a "so-so" experience, but have been generally happy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, after the last firmware upgrade to v.32.0...... &nbsp; I've had an issue that I can't seem to solve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm on O2 Pay &amp; Go and have unlimited data in my plan. &nbsp;This has worked seamlessly until the update. &nbsp;Now, all my apps that use the internet connection are unable to connect. &nbsp;Nokia's ovi store/maps/web browser/email music etc. and Opera Mini are fine and
 can connect to the 2G/3G/3.5G bit none of my other apps can, for example, fMobi (great app I must add), Snaptu, Sky Mobile etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything including all my apps work fine on Wi-Fi, just not the category I highlighted above, on the GPRS.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've checked my settings as I thought it was a permissions issue, but the connection is set to "automatically" &nbsp;I even deleted and reentered the settings, to no avail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi, yeah, but no luck, I had to flash the device last week as it developed a problem where immediately after startup, the screen would "dissolve" and the phone was very laggy as if there was not enough RAM, even though nothing was running. Anyway, the
 apps worked again, until the firmware updated.<br />
<br />
I would just leave it on the old firmware, but the original factory release was quite 'buggy'

            Here is one worth trying, do several back ups (one complete and one complete but without saving the Settings) Then you can try totally wiping and formatting the phone but when you reinstall your back up use the one without settings, they often re-break
 what you just fixed by using the old, now broken, settings. Worth a go if you got nothing better to be doing. :)

            Never thought of that, will give it a try, nothing to lose if it's backed up :)<br />
<br />
I not too sure about the X6 overall, I WANT to like the phone, but it's the wee daft things that are putting me off, like a "wobbly back cover" loose battery (which my friends also does) and for some reason, Nokia are removing more and more apps for it from
 the Ovi Store :(<br />
<br />
Thanks again, will report back

            To insert any field, you must press <strong>Ctrl+F9</strong> to insert the field delimiters (which look like braces but can't be typed from the keyboard). Another way to insert the DATE field with the default formatting is to press
<strong>Alt+Shift+D</strong>.

</span></span></strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would first suggest you to
<strong>remove all external devices connected </strong>to the computer except essential devices like keyboard and mouse and then boot the computer and check.</span></span></span></p>

</span></span></strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If the above steps didn’t help, I would suggest you to
<strong>disable any third party antivirus programs </strong>(if installed). Third party antivirus programs and firewalls can interfere with installation process. Hence disable any third party software installed temporarily. Now, try to install and check.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Hi Jackson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you try add it to the Quick Access Toolbar: Click File tab&gt; Options&gt; Choose Quick Access Toolbar&gt;then click the drop down button under Choose commands from and look for All Commands&gt; Now look for Browse Office Store, and then click Add&gt;&gt;Once
 done click OK.</p>
Now check if the Store is at the top left of your Outlook app.

<p>If not, please share the following information with me to further analyze:</p>
<p>1. A screenshot showing "I see the icon (on the right under "Home")".</p>
<p>2. A screenshot by clicking "File" as the image below shows.</p>

<h2>            Mass deleting emails in Outlook 2016 specifically</h2>
                    <p>I have about 30-40,000 emails to deal with in my two accounts in Outlook 2016 software on my laptop or online (since they sync) and want to mass delete everything older than a year.&nbsp; One of the accounts is archiving everything older than a year, but I'd
 like to clean that up, also.&nbsp; What is the absolute fastest way to do this?&nbsp; The answers for previous versions have not helped, as 2016 tool bars look different.&nbsp; Can you please help?</p>

            <p>I'd much prefer to get them off of my computer. Is there really no way to do this or a work-around of some kind? I suppose I don't really understand how archiving is different than just putting them in a folder in the hard drive. Would appreciate the insight
 and any additional ideas from anyone.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My Password is going crazy &#40;Correct then incorrect&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>My Pc working on Windows 10 is having an issue quite uncommon:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My password, when my laptop launch, reboot after an update, is correct (I can access to my account, folders...).</p>
<p>BUT when I try to put my password anywhere else, Windows indicates to me that my password is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>I assume that when you create a new email, the email is left aligned, which is normal.</p>
<p>When replying to a new, the signature is right aligned. What about the condition after you sending the email out?</p>
<p>Please share with us a related screenshot. To upload the screenshot in the forum, please click&nbsp;<b>Use rich formatting</b> and then the<b> Insert/Edit Media</b> icon.</p>
<p>I’d like to collect the following information as for a better understanding of the whole situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the issue occur every time you reply to an email? </li><li>Did outlook work well before? </li><li>How about <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OWA</a> (Outlook Web App)? This can help us narrow down whether the issue is related to the account.
</li><li>Is the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-off-HTML-formatting-151af866-418b-4aab-bba1-61f79482ff0f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
email message in HTML or plain text format</a>? What about changing to another format?
</li><li>Does the issue occur to other users? &nbsp; </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;If there’re some users not encountering the issue, we suggest you set up your account in their Mac to perform a test.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook&nbsp;</p>

<p>It happens sometimes but I think I found a work around. &nbsp;I copied the signature out of Outlook 2016 for Mac, and into Word 2016 for Mac. &nbsp;There I center justified, and then clicked left justified, copied it back into Outlook, and so far so good.</p>

<h2>            Word crashes when opening doc&#39;s based on a template</h2>
                    <p>We have always created templates for enterprise wide use but lately our users on Office 365 cannot open documents based on the company letterhead.&nbsp; They only way they can do this is before it crashes they have to enter ESC and re open the document.&nbsp; It seems
 to be an issue with&nbsp;Word &gt; Properties &gt; Template's title or location.&nbsp;The templates were created in Office 2010 and 2013, now we are moving over to Office 2016 but our companies are on various office suites from O365, 2010, 2013 and 2016.&nbsp; Why is this happening?&nbsp;
 We require a permanent fix as now documents being sent externally for review are also affected.</p>

    <title>Windows Defender Deleted My Steam and games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> og frost  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender Deleted My Steam and games</h2>
                    I don't know why but Window defender decided to think that my Steam is a virus and removed it, I can not launch the app or any games, it says that Steam might be containing virus at first and now it says cant find it since it's deleted, this is frustrating
 since i have a lot of games installed and I have to install everything again.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows Defender is detecting that Steam might contain a virus, you may add an exclusion so that when you reinstall it, you can avoid getting an alert and it will not block the program. To do that, kindly refer to the article below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/64495205-6ddb-4da1-8534-1aeaf64c0af8/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-defender" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add an exclusion to Windows Defender</a></strong></p>

            <p>Similar issue with a clean install of Win10 Home with 1703 update.&nbsp; When I was downloading my games from Steam, Defender said that one of the .exe files was a Trojan:&nbsp; Win32:Trojan-gen</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the game inside the Steam client and downloaded it again with no issues from Defender...very strange behavior.</p>

    <title>OneNote&#58; sign and send a document - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OneNote&#58; sign and send a document</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A common scenario: I receive a pdf file with a document I need to sign and send back as an electronic copy. Of course I can print, sign, scan and send it back but having MS Surface Pro and One Note I want to do it without paper. So I open a pdf file and
 print it to one note. It creates a new page with a printout. Then I sign and export it back to pdf. But the problem is: the page created has fields, it is not completely filled by a printout. So the question: it is possible to print to one note so that it
 keeps pages size and layout when printing or exporting the result?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Sync theme files</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have many of my office files in Office 365 OneDrive, so that I can work on them at work and at home.&nbsp; I have a theme I'd like to be able to sync:&nbsp; "Class, black.thmx" for some PowerPoint work (I'm a teacher). Can that be done?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Perhaps the entire "Templates" directory (under C:\Users\thisuser\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft) could be synced, then, on the other computers where I work, set the synced folder to be a "Trusted Location", but I don't see how to set this folder to be used for
 templates on other computers.</p>

<p>hi christopher king,</p>
<p>thanks for your update.</p>
<p>for “<em>i'd like to be able to sync:&nbsp; "class, black.thmx" for some powerpoint work (i'm a teacher). can that be done?</em> ”, yes, we can sync the .thmx files in our onedrive for business.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=023fc1f1-6946-41f3-9dc4-73076ebc365a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d023fc1f1-6946-41f3-9dc4-73076ebc365a" /></a></p>
<p>for “ <em>i think the issue is what folder to put it in, and how to get office 2013 (or 2016) to recognize it</em>.”, you can create a specific folder which used to save .thmx files. and for recognizing them, do you mean the following?(if not, please update
 us with some more detailed information)<br />
for .thmx files, we can see it in a folder like below:</p>

<p>for ppt files, we can see it in a folder like below.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>A few weeks ago my phone was returned from the B2X repair channel. The main "board" had been replaced. I have now checked it with the various WiFi connections I mention in my other posts. The phone seems to be working with all of these including those running
 WPA2.</p>
<p>Now happy and will leave you chaps in peace until I get annoyed with trying to sort my contacts out.</p>

</p><p>Hi Debra,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><em>Unfortunately for Tablet &amp; Surfaces, Since windows 8 &amp; 8.1 comes with Office Home &amp; Student 2013 RT preinstalled hence there would not be any instance that the RT version can be removed and then loaded with office 365 since they
 both work on a different platform all together. RT works on ARM processor whereas OFFICE 365 works on an Intel or AMD processor. In order to use office 365 you should either have a windows or a MAC mobile phone else you should have Laptop / Desktop which has
 windows 7 / 8 since Office 365 or Office 2013 is only supported on windows 7 &amp; 8 and not on Windows Vista or XP.</em></p>

            <p>Thank you for your quick reply. If you would indulge me a little more clarification, I would be greatly appreciative, as I am trying to sort through the various platforms, applications, etc. My original question stemmed from viewing an ASUS Transformer which
 has an Intel processor, but has MS Office &amp; Student 2013 pre-installed. Your reply said that "RT" runs on ARM and 365 runs on an Intel or AMD processor. I don't know if the difference here is "RT" or not. Please help me understand. Is RT and Office &amp; Student
 2013 terms that are used interchangeably or are they different?

</p><p>Dear Debra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to see that this is a laptop so on this you can certainly use Office H&amp;S 2013 instead of RT. Since Office H&amp;S 2013 is preinstalled and if you wanna use office 365, you can remove it and install Office 365 after you purchase. All you require is
 a Microsft account and you can install it by going to office.com/myaccount after redeeming it through the website office.com/setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let me know in case of any concerns </p>

<h2>            How to avoid sending meeting cancellation when sending an update after removing invitees who have declined</h2>
                    <p>When a person declines my meeting request, the meeting is removed from their calendar and I receive the declined notification.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I then want to send an update or reminder meeting request (with no response needed) to just those who have either accepted or have not responded.</p>
<p>However, if I delete those who have declined from my updated meeting request, they are sent a meeting cancellation notice.&nbsp; This can have undesired results (e.g. the person who declined and subsequently received the meeting cancellation comments to someone
 who DID accept the meeting that the meeting has been canceled.)</p>
<p>How do I send an update or reminder to just those who have accepted or not responded, without sending cancelation notices to those I have removed?&nbsp;

                    My experience with Data Execution Prevention is that only when I click on something that requires a new window to open does it give me the error that IE has stopped working. Then the bubble at the bottom comes up about DEP. I followed all of the directions
 and honestly, don't need this security feaature as I have good anti-virus software. I need to know how to disable this or at least make it promt me by asking if it's safe for that new window to open.

Very frustrating!!<br />

            Although you can turn DEP off, I would not recommend doing so. Lets first try and solve the underlying issue.<br />
<br />
Most DEP errors are caused by faults add ons. Lets check this is the case be opening IE without any add ons and seeing if you still get the errors. To do this, please click start --&gt; all programs --&gt; accessories --&gt; system tools --&gt; Internet Explorer (no add
 ons) and try to open a new window.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your reply.

<p>http://&lt;mysite&gt;/CustomPage/_vti_bin/listdata.svc/TestAddresses?$orderby=Street_Name</p>
<p>But I also have a view on this list called TestAddresses called 'TestView'.&nbsp; How do I access the information in TestView not the 'All Items' query?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
