<h2>            Excel 2010&#58; Nearly all options are grayed out in a sheet that&#39;s not protected or shared</h2>
                    <p>Also, I haven't selected more than one sheet. I've tried all the usual tips--unsharing, unprotecting, de-selecting. I even reinstalled my 2012 Excel files, although I received an error message saying that this file could not be restored to its original location.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Microsoft Office\Microsoft Excel 2010.lnk to original location</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I</span></span>s that the problem? Please help. I have a deadline to meet, and I've spent all day just trying to get Excel to work! I have a feeling this has to do with add-ins, but having a hunch
 isn't getting me anywhere. Thanks in advance for any suggestions beyond those I've already tried. &nbsp;</p>

            Following are likely solutions.<br />
<br />
1. Please try to repair your Office as a quick fix.<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx<br />
<br />
2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name) and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files
 / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself.<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type ""? application.StartupPath"" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else.<br />
<br />
4. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck ""Run this Program as an Administrator""and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
5. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check ""Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)"". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck ""Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)"".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
6. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
7. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
8. Review the KB article - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2779852 (Excel: How to Troubleshoot Crashing and Not Responding Issues with Excel)<br />
<br />
9. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
10. File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options.<br />
<br />
11. For one person upgrading Internet Explore did the trick and for one uninstalling the windows compatibility package that was left over from a previous version of office did the job.<br />
<br />
12. If none of above works, please uninstall the current installed Office, and reinstall it again. Before resorting to uninstall, make sure that you have the license keys.<br />
<br />
To uninstall the Office, follow the instructions in the following support article: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 &amp; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179/en-us<br />
<br />

<h2>            .oft files not opening if they contain an attachment</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an issue with my outlook templates&nbsp;.oft files. I&nbsp; have Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus subscription, I am working on a PC with Windows10 and using Outlook 2016 Desktop App (version 1710 build 8626.2121 Click-to-Run).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have templates created that include attachments and they have been opening fine for years, however recently they have stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Outlook is running and I open an .oft file with an attachment,&nbsp;it opens a blank email.
</p>
<p>If Outlook is closed and I open an .oft file with an attachment, it opens perfectly with the attachments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Lyndsey Turner,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So this might be related to some
</span>add-ins in the Outlook client. Here are the steps to check which add-in is causing the problem:</p>
<p>1. Click&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>&nbsp;menu, navigate to&nbsp;<strong>Options</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Add-in</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Go</strong>&nbsp;button next to the&nbsp;<strong>Manage: Com-in Add&nbsp;</strong>field.</p>
<p>2. Clear all the checkbox of the add-ins to disable them.</p>
<p>3. Reopen the Outlook client and select the add-ins one by one to check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have any other questions about using Office 365, please let us know, we'd like to offer our further help.</span></p>

<h2>            PowerPoint cleared all data in the Presentation&#33; How restore it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Worked in Mac OS 10.13.5 used Power Point&nbsp;16.13.1 (App next)<br />
My Presentation was opened, but the&nbsp;file had an incorrect name.</p>
<p>I decided to change that name. Went to the folder and changed it.<br />
After having come back to the App it said that file was changed out the App and please save your changes to prevent loosing - I pressed OK, and choose the&nbsp;same file but with new name (in the folder wasn't ane another file only this file with new name, because
 it was the same file - in the App file name was old and in the folder was new) and it asked to rewrite - I agreed. After closing the App and opened again - there wasn't any slide, and the&nbsp;file size was 0Kb.</p>
<p>How can it be? File in the folder had 50Mb and it was only renamed. Opened file in the App was the same - the file name was changed only, and overwritten&nbsp;previous file to save with a&nbsp;new name!!!<br />
<br />
How restore it?</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this problem has been around forever but It doesn't seem to have been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created an email signature but when I create a new email, there are two (2) blank lines INSERTED ABOVE the signature. This might be OK when you create a signature that looks like this (Type 1):</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">John Doe</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">+1 4444 4444</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The 2 lines being inserted above this signature would be ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I use this type of signature (Type 2):</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Dear Jane Doe,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">How are you?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">John Doe</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">+1 4444 4444</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Two blank lines inserted above the signature is not required in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I can only assume the developers have made the assumption that signature Type 1 is what people will code - an 'actual' signature. If you use 'Type 2' to 'seed' the new email with more than just a signature, these extra two lines become a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the case (i.e the developers have made an assumption), I would suggest this be removed. If people want to add two blank lines at the start of a signature, they can (just hit 'return' twice). If the lines are not required, they are not added -
 simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, this all may be due to another issue or may well be bypassed with a setting or two (lacking in Outlook for Mac!) but it is a widely reported problem and should be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI - this is NOT 'an extra line is added into my signature body' problem - I don't have that issue. I've looked at many other 'fixes' (e.g. copy from Word to TextEdit and back to Outlook) but none work or fit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, being able to position the cursor would be advantageous too....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ms/Mr Microsoft Community Member, what do you think?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, vilro</p>

<p>Hello vilro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post in forum. Regarding your description, for two black line in email signature, the another option is at the time of composing new email, after inserting email signature &gt; select whole email signature part &gt; right click on it &gt; select
<strong>Paragraph</strong> option &gt; under <strong>Spacing</strong> option set "<strong>0</strong>" in "<strong>Before</strong>" and "<strong>After</strong>" option &gt; click on
<strong>Ok</strong>. The space will remove from the email signature.</p>

<h2>            Images are not auto-sized when pasting into OneNote</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am facing a very strange issue with OneNote in the past few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically, when I paste an image into OneNote, it actually gets auto-sized to fit into the available screen-space. I can always right-click on the image and select "Restore Original Size" to view the image in its original large size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, from the past week or so, when I paste images into OneNote, they don't get auto-sized and instead the layout of the page gets expanded to fit the large image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get OneNote to auto-size the image down to the available page width again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Kiran</p>

<p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it worked in 2010 for Toby that's fine, but it doesn't work anymore ... and with VBA code you can never reformat an image from PNG to JPG from within the Word application itself. To do that requires VB.Net. Here is a sample from one of my VB.Net applications.</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Private Sub CreatePicFile()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Try<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wApp.Selection.CopyAsPicture()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Windows.Forms.Application.DoEvents()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image = Forms.Clipboard.GetImage<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Windows.Forms.Application.DoEvents()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If image Is Nothing Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wApp.Selection.Collapse(Word.WdCollapseDirection.wdCollapseEnd)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image.SetResolution(300, 300)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sNbr = Format(nbr, "0000")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image.Save(iPath &amp; zFileName.Text &amp; sNbr &amp; extFormatName)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nbr = nbr + 1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forms.Clipboard.SetText(" ")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cntr = cntr + 1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If errRsp Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Me.MsgText.Text = My.Resources.frmPicSaveText6 &amp; cntr.ToString<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Me.MsgText.ForeColor = Drawing.Color.Red<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beep()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exit Sub<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Me.Refresh()<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Catch ex As Exception<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MsgBox("CreatPicFile" &amp; vbCr &amp; ex.Message, vbCritical, ThisAddIn.LGPVersion)<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, why have Nokia removed something that was not broken?&nbsp; And seem to have broken everything else. Couldn't they just left things alone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why make things so difficult for Nokia users that they really don't want to go through all this again by staying with Nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon I will be looking for a new phone, the only criterion so far is that it's not going to be Nokia.&nbsp; For someone who has had several Nokia phones over the past 9 years I really don't see the point in all this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back on topic, why has OVI store been removed fro this update?&nbsp; If you could call it an update that is, more a downdate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;upps, I updated the link. You should see 3.7.22 now. Furthermore, if you use the same trick, you get&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131019121457/http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_Suite_webinstaller_ALL.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia

<p>Would be surprised, if that gives a anti-virus warning because that EXE file is code-signed.</p>

<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been loyal to Nokia more than 10 years. I have to buy another phone very soon and I can guarantee it won't be Nokia any more. That's it. Problem is not Nokia, it's M$ - microsoft. They've killed everything what Nokia stands for.</p>
<p>I've renewed my first 8310 like new - spent more than 60GBP for original housing, accessories -all of them, LCD and batteries. It is MADE IN FINLAND. It will stay as the perfect phone ever!</p>
<p>Some to my E71 which I till use and will use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really can't understand why Nokia Suite and other working apps was killed and not working any more. Nokia Suite "upgrade/update" is actually DOWNGRADE. I'm glad to keep couple of Nokia Suite versions back, including 3.8.48 with the CURE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abnormal but fact!!!</p>

            If you create dates for 2016 &amp; 2017 in a new worksheet, then copy them, you can open Power Pivot and Paste Append the list to the Calendar tab. That will add 2016 &amp; 2017 to the Slicers.

<p>Thanks, SmittyPro1. We are so close. I followed your instructions and the system appears to have added the Slicers but not in the same format as the original years. Secondly, even when I add in data for those months, the graph is blank. Any other thoughts?</p>

    <title>Outlook 2007 cannot send or receive emails ERR Authentication failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clauderaines  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007 cannot send or receive emails ERR Authentication failed</h2>
                    <p>The day before leaving on vacation I was able to connect to my msn account via Outlook 2007 on my desktop without a problem. I have not been able to connect to my msn account at all since I returned from Vacation. Every time I open Outlook my msn account
 fails to connect while four other email accounts connect to their servers, receive and send emails without incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I double checked the account settings and they are correct. my email address as username, my password, pop3.live.com, smtp.live.com, outgoing same as incoming, 995 and 587, encrypted connection (used TSL and Auto), it's a textbook setup and it is correct.
 I can log on to outlook.com via the web, using the same password that I use in Outlook 2007. Since I was able to reach my msn account via Outlook before vacation and unable to after vacation, I am convinced that this is a Microsoft problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get these error messages - </p>
<p>
</p><p>"Log onto incoming mail server (POP3): your mail server rejected your login.Verify your username and password in your account properties. Under Tools, click Email accounts. The server responded: -ERR authentication failed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the send side - "Send test email message: none of the authentication methods supported by this client are supported by your server."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran office repair, changed my password, deleted and recreated the account, ran scanpst, all to no avail. I created a new account with the same settings as the problem account and it works fine. I called Microsoft Support and after explaining the steps
 I had taken, I was told that the only way to resolve the matter was to pay for a 1 year service contract, approx $150. I am a retired Senior Help Desk Analyst but I am a bit out of touch since I retired 15 years ago. I declined the offer since I would only
 use it for this issue. I went to plan B. I logged into the problem account on the web and forwarded all incoming emails to the newly created outlook.com account as a temporary measure. My original account, the problem account is an msn.com email account that
 I have had for over 20 years and just don't want to give it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading everything I could find on the issue and realizing that I've read it all before, I turned to the community hoping for different ideas. My theory is that the problem is not on my Desktop but on the msn side so I booted up my Laptop, which I
 use primarily when I am on vacation. I opened Outlook 2007 on the laptop and the same problem exists there too. I rarely use my laptop but boot it up periodically to get updates on Windows and other programs. Both machines are running Windows 7 (Professional
 on the Desktop and Home Premium on the Laptop). The fact that the problem exists on both my laptop and desktop is why I am convinced that it is not my problem but Microsoft's. I would appreciate any feedback, has anyone resolved this problem?</p>

<h2>            My Lumia 640 will NOT shut off. Why not&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For some reason my Lumia 640 won't shut off anymore. On the weekends I like to shut it off. I don't need it to be on overnight, I'm not getting up early the next day for anything, etc. However, last night I tried
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">3 times</span> to shut my Lumia 640 off. I pressed the power button, the message would then pop up saying that I'm to swipe down to shutoff my Lumia. I do so. The screen goes blank and black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then it reboots itself immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does it do that???????????????????????????????????????????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I want to turn it off, I want it off. I do not want it restarting. So why isn't it staying off, especially when it tells me it is shutting down?</p>

<h2>            Free &#47; Busy Troubleshooting</h2>
                    
<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>free/busy information is only logged in Outlook 2010! This is a great, great feature and so useful that I simply don‚Äôt understand why it is not present in Outlook 2013</p>
<p>anybody have an idea of how should i troubleshoot the free/busy information in the Hybrid environment. (office 365 / On prem)</p>
<p>is there any tool available, that will work same like the Outlook 2010 troubleshooting logging?</p>

<p>Hi DhandapaniK,</p>
<p>To avoid misunderstanding, may I confirm some information?</p>
<p>1. About the first sentence ‚Äú<em>free/busy information is only logged in Outlook 2010! This is a great, great feature and so useful that I simply don‚Äôt understand why it is not present in Outlook 2013</em>‚Äù, which of the following is true?</p>
<p>a. There is no actual free/busy view issue, the only question is that: you can only see free/busy logs in Outlook 2010. But Outlook 2013 does not have such logs.</p>
<p>b. There are free/busy view issues. You can only view users‚Äô free/busy information in Outlook 2010. In Outlook 2013, you cannot view users‚Äô free/ busy information.</p>
<p>I appreciate your clarification.</p>
<p>2. Usually, we can use Hybrid Free/Busy troubleshooter to troubleshoot Hybrid free/busy issue.</p>

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10092/troubleshooting-free-busy-issues-in-exchange-hybrid-environment</a></p>
<p>3. Do you mean you cannot see troubleshooting logging in Outlook 2013?</p>
<p>Outlook 2013 also has troubleshooting logging, just like Outlook 2010. We need to first enable it. Reference link:

<p>Is this what you mean?</p>
<p>If not, please correct me. So that I can further assist you.</p>

<p>Hi DhandapaniK,</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
<p>Upon researching, there is no officially recommended tool for Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>Regarding Outlook 2013 client troubleshooting tool, you can also post at our Outlook 2013 forum:</p>
<p><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook</a></p>
<p>They are more proficient at Outlook client configurations.</p>
<p>Moreover, about the free busy issue, do you need our help here?</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 930</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!<br />
<br />
I am in a bit of a pickle. I have just bought a Nokia Lumia 930 device, and only later realised that it is locked to a specific carrier. The problem is that I do not know the carrier my phone is locked to. How can I figure this out? I would like to note that
 I do not have the original carrier sim card, so I can not check it.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much!</p>

<p>Tjank you all for your replies!<br />
<br />
I managed to figure out (or better yet, guess) the carrier it was locked to, contacted them via mobile unlock service and I am now happily calling on my new Nokia.<br />
<br />
And to answer your question, yes, I was faced with a message, that my phone is locked to a specific carrier, and that I have 10 unlock attempts remaing.<br />
<br />
I managed to guess the carrier my the settings/system/about/carrier (it still strikes me as to how unlear any information about carrier locking is and how difficult it is to figure out what carrier your device is locked to, it turned out that I had contacted
 the correct provider off the bat, but they could not confirm that the device was locked to them -.-)</p>

<h2>            IOS inbuilt mail does not connect to outlook.com account &#40;setup ok, connection error&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since roughly 2 weeks now, my iphone 6&nbsp;is suddenly unable to get any mail (send or receive) from my outlook.com account. IOS is now the latest IOS (ver. 10.2). I have deleted the account few times and set it up again but no difference in outcome.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The setup works just fine, if I go to "settings -&gt; mail -&gt; accounts -&gt; add account -&gt; outlook.com" on IOS, I am able to add the account normally. But after setup, when I go the IOS mail app, I get this error message: "Cannot get mail" "The connection to
 the server failed". No email comes through, not even the folder structure is downloaded from the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can login and use&nbsp;my mail&nbsp;at outlook.com via web browser (its painfully slow to login - but eventually it does open up and I can use it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions???</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p><span>I got the issue sorted with the help of local Microsoft support. I‚Äôll post the answer here in case it helps someone else.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no real explanation why the account stopped working after several years of working fine, but it came down to the email account being an ‚ÄúEASI‚Äù Account. A way to test if this the case for
 you, is to check if you can access the mail using ‚Äúprivate‚Äù mode on a browser. For me, this failed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>To resolve the issue, I had to create a new email alias for the account (</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></span><span>)
 using the Microsoft account management tool (</span></span><span><a href="http://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>http://account.microsoft.com</span></span></a></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>,
 and make that the primary account for login (don‚Äôt delete the old, leave it as secondary). After I did that, and created the outlook account on the phone once more but now with the new email as login, the email started working again.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, had to ensure from the mailbox (under accounts/connected accounts) that the old email is still the default send from address (and not the new email that is just for login purposes).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

<h2>            How come I can never see an icon on the desktop where I have the software installed&#63; The only time I see the software is when I connect my zune.</h2>
                    <p>I don't see an icon on the desktop. I have windows 7 as my operating system. When I click on the program files, it says that the file is empty. When I connect my zune player, the software opens up with all of the files. Why does the computer do things like
 that?</p>

            <p>You can manually add the icon to your desktop by following these steps:</p>
<p><br />
Click on <strong>Start</strong></p>
<p>Click on <strong>All Programs</strong></p>
<p>Scroll to the <strong>Zune </strong>folder</p>
<p><strong>Right Click</strong> on the <strong>Zune </strong>icon, and then click

<p>If the folder Zune is not available, you can do the following instead:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Windows 7/Vista</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Start</strong></p>
<p>In the <strong>"Search Programs and Files" </strong>field, enter the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Zune\</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press enter and it will open the Zune folder. Right click on Zune.exe and then
<strong>Send to &gt;Desktop (Create Shortcut)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows XP</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Start</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>Run</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter in the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Zune\</p>

<p>This will open the Zune folder as well, right click on the Zune.exe and then <strong>

<h2>            E61 - automatic retrieval of email</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
just got Nokia E61, configured it for my IMAP/SSL mailbox, it works perfectly... almost...<br />
<br />
When I configure it for automatic retrieval on every 30 minutes, it connects to 3G, fetches new emails, BUT DOES NOT disconnect the 3G session (the two arrows under the 3G are always on... for hours).<br />
<br />
The only problem with this is, that while 3G session is active, I don't get any SMS messages, nor I can send one.<br />
<br />
Setting-&gt;Connection-&gt;Packet data-&gt;Packet data con.. is set to "When needed.".<br />
<br />
Any clues of how can I get it to disconnect itself ?<br />
<br />
Software version: <a href="http://1.0610.04.04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">1.0610.04.04</a><br />
<br />
Thank you very much,<br />
Simon.

            What network are you on? I can send and receive messages while I'm online via 3G without any problems... Seems odd that you can't, I thought that was one of the advantages of it.

            I'm on Slovenian network - Mobitel.<br />
<br />
As I recall, on Nokia 6630 on the same operator few days ago receiving an SMS while being on 3G was not a problem at all, even if I was on GPRS it worked, the connection was dropped for a few moments, but continued to work.<br />
<br />
I don't know what's with that phone now. The operator doesn't know nothing about this of course.<br />
<br />
Any setting that would controll this ?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
still waiting for a SMS... Simon.

                    <p>I have an excel sheet that works fine on the desktop, but when I open it in a tablet app on either IOS or Android it no longer works and produces a #REF! error. The Formula uses the CELL, INDIRECT, ADDRESS, and INDEX MATCH functions. What could be causing
 this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is there any way to Evaluate the formula step by step on the tablet? I cannot find the "Evaluate Formula" button in the Formula ribbon.</p>

            1. Android app doesn't provide Evaluate formula. This has to be done on desktop.
<br />
<br />2. Can you share the link of your Excel file (Make sure it doesn't contain any confidential / sensitive data)?

            I have a new 6230i, which I love, but the ringtone changes! I set it from the mmc card, and most callers have this ring, but when certain people call me, the tone is different. i did not set that tone, and I have deleted all groups in an effort to stop
 this problem! You have recommended moving the tones from mmc to phone memory, I am sorry but I am a technophobe, and have no idea how to do that. Please advise? thanks

            Not sure how you do this on a Series 40 phone but if you see the ringtone file in say the music player, you may find an option for moving the file.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can use the Phone Browser in PC Suite. Depending on the file format, you probably need to move it to either:<br />
<br />
Phone Memory/Sounds/Digital<br />
Phone Memory/Sounds/Simple<br />
<br />
Where Digital is for regular music track and Simple is for actual ringtones.
