<h2>            Investigating performance issues on Skype for Linux 8.13.76.8 and higher</h2>
                    <p>It seems skype is leaking memory and I did search this forum and found that the suggestion often is to run skype alone to see if the problem persists. What is meant by running skype alone? Obviously I still need to run the window server and possibly a window
 manager and compositor, network is probably good to have going too. During this "experiment", should I refrain from using skype at all? Or should I use it for communication?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My observations are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Skype consumes more memory the longer it has been running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Skype becomes slow in response, hundreds of milliseconds delay for each keystroke when typing messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to point out that this forum has no subcategory for general technical issues but the category is mandatory. This is why the category is not correctly set for this post, if this is not the right place for these kind of questions, please
 direct me to where is.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Some apps have gone unresponsive</h2>
                    I am using build 10.0.15228 in my Lumia 640. I am facing a serious issue from last few days. Some apps like whatsapp, whatsapp beta, UC browser, tube x pro and torrents hub lite have become unresponsive. When i try to open these apps, they just keep on
 loading and loading but don't open at all. Can someone suggest any solution(apart from hard reset)?

            Hi Kushith,<br />
<br />
<br />
Your apps may not be updated that's why you can't access them. This could also be a phone's software issue, however, it's best to post your issue to the<strong>
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum">Windows Insider Program</a></strong> forum.
<br />
<br />
For future queries for the Windows Phone, you can always get back to us. <br />

Regards.

    <title>User account system around Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rayan m vepari  say:</h3>
<h2>            User account system around Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Windows product engineering department</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to let you know that Windows 10 was not a finished product, but Microsoft have to get rid of all traces of treating traditional computers as mobile device as quickly as possible before everybody plans to get rid of their computers and Microsoft
 starts loosing their customer base. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I would like Microsoft to completely remove lock screen functionality on traditional desktops and laptops immediately because it was making people find their products more difficult to use. People do not need any lock screens on traditional computers
 at all because it makes it much difficult for people to get back on their computers. Computers are computers and they don't need any lock screens at all, Microsoft should completely get rid of lock screen as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, Microsoft should make sure that login screen is completely user friendly for traditional desktops as what happened with Windows 7. What Microsoft should do with their login screen functionality is make sure that the UI of logging into computers and
 user account system is more like Windows 7, but with following advancements like Secure password system and support for third party antivirus for computer logins due to rise of heartbleed and security issues that are going to make strong passwords obsolete.
 There should be many advancements to user accounts page in re-invented control panel as PC settings app will no longer be needed anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, Microsoft should improve lock functionality to go beyond traditional lock your computer. When a person locks their computer, the entire login session is completely disabled so no hacker can run BSoD on people even when they are away from their computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fourth, Security for logging into computers must be advanced to stop cybercriminals and identity thieves from breaking into computers when people enter their password and log into their system. Cyberattacks caused by lack of security when a person is about
 to login to their computer is rising as cybercriminals try to exploit traditional Windows login system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fifth, New functionality that blocks hackers from exploiting CPU's and GPU's to slow you down when you are on your machine by default. Most laptop makers like Dell, HP, Lenovo and Acer are now shifting to standard voltage processors to ultra-low power processors
 that allows people to spend more than 12 hours on their computers without facing battery drainage issues. Most people want thinner computers that are designing for vibrant computing than ever before, but they come with security risks like hackers breaking
 into your computer to cause more performance issues or triggering you to use up your hydro bill or drain your battery on your laptop. Thin and powerful computers are becoming the new norm as well as aluminum cases that are designed to compete with high vibrant
 MacBook's and new user experiences found on modern devices. New standards with Windows 10 should have a newer technology that automatically blocks CPU and GPU cyber attacks especially with hackers slowing down people who have ULV CPUs these days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft improves User Account System and remove every instance of Windows 8.x login functionality and treat how people login to computers as accessing your P.C., not mobile devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 should not look more like future Windows 8.x release, it should be more userfriendly and fully optimized for desktops and laptops.
</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            How do I edit an existing query within excel 2010</h2>
                    I have several excel spreadsheets that have data that needs to be refreshed on a monthly basis. Often the criteria for the data&nbsp; changes and I need to modify the query itself. I have not been able to find a way to do this in Office 2010. In the previous
 versions there was an option to "edit query". I only seem to be able to refresh with the exisiting criteria.

<h2>            Sending the same message to 6,000 different recipients over a period of a month</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am planning to send the same e-mail to 6,000 addresses over the period of 20 days. I need to be sure that I will be able to do so from my trusted account and I want to avoid any last minute disappointments and delays (deactivated accounts due to suspicious
 activity etc.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody knows whether I will be able to do so by simply operating in the 300 daily limit for a period of 20 days straight, or whether I should contact the company (Microsoft) a priori in order to avoid any restrictions to my account (which I have for
 6 years now) or any lowering of the daily limit? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer responsibly as it is very important to me to be able to do this!</p>
<p>

    <title>Access, ODBC and NVarchar&#40;Max&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hardkorehak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access, ODBC and NVarchar&#40;Max&#41;</h2>
                    I have seen several posts around the Internet regarding the issue of ODBC conversion from SQL nVarChar(Max) to Access Memo fields. This has clearly been a hiccup since the creation of the Max concept. So, here is my environment: Access 2007 front end,
 SQL 2012 back end. The only way to allow Access to process greater than 255 characters of the Max is to implement the ODBC drivers dating back to version 6 (plain-Jane SQL Server - nothing Native about it) a.k.a. SQLSRV32.dll. At that point, our "applications"
 can handle old the 65k character limit. My understanding of the issue, in plain terms, is Access, through any recent version of the ODBC Native driver, sees NVarchar(???) and merely a small text field, imposing a limit of 255.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, the question is: is there a combinations of versions of Access/ODBC/SQL that will ever properly handle the MAX definition?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have tried SQL Server Native Client 10.0 and 11.0, to include the most recent version of 11.1.3000.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I work for a Systems Integration company builds proposals, RFQ's and Purchase Orders with heavy use of "memo" fields. We starting using Access as our everything (FE/BE) many years ago. Very quickly learned the benefits of SQL as BE. Have a lot of time
 and money invested into our FE being in Access, so any suggestions of moving away from that, no matter how logical they may be, are out of the question.</div>

            Wow! What an eye-opener! I've been using the plain old SQL Server driver because so far it's worked without a hitch on a SQL 2005 BE and a 2003 FE. I guess I've been really lucky.
<div><br />
<div>When I used the SQL native client 10 the nvarchar(max) I got some really weird results.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>The longest in a table was 2569 characters long. The last 18 were returned.</li><li>ordering by the len() gave me the right sort based on the actual length in SQL BE even though Access linked table showed the length of what it showed in the FE table.</li><li>fields less than 255 characters were also truncated to the last characters. A 250 char string was truncated to the last 15.</li></ol>

<p><span>Hi Ramon,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that you create a customized event view based on the date of the events in the calendar list. If yes, if you create a new event view to
 show the events meeting the date conditions, what’s the result? </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the issue seems to happen in multiple calendar lists in multiple sites, I’d like you to list the steps about how you set up the view and filter the view for clarification.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>After troubleshooting and playing with the settings we discovered that the problem was with the "Recurring Events" in the calendars that were not populating in the Events windows.&nbsp; At the moment the only solution we were able to come up with was to input
 each event one by one across all the calendars in outlook.&nbsp; Then re categorizing each event in the Sharepoint calendar on by one to have them display on the Sharepoint site.</p>

<p><span>From your description, it seems that you create a calendar list and sync it to Outlook 2016. The root cause is that the recurring events aren’t populated in Events and
 I’m glad the issue goes away in your environment now. If you need further help on this issue, welcome to post back at your convenience.</span></p>

<p>When it will be released who knows, as I've seen from your other postings you seem to want to jump the gun and after getting newer builds you complain about bugs, Preview builds are BETA software and may have issues (bugs) that is the reason for this Preview
 site is for Insiders to test and report using the feedback App any problems, issues, bugs it isn't software to use as an everyday system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is the info(found by doing a Google search)&nbsp;note it is only foe certain Mobil products:</p>
<p>Today, we are releasing<strong> Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview Build 14283
</strong>to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we are initially making new mobile builds from our Development Branch available only to devices that shipped with Windows 10 Mobile. Currently this includes the

<p><span>Thank you for your post on this forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Most of Lumia 535 and 535 Dual-SIM customers are happy with their phone, but we know<br />
that some of you have experienced touch screen functionality problems. We<br />
improved the touch experience with the software update released earlier in<br />
December; however the problem still persists for some customers. Our technical<br />
team is definitely committed to addressing the issue and are working hard on<br />
further software updates to be released in the near futurewe'll timely update<br />
you on progress. Thank you very much for your patience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            11082&#58; Copy&#47;move dialogue box missing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just wondering if anyone else is seeing this or just me: in today's Fast Ring build, when I go to copy or move a file or group of files, the operation appears to take place, judging by watching the destination directory, but the dialog box that shows progress
 doesn't show up, and there's no green indicator in the taskbar to tell how far along the process is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty sure this is a bug (which was reported through the Feedback app), but just curious if it's affecting anyone else.</p>

<div>After the re-flash of the firmware, I am observing another issue, the touch screen some times is inactive. i.e if I see an incoming call, I cannot answer the same and due to this unibody design, I need to wait till the caller disconnects and I have to

            <p>Some of these restart problems are due to faulty SIMs or SIM slots. I suggest you contact the place of purchase or local Nokia Care center for&nbsp; a fix/replacement.</p>

<p>If you haven't tried a factory reset you could also try that first to rule it out:

<div>Based on the same, I had my SIM card replaced. No luck.</div>
<div>Got the firmware reflashed from Nokia Care, No Luck yet.</div>
<div><br />
<div>May be I need to show this to Nokia Care and Ask for a replacement. This issue really took 2 days off my weekend. But back to Square one.</div>

            It is most definitely a hardware problem then and Nokia Care should fix or replace your phone.

<p>we can use smtp submission with a service account for the external company's. We have external party

<p>Hello Roy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when you use the SMTP client submission to send an email, a licensed mailbox is needed in Office 365. For detailed information, please see:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to tell us if anything is misunderstanding.</p>

<p>as of now i can create three cells and try to expand out to 496 but all i get is a repeat of the first the variables.</p>
<p>Any Ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i would like to index the number in both columns inside of [X] brackets.</p>
<p>if a function is used what would be the next step to strip the formula and retain just the data generated?</p>

            Probably the easiest way is to enter the text in the column (say column C) without the closing ]. Then drag down as far as needed. Excel should increment the number properly. Then in an another column, enter the formula: =C1&amp;"]"&nbsp; and fill this down. this
 will add the closing bracket. Then copy that range, select the first cell in the final column and select paste special and choose values.<br />

 Express and page, and when I clicked on Express, it said it would check for updates but there was no progress bar and it just hung. I had to end the programme by using task manager, and i still can't get the updates. I made sure that ActiveX was installed
 but it still doesn't work.<br />

                    After an automatic Windows update yesterday, SKYPE will no longer connect. Everything was fine until then. I looked at the Windows installed updates page and there are over 30.&nbsp; I have no idea what to uninstall.&nbsp; What do I do?

<p>
</p><p>My problem with SKYPE is just one of many that I have had since the November update of Microsoft (HB 4048955).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, to answer your questions.</p>
<p>Skype version 7.40.0.103</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home 1709, OS build 16299.64</p>
<p>Fiber</p>
<p>I can sign in. The first thing that appears is: Skype Home is unavailable at the moment. (Before the update, it was always available.) When I try to connect through video or phone, the error message is "Internet Connection Problem." I cannot read the rest
 of the message because it flashes and disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read everything I have written below before you suggest a solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems I have been having since the November update. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. In Outlook, when I click on the information bar at the top of an email to download images, or if I right-click on any image box, the image will not download.
 Error message:"The linked message cannot be displayed...verify that the link points to the correct file and location."
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Word, hyperlinks in documents do not work. Error message: "Unable to open [FILE]. Cannot locate the internet
 server or proxy server."</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. &nbsp;&nbsp; Hyperlinks will not open in PowerPoint presentations. Error message: "Cannot locate the internet server or proxy
 server." </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. In SKYPE, when I try to call phones or SKYPE with a contact, the error message says there's no internet connection.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All these error messages
<strong><em>intimate</em></strong> that the internet connection is faulty. But this is only the case with programs that Microsoft owns. I can open hyperlinks in PDF files or notes that I create for Facebook.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Last Fall, Windows&nbsp; 8.1 was working just fine until an update. Then I had all the problems above. In the Microsoft Office
 forums, lots of other people said they were having the same problems with updates to 8.1</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I finally upgraded to Windows 10. All the above problems disappeared until the major update on November 17 (KB 4048955).
 Now they are all back again. Nothing else changed on my laptop except for the update.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I ran the app to troubleshoot Microsoft updates. Problem found: "the remote device or resource won't accept the connection."&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Details gave me this service status: Problem with BITS service: "The requested service has already been started. More
 help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2182."</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Google search on this message turned up several hits for NET HELPMST 2182</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have copied the links below. My takeaway from these links is that lots of people have received this message number,
 and it doesn't seem that ANYONE has found a viable solution to "the remote device or resource won't accept the connection."
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My Windows 10 is up to date. (Windows 10 Home, 1709, OS Build 16299.64)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have a 64 bit operating system in a Dell Inspiron 7537</span></p>
<p>Though the experts in the forum are doing their best to help me and others with these problems,
<span>these issues&nbsp; reoccurring now more than once a year when there are updates.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft must fix this idiotic situation. I tried to send feedback through Microsoft help. That won't load. There does
 not seem to be any outlet for me to voice my fury directly to Microsoft. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Danida, </p>
<p>I just tried a fix from another thread. As you can see, since November 2015, people have been having the same problems with Microsoft programs after updates as I have had TWICE this year.
</p>
<p>Here is the thread. https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_win10-mso_2016/outlook-2016-email-update-cannot-view-images-and/3500fda7-cb82-4d86-8acc-abd735d9d348?messageId=9a5f8fb6-3d6b-47e0-ae93-a58eb85dc77e</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix from Rich Blessington: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't have the name of the original poster of this solution but this is the
<em>onl</em><em>y </em>thing that worked for me:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The quickest temporary fix I have found is </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Control Panel -&gt; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Internet Options -&gt; </span>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Advanced tab -&gt; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">click on the Reset button </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">restart the computer.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Now, everything works again, including SKYPE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I read his post, I was just about to again uninstall 365 and the update and reinstall everything. But that didn't work last time, and others also said that uninstalling and reinstalling the update a few times didn't work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had forgotten that the last time this happened with an update, Internet Explorer also didn't work. I don't use it as a browser.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So before I tried the fix, I tried to load Internet Explorer, and it was unavailable because of a poor network situation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem happens often to many people after Microsoft updates. I hope you can let Microsoft know how frustrated an angry people are when they have to spend hours trying to find a fix.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out!</p>

<p>You can place shapes such as rectangles, circles etc. on a worksheet. These shapes may contain a frame that contains text. In versions of Excel&nbsp;before Excel 2007, these were exposed to the programmer through the TextFrame and TextRange objects. In Office
 2007, Microsoft introduced a new graphics engine with more capabilities; it is now possible to handle text in a shape almost as if it were text in a Word document. This is exposed to the programmer in the form of new objects that support the enhanced features:
 TextFrame2 and TextRange2. For reasons of compatibility, shapes also still have the older TextFrame and TextRange.</p>
<p>So you only need the TextRange2 object if you're working with shapes and if you want to make use of the new advanced text editing capabilities.</p>

            I don't think, it is something related to Security Settings.<br />
There might be some issue with package file, try downloading a fresh one, or, contact the developer regarding this issue.<br />
If you are a Nokia X based device, you may prefer using HERE maps, with offline support.

<h2>            Helping Windows 10 work smarter</h2>
                    <p>I love the new Microsoft Windows 10 Preview,&nbsp;if you haven't installed this OS on a test machine, now is the moment to do. Here's the reason why I love it -- looks new, works well, absolute novelty, love the task bar and start menu, comes preloaded with apps,
 and for the most part it works well with all my current applications and software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we use the laptop touch area to work with the new windows 10</p>
<p>*two finger swipe to move pages side ways; move internet page to previous or after</p>
<p>*three finger swipe to brings apps and background windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above features exist with other OS vendor.</p>

    <title>MY MSN SETTINGS ARE OUT OF DATE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rossmarvin  say:</h3>
<h2>            MY MSN SETTINGS ARE OUT OF DATE</h2>
                    <p>Everyday, multiple times a day.&nbsp; It is incredibly annoying and unproductive.&nbsp; Before you put out a product like 10.......this should have been addressed.&nbsp; Especially since I see 360 people like me having the problem and probably ten times that who haven't
 gotten to this site yet.&nbsp; Okay with that off my chest.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I think my microsftoffice 365 and my msn site are fighting with each other.&nbsp; Microsoft office is winning and making my MSN which for me is HOTMAIL continuously changing or sending me to a site with a clean mailbox.&nbsp; Each time I get this message I have to
 verify my account.&nbsp; Now I have verified my account so many times that the system has locked me out and I can't get to my MSN account for a week.&nbsp; Really guys.......sounds rather punitive especially since it is your security and system that is asking me to
 verify my account in the first place.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So please help me by stopping with the limitations on the verification.&nbsp; It is the only way I can access my account.&nbsp; Which I should not have to verify once to several times a day.&nbsp; That is security abuse.&nbsp; Please fix it.....or DUMP windows 10 until you
 figure it out.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What can you do to help me access my MSN account?</p>
