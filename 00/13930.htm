            <p>Hi nitinswarup,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p><br />
As the Maps service is not yet available in India this is the reason that the Find My Phone feature is not yet supported in India.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I haven&#39;t been able to get into the hub since 16193.1 or 16199.1 where I am now. PC Windows Insider fast ring 02&#47;08&#47;2015</h2>
                    <p>I had a heck of a time downloading 16199.1. The computer tried twice &amp; failed &amp; I did it twice and failed once, the second time it downloaded but took about as long as it did to DL 10 when I first became an Insider. History showed it didn't download. This
 morning I rolled it back a build &amp; came forward to 16199.1 and got it. I found some problems with the Edge, although it had been updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here is where things get a little strange. I was in my account &amp; someone from Microsoft said I didn't have any device, so I ask him what he was contacting me on if I didn't have any devices and he wanted verification &amp; text the phone he said I didn't
 have &amp; I of course responded to him with the code. Since that didn't work he said I didn't have 10 on them, which is totally Impossible, like I said I have been a Windows 10 Insider on the fast ring for 2 years &amp; a little over four MO. The other reason is
 I have had 3 computers since I came on 10, 10 killed one of them, here is his problem the one I am on now I bought a little after 10 was released to the public it is a Dell Inspiron 3847 which came with Windows 10 on it 8GBS of RAM that I upgrade to 16 GBS,
 i7 Intel Processor, a 1000GB HD &amp; I am running at 72Mbps. The other device in a Lumia 950 which of course has 10 on it. I didn't mention I have been a mobile Insider on the fast ring for around 6 months. From it I can get on the mobile hub no problem at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This starting to get old, I have been with Microsoft for somewhere around 25 years, it was DOS back then &amp; Windows didn't come along for quite a few years &amp; even then it ran on top of DOS. I think I have had every O/S expect for 8.0. It seems like
 it is something all the time. I did a hard restart on my Lumia &amp; some guy form M/S sent me a 17 page ( if you counted the links )&nbsp; email saying I had no business doing that to MY PHONE &amp; I should got ahold of him, when I didn't know who him was &amp; that he was
 the head of the Insiders &amp; would have had a couple of Insiders help me. I told him how long I had been a Insider &amp; if M/S wanted MY PHONE back I would sell it to them. I also told him that I thought Dona Sakar was the head of it. What does he do, he put on
 my record how disrespectful I was &amp; who was I to talk back to a M/S employee. My response was "for a $1000.00 Alex what is a customer".</p>

            I fixed it myself. I went to the app an reset it. It said I would loose data, but I figured I was better off less data then no data, so I re-set it. The thing is I didn't loose anything.

<h2>            Windows 10 technical preview - problems with screen resolution and mouse</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 10 technical preview for some time, and I have screen issues. First of all, when I turn on the PC, the resolution of screen is automatic set to low 1024 x 768, but my screen is 1920 x 1080. &nbsp;Second, every time I turn on - I must pull
 out and plug in mouse again, because it don't work from start. Does anyone run the same problem? How to fix it?

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community Forums. You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
What is the make and model of the graphic card?<br />
<br />
</span><span>The issue seems to be with the graphic card drivers. I would suggest you to uninstall all the graphic card drivers and install all the pending updates so that the drivers for the graphic card
 will get installed from Windows updates.<br />
<br />
1. Press (Windows key + X) and click on “Device Manager”.<br />
2. Expand “Display Adaptor”.<br />
3. Right click on the video driver and select “Update Driver Software”. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mobile store displays ghostly screens, won&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile store displays ghostly screens, won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>Others have mentioned that the Windows Mobile Store won't open, but this may be an odd case of it. On my Lumia 640, when I've tried to open the Store over the past month, I get screens like these that show ghostly images. If I let it sit, they sometimes
 change, like a slideshow. I do recall a phone update that might have triggered this, but the timing is hard to remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an older Lumia 520 that loads the Store OK (Windows 8.1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>These combined images were grabbed on Feb 2 &amp; 13, 2019. Nothing else loads beyond that. Has anyone else seen this behavior?</p>

<p>+ that looks like fluent design &amp; maybe a simple restart&nbsp;to the Windows Phone will help //</p>

<p>
</p><p>Updated/edited reply:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reboot it often so that didn't seem to be the issue, but there was a "stuck" reboot pending for a recent phone update and it fixed the problem<strong>&nbsp;but only temporarily</strong>. I wouldn't have known about that reboot-needed without checking Settings
 manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The blurry screens are back as of 2/16/19, so I'll see if anyone has a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This "rotating" screencap was timed just before the screen went blurry again. Repeatedly loading the Store gives a very brief sharp image like this.</p>

    <title>Window default size and location in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rossh51  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window default size and location in Word</h2>
                    <p>I have searched on this and tried all recommendations I can find replacing Normal.dotm and plist files, opening/saving/closing etc without any success. Also tried a complete removal and reinstallation of Office 365 as per MS instructions to do so.</p>
<p>Despite all this Word opens in a small window in the top left of the screen for either a blank new file or for an existing file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I note that the Normal.dotm file never seems to be written to when I change size/location and save file and close. Permissions look ok.</p>
<p>Can anyone advise on steps to try to fix this? Google is not my friend with this one!</p>

            <p>Hi x0haib..., <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your contribution to the forums, <br />
<br />
You should be able to log out from the Facebook . <br />
When in the app tap on "..." and you will get the option to log out. <br />
<br />
If you want to log out from the Microsoft Account, that is set as a main account on your phone it won't be possible.You can have only one main account on your phone. And only with this account you will be able to use the services. The others account that you
 may want to add are only be treated as the email accounts. For that reason you won't be able to switch between the accounts.
<br />
If you want to change the main account on the phone that is visible in the Applications-Settings-Email+Accounts - the first account there will be the main account, you will be required to perform the Hard Reset.
<br />
<br />
Let us know if this information helps you. We would appreciate your feedback in order to provide you with further assistance.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind Regards, </p>

    <title>Combo Box settings&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cdavis10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combo Box settings&#63;</h2>
                    I have a combo box on a form that draws multiple columns from a table/query. If the desired entity is not in the list, I would like it to pop up another form.... How would I set that?
<br />
&nbsp;For example I have a combo box&nbsp; for employee,&nbsp; it selects the employee ID, first name, and Last name.&nbsp; With the first name being the one displayed, and the last name displayed in a textbox beside it&nbsp; using the column property and my combo box as the source.<br />
&nbsp;when the user goes to select an employee from the list, if say, Employee Jane Doe is not in the list,&nbsp; I want another form to open up where I can enter in the new employee and all that employees info that might not be shown in the original combo box.
<br />
I See there is an event for " On Not in list" but Im not good with VBA code....&nbsp; <br />

            Yes, you would use the NotInList event. There is plenty of sample code snippets for how to use it.&nbsp;

            <p>The event procedure for the On Not In List event of the EmployeeID combo box could look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub EmployeeID_NotInList(NewData As String, Response As Integer)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Ask user whether name should be added<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If MsgBox("The&nbsp;employee '" &amp; NewData &amp; "' does not occur in the list." &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to add it?", vbYesNo + vbQuestion) = vbYes Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Open&nbsp;employee form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm FormName:="frmEmployees", DataMode:=acFormAdd, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WindowMode:=acDialog, OpenArgs:=NewData<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Tell Access that name has been added<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response = acDataErrAdded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Undo the new name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.EmployeeID.Undo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Tell Access to&nbsp;suppress the built-in error message.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response = acDataErrContinue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must substitute the correct field names and form name of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the On Load event of the employee form (frmEmployees in the above example), create code to fill in the first name if supplied:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Form_Load()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(Me.OpenArgs) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FirstName = Me.OpenArgs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, substitute the correct field name.</p>

<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
The very first form in the demo parallels your situation, but rather than having a separate text box for the LastName value, concatenates the first and last names in the list and allows you to enter a new name in the combo box as Jack Flash for instance (try
 it in my demo).&nbsp; The name is passed to another form via the OpenArgs mechanism and parsed into the first and last names in the second form's Open event procedure.<br />
<br />
However, and it's a big HOWEVER, names are not distinct, and are legitimately duplicated, even in quite small populations; I myself worked with two Maggie Taylors.&nbsp; The first form in my demo therefore provides an alternative solution with the Add New Contact
 button, which simply opens the second form in dialogue mode, and after adding the new contact and closing the form, requeries the combo box on the first form to show the new contact.<br />

            <p>There is no need to use VBA for this.&nbsp; Since Access 2007, you can just have your form for adding the value.&nbsp; Then you put that form name into the LIST ITEMS EDIT FORM property of the combo box.&nbsp; Access will then ask if you want to add the value if the item
 is not in the list.&nbsp; If you say YES then it will open your form, you add the record and then close the form and then it is there in the combo - with absolutely NO VBA CODE OR MACROS NEEDED.</p>

<br />
It's a cheap and cheerful solution, but it doesn't pass the values to the form in the way that the NotInList event procedure can do.&nbsp; Do you really want to have to enter
<i>'Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge'</i> a second time? &lt;G&gt;.<br />
<br />
A little bit of bog-standard code makes things considerably more user friendly.<br />

<h3> dcsj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changecase keyboard shortcut &#34;this command is not available on this platform&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am having a weird problem that just showed up in the last week or so. I use ChangeCase a lot (bad typist), and have the keyboard shortcut "Alt-C" assigned to this command. I know that "Shift-F3" also does this, but I find Alt-C easier to get to, and it
 was the default way back when in eons past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just added to the assigned keyboard shortcuts Alt-C to this command. This has worked fine for years!!! This last week I have been getting a warning dialog box that says "this command is not available on this platform". I have to OK out of the box, but
 the ChangeCase command still works anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when I shut Word down and restart, this goes away for awhile, but then comes back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shift-F3 doesn't result in the warning dialog, it works as per normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I got the bright idea to create a macro and just record "Shift-F3" in a ChangeCaseMacro, then assign the Macro to Alt-C. Same problem persists!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... any idea? Is it possible that I have changed some setting that is making this come up?</p>

<h2>            Quick notes&#58; moving from One Note 2016 to One Note</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have both One Note 2016 and One Note (for Windows 10) installed on my computer. I only use One Note as the 2016 version can only work on local notebook (as per company policy).</p>
<p>When I press windows+n, the quick note shortcut launches ON2016, while I would like it to launch One Note.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I change that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>

            The quick note functionality (e.g. opening a small note window with a minimalistic user interface) is completely built on OneNote W32 (OneNote 2016). There is no equivalent for it in the OneNote app for Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />There has been a similar function for the Windows 10 app (creating a new note using a shortcut) up to Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. Until then a symbol in the Message Center of Windows allowed you to quickly start OneNote (App) with a newly created note. Unfortunately, Microsoft has removed this shortcut in the recent version of Windows. It's only left for Surface users, bound to the pen button.
<br />
<br />But I can give you the command that was called with that shortcut, so you may create a desktop or start menu link of your own and maybe assign a keyboard shortcut to it:
<br />
<br />onenote-cmd://quicknote?onOpen=typing

<p>Thanks a lot for the quick reply</p>
<p>1. Do we know if Microsoft has plans to bring back this useful function in?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. How do you create a start menu link with assigned keyboard shortcut to it?</p>

            1. No we don't, but it's very unlikely because they removed it deliberately because of low usage.
<br />
<br />2. I'd start with a desktop shortcut. In short: Right-click on your Windows desktop, select "Shortcut". In the next window paste the above command line into the input ("location") field. Click "Next" and create a name for the shortcut (something like "Quick Note" or whatever you want).  Click "Finish". You now have a shortcut on your desktop showing a white OneNote symbol. Clicking on that will start the OneNote app with a new page. You might get asked where you want your Quick Notes section at first start.
<br />To assign a keyboard shortcut to that desktop symbol righ-click it and select "Properties". You'll get a window that also shows you an input field for a keyboard shortcut. You can't use combinations with the WIN key here but with Shift, Ctrl and/or Alt. So maybe define something like Ctrl+Shift+N by putting the cursor in that field and press that combination once. Click "Ok", done. Now you can start a new note in the OneNote app by using that key combination.
<br />
<br />There might be more elegant methods with scripting tools like Autohotkey.
<br />
<br />Converting that desktop shortcut into a Start menu tile is not needed if you want to use the keyboard and it's rather complicated as Microsoft did not offer an easy way to do so. 
<br />
<br />I wrote an article with instructions for a OneNote page link here:
<br /><a href="http://onenote-blog.com/link-zu-onenote-seite-ins-windows-10-startmenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onenote-blog.com/link-zu-onenote-seite-i...</a>
<br />(never mind that that link is in German, the article is in English)
<br />As you already have created a link on your desktop (not for a OneNote page or section, but that does not make a difference here), just start with #6 in the instructions from that article.

</p><p>I have a report which is grouped on a date field by week so all the dates within the week are grouped together.</p>
<p>Is it possible for the title of the group to contain a control that can work out the week commencing date?</p>
<p>So the header for each group on the report will say Week Commencing Monday [Monday's Date].</p>

            <p>Hi dabears_34_34, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your concern here at the Microsoft Community forum and it's my pleasure to assist you today!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based from what I've read, you received an email from your friend that contained a virus link and the details of the email end up on message source in your mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, it is possible that your friend's account has been hacked due to the spam email that you received from his/her account. Please advise him/her to visit our help article
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/hacked-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hacked Account</a></strong> and follow the steps provided on how to keep his/her account safe and secure from the hackers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, it is possible that you're not using an updated browser that's why the details of the email end up on message source. If you want this to be resolved on every email that you will receive, I highly recommend that you keep your web browser up to
 date to get the most out of Outlook. If you’re not using an updated browser, some parts of Outlook might not work and it might not display properly.
</p>

<h2>            N85 lot of play on slider, damage after 2 days</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought my N85 two days ago. It's a very nice and good working phone but it is also my first Nokia and first Sliderphone.</p>
<p>But now, 2 days later I saw scratches on the numeric keypad coming from the slider. If you keep the phone in two hands you can feel there is 'play' on the upper part of the phone (read slider). I'm not mister perfect but if cheap other branded phone witch
 is more than 2 years old doesn't show any scratch at all, ...</p>
<p>What can I do about it and is this normal? For a phone who cost €450,- I expect more quality.</p>
<p>Any help or suggestions are welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made a picture but it's hard to see because of the glossy black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            if you can exchange your unit, do so . unfortunately this is rather a&nbsp; common experience with this phone. if you want to make your dissatisfaction official you can use the 'contact us ' button on the top right of the page and get in touch directly with
 nokia as this is a user to user forum. no official feedback from nokia will&nbsp;be received.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I went back to the store where I bought the phone (nokia store) and they changed the numeric key pad.</p>
<p>The scars on the phone's surface itself was still there when I picked it back up. Because the scars on the surface where little I was not disappointed.</p>
<p>Now, 2 months later the same story again, only now the surface of the phone, where the numeric keypad is mounted, and the top keypad are scratched very bad. It looks very ugly and the people in the store told me that there will be no change of parts except
 for the numeric pad.</p>
<p>So I contacted Nokia consumers service, and there they answered me that if the people in the store say that the damage is normal, nothing will happen.</p>
<p>Is this normal? For a phone of that money? My 1661 is used as 'workphone'. I'm a car mecanic so its always dirty and liing between materials. No problems at all. No scratches, no peeling off, ... Nokia N85 €450, Nokia 1661 €30.</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me how this can happen?</p>
<p>My N85 is bought in 23 march 2009 and if you open the slider it looks 2 years old.</p>

            I'm afraid that while the Nseries are very stylish and have the best technological features Nokia can provide, they're not the most resilient handsets in the world. If you want something with a similar set of features but sturdier construction, the Eseries
 has a reputation for being indestructible.

<p>Are you signed into the correct account with an active Skype number? Did you use a one-time payment method that makes it non-renewable? Did you possibly already put in a request to cancel the number or did it already cancel due to lack of payment? Is the
 Skype number owned by you or only assigned to you?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>

<p>i have a question. we have office 365 Enterprisepack license bought in Netherlands, and have several offices around the world.</p>
<p>When i assign a license for a user in the US , do i need to set this specifically on US and does it technically do something on the background, like will it move the mailbox to somewhere else.?</p>
<p>if it is technically doing nothing, can i just set it all on NL ?</p>

<p>regards,<br />

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>It depends on which country or region your company administrator specified during the initial setup of the Office 365 service. If your admin selected Netherlands, the answer is no. All the users’ data in your tenant are restored there.</p>
<p>Generally, Microsoft has a regionalized data center strategy. The customer’s country or region, which the customer’s administrator inputs during the initial setup of the services, determines the primary storage location for that customer’s data.</p>
<p>For more information, please refer to:<br />

<h2>            Windows apps and tiles</h2>
                    <p>I like the new start menu.&nbsp; On Win 8 and 8.1 I used the one of the other brands available and was happy.&nbsp; With Win 10 I am using the start menu provided and like the idea of adding and editing tiles.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My complaint is that the win apps I get from the store usually dont work well or are sloppy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Choosing my own apps from other sources and adding to tiles works fine and I like this a lot.</p>

            <p>I too have had some problems with Windows store apps.&nbsp; The live tiles seem to work okay; but a lot of the apps themselves don't work well.&nbsp; Sometimes they don't seem to fully launch at all; sometimes they freeze or slow my computer way down.&nbsp; Some of them
 definitely seem not to like being on an HD&nbsp;widescreen or in a window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm not sure if problems with Store apps are the kind of feedback Microsoft is looking for from this first build though, so I haven't sent a lot.</p>

            <p>the article writers just don't have a clue of what's REALLY going on, do they? &nbsp;Not very critical - almost like talking about a 'magical kingdom' or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS most CERTAINLY cannot afford another screw-up like 8 was. &nbsp;But they did it ANYWAY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;"the store" - NO _serious_ developers will go there. &nbsp;Why should they?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;The most popular open source applications typically are developed for POSIX systems *FIRST*, then use some kind of toolkit (like Qt or GTK) that makes them CROSS-PLATFORM. &nbsp;[worth pointing out, Mozilla TOTALLY ABANDONED a "the METRO" version of Firefox]</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;In a few cases there will be a windows version FIRST, but there are enough NON-METRO and NON-DOT-NOT platforms for a superior development experience [and results].</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp;Why must EVERYBODY re-learn how to do EVERYTHING AGAIN, just like back in the ".Not" days, simply because Microsoft WANTS IT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(last I looked, ".Not" development was a small fraction of the whole, based on the TIOBE index, just like Windows 8.x usage is a small fraction of the whole)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So NOBODY who is a SERIOUS developer is even going to TOUCH that CLUSTER-BLANK known as "the Store". &nbsp;I mean, self-promotion is SO easy, if you want to charge money for your application, but a lot of stuff is just plain FREE and people download directly
 from sourceforge and github and many other places. &nbsp;And it WORKS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And, of course, without "the STORE", then windows 10 is a BIG FAT FLOP! &nbsp;(that article even hints at it a bit)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway, the groans aren't loud enough YET, but when they become angry mobs of would-be customers NOT adopting 10, maybe Microsoft will finally REALLY LISTEN to what we have to say?</p>
<p>
</p><p>and not just SAY they're listening, with a few "see, see, see?" examples that are trivial by comparison.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[what they SHOULD have done is produce a version of windows that people are WILLING! TO! PAY! MONEY! TO! GET! and WILLING! TO! BUY! NEW! COMPUTERS! TO! GET!!! &nbsp;but they didn't do that, did they?]</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your Windows 10 Technical Preview related query here in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You need to have an “unallocated disk space” to the right side of the Partition\Volume you wish to extend on the same drive. Only then you will get the “Extend Volume” option gets highlighted or gets available.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may refer to the following Microsoft TechNet article for further assistance with this issue. These articles are for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, but it applies to Windows 10 Technical Preview as well.</span></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this scenario, you may try installing the Windows 10 Technical Preview on the 286GB drive and then try to extend the volume with 107GB.</p>

<h2>            Windows defender automatically removes malware</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Windows defender is removing automatically malware without asking me for my intervention. I went to gpedit.msc to disable this behavior but it didn't work. Also went to the registry and checked for&nbsp;DisableRoutinelyTakingAction (screenshot below). This is
 happening on 3 different machines. Is this a bug or did Microsoft quietly disable this?</p>

<p><span>I was testing Trojan:JS/Flafisi.D detections last night on the Yahoo news portal – and I noticed that Automatic remediation kicked in despite the fact that I still had it disabled – so I did some further testing
 with the eicar.com file and found that the behavior for this parameter is inconsistent.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is most likely related to recent changes that were made in the Windows Defender detection scheme. These changes were actually announced as changes for the Trojan:JS/Flafisi.D detection, but in fact they
 apply generally – so this is bound to cause some confusion, and might also have introduced some new issues. I’ll be testing this more thoroughly if I can find the time, but anyone can do this kind of testing with the test files provided by EICAR, AMTSO, and
 Microsoft:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install office 365 proplus which comes free from my college/uni moodle account and use the college's platform to access same so i cannot use an offline method or a wired connection.</p>

</p><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My HTC 8x has started to BSOD and send me other errors and won't start at all, and will often keep trying to restart itself over and over until the battery dies. How do I get my phone to start up, and stop BSOD'ing?? My warranty from my mobile
 provider is over, and this is a software issue, does anybody have a solution??</p>

</span>Anthony_Rauscher, </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the following steps.</span></p>
<p><span>Soft reset:press and hold at the same time and for 10 seconds the buttons power and volume down. The phone will restart.</span></p>
<p><span>If the soft reset doesn’t sort out your problem perform a backup of the system and try with a hard reset.</span></p>
<p><span>In order to perform an hard reset
<span>&nbsp;</span>follow this link:</span></p>

</p><p>Hi Marta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soft or hard resets didn't work, I now get an error screen the tells me to "insert the installation cd" which makes no sense, because it's a cellphone, not a p.c. It also tells me I'm missing hal.dll, and bootvid.dll, or that they are corrupt?
 What the heck is going on here?</p>
