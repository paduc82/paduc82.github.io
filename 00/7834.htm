    <title>Outlook Credential Prompt - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook Credential Prompt</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently we have released creators update within our environment, since we did this there has been five users with this same issue. &nbsp;The credential window for Outlook continually pops up. &nbsp;I have tried what feels like all possibilities including clearing
 out Credential Manger, Online Repair, rebuilding the Outlook profile, running SFC as well as Windows and Office updates. &nbsp;The strange thing is they never lose connection to the server and continue to receive email whether they enter their credentials or just
 cancel out and close the window. &nbsp;It is more of an annoyance than a functionality issue. &nbsp;I was thinking at this point it may be a bug introduced by Creators update, is anyone else experiencing this behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS = Win Version 1703 (OS Build 15063.296)</p>
<p>Office = Version 1704 (Build 8067.2115 Click-to-run)</p>

<p>It turned out to be the newest Office build, we have reverted four users thus far back to Version 1702 (Build 7870.2038) and this resolved the issue, you can find instructions on how to do this&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2770432/how-to-revert-to-an-earlier-version-of-office-2013-or-office-2016-click-to-run" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here</a>.</p>

<h2>            Considering the HTC HD2 but put off by the Marketpalce, is it good&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I know my title is very broad so allow me to be a little more specifc.<br />
<br />
I am torn between getting the iphone or the HTC HD2. I would like to go for the HD2 but I am put off by the market palce. I have seen that both the istore and the store available to android based ohnes are really good, if the windows marketplace any good.<br />
<br />
i am a little concerned that MS are going to let us down by being more concerned about money and not letting any cool apps onto the store.<br />
<br />
Basically I guess my question is can I trust MS to develop the marketplace as well as apple have the istore?<br />
<br />
On a side point is the marketplace the only place to download apps from or can I get them from elsewhere?<br />
<br />
I know I am asking a lot but your help is soo appreciated. I dont want to waste my money on a device that will have 2nd class support and community

            I don't use the Marketplace now b/c it only installs to the internal memory vs. the storage card. &nbsp;You can definitely get apps from a variety of places. &nbsp;In fact, when I see an application on the marketplace, I go to the developer's site to download the
 .cab file myself so I can install to my storage card.

<div>You will be the envy of many if you get the HD2. &nbsp;I *just* got the Tilt 2, but I'm already wanting to upgrade! The HD2 looks amazing!! &nbsp;:)</div>

            There are lots of places on the web where you can purchase great windows mobile software and you are not limited to purchasing applications from the Marketplace (where do you think we windows mobile geeks have been purchasing applications all these years?).&nbsp;
 You can check out <a href="http://www.handango.com/homepage/Homepage.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Handango</a> ,
<a href="http://www.pocketgear.com/en_US/html/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Pocket Gear</a> , <a href="http://www.mobihand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mobihand</a> , and a myriad of other third party stores for windows mobile software, or you can usually purchase software directly from the developer's websites (this is usually my preference).&nbsp; There are also some great websites where you can find free windows
 mobile software.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for recommendations for good software for a device, you might also check out the last
<a href="http://www.smartphonemag.com/cms/awards/2008/winners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Smartphone &amp; Pocket PC Software Awards writeup for 2008</a> (the data's a little old, but the developers who make it to the list make really great software).<br />
<br />
If you would like some personal recommendations for software, just post a question here.&nbsp; I have tried out lots of windows mobile software and I, along with the other folks who post here, could probably recommend some good choices to you.<br />
<br />
I think the Windows Mobile Marketplace could be a great place for developers to get exposure for their software and to make money.&nbsp; But I don't really see Microsoft making a ton of money off the marketplace since Microsoft does not set the price of the software.
 The Marketplace will be a great place to learn about software and will be a convenient place to purchase software, but I don't see it ever being the ONLY place to purchase windows mobile software.<br />
<br />
Whatever you do, don't make a choice about a mobile device just because you don't like its marketplace.&nbsp; Make your choice based on what you need and whether the device will satisfy your needs - and chances are, there is a great windows mobile application that
 will satisfy your needs even if it's not available through the Marketplace.

            <p>It depends on exactly how you bought Office 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought it factory installed and activated, you have an OEM license that cannot be transferred to your new computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought a "Product Key Card"/PKC, it to cannot be transferred. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought an online download, maybe it can be transferred, maybe not. You'll just have to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought the boxed CD/DVD then you have a Retail/FPP license. Depending on which bundle you have, it allows you to install on 2 or 3 computers at the same time AND to transfer the installation to another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought it some other way, let us know. maybe transfer is allowed, maybe not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have "used up" your 2 or 3 computer limit, then you have to make it "unusable" on one of the current installations.&nbsp; That means either uninstall it, or make sure it will never be used again (ie the computer has been scrapped or is actually dead).&nbsp;
 Note, the uninstall process does not actually contact the MS activation system, which may cause a minor problem during activation on next machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you do a normal install by running the setup program from the disk or online downloaded install file.&nbsp; You can try an internet activation. It may work.&nbsp; If internet activation does not work, then you will have to do a phone activation.&nbsp; When you phone
 in do not reply to the first prompt (it still will not work). You have to wait ( along time) until they offer you the option of talking to a live "service" rep.&nbsp; Explain that you have a free install (uninstalled or dead machine) and want to transfer it to
 this machine. In theory, at this point they should allow your activation to complete.</p>

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to config a shared mailbox for our company and added myself into the shared mailbox to test. But no matter how many times I tried, the shared email address just does not appear in the Outlook app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried sending email to the shared mailbox address, and there are no bounce back for the email, so I presume the email address is created successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know if there are setup I missed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Dot,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings, generally, when you successfully create a shared mailbox and add yourself to the shared mailbox, to add it to Outlook desktop client, simply close and restart Outlook and the shared mailbox should auto displayed in the Folder pane in Outlook.
 Note: it may takes a few minutes before the shared mailbox appears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if that doesn't work as expected, you can do below simply steps to manually add it to your Outlook client:</p>
<p>1. In Outlook client, go to <strong>File </strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Account Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Account Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Under the <strong>Email </strong>tab, select your account and click <strong>
Change</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click&nbsp;<strong>More Settin</strong><strong>gs </strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced </strong>
&gt; <strong>Add</strong>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Type the shared email address and click OK &gt; OK &gt; Next &gt; Finish &gt; Close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-outlook-d94a8e9e-21f1-4240-808b-de9c9c088afd?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open and use a shared mailbox in Outlook</a>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So it appeared to be an issue with the DNS on my vpn where I was using just one google dns 8.8.8.8 and ipv6 was not enabled. I enabled IPv6 and added one more DNS (open dns) and it seems to now work.</p>

    <title>adding leading zeros to a number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gigster99  say:</h3>
<h2>            adding leading zeros to a number</h2>
                    
<p>I had a column of numbers, six characters wide. the first record was 000001, that incremented to 999999. I accidently changed the column type from text to number - which removed the leading zeros. I cannot recover the numbers with leading zeros. How do I
 replace all single digit numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3 ...) with 00000(the single digit number). I'll use the same method to replace 11, 12, 13 ... with 0000(double digit number).</p>
<p>An answer will save me hours of work!</p>

                    Anyone else having problems with the version combinations in the subject? &nbsp;Any of the updated word apps crash on me constantly and won't remember my Office 365 credentials. &nbsp;Every time I start Word, PowerPoint or Excel I have to log in. &nbsp;It simply won't
 keep the credentials. &nbsp;As well, I can only use those programs for a small amount of time before I getting the spinning wheel of death and have to force quit them. &nbsp;Any thoughts?

<p style="text-align: center"><span><strong>Password alteration in KeyChain Access,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span><strong>by Microsoft software installers.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Here lately, for some reason, the installers for Office 2016 updates, has been messing with Office 2016 Passwords stored in KeyChain Access. The following procedure might help, also, it might not make a difference, or you may find items I suggest be
 changed, have been unaffected. Also I have had one report doing this cause the application to crash and the person removed the changed item and resigned in:<br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Quit all open Applications (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">including&nbsp;Microsoft Office applications</span>).<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>Next open <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>KeyChain</strong></span> Access.<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>Click on: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Passwords</strong></span>.<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>In the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>search box</strong></span> type in:
<strong>Office</strong>.<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>There should be 3 to 4 items that appear to have a serial or code number.<br />
(In the Description area you should see reference to Version 15.0 or 15.2, or 15. with another number related to current 2016 series)<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>Now click on the icon with an <strong>i</strong> in the center.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>Click on checkbox next to : <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Show Password</strong></span>.<br />
(this is a Sample of window that will open)<br />

</span></li><li><span>(I've Blacked out sensitive info so you could see window.)<br />
</span></li><li><span>Check, If the password you used to activate, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>does not show</strong></span> in each of the files, or is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>mangled</strong></span>.<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>If so then enter the correct Password.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>Repeat, above steps starting at step 5.<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>Once finished make sure to save changes. Quit KeyChain Access, and try Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote. It's still possible you may have to enter password once on one application; but, then only have to do so once and others should already be
 signed in.</span></li></ol>

            I clicked the link and the new one popped up. I also looked at the activity it looks fine it only gives me a couple of days though. The only way I'm able to see your responses on my phone but I would like this fixed on my computer. I even react brand a
 system restore it said I couldn't do it. So I really believe there's a virus. I have a call in for my virus protection that I pay for. But do you know of any way that I could just get the old one back?

<h2>            Meeting updates being sent out randomly without user intervention - Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are having a very strange problem with a few of our users. We are using Exchange 2016 with Office 365 Outlook 2016/2019. Let me explain with a scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>User A sends out a meeting request to User B, a few days later User B will get a "Meeting update" email from User A without User A changing anything on the meeting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I thought this might have been an issue with iPhone activesync as the first person who reported it had an iPhone 8, however the issue happened again today with two unrelated users and neither own an iPhone and neither have emails set-up on their
 current phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example of what the meeting update looks like when the user recieves it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f92740ab-f8ca-45a2-812a-701c2f16d35e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f92740ab-f8ca-45a2-812a-701c2f16d35e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see the calendar icon with an information symbol which indicates it's a meeting update.</p>

<p>Hi Parmi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are multiple users who have this issue, so there is also a User C and User D (who are sending meetings between each other) as well, and they are completely unrelated to User A and User B, so I don't think a repair of the .ost will work in this case.</p>

<br />In that case, best would be to reach out to Microsoft support. they may know some powershell cmdlets to check things from Tenant level and get some reports.

    <title>Shortcut to change cell reference - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> survivorist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shortcut to change cell reference</h2>
                    I have 12 sheets in a work book with the same formulas in the corresponding cells on each sheet. &nbsp;All of these reference another sheet so that the first formula in sheet 1 refers to the A column in the last sheet. &nbsp;All I need to do is to shift the cell
 reference by one column on each sheet e.g.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sheet 1 formula:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>=IF(Adherence!A16 = TRUE, 83.33, 0)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>then sheet 2's would be:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>=IF(Adherence!B16 = TRUE, 83.33, 0) and so on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a quicker route to achieve this than going through each sheet and changing the reference manually?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have 50 formulas per sheet all with the same structure where the only thing that changes from sheet to sheet is the column index.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Here's a quick macro that should do what you need.&nbsp; Needs to have 12 worksheets at the left of your workbook (+ the Adherence sheet at the righthand end.</p>
<p>This would work up to 26 sheets (would have to do something different if you needed AA, AB, AC, etc.).</p>
<p>Anyway, press Alt+F11, Insert &gt; Module, then paste this code and hit F5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub QuickFix()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim i As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For i = 1 To 12<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets(i).Range("A1").Formula = "=IF(Adherence!" &amp; Chr(64 + i) &amp; "16 = TRUE, 83.33, 0)"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next i<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

            Hi Robert,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft community,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per your query, you get Windows Update error 80072ee7 and we will assist you to fix the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Did you make any changes on the system, prior to this issue?&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you receive Windows Update error 80072ee7 while checking for updates, you might need to change or remove static IP addresses for the Windows Update service. Addresses are stored in an operating system file, called the Hosts file.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The IP address for the Windows Update service can change each time you check for updates, but some add-on programs for Windows add static address entries to the Hosts file. A static IP address for Windows Update will prevent your computer from getting
 updates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let's try to follow these methods below and check, if it works:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Method 1: </div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />
This issue may occur to some corruption in the Windows update components</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try to run the Windows update troubleshooter steps are below:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Type ‘Troubleshooting’ in the search bar and press Enter. <br />
2. Click on ‘View all’ on the left panel of the ‘Troubleshooting’ window.<br />
3. Click on ‘Windows update’ and follow on the screen instruction.&nbsp; </div>
<div><br />
If the issue still persists, follow method 2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 2:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>To remove static IP addresses for the Windows Update website, follow these steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Type This PC on search bar, then click on This PC tab, to open it.<br />
2.&nbsp;Double-click the local hard disk where Windows is installed, typically drive C.
<br />
3.&nbsp;Double-click the Windows folder, and then double-click the System32 folder. <br />
4.&nbsp;Double-click the drivers folder, and then double-click the etc folder. <br />
5.&nbsp;In the etc folder, right-click hosts, click Open, and then, when you are prompted to choose a program to open the file, click Notepad.
<br />
6.&nbsp;In the hosts file, check if the # sign appears next to each Windows Update IP address and host name entry. If not, add the # sign or delete the entire entry.
<br />
7.&nbsp;Click the File menu, click Save, and then try to check for updates again. </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the above information helps. Reply with necessary information and the result to help you further.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

<h2>            Disable Saved Locations in Outlook Meeting Request</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to disable the saved locations drop-down in an Outlook Meeting Request?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple times, I have gone in to update a meeting request, and accidentally change the location. I must not realize the mouse pointer is on&nbsp;<em>location.&nbsp;</em>When I then use the mouse wheel to move up/down the meeting request I am changing the location
 to a saved location in the drop-down. &nbsp;I send updated meeting request, notice the error, go back in, fix and resend.</p>

<h2>            Offline global address list is not showing one account</h2>
                    <p>I created a new user earlier today. Everything works the way it should for this account, except for one thing. It does not show up in the Offline global address list. Even when the user is logged in and searches the address book for himself, he doesn't exist
 there. This is true for both the web app and the local Outlook client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In mail settings, the 'Show in global address list' slider is set to 'Yes' and it is an Exchange Online account like the rest of the accounts on the domain. When I click 'Edit Exchange properties,' the "Hide from address lists" box is not checked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else should I check?</p>

<h2>            Lumia 950 Browser will not load specific websites</h2>
                    <p>When loading specific websites, the mobile browser will return a 404 error (for all pages on the domain).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Loading the page (such as a json file on the website) with another app, that does work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Loading the website on literally any other device, there are no issues whatsoever (which is how I know it's an issue with the browser on my phone). This includes PCs and android phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, my wife's phone exhibits the same issue, on the same websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the website&nbsp; where i consistently run into it (my own website): http://www.timfalken.com/</p>
<p>&nbsp;when viewing it on a Lumia 950 I consistently get a 404, while simultaneously having it work just fine on the desktop I'm in front of.</p>

<p>Tim, I just tried it on my 950XL. I just entered "timfalken.com" and it showed the website fine in both mobile view and desktop view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I entered www.timfalken.com OR http://www.timfalken.com I had difficulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not spend time with it just wanted to share my results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a new tab, try "timfalken.com" and see what happens. Try it with mobile view and desktop view.</p>

<p>Hey,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply. I've tried both timfalken.com and&nbsp;<strong>www.</strong>timfalken.com after your suggestion, but this still returned a 404.<br />
<br />
I've also tried on several WiFi&nbsp;networks and a mobile connection, with no difference. Same for desktop mode, sadly.<br />
I do not own an XL version, though I am surprised to see that there is actually a difference.<br />
<br />
I should add that, while my wife's phone (which is the exact same model) has the same issue, I haven't tried any other phones of the same model as I do not have access to any.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
As before, opening the website, both with and without "www.", in any other device works just fine.<br />
Should it matter, I live in the Netherlands and have Vodafone as provider. The issue also hasn't been around for that long; While I don't know exactly when it started, there was a time when I could access my website normally. While it seems unlikely, I'm not
 ruling out any issues with my website either, though I don't expect this as so far&nbsp;<strong>only</strong> the Lumia 950 (at least, the two I was able to test) have shown this issue. (and only with the web-browser I should add, any other apps retrieve data just
 fine, making this issue even stranger.)<br />
<br />
If I encounter this behavior with any other websites I'll also report back here.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for testing, though, even if just briefly! It may be helpful to know that this issue apparently only exists with the ordinary 950, and&nbsp;<em>not</em> the 950XL.
<br />

            <p>The options on the ribbon menu are under the Home Tab. The paragraph group of options are third from the left and there is an icon for both bullets and numbers.</p>
<p>You might check the PDF options on the work computer. You can&nbsp;'optimize' output from minimum to commercial press. My test were done with 'high quality printing'.</p>
<p>Another thing you might check is how the lists were constructed. If I do a hard return at the end of a line, and thus create a new paragraph, the bulleting works. Howver if I do a soft return (shift + enter) to create a new line, then the bullets do not
 work.</p>

<p>Log into your mailbox using a web interface.&nbsp; Delete all of the unneeded messages and create another server-side folder.&nbsp; Move to that folder all the remaining Inbox messages that are not new.&nbsp; Because they're not in the Inbox, Outlook won't be able to see
 them and won't try to download them again.&nbsp; They're still be on the server and you'll be able to access via the web interface.</p>
<p>This happens if you create a new mail profile.&nbsp; Outlook loses the information that tells it what messages have been downloaded before.</p>

    <title>Office&#47;Excel registry keys not present for user - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthonyberglas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office&#47;Excel registry keys not present for user</h2>
                    <p>I have an add-in that gets installed by a simple installer that updates the normal registry keys, like
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\</span><span>Office\16.0\Excel\Options</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>But no keys like that are present on the German user's computer.&nbsp; Nor the HKKLM versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as to where they might be?&nbsp; User reports that Alt-F11 brings up VBA, so not web version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>User is running Excel 365 16.0.11629 32 bit </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what happened to the keys?</p>

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alt + F11 is the shortcut key in the Excel application which opens the Microsoft Visual Basic For Application Editor. Coming to your Options Key under the Excel for Registry Editor, we suggest you follow the below steps in the keys missing computer and check
 the outcome:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Close the all Office applications that are opened.</p>
<p>b. Go to your Control Panel&gt; Programs&gt; Programs and Features.</p>
<p>c. Right-click on your Office product&gt; Click on Change&gt; Click on Yes when it is prompted with “Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device”&gt; Select the Online Repair&gt; Repair.</p>
<p>d. After performing it, restart your PC and Open the Registry Editor to check whether the Options key is present in the following path:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Excel\Options</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If still it doesn’t list in Registry Editor, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Screenshot of the problematic user Office Account page. (open any Office application&gt; Account)</p>
<p>Note: Please mask the email address and tenant name to protect your privacy.</p>
<p>b. As Options key indicates that an add-in is installed, can you find any add-ins listed via Open Excel applications&gt; File&gt; Options&gt; Add-in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Chitrahaas</p>

<h2>            I get Chinese Emails from my Windows Live &#40;Microsoft Account&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Everytime I get an email from my Windows Live (Microsoft Account), its in Chinese.
<br />
<br />
For example, they sent me a security code to verify my account, and it was in Chinese (except for the code numbers).<br />
<br />
A-How can I make sure I get emails only in English?<br />
<br />
B-How can I make sure that my account is safe? I already changed my password..<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

                    The Ocean County Library of Toms River ,New Jersey recently installed Internet Explorer 11 on all it's computers. Ever since- I have been unable to switch from Basic Yahoo into full Featured Yahoo E- Mail. This was never a problem with earlier versions
 of Internet Explorer. The message I receive at the top of my Yahoo E-Mail reads= Your seeing Basic E-Mail because your using an unsupported internet browser. All the other versions of the internet browsers always allowed for the switch to the Full featured
 Yahoo E- mail. Can you please advise me- Thank-you Kindly- JF

<p>What you are describing can happen if you open the Developer Tools in the DOM Explorer tab.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the suggestion was written for a version of IE before IE11 and would have to be interpreted to adapt to its UI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In IE11 instead of having a Browser
 menu you have an Emulation tab and can pick a different combination of User-Agent string and Document mode in there.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in IE11 with the DT open press Ctrl-8 to get in there.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An issue with the web browser can be the reason why you're unable to connect or sync your Spectrum Charter account to your Outlook.com account. For us to verify if the error is with the browser or Outlook.com, kindly access your Outlook.com mailbox using
 another web browser. After doing this, please check if you can add your other email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're attempting to use POP email protocol to connect your Spectrum Charter account to Outlook.com, you may need to enable POP access in your other email account so that you can sync it using Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.</p>

<p>We appreciate the update. Since you're unable to connect your Spectrum Charter email account even when using the Outlook app, it is highly possible that there is an issue with its settings. In order for us to know if the error is with Outlook.com or the
 Outlook app or with the settings of your Spectrum Charter email account, we strongly recommend that you connect or sync a different email account.</p>
