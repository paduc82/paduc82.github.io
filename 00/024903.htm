    <title>Change Windows 10 Enterprise To Windows 10 Pro &#40;Insider - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t.tasos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Windows 10 Enterprise To Windows 10 Pro &#40;Insider Preview&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I was testing the Enterprise Insider edition of Windows 10 the last few months, but I just found out that&nbsp;since the official release the Enterprise Edition has only 90 days trial, and is not part of the on-going Insider program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I'd like to move <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">from</span>
<em>Win10 Enterprise</em></strong> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>to</strong></span>
<strong><em>Win10 Pro</em></strong> (No by upgrading from a Win7 / Win8, but keeping my
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Insider status</span>).</p>
<p>So my question is, how can I do that without clean installing from the scratch and losing all my settings?</p>

            <p>what makes you think that enterprise edition of the insider program only has 90 days trial? What I've read so far is that as long as you remain an insider, it will remain activated as is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you share a link to the information from Microsoft that states what you say about a 90 day trial for enterprise?</p>

            <p>Well, the information about the Insider Program is too scattered around, can't really find any official FAQ from Microsoft aimed to Insiders. I remember reading somewhere that the Enterprise Edition will only be used through a Volume Licence, but I could
 have misunderstood something. However, there are the following facts that have driven me to my conclusion that Win10 Enterprise Insider is discontinued.</p>
<ol>
<li>Since the last build (10240) my Enterprise edition stoped being Activated, not Activated means I get a watermark, can't change some account and desktop settings and I don't know yet what else might happen.</li><li>When I try to mannualy activate, I get the error code: 0x8007232B. Trying the new serial keys doesn't work either, the key is accepted but I still can't activate the Enterprise Edition. The above error seems to occur because my PC is not connected to a
 corporal network with genuine KMS Activator.</li><li>My status under the Settings &gt; Windows Update &gt; Advanced Options still lists me as an Insider (there is a button with the text "Stop Insider builds". So I didn't quit the Insider by accident, I'm in the program but my Windows are not activating.</li><li>Where Windows 10 Enterprise Insider Edition used to be, now there is only a 90-day trial (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise</a>)</li></ol>
<p>I hope for an official Microsoft answer on the matter.</p>

            <p>I'm faced with a similar problem. &nbsp;I installed the Windows 10 Enterprise preview, onto a Microsoft Surface Pro. &nbsp;Nothing warned me during installation about the consequences of 'upgrading' to 'enterprise' edition. &nbsp;It was the only preview that I could find,
 and I needed to begin testing ahead of the final release. &nbsp;I presumed it would install the appropriate version upgrade to what already existed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had thought that Microsoft allowed you to downgrade other products, such as Office. &nbsp;I know you can upgrade to more advanced versions, but perplexed why we can't downgrade. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has discouraged me from future pre-release testing for Microsoft products. &nbsp;I can't believe all the trouble for something they are supposedly providing for 'free'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, just ranting, basically. &nbsp;Hoping to add to the list of people that could use a fix besides 'reinstalling from scratch'. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Enterprise is not for general consumption, there was and is adequate info on the download page for enterprise - and you have to tell them what you are using it for.</p>
<p>The simple answer is, YES, it will expire.</p>
<p>IF you want the consumer win 10 version you will need to do a clean install (which will not activate at the moment as the keys are blocked until further notice... ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, preferably re-install your qualifying OS and then update to win 10 using the ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the moment, the insider program - for new installs - is closed. Enterprise versions are Enterprise versions only and all users of such were clearly informed, so, bad luck really. Sorry, but.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sort of between a rock and a hard place, and all the fault of the user - one cannot blame MS for a user NOT knowing what they are installing - especially after the information given when signing up for the enterprise preview.</p>

<p>I suggest to install the original OS that was installed on your computer, then upgrade to Windows 10 for free. However, if your previous edition of windows was not a Pro edition then the free Windows 10 upgrade will not be the Pro edition. The free Windows
 10 only matches the pre-installed edition e.g., if you had Windows 7 Starter, Windows 7 Home Basic or Windows 7 Home Premium will be upgraded to Windows 10 Home. Windows 7 Professional or Windows 7 Ultimate will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 (the standard edition) will receive Windows 10 Home. And those with Windows 8.1 Pro or Windows 8.1 Pro for Students will receive Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no free upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise edition.</p>

<p>When sending an email in Windows 10 Mail, the contact will only appear when clicking "To: " when the contact has an email address entered into People App.</p>
<p>Go into your People App which can be found by clicking on the START icon in the lower corner of your screen.&nbsp; The program appears on the list on the left side or simply use Cortana to search for Preople.&nbsp; Make sure you have an email address next to one of
 your contacts and then try to start a new email with Windows 10 Mail.&nbsp; That contact should now be available to send an email.&nbsp; If this works then continue to add email addresses to all your contacts and their email will&nbsp; fill in automatically when you click
 on the "People Icon" at the end of the "To: " line.</p>
<p>Entering just part of the Contact's name will show a list of choices that could be applicable.</p>

            Does anyone have a solution for not being able to access the e-mail list when clicking the 'TO' icon in Outlook. I get a list of 5 names in small box in random fashion not in alphabetical order. And if I try to scroll, the box disappears. When I click
 on a name the address goes to the 'TO' line. Then the box jumps to another part of the screen with a new name added. However there are names that appear that are not on my 'People' list at all.&nbsp;

<p>Clicking next along side "To: " I first get a list of suggested email recipient.&nbsp; Then I type a letter next to "To: " and the contacts with that first letter will appear.</p>

            Hi Shaun...Thanks for the help. I was able to put a letter beside the 'TO' and got a number of possibilities for the recipient. However in the past when clicking on 'TO' all my 'people' would be presented in order and I could click on their names and it
 made sending/forwarding easy. This new way is not user friendly, as I would have to go through the alphabet to see all the names I may want to send a specific e-mail to. Lots more time involved with this method. I was hoping it was a glitch on their part or
 I was missing a step and that there would be a fix for it. I don't think they would create a new system to make it harder to use. Thanks again

<p>Dear Hans,</p>
<p>In the image below, you will note that I put a circle around the People Icon.</p>
<p>If you see the same icon when you send an email then click it.&nbsp; This will produce the entire list of available email addresses available in the People contact list. Only contacts with an associated email address will appear.</p>

            Thanks again Stuart...unfortunately I don't have that icon anywhere on the e-mail page. It IS at the far left side of the screen and when I click on it, it leaves the e-mail page completely and goes to my contact list. However it doesn't coordinate at
 with 'TO' 'CC' or 'BCC' . I'm still looking for an answer to having my complete contact list available for sending or forwarding...cheers

<p>Hans,</p>
<p>While starting to send an email in Outlook, if you look to the far left of the window you should see an Icon that will open the People App. See below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ec4fc77-deb9-4ff8-9c8f-577f3d7f4f57?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ec4fc77-deb9-4ff8-9c8f-577f3d7f4f57?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on the icon with the red circle and <strong>the Complete</strong> list of contacts will appear. This what I believe you are looking for.&nbsp; I only have room to show the "A's" but scrolling down will reveal all the contacts.&nbsp; Highlight the contact you
 want to appear next to "To: " and then click Send email.&nbsp; The contacts must have an associated email to appear next to "To: "</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe695f9c-d959-429e-9974-20892f05b0dc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe695f9c-d959-429e-9974-20892f05b0dc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After clicking Send email you should see something like this:</p>
<p>

            Thanks Stuart...I can send an e-mail from the contact list. That works great if I want to send a new e-mail that I write. Do you have a fix for being able to forward e-mails that I receive? I don't see a way to do that when I click the forward icon on
 an e-mail I receive. How do I apply my contact list people to the 'TO' etc. I appreciate your helping this not too technologically savvy person. cheers

<p>Hans,</p>
<p>Selecting a contact to forward an email to works exactly the same way as sending any other email. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>Belolw, I received an email for Electronic Skin which I want Samantha to see.&nbsp; So I clicked on the Forward button in the red circle.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71b3a05c-6b15-46fd-819e-c02975679ee8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71b3a05c-6b15-46fd-819e-c02975679ee8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I clicked on the People Icon on the far left panel indicated inside the red circle. This will open my contacts.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e77a51ae-a8f9-4693-89a0-9f3cb6359f03?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e77a51ae-a8f9-4693-89a0-9f3cb6359f03?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a partial view of my contacts from which I choose Smantha and click her name.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/41132fa5-aac6-4110-8b89-46efc2637748?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/41132fa5-aac6-4110-8b89-46efc2637748?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The following appears when I click Samantha and then I click on "Send Mail" which I indicated with a red rectangle.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e1308e5-e768-418f-a605-4432d8b6a7ee?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e1308e5-e768-418f-a605-4432d8b6a7ee?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Samantha's email will address automatically filled in next to "To:&nbsp; "&nbsp; and you can go ahead and send it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c263f97-e725-4b37-85d9-7412727156f9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c263f97-e725-4b37-85d9-7412727156f9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this works for you,</p>
<p>--Stuart</p>

            Hello Stuart...well, I tried that and followed those steps. However when I clicked 'send e-mail' it didn't fill in the names beside the 'TO' icon of the message I wanted to forward. Instead it filled in the names beside a 'TO' icon as though I was composing
 a 'NEW' e-mail.&nbsp;

<h2>            Blank page being inserted before the current page, not after. How do I fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am working with Word 2013.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I did but when I went to insert a blank page, the page was inserted before the page I was working on instead of after. &nbsp;For example I was working on page 2, went to insert a blank page expecting it to be page 3 but it became the new page
 2. I have no idea why, all of a sudden, it is doing this. When I was working on documents earlier, it did not do this so it is a bit frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a section break between two pages but I don't recall doing anything out of the ordinary to change the settings. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>There is a difference between a manual page break and a (new page) section break.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally when you simply tell Word to insert a break, it will insert the break where you tell it to. If your insertion point is at the top or in the middle of a page, it will push the rest of your page into the new page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can be very helpful when working in Word to display the non-printing formatting marks (including section breaks and manual page breaks).

<h2>            Help me recover my hacked Skype account</h2>
                    <p>Dear Skype / Microsoft,<br />
<br />
can you please help me recover my Skype account (.........) that seems to have been hacked in June? I have been using this account for years and simply do not want to lose it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately due to inactivity my access to the email account (*********@*****.com) that was associated with Skype account has been terminated and therefore I cannot use this email account anymore to recover Skype account (obtain a code). I do however have
 on my local drive a copy of an email that I have received from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Registered email successfully changed; received on 2010-10-06) when I updated the Skype account most recently. I can provide you with a copy of this email.<br />
<br />
I have tried multiple times to recover the Skype account using the online automated procedure, however every time I tried your automated system has determined that the information I provided was not sufficient for you to validate my ownership of the account.<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that I have initially registered my Skype account some 10+ years ago I am simply not able remember all the information required when trying to recover the account using the automated process. I believe that I have initially registered my account
 with the following email address:<br />
-******@**********.com or with:<br />
-******@*******.fm<br />
<br />
I also believe that I have included Wroclaw (city), dolnoslaskie (province/region),&nbsp;***** (zip code), Poland (country) as my contact information. I might have changed it to Amsterdam at some point as I was living that for some time.<br />
<br />
I also am not able to remember all the passwords that I have used with this account. I believe that I have used only one. However, I might have changed at some point and then went back to the initial password.<br />
<br />
I am also able to provide you with a list of persons that I most often communicate with using Skype and indicate whether it was a voice call or instant message. I would also be able to indicate the date and time of my most recent voice calls with my parents
 (Skype account: renata.swiderska) by looking at Skype history of my parents account.<br />
<br />
I honestly do not remember if and when I have purchased any Skype credits. I might have purchased Skype credits once or twice but if this is the case I had to take place a very long time ago and I would not remember the amount or precise date of the transaction.<br />
<br />
I would greatly appreciate if you could help me out with this issue.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,</p>

            <p>Here is an example for a single sheet.&nbsp; It inserts two blank rows above row #715. This pushes row #715 down to row #717.&nbsp; The macro goes to row #714 and copies each formula in that row down to the next two (<em><strong>newly inserted</strong></em>) rows:</p>

            <p>Should I add both the codes together. I'm new to VBA.</p>
<p>I copied the first code, it worked and subsequently I changed the revised</p>
<p>code provided above, and it says cannot be executed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally instead of telling the macro to add at Row 715, Can we change it to look</p>
<p>at the last row under Column A which has got a text "Total" and add row above this Row.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to bother you but your help is much appreciated</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access Yammer via browser just fine. But cannot login via mobile app in my Iphone. I used to be able to access via app, on the same phone but after someone added me to a new group, my app crashed. Now when i try to login, it is not letting me:&nbsp;</p>
<p>After i type in my email and password, the app takes me to a "Welcome to Yammer" page and then says "Here's an account you can use- tap to sign in."</p>
<p>Then below is written: <strong>Office 365 Account </strong>and below that my name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when i click on my name, it briefly opens my yammer page [for a split second] but then comes back to the same welcoming page. Has this happened to anyone? I would appreciate if someone shares a fix. Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please clear all APP cache, Data /&nbsp;and reinstall the&nbsp;latest version of Yammer APP and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please check if you are able to login to Yammer app on other device to isolate if the issue is&nbsp;device specific of profile specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue, persists we will need&nbsp;tenant / Network details&nbsp;to troubleshoot on this issue which can't be shared on this public platform.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would suggest you to create a service request with Yammer support team via Office 365 admin centre &gt; Support &gt; create service request.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Sreejith</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you suggested, I have used another Iphone to login to my Yammer account and it worked. Looks like it is an issue with my Iphone. I have deleted Yammer and reinstalled it, but the login problem still persists.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>How do i clear all APP cache, Data on Iphone. Phone only shows me option to clear cache in Safari and that's all. Also is there a way to delete saved Office 365 login details from Yammer app in iOS?&nbsp; Thanks once
 again for your time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since the App works successfully on other device, the issue doesn't seems to be with cloud Application -Yammer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be a device specific issue, which is out of support boundary for Yammer support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible try to reset your Mobile to factory default settings and test if this issue is resolved.</p>

            Was this ever really solved? We are seeing similar things with keeping previous credentials on the Android Mobile App for Yammer.

    <title>Slide Presentation Timer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slide Presentation Timer</h2>
                    <p>I am using Powerpoint 2010 and later along with Power Point on iOS (ipad). &nbsp;I have seen this done in the past, but don't know how it was done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to have displayed when in presentation mode the amount of time that has been spent on that specific slide. &nbsp;When advancing to the next slide, the clock resets to 0:00, and immediately starts ticking up. &nbsp;This way the presenter can look up and see
 immediately how long they have been on that specific slide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen some similar posts out there. &nbsp;The closest that I've found to help was
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_powerpoint-msoffice_custom/count-up-timer-for-pp/5c765d5f-ed0e-454a-9cb9-5c71fafe5c03">
THIS PAGE</a>&nbsp;, however that requires the timer to be clicked with a mouse. &nbsp;I need this timer to be able to automatically start ticking when the slide is switched, and also reset to zero at the next slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure this is just a matter of editing the vba a bit, but my lack of education there has me stumped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to help me with this? &nbsp;Is there an easier solution??? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it is worth, java is a no-go. &nbsp;I save the power point files on my ipad, and then display the presentation on a TV via my apple tv. &nbsp;More so, as I type this, I'm not even sure if macros work when done in this manner either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<h3> hai woo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for Mac v15.8 Can&#39;t Quit, have to Force Quit</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to have develop a minor problem after the "huge Outlook Saga" of cannot even launch Outlook properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reasons for the past few days, I <strong>cannot quit Outlook v15.8.1</strong> on my iMac, the Dock icon would still indicate it is loaded (small dot below icon), I
<strong>have to Force Quit</strong> the app every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this? Am thinking the quickest way now is to re-install the app. But not sure whether it will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, <strong>which one has the latest version?</strong> I am a Office 365 subscriber:</p>
<ul>
<li>The I<strong>nstall Outlook for Mac</strong> in my account, OR</li><li><strong>Office for Mac Preview Download</strong>?</li></ul>
<p>Many thanks!</p>
<p>HW</p>

<p>
</p><p>2) AFAIK.. both the versions of outlook are the same. The only diff.. is that outlook part of the preview contains a diff version number but they are the same.

            <p>Typically not being able to quit involves some process running in background. Perhaps check to see if Outlook is in process of getting mail— spinning or remaining in a state of accessing server or is ties up connecting or trying to complete its integration
 with the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no background activity, then something else is going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a delay SOMETIMES but it usually is connected with activity or stalled email gathering for a server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a thought.</p>

            <p>Hi Cletus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I don't think so, no accessing on server or something. If I quit the app itself will "disappear" from the Desktop but the icon on the Dock indicated it is still on. If I click on the icon nothing happens, no re-lauch or something, and only way is to Force
 Quit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Interestingly", if I leave the app and try to shut down the iMac, it will not shut down but getting rainbow wheel on Outlook, until when I force quit the app, then shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            I've been getting the same problem for the last few weeks. I've left the Mac on for ages waiting for any unfinished processes, but however long I leave it, it never seems to be long enough. Have to end up doing a Force Quit. Then the error report screen
 pops up with a default of relaunching Outlook. If I forget to untick that option I have to go through it all again.

            <p>Hi HW</p>
<p>Did you manage to solve this issue? It still perists on my MBA running outlook 15.11 (latest release).</p>
<p>I noticed that it happens especially after the laptop is on sleep. Soon as it restarts, I cannot quit outlook without force quit every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note, this is for an Exchange account. Also, when outlook is switched to offline mode (toggle) this issue stops. Makes me wonder if some process sync for exchange is happening in the background, although doesnt seem to be the case...</p>
<p>Thnx&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nokia N70 &#40;Variant Firmware Update Doesn&#39;t found with NSU&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I think Latest NSU doesn't find Updates for Nokia N70 Finland (Sonera Surfport, VL7) Variant. Because it doesn't even let you re-install current version which is: 5.0616.2.0.3 (24-04-06, RM-84).<br />
<br />
NSU Says: "No Software updates available for your phone." and doesn't give you to re-install.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure have Sonera released yet version: 5.0638.3.0.1 (18-09-06, RM-84), but it should atleast give you re-install the: 5.0616.2.0.3 (24-04-06, RM-84). So i think NSU isn't available even find Sonera Variant updates.<br />

            Hi - Did you install the original version (1.1.25 if I remember correctly and upgrade or did you directly install the new version of the NSU which is 1.1.27en for the English version ?) The reason why I ask is that if you installed the original version
 and it self updated then I'm pretty sure you have good connectivity to the internet and that Nokia just have to add the product code to the list as described here<br />
<br />

<br />
If you installed the new version straight off then you need to check for internet activity whilst you try to upgrade it to make sure the NSU is talking to the internet correctly.

<br />
Yes, NSU Version: 1.1.27en<br />
<br />
My Nokia N70 Firmware: 5.0616.2.0.3 (24-04-06, RM-84) was Updated in Nokia Service<br />
<br />
I have installed: F-Secure Internet Security 2007 (With Latest Updates) with Normal -security level (as your forum says). All Windows XP Pro Finnish (SP 2) Updates Installed.<br />
<br />
Computer is behind NAT (But Routers Firewall is Off and NAT/Public IP Is Static. Routers Firmware is Updated to Latest. Computers BIOS is Latest too.)

            Hi - Thanks for responding.<br />
<br />
Updating is a good sign - it means you have internet connectivity and the checking is actually taking place.<br />
<br />
That means it's just a case of Nokia either Nokia adding the product code to the NSU, or your operator authorising the new firmware.<br />
<br />
If it's any conciliation, I am in the same position with regard to the latter situation with Orange and the N70 in the UK, as are all the other UK Orange N70 users.

            In fact I have just backed up my phone contents and ran the NSU to see whether Orange have released the updated firmware yet - and no joy :(<br />
<br />
However interestingly enough the option to reinstall the firmware has now been removed. The statement "Your phone have already the latest supported software. No update needed." is displayed - even if it is grammatically incorrect :)

            so i contacted Vodafone Romania to ask about updating FW via NSU. They said that the fact that the phone is locked to Vodafone RO has nothing to do with the interferring with NSU, and that i should be able to update.<br />
<br />
Specialist, CS Business, Voice and Mobile Data<br />
replied.<br />
<br />
They suggested i contact Nokia Careline Romania to ask about this. I already did that even before Vodafone suggested this, but the reply Nokia gave was unsatisfing. Instead of clearing the problem, they just thanked me for being interested and writing to them
 and ended up with a list of service points, NSC's and point of collecting damaged phones.<br />
<br />
I just send a new e-mail to Nokia Careline in hope that i will get a more clear answer.<br />
<br />
0527279 is my code

                    <p>I'm trying to meet a rule. I need to calculate the percentage between the past due balance cell, G2, and the previous year sales cell, E2. And I want to get a true or false statement to fulfill rule 3. I'm struggling to figure out the formula.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The percentage depends on the perspective... If we assume that we have 2 values A and B, and A=5 and B=4 we can can ask 2 questions:
<br />
<br />How much of B is in A? 
<br />
<br />Which means A is the maximum and thus is associated with 100%, therefore the calculation is B/A = 4/5 = 0.8 = 80%
<br />
<br />How much is A over B?
<br />
<br />Which means B is the maximum and thus is associated with 100%, therefore the calculation is A/B = 5/4 = 1.25 = 125%
<br />
<br />So we can answer your formula is =E2/G2 or =G2/E2
<br />
<br />In my example, A and B have the same unit, but your values do not. Of course both are $ amounts, but one is "Sales" and the other is "Balance"... 
<br />
<br />I can sale goods for $1 and my bank account shows $1.000.000 or 
<br />I can sale goods for $1.000.000 and my bank account shows $1
<br />There is no logical dependence between the two, right?
<br />
<br />From that point of view: You could also have asked how much your Christmas gifts weigh, we can not answer that, sorry.
<br />
<br />Andreas.

<h2>            OneNote audio cannot be played if not saved properly</h2>
                    <p>I've had good experience with OneNote before, but since this year when I started to use it for recording my lecture, it has created a mess. I have experienced this same issue several times.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a MacBook Pro 2018 and I'm using Office 365 for Education version. When I was recording and making notes using OneNote, my computer just shut down and restart suddenly without any notice. The computer only restarted when I used OneNote recording.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
The real problem is that, if not manually clicked "Stop" button, the audio will not be saved and played. When I reopen OneNote after the computer restarts, the audio becomes an icon with a red X. I don't know how to recover the lost audio, and this has caused
 a lot of troubles. Any idea how to recover this problem?</p>

I see a red X and not my picture or clip</a>&nbsp;to see whether that may help you. Also,due to you were not manually stop the&nbsp;audio, the&nbsp;audio is not record successfully then the&nbsp;audio&nbsp;was broken so that you need to record the audio again.&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned, when you record the audio with the OneNote, the computer just shut down and restart suddenly without any notice.&nbsp;It seems&nbsp;may some background programs are interfering with&nbsp;OneNote for Mac, please try to o<span>perate&nbsp;the Mac with the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe

            That is an app similar to MSN Messenger for chat, but integrated with Office. We use it at work to chat with co-workers.. you can see when people are online, including in Outlook and other Office applications. Basically if you don't need it to chat with
 co-workers you probably don't need it (use MSN Messenger instead)
