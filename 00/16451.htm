<span><span>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do choose to upgrade your existing version of Windows to Windows 10, please be warned, it will make your recovery partition in operable, requiring that you have separate recovery media for reinstallation if necessary.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft band 3 replacement I would hope as you read this give your opinion</h2>
                    <p>I had the band 2 and love the way it worked with my windows phone,, and the functions are just what I wanted not to much that it is over complicated.&nbsp; Unfortunately my band split and after the second replacement I realized that that is the flaw in this watch
 so I Ebayed the replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realized I do not want another smart watch with a bunch of apps. What I want a fitness tracker walking, exercise,&nbsp; running, heart rate, phone call notification, (I would turn off the ringer and volume down my Phone, and still have contact if I needed it.)&nbsp;
 quick news, Cortana, (if MS keeps Mobile OS) quick pay.(I found the Starbucks useful), sleep tracker, just add a vibration notification when I leave my phone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The band is the right idea but, the wrong application.&nbsp; I have a collection of classic watches from over the years and was very hesitant to give them up.&nbsp; Some are $200 plus.&nbsp; The band was trying to be a replacement for those watches instead, it needs to
 be a compliment to those watches.&nbsp; The band 2 has the perfect clasp, and the sensors for the band, were some of the best. I would hope that Microsoft would realize that we do not need another watch!&nbsp; I have that. Let Fossil, Timex, Rolex, who ever supply those,
 just have them offer the band to complement thier watch. &nbsp; I just need the band and the display under the wrist that will attach to my classic Fossil or what ever watch that I wish to wear.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that Microsoft has not given up on the tech, and will come out with the band 3, and look at their wrist do you really want to give up your watch that you like?&nbsp; Instead of a watch realize that we all have watches, ones that we bought on our own, gifts
 from family, or co-workers, memories of&nbsp; times (tell me you do not have a Micky Mouse watch) and do not want to give them up to set in a box some where, but what I want is a band that will I will be able to attach the watch face that I have now that will give
 me the best of both worlds a choice of classic watch and a fitness tracker.</p>

            What exactly is it that you want to do?<br />
<br />
I've never tried to install different languages of same version.&nbsp; I suspect you would run into conflicts<br />
<br />
You can install language packs to enable more than one language in the suite.&nbsp; That may do what you want.&nbsp; Otherwise I suspect all you could do is install one, or both in separate Virtual environments.<br />
<br />
Yes, you can install 2003 and 2007 on the same machine. I don't know how well the alternate languages would work.<br />
<br />
The problem is, even if you do a custom install to a custom folder, large parts of the Office suite are installed to "standard" locations that we can't control. I don't know if languages fall into the realm, I suspect they do.<br />

<p>Hi Pravin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please provide the detailed steps you performed to share the file for us? I just want to confirm the steps are correct so that we can collect other information from you to check whether the issue occurs because the invitation emails are not sent
 out or they have been sent out but the recipients cannot receive them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Ran</p>
<p>Thank your reply, I go to OneDrive Folder, right click -&gt; Share -&gt; write e-mail address; one belongs to the organization and another outside organization -&gt; the click on Send; as you can see here in the image:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54ff30b0-182e-40f3-9b83-12a809bd4cce?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54ff30b0-182e-40f3-9b83-12a809bd4cce?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it gives message that this has been sent:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4c78d45-6979-4937-8050-cc1030b5317e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4c78d45-6979-4937-8050-cc1030b5317e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>But when I go to both the mailbox to check whether this has been received or not, because when clicked on Send, no error was displayed.</p>
<p>This is the mailbox status of both the account; received on personal ID, but not on Organization's mail ID. Please guide.</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>Pravin</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your so detailed reply. I want to clarify that the organization account should be the work or school account in your organizations.(Such as username@domain.onmicrosoft.com). Form
 the screenshot you provided, it looks like the both account should be the out of the organizations account.(***.gmail.com).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my test, if I share file with the outside organization account(**@gmail.com) with the steps you provided. When I sign in the gmail account to check the inbox, I find the email was
 recognized as spam. And I click the no spam option, then I can find the email in inbox. Please refer to the screenshots below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Please provide the following information to check the outcome:</p>
<p>1)Does the issue occur if you share the file with username@outlook.com?</p>
<p>2)Please share the file with the organization account(username@domain.onmicrosoft.com) to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Virgil</p>

<p><span>Hi Virgil,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your reply, this gives me some information. I want to inform you that, above steps involved testing with one of my personal&nbsp;GMail account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) and another work account ( G S***e ****@it*****a.o***g);
 that could be one of the reason you can both are outside organization account. Because it is on GMail.</span></p>
<p>After I shared this link, I have received the e-mail with shared link on my personal GMail account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) but it was not received on my work e-mail (*****@it***a.o**g; G-S**e account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your query:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)Does the issue occur if you share the file with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***? ?&nbsp; It worked with my one of the Microsoft Account ( ******@ho***ail.com)</p>
<p>2)Please share the file with the organization account(*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) to check if the issue persists. - &gt; Actual problem is this, sharing within organization or with the ****@u****pl.<span>onmicrosoft.com
 or with ****@it***a.o**g is not working.</span></p>

</p><p><span>According to the screenshot(2 did not receive) you provided, you add the organization account(</span><span>***@u****pl.onmicrosoft.com</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>With Gmail. Based on my test, I cannot add organization account(username@domain.onmicrosooft.com) to Gmail. So I want to confirm how you achieve it.</p>

</p><p><span>Meanwhile, for the organization account(</span><span>****@u****pl.onmicrosoft.com/</span><span> G-S**e account</span><span>), I suggest you go to poratal.office.com and sign in with<span>&nbsp;

<p>Note: Please click inbox&gt;Focused and others or junk email to search completely.</p>

</p><p>Besides, could you please share file with other users in your organization to check the outcome? In this way we can confirm if the issue only occur on the specific user.</p>

<p>Yes 2 did not receive the mail notification of file shared. Organization account has not been added to the GMail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried going to portal.office.com to check what you have suggested, but our e-Mail is on G-S**e. No e-mail or any option to check mail was available on the portal.</p>
<p>Yes, I had already tried sharing the files with different users within the organization but the result is same.</p>
<p>I want to understand if this has to do anything with DirSyn or DNS settings; so that I am not able to share withing organization, BUT outside organization. If so, what I need to do to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Virgil,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks, based on the steps you mentioned, i checked and found it doesn't&nbsp;have Exchange license.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/646b8355-0d21-42a9-a580-8ad5d8a97a0a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/646b8355-0d21-42a9-a580-8ad5d8a97a0a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>This is the screenshot of the license we have. But how does that make difference on sharing the files and links to the people within organization.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I again tried to share one file with one of the user from my organization and I noticed the same thing, no e-mail notification received at the user end. BUT, when I checked OneDrive online of
 that user, I could see the file shared under "Shared With Me"</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bfcf9a95-222f-4127-b1ad-ed24bf219a8a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bfcf9a95-222f-4127-b1ad-ed24bf219a8a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am just wondering it is able to share the file with the user, but why the mail notification is not being sent.</span></p>
<p><span>This also reminds me of that we are not able to use Skype for Business 2016 as it gives error of DNS:</span></p>
<p><span>I tried to resolve this issue by setting up the correct DNS on Office 365 account but once, it suggested to change the name server, and that change created issues for us, on receiving e-mails,
 and some of the e-mails were not received.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Pravin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you share a file with a user from your organization, you will give the user permission on the file.
</span><span>In this way the user can find the file under Share with me.</span></p>
<p><span>And if you have Exchange license, the user will receive the email notification at the same time. The file permission and the email notification are controlled by different function.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, I suggest you go to portal.office.com&gt;Admin&gt;SharePoint admin center&gt;user profiles&gt;under the People, select Manage User profiles&gt;find the user.</span></p>
<p><span>Click the account name&gt;Edit my profile&gt;check if there are values in SIP Address and Word Email.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            i would advice not to upgrade by web if you are using only a dial-up connection! it's a very long download &amp; if ever your disconnected at any point during the upgrade your phone will be unusable!<br />
<br />
besides you cannot use the modem of the N91 while upgrading you will need a separate modem connection w/ the PC/Laptop.<br />
<br />
if you got a broadband like dsl it's alright, more reliable &amp; faster than dial-up!<br />
<br />
remember to backup all your files before upgrading

            Hi gtsolid 
<br />
<br />If you are just using cell formatting to apply the currency symbol, select all currency cells, right click and choose Format Cells, then set those to currency - dollar
<br />
<br />If you have manually typed those currency symbols, you will need to use Find and Replace - replace all . . .       
        </p>

            Hi gtsolid
<br />You could try using the Replace command.
<br />1.	Press the Keyboard Shortcut Ctrl + H, this will bring up the Find and Replace dialog;
<br />2.	Select the Options button, the dialog will expand;
<br />3.	Select the Format button on the right-hand side of Find what, the Find Format dialog will appear;
<br />4.	Select the Accounting option from the Category list, this should display the current currency you are using;
<br />5.	Click OK;
<br />6.	Select the Format button on the right-hand side of Replace with, the Replace Format dialog will appear;
<br />7.	Select the Accounting option from the Category list, this should display the current currency you are using, for the Symbol select the required Symbol;
<br />8.	Click OK;
<br />9.	Select the Replace button to see the effect;
<br />10.	If happy select the Replace All button.
<br />Let me know if this is okay and if you have any other questions.
<br />Regards

<h2>            Help&#33; Word 2008 for Mac major track changes glitch&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am editing a book for a client and need to used track changes so they can see every edit. I am a few chapters in and the track changes feature just stopped showing changes on screen. I click that box and click ok and nothing happens. When I reopen track
 changes the box is no longer checked. I'm freaking because I am on a tight deadline!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied whole thing into a new blank document, problem remains. I open one of my old docs and problem isn't there. I don't know what's going on. Is it the file? Is it a new sudden glitch in my word app... should I download a new version of word? (yes, money
 is an issue...)</p>

<h2>            Excel formatting disappears</h2>
                    Just recently I have opened several saved spreadsheets and the formatting (cell colors, font, borders, etc.) has disappeared.&nbsp; I am running Window 7 Pro and using Excel 2010.&nbsp; Some of the spreadsheets are saved as 97-2003 some as 2010.&nbsp; As far as I know,
 I am not doing anything differently than I have done for years.&nbsp; How can I prevent this from happening in the future?&nbsp; Is there a way that I can recover the formatting from the affected spreadsheets?

<p>Hi Denise,<br />
<br />
There are a few reasons why the formatting of your Excel files disappeared. For us to narrow it down, kindly answer the questions listed below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which Excel files have disappeared? Is it the file saved on 97-2003 or 2010?</li><li>Have you tried to access your files on a different computer to see if the results are the same?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your reply.</p>

<p>Since the file formats you cite store formatting information, then I would guess they may have this extension but have been saved as .csv files.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try opening the file in notepad and see if it is really a .csv file (don't save it from notepad).</p>

<p>Two of the files were 97-2003.&nbsp; I am not sure about the other one.&nbsp; It was the first time that it happened and I didn't pay attention to how it was saved.&nbsp; I restored an older version from Carbonite and saved as 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formatting is missing when the file is opened from a different computer.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Tom Olgivy's suggestion to open in Notepad.&nbsp; It was gibberish.&nbsp; May I conclude that it was not accidentally saved as .csv?</p>

            Hi Sbongile,<br />
<br />
I would like to confirm the steps to auto sum the numbers: <br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Select the cell to the right or below the numbers you want to add.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click the Home tab, and then click AutoSum in the Editing group.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3097c0ba-e580-460d-8ffa-62dfb914dd5f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3097c0ba-e580-460d-8ffa-62dfb914dd5f" /></a>
<br />
<br />
Are these the exact steps you are using to sum up the numbers? <br />
<br />
To narrow down the issue, I need detailed version of Office 2016. Could you please provide us with the screenshot of the ‘Product Information’ (as shown in the screenshot below)? To do this, open any Office application, let’s say Excel, click File&gt;Account.
 &nbsp;<br />
<br />

            According to another answer (below somewhere, on page 7 currently, I think) the ability to sign in with a PIN has been suspended in this build, but it will return in a future build.

            Thanks did not see that.&nbsp; I am having this issue on a laptop which I performed a clean install and then setup the PIN login.&nbsp; I have another PC running 9926 which updated from the previous build and the PIN still works, although looking in the sign-in
 options the PIN is not activated.&nbsp; I suspect if I tried to change, the issue would occur.

            <p>Hello Harald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't have to separate the processes of exporting and importing personal data. If you have both Windows Live Mail and Outlook installed on the computer there is actually an easy way to migrate your folders. Just follow the instructions on the following
 website:</p>

            <p>The description you point, doesn't say anything about importing to Outlook. Does this mean, that just by exporting as describe, it should be in Outlook? This is not the case (I have closed Outlook and opened it again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i select Open Outlook datafile in Outlook, it expects this to be in the folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">C:\Users\Harald Mejlholm\Documents\Outlook-files</p>
<p>
</p><p>but this folder is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same when I select Import/Export in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have search the whole disk for files of type *.pst, but there are only one, which has to do with my Canon printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>It depends as to what type of account the other is, pop, IMAP or? as to what you would need to do.

            <p>The second mail account is of type IMAP. This was automatic set, when I created the account from the server, and cannot be changed (selection box in account properties dimmed). In WLM it is a POP3 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think, that changing to POP3 in Outlook would solve the problem? And if so: How do I do this?</p>

            <p>Hi Chanchan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of Windows 10 family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have queries about Windows 10 product activation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to inform you that Windows 10 comes as free upgrade, if you use 32 bit OS. Then it will upgrade to 32 bit and same goes for 64 bit.
</p>
<p>The free upgrade does not have the option to switch architectures, so the architecture will remain the same. If you want to switch architectures, you will have to download the&nbsp;Windows 10 ISO file in the appropriate architecture (32 or 64 bit) and&nbsp; perform
 a custom install. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the below link and check if it helps.</p>

            It can be turned off in the "Settings" app (turn off "Sleep mode" there). It'll use a bit more battery that way, though, as the display isn't completely turned off (the screensaver still runs without backlight).

            Is the blue light of any other use? It keeps me (and worse, my gf) awake at night, so I have to hide my phone every evening.<br />
<br />
If the light doesn't do anything usefull and can't be turned off, perhaps I could destroy/short circuit it somehow? (I do like it to go standby..)<br />
<br />
If I do not use my phone, I do not want to be distracted by it either. Up till now (~4 weeks) this blue light is the major drawback of the phone to me.. (the other one being the entire screen flashing on for no apparent reason)

            It can be turned off as you can follow Petribs instructions, i'ts just there telling you the phone is in sleep mode or that the phones active if you like.<br />
<br />
I do not recommend destroying the phone as i said it can be turned off

            Yes, I did so, however now it will not go to sleep mode anymore :-(. I never turn of the phone, so I know whether it is 'off' or 'sleeping' if the screen, since its always the latter. Unless the battery runs out, which will happen faster now.<br />
<br />
It reminds me of the 'everything is OK alarm' from homer simpson:<br />

Ow well, if this is the way it is, so be it. If the only thing I can complain about is a blinking light, then the phone must be pretty good :-).

You are correct. That is very easy, isn't it? Or put it in the pocket like I do. Very very very easy.

            Turning the phone upside down doesn't help much, the light is very bright. When at home I usually do not keep the phone in my pocket, so I think it is annoyance to do that just before I go to bed. I think I mainly feel that way because technically it shouldn't
 be a problem to have a software switch to en-/disable the led, but for some reason it isn't there.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I returned to this thread not to say the same things again but to post a related link that I found (while surfing for totally unrelated N73 info):<br />

            I'd just like to thank you for raising the question, at least, as it's let me know what the heck the light is for.<br />
<br />
How you can have a phone with a flashing blue light on the front and not mention it in the manual is a little amazing (I mean, I just searched the PDF manual for the word "blue" and it's not there. It's not under the list of important signals at the front,
 there's nothing pointing at it in the pictures of the phone...)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your posting. We will try our best to provide support for you.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your case, could you please create a new presentation to check whether it can be saved normally? If the issue doesn't occur with the new presentation, please copy the slide in the affected presentation
 and paste to the new presentation one by one to see the outcome. Another suggestion is to open PowerPoint Online and paste the content there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, could you please share the following information if you need further help?</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Your OS version and Office version(PowerPoint&gt;About
 PowerPoint).</span></li><li><span>Please capture a screenshot of the complete error message.</span></li><li><span>Does this issue occur when you tried to save the file to particular file format or location?</span></li><li><span>Did PowerPoint work properly previously? If so, did you make any changes like updating or installing some software?</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi IrfaanM,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please let us know what difficulties you encountered when you tried to copy the unsaved changes to PowerPoint Online manually? This is a workaround to preserve your work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that the issue occurs with all the files in your end. If so, since we test in 16.16 but failed to repro, we might need you to try some troubleshooting methods to see the outcome.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Please <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
open your Mac in safe mode</a> and launch PowerPoint to see the outcome.</span></li><li><span>If the issue persists in safe mode, please&nbsp;</span>create a new user account to sign into your Mac to see the outcome. This helps us to confirm whether the issue is related to your original user profile.&nbsp;</li></ol>

<p>The only thing I can think of that would trigger that message is if the file is on a shared server and someone else did a file save and altered the file while you were using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try making a minor edit to the file and then use File &gt; Save As and give it a new name.</p>

<li>Open <strong>QuickTime Player</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>File&gt;New Screen Recording</strong>.

<h3> slamb247  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 wont open or uninstall windows 7 32 bit.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have a problem with Internet Explorer 11 on a system with windows 7 32 bit system. When I click Internet explorer 11 it does not open the browser window, instead it opens a download box and has a file name there (which changes the file name every time
 you open internet explorer) and the only options are to close or to save the file. If you choose to close the download box then it shuts down but wont open the browser itself. If I choose save then it saves the file to my documents.</p>
<p>I have tried to uninstall Internet Explorer 11 but during the uninstall it gets an error and wont finish the uninstall. I have tried to uninstall it in administrator mode but the result is the same. In control panel I've tried to reset the internet options
 but the options box does not open.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Slamb,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that Internet Explorer opens a download box when clicked and does not open. Neither you are able to uninstall Internet
 Explorer 11 nor get it to be repaired. You have already tried a number of troubleshooting steps like resetting internet Explorer settings from control panel and trying to uninstalling Internet Explorer 11 as an administrator, however, none of them helped you
 enough to get this problem resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>You mentioned that it gets an error and won’t finish the uninstallation, what error message do you receive while trying to uninstall Internet Explorer 11?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></li><li><span>Were there any significant software or hardware changes made prior to this issue?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try to uninstall Internet Explorer 11 completely through command prompt and check if the issue persist with previous version of Internet Explorer as well.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps below to uninstall Internet Explorer 11 from Command Prompt.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Type <span>Command Prompt</span> or <span>cmd</span> in the <strong>
<span>Search</span></strong> box, right-click
<strong><span>Command Prompt</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Run as administrator</span></strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong><span>Allow</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>FORFILES /P %WINDIR%\servicing\Packages /M Microsoft-Windows-InternetExplorer-*11.*.mum /c "cmd /c echo Uninstalling package @fname &amp;&amp; start /w pkgmgr /up:@fname /quiet /norestart"</span></strong></li></ol>
<p><span>Please Note: Uninstalling IE11 will automatically restore the previous version (i.e., IE10, IE9 or IE8). To stop Automatic Updates from installing IE11 again, you will be required to hide
 Internet Explorer 11 Update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Internet Explorer works fine in previous Internet Explorer version (IE10), you may decide to upgrade Internet Explorer again to IE11.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps, Please let us know the results feel free to write us back for any further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.
</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply but I have already tried to do the uninstall with command prompt with the same result. There is no specific error number associated with the error it simply says "An error occurred while trying to uninstall and can't complete. When in
 command prompt it gives me the error message at each of the steps to remove the program. It seems to be affecting the other browsers I have like Firefox and Chrome as well, they start to run slow and take several seconds to close the browser window or freeze
 while loading video. I assumed I had a virus or a malware problem at first but I have run my malware cleaner and anti virus programs but neither can find a problem. I'm at the point now that I'm thinking of doing a repair install of window 7 just to straighten
 this mess out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other suggestions I'd be glad to try them before doing a reinstall of windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advanced,</p>
<p>Scott</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I'll take a screen shot of the download box and the the error message and post them shortly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the command prompt I used:FORFILES /P %WINDIR%\servicing\Packages /M Microsoft-Windows-InternetExplorer-*11.*.mum /c "cmd /c echo Uninstalling package @fname &amp;&amp; start /w pkgmgr /up:@fname /norestart"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It varies slightly from your command line where yours says quiet towards the end this one does not.</p>

    <title>Incorrect Status Icons in OneDrive Folder on PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ron-wi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incorrect Status Icons in OneDrive Folder on PC</h2>
                    <p>I use Adobe Lightroom Classic CC for organizing and editing my photos. I have a OneDrive folder on my SSD C: drive that contains folders with Microsoft documents and music. My photos are physically on my larger D: hard drive. I created
 an NTFS reparse point (hard link) within my OneDrive folder, to the folder on my D: drive where my photos are located. I used this command:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MKLINK /J C:\Users\Ronald\OneDrive\Photos D:\Photos</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lightroom catalog files are on my C: drive in a folder separate from OneDrive. Only the photo files are on the D: drive which is hard linked to the Photos folder in OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My issue is when I look at the Photos directory in the OneDrive folder on my computer, the status of all of them shows the blue circle arrows as if they are being synched. However, the OneDrive icon in the notification area says “OneDrive
 Up to Date.” When I go to OneDrive online, all the photo files are there. When I add and delete photo files, I can see then being synched by clicking the OneDrive icon in the notification tray. Yet still, in the directory listing of the photos folder in OneDrive
 on my PC, I continue to see the blue circle arrows for all photos there.&nbsp;The synch seems to be fine. It's the status icons for my photos that seem to be incorrect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One other thing I’ve noticed is when I right click the OneDrive folder on my C: drive and choose properties, it shows the file count and disk usage for all the files except photos. If I right click on the Photos folder under OneDrive
 and choose properties it will show me the file count and disk space for the photos. That seems odd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran through the steps to “Fix OneDrive Sync Problems” at this link with no luck.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion. I gave it a try but after OneDrive processed all the files, my OneDrive Photos folder,&nbsp;subfolders, and files all still show the circular&nbsp;arrows signifying a sync is in progress.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, I'm not talking about the OneDrive icon in the notification tray. After processing all the files following the reset command, that icon now shows up to date. Where I'm seeing the sync&nbsp;in progress icons is in the Status column in File Explorer.
 All the real subfolders in the OneDrive folder (documents and music files) show the green tick icons. It's just the Photo folders hard linked&nbsp;from my D: drive showing the incorrect status icon.</p>

<h2>            Excel Survey responses not populating</h2>
                    We recently created several surveys using Excel Online in Office 365. The responses are not showing up in the survey. Today we tested the link again and responses are appearing. Does anyone know what might cause this and maybe have an idea of if it is
 possible to recover answers that have been submitted? Thanks.

            <p><span>Hello Sarah,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Excel Community.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you created the survey, you might have prompted to select the name of the workbook to which the survey results has to be stored.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So could you please check for the workbook which was selected that time and verify if you can find the results over there.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may refer to the blog link given below which provides detailed information about the issue. &nbsp;</span></p>
