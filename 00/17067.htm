<h2>            OneDrive Sync issues after the Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: Documents moved to OneDrive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, I've changed default location of Documents and Pictures folders into OneDrive folder.</p>
<p>I've been doing this for pats 8 years until W10 when Microsoft decided to 'improve' Windows hahaha:)</p>
<p>Now, every time when I reboot pc- Windows taking my "user...@outlook.com" of the folders rights and therefore OneDrive is not syncing anymore- won't even show the error message.</p>
<p>Do you know guys any fix for this? (apart running startup bat file for sorting rights every reboot- think not very professional)</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS sorry for posting this on W8.1- there is no option for W10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Microsoft -WAKE UP!!!!!</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>"View Sync Problem" is greyed out.</p>
<p>No event errors. OneDrive icon shows "downloading...3 files remaining"</p>
<p>and I have to add user...@outlook.com with full rights into all folders inside of the one drive then OneDrive start syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW Where is the onedrive troubleshooter for W10?</p>

            <p>I did an upgrade to windows 10 pro from 8.1 Pro... Onedrive continues to crash with any attempt to do any&nbsp;sync settings. No doubt the changes in onedrive from windows 8.1 and 10 is the issue. I am trying to find a way to clear my onedrive settings which
 should fix this issue. I did a reset (clean install of Windows 10) and the sync issue is not there. Onedrive allows me to set what I wish to sync to the local PC.&nbsp; I went back to a windows 8.1 image I created before my upgrade to windows 10. I then upgraded
 once again to windows 10. The sync issue remains after the upgrade. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply... how do I clear settings for onedrive after an upgrade from windows 8.1 to windows 10. ? I will likely do the clean install again and move on. But I am sure others would rather have the upgrade work. I found the upgrade to be quite solid with the
 exception of my onedrive sync issue... </p>

            <p>I couldn't sort the problem. After upgrade to W10 created local account with admin rights- logged in as local, removed my MS account and then re-added MS one- Create backup before. All installed software stay on pc but all settings go.</p>

            I logged in local and the onedrive system tray icon functions.&nbsp; I did not see an opportunity to remove my Microsoft Account. ? When prompted in the local account to log into MS Account, I did and the onedrive issue is still there.

            I too had an issue with One Drive after updating too Win10.&nbsp; I have an excel document that I make changes to from my pc and my phone (droid).&nbsp; Before the upgrade there was no problem.&nbsp; After the upgrade I could not make changes from my phone.&nbsp; It would
 tell me "your changes conflict with changes made by someone else"&nbsp; I got on my computer, I made a change so I could see I had the newest version when I went back to my phone.&nbsp; I went back to my phone, dismissed changes, went back through opening the document,
 saw the change I made from the computer, deleted that change, saved it, even did a "save as" and "replace file"&nbsp; still got the "your changes.........."&nbsp; Moved the file from one drive to DropBox.&nbsp; Opened it on my phone, made a change, saved it, then my computer
 chimed at me, looked up, it was notifying me that there was a new version of the document click here to see.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try repairing the Office installation via the Windows Control Panel&gt;Uninstall a program link, select Microsoft Office and then click on Change and then select Repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not work, try using Windows System Restore to restore your operating system to the state that it was in before you used regsvr32.</p>

            <p>Hi Doug:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much&nbsp;for providing solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The repair part doesn't work. Not sure how to restore the system, my problem wasn't just happened; it was about a few month ago. And I think the following describe happened when I run the regsvr32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is the font "PMingLiU" which is in Fonts folder but didn't show in Word drop-down, and the font happened to be a shared template default font.&nbsp; When I opened up a doc SimSun will become the default, and I have manually change to a different font.&nbsp;
 This is really pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a solution?</p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 emails I send are suddenly going into regular recipients Junk folder</h2>
                    <p>Very recently every email I send using Outlook 365 goes to the recipient's junk mail folder, INCLUDING clients I have emailed regularly for many years. Incoming emails work as per normal, it's just anything I send myself. I have tried removing all images
 and links from my outgoing email and even reinstalled Office, but the issue remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is making my life very difficult. Any suggestions on why this is happening and how to fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't come back with the generic response, telling me to ask my clients to mark my messages as safe, as they will obviously not get that message to start with and I have been emailing them for years, so there is no reason why they would think to look
 in their junk folder for messages from me either.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>If you have the status Setup in progress for the domain, please finish it. For more information about the steps, please refer to the article:

<p>Hello Nemanja and Pedro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pedro, I am not sending out bulk emails or anything, so I don't see how I could get blacklisted. I am worried about using such I.P. integrity sites, as I have heard they always come back with one or two saying you are blacklisted, then you have to go to
 the apparent blacklist registry and pay to get whitelisted, i.e. they are scam sites set up just to con you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nemanja,</p>
<p>I don't use Office 365 managed domain, just the domain my website uses. Only have Office 365 Home, as just running a very small business from home. My domain is with crazydomains and my website and email is hosted by Hostnine. I have replied to your private
 message and copy and pasted a header from an email that a recipient forwarded to me as having landed in their junk folder, hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you both,</p>
<p>Michelle</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Michelle,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you don't use Office 365 managed domain email address we cant help you too troubleshoot the case. The best place to address your concerns should be your DNS provider. With the offered information, my understanding is that it might be something wrong
 with your DNS records. So please, contact your DNS provider and ask for help in configuring the records.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding,</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Nemanja,</span></p>
<p><span>We have two computers on my small office and they share the same I.P. My daughter also plays games on one of them and a virus check has found a proxy changer Trojan&nbsp;on it. Even though that computer is not the one I
 use for emails, it does have one of the installations of Office 365 Home on it. Is it possible that this Trojan has somehow gotten our I.P. blacklisted?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Since
 you don't use Office 365 domain, and this couldn't be related to Outlook desktop client (if you send a message form web mail, it will still go to junk) there is not much left for us to troubleshoot.
</span></p>
<p>I
 can just say that from my personal experience, this should be related to someone's action of blacklisting your email address or domain. These are the most common cases. I cant say that this is not related to a virus or some kind of malware, but the best chances
 are that its domain or email related. If you want to check your IP health, you could try to search the web for a services which could help you to check it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once

<p>Thank you for posting in microsoft community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Security certificates error occurs when the security certificate that you are using expires. Therefore I would suggest to change the time/date of your computer because date &amp; time has a major role in certificate issues. If the date and time is incorrect&nbsp;there
 is&nbsp;a chance that certificate error will&nbsp;pop and it will ask to put the certificate on the site that you would like to browse</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also check the certificate expiration date of website&nbsp;by typing inetcpl.cpl in run then go to&nbsp;content tab and click certificate</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope it works</p>

            Sometimes, it is problem within the browser and in other cases, it is problem related to the operating system. So if you are using Internet Explorer and it works fine, then you have to update Firefox and Chrome.

</p>
<p>I wish to create a list of two words per line from many paragraphs of text. </p>
<p>My question: how to use Find &amp; Replace (with wildcards) to replace *every second instance* of a space between words - does anyone know the syntax please?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If this is not possible, I'm wondering if I just need to use a much slower simple Word macro that repeats until the end of the document?&nbsp; Many thanks for any advice on this.</p>

<p>Basically:</p>

</p><p>Is there anyway we can disable the IE 11 in windows 10 prompt to save-open-saveas or not. because this is giving me headache. I can't find any blogs or helpful notes apart from saying that this is not possible. In our Windows 7 environment we can tell IE
 on what to do, but currently in process to upgrade all systems to Windows 10 and IE11 and coming across some very bad experiences. It will be really helpful if someone already managed to fix this issue.<br />

    <title>Word printing a booklet using a Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shydewhite  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word printing a booklet using a Mac</h2>
                    <p>I work at a church and we print a bulletin every week for our worship service. I was using inDesign until we upgraded to El Capitan and now that program won't work .
</p>
<p>So, we began using Word, which works just fine for the creation of the document, but it won't let me print it as a booklet. I am not given the option to print as a booklet. I print each page onto legal size paper, then duplex - to make it 2 sided, then using
 the printer I make it into a booklet which the printer folds and staples. The main issue is that I lose quality each time I have to run the paper through the machine. 1 step down when I duplex, another step down when I do the booklet. It just doesn't look
 as crisp as it did when printing straight from the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Word, in 365, give the option to print as a booklet from the print menu?</p>
<p>I have tried saving it as a pdf and printing a booklet from there. It does not work for me either. It prints the text very tiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mainly, I want to know if microsoft has addressed the issue of booklet printing from Word for the mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. We are using Word 2011</p>

Hi Shydewhite,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Given the situation, if you can’t use InDesign on Mac of EI Capitan, I suggest you try the way in
<a href="http://indesignsecrets.com/topic/el-capitan-issues-with-indesign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://indesignsecrets.com/topic/el-capitan-issues-with-indesign</a> to see the outcome.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you want to get booklet printing in Word 2011, I suggest you use a third-party software recommended in
<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4083268?start=0&amp;tstart=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the discussion</a> to give a shot. It may be a better way to achieve your requirement.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 sites or any support related to technology.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thanks,</p>
<p>
Cliff</p>
        </p>

</p><p>In Word 2016 for Mac, there is no Book Fold option. However, you should be able to set up something similar with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the OS X menu bar, choose <strong>File&gt;Page Setup</strong> and set the page orientation to
<strong>Landscape</strong> (the second icon). OK out.</li><li>Choose <strong>Format&gt;Document</strong> and select the <strong>Margins</strong> tab.</li><li>Check the <strong>2 pages per sheet</strong> option.</li><li>Print a sample and see if it works with your bulletin layout.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi Shydewhite,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, you have tried saving the document as a pdf and printing a booklet from it on Word Mac, while you donot like the tiny text. Do you print a booklet via
<a href="https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/21068/create-booklet-pdf-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the third-party software</a> Cliff mentioned? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, we suggest you download Office 2016 in <a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 portal</a> and follow John's suggestion to set your booklet in layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, we suggest you try using this tool to format a book for print in Word.</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/21068/create-booklet-pdf-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download and install the tool</a>.</p>
<p>2. Open your document and navigate to File&gt; Print.</p>
<p>3. Click on the PDF drop-down box and select Create Booklet.</p>
<p>4. When Preview opens, go to File&gt; Print and select 2 sided with short-edge binding.</p>
<p>5. Press Print.</p>

            <p>Use the "2 pages per sheet" option in the <strong>Page Setup</strong> dialog to create the half-sized pages. Then save the document as a PDF and print it from Adobe Reader using the booklet option. I have done this in WinWord and found it works flawlessly;
 you don't have to reorder the pages, as Adobe handles it for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also, from Adobe reader, create booklets with folded pages (half sheets) from full-sized pages, but the print will be reduced, so it's harder to gauge the output than if you create the pages at half size to begin with.</p>

            <p>Thanks. I have saved as a PDF and used the print booklet option. I need it folded and stapled, so it doesn't suit the needs. When the print is too small, the people in the church service can't read it. It's tiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No worries, I think I'm going to have to bite the bullet and get InDesign 2016. I just hate having to pay $20 per month. At least I will be able to do what I need to do.</p>

            Yes. I tried the PDF thing before I posted on this thread. I can't have the words be so small and I need the booklet folded and stapled. Thanks though.

<p><span>Hi Irving,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that you are using the co-authoring feature in an Excel file in a site library in SharePoint Online. If yes, about “</span><span>Something
 went wrong cannot read property 'code' of undefined - This error Message is constantly appearing to SP users.</span> The Server is Busy now. Try again later - Error message showing up to SP users when try to access files.”, when do you encounter the error

<p><span>Note: Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, please check if the issue happens in a specific file, in a specific site library or a specific site.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I dunno...I think there will be a diff pushed out mid-week next week to address some of the install issues etc.&nbsp; I wouldn't look for additional features for 2-3 weeks.&nbsp; From a dev standpoint, they can't get feedback on features if folks can't install etc.&nbsp;
 Best fix the fundamentals and worry about the happy happy joy joy in another build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being a dev myself, I'm loathe to be critical (glass houses and all) but it is what it is...</p>

<p>By looking at your previous posts it looks like what you might&nbsp;really be asking is</p>
<p>"When will Microsoft release a good Insider build ?" </p>
<p>as most of the resent builds have had many more&nbsp;issues than usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer that question you need to&nbsp;check posts by&nbsp;Dona. <a href="https://twitter.com/donasarkar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://twitter.com/donasarkar</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will&nbsp;notice Dona has have been talking about&nbsp;having&nbsp;constant (N&nbsp;+ 1) issues,
</p>
<p>that is where the previous build does not update well or at all to the next build.</p>
<p>When they fix this updating issue each time&nbsp;then they usually release a new build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next public release is expected this Fall&nbsp;(Autumn) version 1709 , September 2017.</p>

<p>Soumen you need to stop asking this.&nbsp; A build or two ago you polluted the boards with 14--14!--threads with this same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Builds come out when they come out.&nbsp; We get our information from Dona's Twitter feed, and either CBarnhorst or CrazyKats will post updates here when there's a new build incoming. We'll also usually get an update when there's a new canary in BuildFeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using an Insider build on your main machine, which seems to be the case since you complain about the builds you have every time, then that's tough--you're not supposed to have an Insider build on your daily driver machine for the express reason
 that they're going to have problems of varying severity.&nbsp; 16125 is one of the more buggy builds I've seen, but when it crops up with a problem, every machine dual boots with the current public build.</p>
<p>

<p>First of all I not complain&nbsp; to you ok..! &amp; second .. I just ask my fellow insider with each time about problems&nbsp; if you say that it polluted &amp; you have right to say &amp; you are have right to dictate any one? if so then I not ask any ! &amp; last I just ask only
 one about this&nbsp; after so long&nbsp; so just look out the date ! I don't understand why you target me while many others also ask same with several time!&nbsp; ok&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Unable to DL Insider builds - PC Settings asks me to register &#40;I am already&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to join the Insider Program.</p>
<p>I signed up already on your website (accepted the license agreement). I am running the latest public build of Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to PC Settings &gt; Updates &gt; Windows Insider Program, add my MS account it still says I have to register into the program. But I already am. It won't let me do anything.</p>
<p>It directs me to the website but there's no register button or anything like that there. Please see the screenshots.</p>
<p>What should I do? Do I have to wait? I tried leaving &amp; rejoining the program, didn't help. Tried a second MS account, also didn't help.</p>

<h2>            Extracting Data from Multiple Cells in One Tab Based on A Condition and Adding to One Cell in Another Tab</h2>

<p>There will be a cell for each that ties them together (OLBG#)</p>

            That is simple, you Range.Find and search the column, use Range.Offset for each found result and combine the cell contents to a string. Are you familiar with UDF?<br /><br />Andreas.

<p>You're amazing, thank you for your help.</p>
<p>I've made this too confusing. To explain, I make up data and then figure it out after due to privacy issues, but there is nothing in this situation I can't divulge.</p>
<p>So the data I need is in tab "Control Requirements" in cell ranges F8:F13, F17:F72, F76:F109, F113:F240, looking for "Yes", then if yes if found taking the contents of the cell from 2 cells to the left and exporting the data to the other tab (Non-NBP Report).</p>
<p>What will link them is the OBLG# found in cells G32:(varies, depends based on how many selected elsewhere) in tab "Non-NBP Report", AND in tab "Control Requirements" in ranges f35:f65, f80:F100.</p>
<p>There will be multiple Yes answers, so the tricky part is having those controls (multiple) get added to the appropriate, specific cell.</p>
<p>Its a lot, I know. Any help will be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            I have to quote you:
<br />
<br />&gt;===
<br />So the data I need is in tab "Control Requirements" in cell ranges F8:F13, F17:F72, F76:F109, F113:F240, looking for "Yes", then if yes if found taking the contents of the cell from 2 cells to the left
<br />===&lt;
<br />
<br />2 cells to the left are the cells in column C and D, you must pass all cells to the UDF otherwise the results can be wrong, because Excel did not call the UDF if one of these cells changes.
<br />
<br />Here is the sample file:

<h2>            Save Windows phone &#38; inject hope for continue supporting Windows 10 on Phones for a special Target Market</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft team,</p>
<p>As we have already announced that the support of windows phone will be ended till end of 2019 we need to declare our worries, feelings &amp; Ideas&nbsp; regarding this decision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We know that Microsoft has lost the market for windows phone but instead of leaving us &amp; this platform alone it can target a special market/people all around the world &amp; get some privileges to those who are insisting to have it in their hand considering
 all the limitations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are lot's of reasons that some people has selected windows phone &amp; they have payed for it and also wants to continue using it.
</p>
<p>They have trust to Microsoft&nbsp; this is the time that Customer Service Support of this global corporation should help &amp; support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can also have the hope for Lumia 960 …&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warm Regards,</p>
<p>Amirhossein,</p>
<p>On behalf of all the people of the world who wants to continue using Windows Phone needs Microsoft supports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I absolutely understand how you feel but the reality is that Microsoft has made the decision and have an EOS (End of Support) cycle that they follow. At least we got a little extra time with our beloved Windows Phones. As sad as it is, it is time to move
 on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I just got my first Android device. I had a difficult time initially but after installing Microsoft Launcher and as many Microsoft apps as I could, it has come close to a Windows Phone experience. It is not exact but the intuitive nature of Windows
 Phone is there with Launcher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just my thoughts....</p>

<p>Dear Jack,</p>
<p>I fully understand that Microsoft has made the decision, but we as the loyal customers of Microsoft, expect a better migration or leave some special offers for the ones that has already synced all their lives with their mobile devices &amp; in any reason would
 not like to choose a different operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I myself experienced both iOS &amp; Android, I confuse so many times working with them Do you believe me ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>for Myself if Microsoft wouldn't enter to smart phone market I would never change my NOKIA 6300.</p>
<p>At that time I was fan of NOKIA. After lunch of windows on Nokia I set my long term plans on My Microsoft account &amp; other services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your comments but I'm just trying to find a way to tell my Needs &amp; Ideas to Microsoft.</p>
<p>I always try to advertise for Microsoft since I highly satisfied with its products &amp; services.</p>
<p>

<p>I totally agree with you Amirhossein! However, it is a business decision and as much as I am saddened at the loss of Windows Phone I recognize the need for them to make that decision as much as it hurts me. As I indicated above, I finally made the decision
 to move on to Android and as much as it such a different experience I had a hard time with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, I read an article on Microsoft Launcher and immediately installed it. It immediately made the Android experience better! I was no longer struggling with it and my comfort level dramatically increased. Life goes on and it is what it is. I am
 enjoying the Microsft apps on my Galaxy Note 9 and as each day goes by I get more and more comfortable with Android.</p>

<p>So I am NOT an Apple person, therefore I chose to look at the myriad of choices out there. Ultimately I chose the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 partially because my wife needed a new device (her Windows Phone was very old). We did a lot of research and decided on
 the Note 8 and we liked it particularly after installing Launcher! Also, I made the decision for me because of reviews, the memory of the device and most definitely because of the screen size and quality of the screen. It was expensive, but I got it on sale
 and I will keep it for several years. Samsung has done a great job!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did look at the iPhone (my son and daughter-in-law both have them and love them) but it just was not for me and I felt there was more customization available on the Android platform. Personal decision! I would advise looking at the Android choice and go
 to an Apple store and look at their devices. Take the time and check out both platforms. It is a lot of money and you need to make sure it is right for you!!</p>

<p>Launcher is NOT going to change the phone to Windows Phone. That is NOT their intention but it does give a familiar Windows Phone experience. I used the Note 9 for three days without Launcher. I was confused and felt it was not anywhere close to the intuitive
 nature of Windows Phone. It was very confusing! As soon as I installed Launcher, immediately it changed the experience!</p>

<p>Great comment, many and I feel the same, but the current Microsoft leadership will listen to absolutely no one - in a stark contrast to what they claim.
<span>Their only worry is in daily financial reports, and they do not care about anything else.
</span>They finally have chosen to actually become the 'evil empire' instead of just being called so out of envy by rival-bribed yellow press 'writers'-losers. Unfortunately, sometimes it's enough to shout loud and long and people will believe even the most
 stupid claims over time. </p>
<p>//</p>
<p>One real mistake the previous otherwise great Microsoft's leadership did was they did not recognize and counter-act this propaganda
<strong>out of some aristocratic ethics</strong>. They even helped Apple to survive when they could totally destroy it or buy it out with all guts in 1997! They should have start plugging foul mouths at least in 2005 but they did not. And all these ****pedia
 'resources' kept shaping public opinion that Microsoft's products are lame etc, ad every little mishap, often quite stupidly but when you do not answer it, it sort of becomes true as you silently agree, right?</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Coming back to the current situation, Microsoft is trying to be more cynical but unfortunately again, this cynicism is only diverted at its user's base. They are trying to be merry or pretend so with Google and Apple, the most stupid idea even if it's just
 pretending! They forgot that their users were the only actual strength they had.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Coming back to their product range and plans, these are not smart either. You can ask anyone, and will get the same answer: a key to long-term sustainability and prosperity in any big business is diversification. If you think that you can get away with just
 investing in cloud services only (putting all eggs into one basket) and forgetting about the end-point user infrastructure, you are making a terrible judgement mistake. Only personal 'ecosystem' that includes hardware and software and has a distinctive 'feel'
 to it will be sustainable longer-term. Because a simple question that the current leadership cannot answer is: what fundamentally different can Microsoft offer with its cloud services? Are they out of their mind to think that Google, Amazon and Apple cannot
 just do the same? And they do! And why to use Microsoft on non-native device then? The only truly different thing they can offer is an alternative ecosystem experience, to 'consumers', to businesses, to enterprise.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>And this did not fail at all with Windows Mobile, despite all the stupid comments that it died by itself, 'developers not supported' etc. Their current leadership
 that can only produce an Android launcher. This is called <strong>poor leadership</strong>.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Argument that it 'never had a market share' is just totally junk. What share did Android have when it entered the market? The market that has been long-before occupied by - yes - Microsoft and Apple and some others? How long did it take in time and money
 to actually become profitable - enormous! But was it worth it - yes!</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>So with Microsoft's current policy it's not even a question of mobile OS. It's a question of Windows 10 OS, all of their hardware, OS making in general and eventually, all 'consumer' apps. Their quality has been degrading for quite some time now (laggy,
 buggy, no productivity features for which we actually loved them). The 'leadership' meanwhile was putting
<strong>all the effort to push their cloud</strong> to whichever hole they could find. Strange, I thought they should know IT history and what happened to the old-generation 'mainframe' makers (IBM and the dwarfs). They thrived and then quite suddenly they
 died. This is no different - no diversification. Cloud becomes out of vogue once again&nbsp; - Microsoft is dead, this time without resurrection.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>The diversification and long-term success, dear Microsoft, comes<strong> quite naturally from the end-point users as all people are different</strong>. No need to invent anything in this business model, just build your own ecosystem and invent in technology.</p>
<p>I have been a life-long supporter of the company, but once I will make a switch from it I will never come back. I will be advocating others to do the same as well, this includes all services from Microsoft - not worth it, we live one time and I want to have
 a reliable partnership. Failure to recognise it is the absolute failure any business can do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So again I need to preface my comment with I am still very new to Android (just recently got my first device). What I should have done is write down the steps I took in setting it up but I did not because I was trying different things. I had to try a variety
 of things but eventually was able to set it up the way I wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Outlook (as well as all the other Microsoft apps I always use). When I set it up I used my primary Microsoft account and all my contacts came over. That was fine but I wanted the contacts to appear in the Android Contacts app and they were not.
 It worked well just using the outlook app but I wanted the other one to have them as well. Eventually, I got them to show. I ended up setting up my account using exchange active sync and it worked.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can use your Outlook.com account to use Xbox account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>"Microsoft account" is the new name for what used to be called a "Windows&nbsp;Live ID." Your Microsoft account is the combination of an email address and a password that you use to sign in to services like
<strong>Outlook.com, <span>OneDrive</span>, Windows&nbsp;Phone, or Xbox&nbsp;LIVE.</strong> If you use an email address and password to sign in to these or other services, you already have a Microsoft account—but you can also sign up for a new one at
 any time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Over time, all Microsoft services will be switching from the old name to the new one. You might continue to see mentions of "Windows&nbsp;Live ID" instead of "Microsoft account" for a while—for example, on xbox.com or windowsphone.com—but the names
 mean the same thing, and the services will be updated soon. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, refer to the link.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the prompt reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The possible reason why the command was ignored is the number of members in your current group. Skype version 8.42 should still support the command if you have 50 or less members in the current group. You can try on removing some members in the group until
 it reaches the 50 max limit then try to use the /golive command or the CTRL+SHIFT+K.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of this will send a notification to all the group participants that a group call will be initiated. It will not ring all the members to prevent any interruptions with the participants of the group.
</p>

<p>Select the milestone shape and chose the Open ..&nbsp;command at the bottom of the Edit menu. You will have fun scrolling to the top to find the text block. Use the arrow keys because the scroll bar will not let you get there. Select the text block, choose Text

<h2>            How to import music files into W Media Player&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have WMP open on my desktop at the moment and several MP3s I the Music folder of my C drive. I would like to import the MP3s in to WMP and, later, add to that collection. After a while, I would like to burn them to a blank CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see references to Libraries and Playlists (?), but there is no 'Help' link in WMP or no 'Import' link to import my MP3s in WMP, so what is the first step I need to take please?</p>

<p>Hi again - we were trying to sort out something along these lines before weren't we (in this earlier
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/musicandvideo/forum/winmediaplayer/importing-music-files-into-media-player/4dd887c0-a772-46cc-b5d0-9d296f9e48e9">
Thread</a> which is now locked (dormant threads now automatically lock after a period of time).</p>
<p>You're right that there is no 'import' option for WMP. What it does is automatically add any new files that go into your chosen library folder - in this case
<strong>'Music</strong>'... however this process can go wrong (particularly in earlier versions of Windows - 10 has a simplified library structure.)</p>
<p>First thing to check is that WMP is reading your Music folder... Open WMP - click Organize Manage Libraries - Music and check that your C:Music folder is selected as shown here... If not use the Add button to add it&nbsp;(then OK) - It should look like this...
 (below)</p>
<p>Let me know this bit is OK and then we'll see if the database needs rebuilding... - Ric.</p>

            Perfect - that looks OK although I'm not sure why the MasterCD one should be there. I think that may have been an unintended command at some point! Unless you have it there through choice you can probably remove that... I'll get back tomorrow on the next
 step.... Cheers, R.

<p>Perfect - that looks OK although I'm not sure why the MasterCD one should be there. I think that may have been an unintended command at some point! Unless you have it there through choice you can probably remove that... (I just use the top one as you can
 see)</p>
<p>Anything you include in that <strong>C:Music</strong> folder should appear in WMP automatically. If there are items missing you may need to restore the library database to get&nbsp; them back - this will empty your WMP library completely and it will gradually
 rebuild. You won't lose any files doing this - only the db is affected. </p>
<p>If (like many users) you do not use WMP for pictures you can save a lot of WMP work-time by removing Pictures from that same settings page in your last screenshot - just switch from music to pictures and remove all locations (then click OK).</p>

<p>Thanks again</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f94d768-16aa-4ad0-aed6-a54556e4a8d9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f94d768-16aa-4ad0-aed6-a54556e4a8d9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on Music and then OK, this is what I see (and that is where I am up to). The main pane is not populated. To create a Playlist ready for burning, I need to drag music files into that right column, but how when the main pane is not populated?</p>

<p>It looks like you are not using the left hand pane - that is called the 'Navigation Pane' and is what you should use to find your way around easily...</p>
<p>Select<strong> 'Playlist'</strong> on the left and <strong>open</strong> the list you wish to burn to disc...
<strong>highlight all the tracks</strong> using the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
shift key</span> - r-click and you'll see <strong>'Add to'</strong> -&nbsp;highlight that and you'll see
<strong>'Burn List'</strong> as one of the options...</p>
<p>The files will appear on the right... check the order is correct - sometimes the last track jumps to the top... if it has just drag it back to the right place. - Let me know if you need a screenshot to clarify. R.</p>

<p>Hello Ric<br />
<br />
This is what I now have:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8b8846e-e3be-42c4-8a13-d61f693aadf3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8b8846e-e3be-42c4-8a13-d61f693aadf3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b2d1f30-0be2-402a-aa2a-f339a29edde6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b2d1f30-0be2-402a-aa2a-f339a29edde6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I press the 'Play' button at the bottom, the playlist (various) appears in the right-hand column and the first&nbsp;track begins to play.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe33d897-0739-44f3-8da5-1f1ffef90672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe33d897-0739-44f3-8da5-1f1ffef90672" /></a></p>
<p>
There is one question: in the main window pane, only 10 tracks appear. In my C Music folder, I have a lot more&nbsp;tracks and inside that C Music folder, I have a sub-folder with other tracks in it.<br />
<br />
How do I import those? Do I import those in addition to the tracks I can already see in 'various'?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<p>Hi - first thing (before going into detail) - That 'various' Playlist looks a bit wrong. Can you just check... do the bottom three tracks (starting with Eric Idle's) play from there? I suspect the link has been broken.
</p>
<p>(This is usually the case when the track nubers are not visible)</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t answer incoming calls with android phone</h2>
                    Recently skype for my android phone and for PC becomes erratic. I can only answer some of the incoming calls but not all the time. Either the answer call button doesn't work or the button does not show up for me to answer calls. Why?

            What is the make and model of your smartphone?

<br />
<br />Try below steps and see if the issue still persists:
<br />
<br />Go to your Phone settings and look for Applications or Application Manager.
<br />
<br />Look for Skype and then select Force Stop &gt; Clear cache &gt; Clear Data &gt; Uninstall.
<br />
<br />After uninstalling, kindly do a reboot on your device.
<br />
<br />Once it pop-up, please install Skype using Google Play Store.
<br />
<br />After installing Skype, please do another restart before signing back in.

            I recommend you switch to another VoIP solution since Skype on Android and third party platforms is unstable and does not work as guaranteed. Look into using WhatsApp or another app called Viber which is similar Skype.
<br />
<br />Its only downhill from here with Skype and Android.

<p>I'm not sure what is causing that Marti.&nbsp; You are the second person I have seen with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I might consider starting with uninstalling WMDC, reboot then reinstall.&nbsp; If it were my device, I would strongly consider doing a hard reset as well just to eliminate the potential issue that it is device related ... but i truly think
 the issue is on the PC side.</p>

<p>I unstalled WMDC and redownloaded it and ran it while my PDA was connected and now everything is fine.&nbsp; I know what I did wrong.&nbsp; When I downloaded it originally my PDA was not connected.&nbsp;This makes the difference.&nbsp; Now I have my contact list and other data.&nbsp;

</p><p>Thanks for the response but this doesn't make sense to me.&nbsp; How am I going to deactivate or remove the old installation if the laptop was stolen?&nbsp; This is also NOT an Office 365 subscription.&nbsp; It's the Home &amp; Student Office activation for 1 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use the previously activated product key on the new laptop replacement.&nbsp; Can I get the product key remotely deactivated or blocked with Microsoft so that the stolen laptop does not take up the user license and then get a product key replacement?</p>

            If you had not used Myaccount ( <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/myaccount</a> ) to register and install your product key, then you can simply install on the new computer.
<br />
<br />But Microsoft has moved away from disc based installation and since your version is 2016, then you must have installed through Myaccount even though it was perpetual license not subscription based.
<br />
<br />Once you login to Myaccount, you will find your original installation there with computer details. This you should deactivate.  It means that you have instructed Microsoft that you no longer will use old license and you will use the license on a new computer.
<br />
<br />Install on new computer through Myaccount.

<p>My stolen Lenovo laptop was purchased this past summer with office already installed.&nbsp; I used the product key to unlock the components like Excel and Word and then created my microsoft account.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the laptop was stolen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got a new Lenovo replacement laptop, again office was already installed but it is locked so I cannot use all of the features.&nbsp; If I put in the product key, it tells me the product key is already in use (because of the previous activation on the stolen
 laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logging in to my microsoft account now on the new laptop, I can see the license in use for the stolen laptop but I do not see an option to deactivate it.&nbsp; Can someone please help with the steps in detail?</p>

<h2>            Help - Duplicate Contacts</h2>
                    
<p>I'm a long time user of Office Live Mail (Hotmail) and the Outlook Connector.&nbsp; On my desktop, I use Outlook 2007 which syncs with Hotmail my contacts via the Outlook Connector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got WM6 and immediately fired up Windows Live for Mobile.&nbsp; When it asked if I wanted to sync my Hotmail Contacts to the WM6 contact list, I said yes.&nbsp; All download correctly and all was good.&nbsp; I noticed there also was an option to merge
 the Hotmail contacts as they came down, but the phone was empty, so there was no issue.&nbsp; I updated a Hotmail contact and told Windows Live for Mobile to sync, but the contact did not appear on the phone as I expected.&nbsp; So, I figured it must not sync Hotmail
 contacts over time, only when you first set it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I hooked the phone up for the first time to the laptop via WMDC which worked like a charm EXCEPT i&nbsp;set it to sync Contacts.&nbsp; When it completed the first Sync I now had TWO of every contact on the phone - the set downloaded directly from
 Hotmail and the set that WMDC sync'd in from Outlook.&nbsp; Each dup contact has a different icon on the phone's contact list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where did I go wrong?&nbsp; Are the Hotmail contacts supposed to stay sync'd?&nbsp; If not and I have to use WMDC, how do I prevent the dups?&nbsp; Whats the best way to fix it?</p>

<p>To remove the duplicates, actually remove the Windows live contacts on your device, you will need to use the Switch Accounts options in Windows Live. Re-type your username and password and do not select the options to download or merge your Live contacts.</p>
<p>For some reason the merge feature does not seem to work. What I did is use the Instant Messaging field in Contacts.</p>

<h2>            User can only share document with some users</h2>
                    
<p>An Office 365 user is trying to share a document stored in OneDrive with other users, some being 365 users (diffrent portal), others being external users without 365 accounts. The user can find the other 365 users when trying to share the document (she searches
 for names and finds them in the suggestions), but only some of the 365 users get the invitation (no error message pops up). Those who get the invitation will be shown in the 'shared with' column. The funny thing is that two of the users she is trying to share
 the document with are on the same portal but only one gets the invitation and the other doesn't. Any ideas what might be wrong or how to solve it?</p>

<p>one of the external users got an email and could open the file once but that user's status still shows up as pending. if that user tried opening the file again, she got a message telling her that the link had expired. the other users haven't received an
 email invitation as far as know. i asked specifically about that.</p>

<p>Could you please let her share a new document to the external users to see if they can receive the invitation? Please type the email addresses of the users in the Invite people section this time. And make sure the send an email invitation box is checked.</p>

<p>We tried creating a new document and she shared it with three external users. When she typed in the email addresses of the other users, their names popped up as suggestions. I got an invitation myself, but couldn't open it. I can send you the screenshot
 of the error message that I got. If you need email addresses I will have to send it to you in a private/personal message as the privacy policies do not allow such information to be shared on internet sites as these :(.</p>

<p>Hi Katrin,</p>
<p>What error message did you get? Is it “Access Denied” or “you don’t have access to this page”? if yes, you may try the workaround in the following KB to see the outcome.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3016644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3016644</a></p>
<p>If not, please share a screenshot about the error message with us. You can mask all the personal information in it.</p>
<p>In addition, I’d like to confirm whether the other 2 external users get the invitation this time and whether they can access the document.</p>

<p>hi ran</p>
<p>sorry for the late replies. the email notification is not working properly (takes about five days to get notified when you post something...).</p>
<p>the issue still exists. as i can't reach the two other external users (christmas holidays...) i found two others to help me, and same thing is happening there. this is what they get when they click the link they get in the email. it basically states that
 *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is not on the domain2.sharepoint.com-site, which is no news to us. we have tried both suggestions below but neither works (same thing happens).</p>
<p>it must be related to this single portal, because users on other portals can share between portals except if they try to share with a user on the problematic portal.</p>

<p>Hi Katrin,</p>
<p>To further investigate this issue, could you try the following first?</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the browser in Private Browsing mode. </li><li>Re-share the document to the external users. </li><li>Enter the email addresses in the invite people section. Do not click the suggested name this time.
</li></ol>
<p>If the issue persists, please follow the steps below to remove the problematic external users completely from the tenant and then re-share.</p>
<p>l&nbsp; Remove the external users from the active users list in the portal.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Office 365 portal -&gt; Users -&gt; Active Users </li><li>In the user list, find the external user account. It looks like 
jondoe_contoso.com#EXT#@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com </li><li>Delete the user. </li></ol>
<p>l&nbsp; Remove the external users from the UserInfo list.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the site, edit the URL by adding the following string to the end of it:<br />
_layouts/15/people.aspx/membershipGroupId=0<br />
For example, the full URL will resemble the following:<br />
https://&lt;contoso&gt;.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/people.aspx/membershipGroupId=0 </li><li>Select your account from the list. </li><li>Actions -&gt; remove selected users from this SharePoint group. </li></ol>
<p>l&nbsp; Remove the external users’ accounts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install the SharePoint Online Management Shell. For more information, go to the following Microsoft website:<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint-help/introduction-to-the-sharepoint-online-management-shell-HA102915057.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Introduction to the SharePoint Online Management Shell</a>
</li><li>Start the SharePoint Online Management Shell. </li><li>Type the following cmdlet:<br />
$cred = Get-Credential </li><li>In the <b>Windows PowerShell Credential required</b> dialog box, type your admin account and password, and then click
<b>OK</b>. </li><li>Connect to SharePoint Online, and then type the following cmdlet:<br />
Connect-SPOService -Url <a href="https://-admin.sharepoint.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://-admin.sharepoint.com</a> -Credential $cred
</li><li>Remove the user from each site collection. Type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:<br />
$ExtUser = Get-SPOExternalUser -filter *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
<b>Note</b>: In this cmdlet, replace &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; with the affected account. Then, to remove the user, type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:<br />
Remove-SPOExternalUser -UniqueIDs @($ExtUser.UniqueId) </li></ol>
<p>If it still does not work, I’d like to collect some information. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message. Please access it via the link below:<br />

    <title>Windows Phone volume randomly drops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> offbeatbop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone volume randomly drops</h2>
                    The volume on my Nokia Lumia 920 will randomly go berserk. The volume suddenly drops to zero and one of four, or a combination of all four of these happen to the volume:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>1. on't increase above 1. Trying to increase it will just make it to 1 and then decrease back</div>
<div>2. increase for a second and then go back down to one</div>
<div>3. randomly going all the way up and then back down again.&nbsp;</div>
<div>4. works again for a few minutes and then goes back t zero again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The last time it happened I performed at least 10 hard resets to no avail. The problem just eventually corrects itself. Very frustrating. It's a shame because I love the WP8 platform and rave about it to anyone who will listen. They really do need to fix
 this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm posting this because in researching the issue I came across a few blogs/articles claiming that recent updates resolved the issue. They haven't. Also if anyone could let me know the official channel to report these bugs that would be great. I really
 want Microsoft to know that this issue still exists.</div>

            <p>I have the Nokia 920 and have not experienced that issue offbeatbop. I'm not sure what is causing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If after a hard reset and BEFORE you add back any programs does it do it?&nbsp; If yes then I would strongly consider sending it in for repair/replacement because it sounds like it might be a hardware defect. Possibly contacting Nokia Care and asking for help/advice
 might be worth trying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure if this will help at all but I thought I would pass it on.</p>
<p>There is a program called LUMIA pusher that does manual updating of&nbsp;programs for Nokia smartphones Lumia 520, 620, 720, 820, 920.<br />
The program uses only well-known direct links of the update Nokia applications in the Windows Phone Store, not available during the search.</p>
