<p>n√£o, ele n√£o queimou... bom, eu sugeria vc de reclamar com a loja, eles tem de te dar uma fonte nova, pois foi informa√ß√£o errada deles.</p>
<p>mas qualquer coisa, o console est√° funcionando de boa, e se for mandar a fonte por concerto, fica tranquilo q d√° pra resolver (e vc pode pedir pra mudarem a voltagem tbm se quiser, √© possivel)</p>

<h2>            How to get all running metro apps on window 8 &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I know there is a feature on window 8, user can open a left bar to show some running metro apps. But looks like the bar is just show 7 latest apps.</p>
<p>I tried to open 15 metro apps, then did all tricks [Win + Tab], [Alt + Tab], move&nbsp; mouse to top left corner to get the list, but&nbsp;it did not show enough my 15 apps. The only way can show all running apps is using Task Manger and select [Switch To]. So my
 question is there any faster or convenient way to show all running metro apps ?</p>

<p>Hi <br />
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per the description I understand you are trying to view 15 last used apps on your windows 8 computer however you are able to see only 7 and you want to know if there is a way to see all 15 running apps at a time.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you move your mouse to the upper left corner of your Windows 8 screen it shows last 7 apps used, however when you click and go to any app and press ALT+TAB, you can switch between a list of all the apps running. However WIN+TAB shows thumbnails of
 last 7 used apps.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this information is helpful, if you need any further assistance, please let us know, we will be glad to assist you further on this</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for reply. Currently I'm using window 8 x64 enterprise. I believe I have tried [Alt + Tab] for few times but the horizontal panel still doesn't display all running metro apps. All the running desktop apps is displayed amount correctly but running
 metro apps&nbsp;are still limit by 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, As your mention above the left gesture is always limit number of apps by 7,&nbsp;and without keyboard (I mean just the tablet pad only, Surface RT, Vivo Tab ... ) how can I press&nbsp; [Alt + Tab] ? Is there any gestures like Android user can swipe up,
 down, left, right&nbsp;to view these running apps ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks you.</p>

    <title>Fix random freeze for AMD CPU, MSI motherboard and nVidia Video Card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redhonker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fix random freeze for AMD CPU, MSI motherboard and nVidia Video Card</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro 64-bit</p>
<p>GeForce GT 710</p>
<p>AMD FX-8320E CPU</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">MSI 970A-G46&nbsp;</span>motherboard
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system freezes randomly without trace in event viewer.&nbsp; Sometimes the freeze will recover.&nbsp; Sometimes only a hard reset will do.&nbsp; No clear usage pattern causing this.&nbsp; It can happen right after reboot or idling.&nbsp; Another issue was there is random buzz
 during audio playback</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a lot research and experiment.&nbsp; And finally I have a stable system for over a week.&nbsp; Here is a quick summary.&nbsp; Hope this can help others.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Clean installation of Windows 10 with network unplugged.&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially I did the upgrade from Windows 7 so was not sure if it's because of that.&nbsp; So I did clean installation this time but still got the random freeze.&nbsp;
<br />
</li><li>Install nVidia Driver.&nbsp; I tried several versions and got random freeze with each of them.&nbsp; So I settled with one that I used before 364.72.&nbsp; This is before step 3.&nbsp; After that, I did not go back to upgrade the driver again.<br />
</li><li><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_update/windows-10-1511-sfc-problem-opencldll/afddea33-9d9a-495c-b17a-a56887c9ed4d?auth=1">nVidia driver installer will corrupt opencl.dll</a>.&nbsp; I used
<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/7808-dism-repair-windows-10-image.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SFC and DISM</a> and fix it.&nbsp; I suspect this also causes the random buzz during audio playback but I can't confirm it since I did not play audio at this point<br />
</li><li>Plug in the network and update.&nbsp; Freeze continues</li><li>Upgrade SSD firmware.&nbsp; Freeze continues</li><li>Upgrade motherboard BIOS.&nbsp; I've checked MSI website many times and it never showed an update.&nbsp; It turns out that you have to install MSI Live Update.&nbsp; It showed available update and I installed it<br />
</li><li>System fails to start after BIOS update.&nbsp; Had to pin-reset and it rebooted fine.&nbsp; Went into BIOS and configured as I would normally do.&nbsp; Reboot, freeze continues.</li><li>Run &nbsp;memtest86+ overnight.&nbsp; No error.&nbsp; Reboot, freeze continues.</li><li>Went back into BIOS, disabled C6 State in power management (kept C1E enabled).&nbsp; Rebooted, no freeze in a week</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I can't say everyone has the same problem.&nbsp; I had to spent several days to troubleshoot and had essentially 3 issues</p>
<ul>
<li>nVidia driver corrupts opencl.dll </li><li>BIOS update</li><li>Disable CS State</li></ul>
<p>One thing worth note.&nbsp; I have 2x8 GB Patriot RAM.&nbsp; In BIOS, I've enabled AMP.&nbsp; According the manufacturer spec and CPU-Z, CAS under AMP is 10.&nbsp; However, CPU-Z showed the actual CAS is 9.&nbsp; I did notice this until the system became stable.&nbsp; Since memtest86+
 passed overnight, I did not slow the RAM down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started with a Radeon video card.&nbsp; It had many crashes.&nbsp; I blamed it on the lack of updated video driver (AMD abandoned the old cards) and switched to nVidia.&nbsp; I did not go back to test this with Radeon card.</p>

            <p>I have a similar setup only with a Radeon card. My entire system was freezing after I dinked around uninstalling a few things trying to speed it up, particularly when Skyrim was running. Symptoms were much like yours, but it never recovered and required
 a POR to fix. I had Windows 10 from an ISO installed over Win 7 because the 7-&gt;10 update process never worked.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I ended up reinstalling Windows 10 and only Steam and a few games - same problem.</li><li>I moved Steam files from my SSD back to C: - same problem. I suspected timing off the SSD, but it didn't help at all.&nbsp;</li><li>I updated MSI's BIOS and had a good day or two, but still had problems after that. Same as you, I had to get Live Update to even see the outstanding upgrade.</li><li>Downloaded MSI's Afterburner and ensured the fans were cranked up and temp didn't get too high. It froze at about 70C on the GPU, way too cool to freeze like that. Watched Afterburner's monitors while I gamed in a window to see if anything was out of spec
 - it wasn't.</li><li>Found DriverEasy and used it to scan my drivers, which I thought were clean. It found 9 out-of-date drivers, much to my shock. The Properties/Driver tab had said they were up-to-date. Updated all of them, mostly AMD and Radeon deep drivers (Bus, sound card,
 etc)</li><li>The problem actually got <strong>worse </strong>after that. Oblivion froze the machine before the Emperor appeared. Skyrim ran about 5 minutes before a freeze. Then it started freezing with no games running, only Chrome. I couldn't see backleveling my drivers
 and BIOS, though. Geez.</li><li>I found your article and changed the C6 power management to DISABLE. Things have been up for about two hours, which is a triumph. I would NEVER have thought to change that.
<strong>Thank you!</strong></li><li>Found another article in Microsoft about disabling the PCI Link State Power Management under Advanced Power Settings and did that for good measure.</li></ul>
<p>Hope your system is still running well! &nbsp;Good luck, everyone who has these. They are frustrating and difficult to run down. Because of the hard freeze, I had NO events in the logs beyond "Hey, you powered off your system without a shutdown". Yeah, thanks!</p>

            <p>Ruth, thanks for the response. A little more info for you: My computer was formerly set up with Win XP Pro O.S. and the Xerox P8ex ran on the USB just fine for many years. (and still does) Since new Software programs don't support XP I decided to buy a retail
 version of Win 10 32/64. I installed Win 10 32 on a clean new&nbsp; HDD that I added to the PC. So I now can dual boot Win10 and Win XP.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Xerox printer although it responds and prints via Win 10, the printout are gobbledaygook. I have down loaded multiple drivers from Xerox support, which the P8EX is supposed to work with according to the original Manual. But when I install
 and&nbsp;print a test page at the end, All it prints is solid black lines, as if it were lines of text high-lighted in black.
</p>
<p>BTW your link to&nbsp;support.Xerox indicates Nothing Available for the P8ex, but there are other sections in that support site where I found PCL 32/64 Drivers,&nbsp;&nbsp;a post script driver, and a Xerox General Purpose Driver.
</p>
<p>I also tried doing the "compatibility mode for XP, but the process seems to stick after the first part and just loops beck to compatibility mode, even although it indicates the compatibility problems have been fixed, i don't see an indication that the driver
 install process was completed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Do date I am going to clean all evidence of Xerox drivers off Win 10, Try to install the Win10 USB print driver, and then test these Xerox drivers one at a time. &nbsp;Meantime I have another printer I can use (Okidata) . If I find a satisfactory solution I will
 post my finding on the community. thanks </p>

            Use the driver for the NRG MP 1100 laser printer for WIN10.- Works OK !!!!<br />
You can download it here : <br />
http://support.ricoh.com/bb/html/dr_ut_e/nrg/model/mp90/mp90en.htm<br />
for Win 7 &amp;amp; 8 you can install it from &amp;quot; Add printer option&amp;quot; <br />
<br />
Good luck !!!

 connected to the point where we choose which we call forward. The important part starts here :) as a printer driver "fuji xerox" then the brand "fx AP-II C2200 PCL" we select the model and I installing the printer driver. So your printer becomes ready for
 use. I hope I can help a friend with a problem like this a tiny bit. Good luck :)</span>

<p>If you can't log in at all, do the connection test and as long as Xbox Stores is the only error you should be able to log in to your account still, just keep retrying as it took me two attempts to log in.</p>

<p>Hi junerose79.</p>
<p>Sounds like quite a problem.&nbsp; That was smart thinking to use the On-Screen keyboard feature.&nbsp; What kind of keyboard are you using?&nbsp; I've seen keyboards that you can remap the keyboard, which actually directs the keys to type something different than it normally
 would.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have another keyboard you could temporarily use to see if it resolves the issue?</p>
<p>There's a feature in Windows called Sticky Keys, but I'm not sure it could cause what you're seeing.&nbsp; But just to make sure, go to&nbsp;"Change how your keyboard works' and make sure all of the settings are correct.</p>

<h2>            Unable to link NFL Network to my NFL app on Xbox one</h2>
                    
<p>Ok. So I have NFL network through Baldwin telecom, which is listed as an available provider. I have tried to link it more times than I can count. The website will say that my device is activated. But it never activates in my NFL app. It is still status:
 inactive. Very frustrating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having the same issue with mine, but my cable provider is Charter Communications. It shows NFL Redzone as active and NFL Network as inactive. Last year when I had NFL network, it read both accounts as active... This year it doesn't...

<p>So I decided to try the same thing with the "Watch NFL Network" app on Windows 8.1... it says I don't have an active NFL Network Online subscription... I'm thinking they may be different things. I'm trying to contact Charter right now to see if this is something
 additional I need to set up.</p>

<h3> lisagar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-triggering Windows 10 Creators Update Privacy Settings</h2>
                    <p>How do you re-trigger the pop-up window for selecting the privacy settings in Windows Creators Update?&nbsp; It is no longer in my action center.&nbsp; The update KB4013214 downloaded and installed yesterday.&nbsp; The pop-up window was setting there when I woke the computer
 up.&nbsp; I clicked remind me later.&nbsp; Came back in an hour or so and clicked on it in the action center.&nbsp; Something went wrong.&nbsp; The box didn't have anything in it, it was blank.&nbsp; A blinking windows icon was at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; I clicked on it and then
 everything went away.&nbsp; Not sure if I will get another pop-up and want to bring it up if I can and do the privacy settings so the CU will download thru WU.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Lisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Action Center in Windows 10 lets you keep track of all your notifications from various apps as well as Windows updates. When the user clicks on the notification from inside Action Center, the notification may disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can still choose the privacy settings for your device after Windows Creators Update. You can follow the steps under
<strong>Choosing privacy settings for your device</strong> in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4014916/windows-10-choose-your-privacy-settings-for-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for
 you to adjust the settings at any time.<br />
<br />
Thank you. </p>

<p>Thanks for the response, but that really doesn't answer my question.&nbsp; I have seen posts that say that this privacy update review has to be done before Windows Update will download the Creators Update.&nbsp; That is why I want to know if I can trigger the screen
 to pop up that I first saw after KB4013214 was installed.&nbsp; It is showing in my installed updates.&nbsp; I just don't know if it will pop back up for me to complete the process.&nbsp; In the task scheduler it shows and I have tried to run it but the trigger says the
 computer has to be idle.&nbsp; So I don't know how to do both things.&nbsp; If there is a way to start it over, please tell me how.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Windows 10 Version 1607 64 bit Build 14393.1198</p>
<p>The update window did come back up and I followed thru with that however now the Feature Update to Windows 10 version 1703 (Creators Update) has failed to install 3 times with error 0x8024200d.&nbsp; It also starts over each time with the download and takes a
 day or more just to download.&nbsp; Then it fails when it's time to install.&nbsp; I have done DISM - restorehealth, sfc/scannow, chkdsk/f C: as well as delete the downloads in the Software distribution folder.&nbsp; It seems I have to do all those things everytime it fails
 or else it stays at 0%-5% download and just gets stuck.&nbsp; I am tired of this slowing down my system not to mention the data usage and the TIME I have spent sitting at this computer!&nbsp; What is wrong with Microsoft!&nbsp; I only use my computer for simple things I
 don't game or anything like that and it's very upsetting to have to spend this kind of time just to try and get an update.&nbsp; Before this year I had not had any trouble getting updates and them installing.&nbsp; Every patch Tuesday has been a nightmare since the
 beginning of this year.&nbsp; It takes days sometimes for the updates to download and install and most of the time I have to spend hours doing all the things I listed above in order for them to be completed.&nbsp; Please tell me if it is my computer with the problem
 or something in the updates that have messed this whole process up.&nbsp; AND how can I fix it! Thanks!</p>

<p>There is a possibility that the reason why you're having this concern is because of the recent update you have on your PC. There could be some corrupted file or data on the system that causes you some issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate the issue, we suggest that you try to roll back to your previous update and install again the latest update on your PC. Let's check if the same issue persists.

            Rolling back to the previous update is not going to fix it.&nbsp; I have had this same problem for months.&nbsp; So that is more than the last update, that is several updates.&nbsp; Some updates you cannot uninstall anyway.&nbsp; The error I get is 0x8024200d, it basically
 says "don't install because it needs to be downloaded again".&nbsp; So that's why it starts over again and again.&nbsp; I just need to know what is causing it to do that.&nbsp; It keeps my computer slow all the time because it is constantly downloading, or trying.&nbsp; I am
 curious to know if others that are trying to update to the creators update are having similar issues.&nbsp; Could it be that it won't allow it to be installed because there are some fixes happening from microsoft to correct some of the issues people are having
 that have already downloaded the creators update?&nbsp; At the moment I am trying to download the update using the windows 10 update assistant.&nbsp; For hours it has sat at 0% but my data is being used and there is a new folder that is slowing increasing in size.&nbsp;
 Not sure how that will turn out but it has used 4% of my data in about 4 hours so it better work this time!<br />

<p>I have tried this and many other things and still nothing has fixed my problem.&nbsp; I am tired of this being my focus daily.&nbsp; I am probably going to have someone look at it.&nbsp; This has consumed too much of my time!&nbsp; Microsoft needs to figure a way that their
 customers can get updates without so much trouble if they are going to send them out it seems every day or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The above suggestion said it couldn't stop windows updates, so the task didn't do anything.&nbsp; I tried to manually stop windows updates and it said an administrator is blocking me.&nbsp; I AM the administrator!&nbsp; So sick of trying to fix a computer that is barely
 a year old!</p>

<h2>            driver for microsoft works word processor&#63;</h2>
                    I have had issues with sending emails via works word processor, I get ' cannot send the 'programme' is either already open or corrupt'. Thats as near as I can remember having used Yahoo to access saved data that I wish to send via email. I have had this
 problem ever since I started using this computer. Which is a couple of years now.
<div>I've looked for a driver to install, is there one out there and will this solve my problem? Otherwise what can I do? Thank you.</div>

    <title>People App and search for contacts Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnpohl  say:</h3>
<h2>            People App and search for contacts Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>This is a Windows 10 problem. In windows 8.1 you could search for your contacts simply by typing in the name in the search. With Windows 10 this no longer seems to work. When I try and load the "people app" it comes up for a second and then disappears? Any
 suggestions? Or is this no longer an option.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the objective is simple to be able to search for contacts with out having to go into outlook 2016 - this capability existed in win 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can do this I would appreciate knowing so at least I can determine if it is my computer configuration or a general problem.

            This can't be the best answer.&nbsp; I'm sure the side effects to that approach would be far worse than the problem it was intended to fix.&nbsp; I too find it impossible to search my contacts.&nbsp; I do not know what the "new and improved" win 10 method is.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just
 want to update the address for one of my contacts.&nbsp; Why has it become so hard to do something so simple that has worked well for decades. New is not always better. How do you get to them now?

            <p>I am generally really patient. But it would help if the question posed by both Jim's issue and mine would be answered&nbsp;- this is
</p>
<p>1) Please note that this is a windows 10 NOT 8 problem. Links to windows 8 general faqs is not helpful. Neither of us are neophytes. That page is for people who have no idea.</p>
<p>2) It does not answer the question is what happened to the search in windows 10 for contacts 3) Did search in windows 8 require the people app - because&nbsp;the People App&nbsp;won't work in Windows 10 (Did I say this is a windows 10 issue?)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been in touch with the help desk by phone . The first tech suggested a series of fixes (all listed in this thread) the second did nothing and did not know anything other than lets set up a new user. .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read all of the "help" and tried everything EXCEPT completely reinstalling WIndows as this is a huge undertaking of time and energy on my part - not that I am lazy but I have better things to do then reconfiguring all of my apps, reinstalling them
 etc.. and then having two log ins on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can you at least answer the basic question. Does Search for contacts only work if the People App is installed. That's it .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            I would just like to find the People app in Win 10. "Windows 10 for Dummies" tells me "to launch the People app, click the Start menu's People title". "People" does not appear when I click on the Start menu icon, either by left- or right-clicking. Can
 you please tell me what I need to do?

            Aha! I just found that if I click on "All Apps", I am presented with an alphabetical list which contains the "People" app. Why don't the instructions given on this site and in the Dummies book say that you first have to click on All Apps? Does Windows
 intentionally&nbsp;make everything difficult, even for people who have been using a PC for years?
