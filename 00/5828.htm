            Your question is too broad to adequately answer here.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>There are an infinite number of possible demand/supply curves, which can be expressed in an infinite number of formulas.&nbsp;Which one(s) you should use depend on the particular demand/supply relationship that you want to chart. Classic demand/supply curve
 graphs plot Price vs Quantity for one or more series of demand relationships and for one or more series of supply relationships
<div><br />
<div>In general:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Enter your independent variable (say, Quantity) in a range. Enter the formulas that expresses the dependent variable (e.g., Price) for each of &nbsp;the demand/supply relationships in adjacent ranges. Then insert an X-Y scatter chart using those ranges (see
 XL Help on Charts) as series.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can "change X and Y axis" in a number of ways - you may change a number of settings by &nbsp;right- or ctrl-clicking on the axis and choose Format Axis.</div>

<h2>            Changing author name in track changes</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have removed all the reviewer data in a document that had tracked changes from many different people, so it now appears the changes are all from one person. However, the changes are now displayed as done by the default, 'author'. I need to change this
 to a specific name? Is this possible?</p>
<p>I have worked out how to change the comments user name by using a macro, but no luck so far for the tracked changes author. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            No Audio</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 (v. 1511) but I have lost audio playback for Headphones connected to my desktop.&nbsp; I have uninstalled the RealTech driver since it didn't work.&nbsp; Windows has replaced it with some stupid chat utility that doesn't require drivers.&nbsp;
 This obviously does NOT work.&nbsp; Windows 10 offers no solution.&nbsp; I can no longer audit news feeds or listen to radio online.&nbsp; I do NOT hear any Windows wave sounds.&nbsp; I'm stuck, though I've tried all the solutions available.

Thanks.&nbsp; I do get a positive result from the sound test, but I don't get Windows sounds and I don't get audio from online new feeds.&nbsp; Everything connected, the device is working OK, but no audio.

<p>Method 1: Windows Fixer made my headset the default.&nbsp; But News feeds got worse, since I got neither visual nor audio, just a black box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: I have the latest drivers for RealTech audiovisual.&nbsp; This didn't help, but I went into DEFAULT PROGRAMS and reset what Windows should do in various circumstances.&nbsp; I changed audio &amp; visual to "Play With Media Player" and that finally did the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thanks, your adice didn't help directly, but it prompted me to futz around until the sound came back on.</p>

    <title>MsMpEng Affinity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevemann  say:</h3>
<h2>            MsMpEng Affinity </h2>
                    
<p>This is on a clean install of Windows 7 Pro, 64-bit, on a AMD Phenom 9650Q qua processor.</p>
<p>The only apps installed were MSE, FireFox and Thunderbird.&nbsp; I noticed that my internet browsing was periodically interrupted - paused - as if another process had taken over my CPU cores.&nbsp; I finally identified MsMpEng as that resource hog by keeping Task
 Manager on top - watching processes.&nbsp; Changing the affinity of MsMpEng to only run on two of four cores has completely eliminated this problem.</p>
<p>Is there any way to permanently change the affinity of a process?</p>
<p>Remember - this is a very clean system.&nbsp; Win 7 pro was installed, activated, and using Internet Explorer to download MSE, installed that, then also using IE, downloaded FireFox and Thunderbird.&nbsp; I was browsing for other apps on FireFox while TBird was busy
 downloading a backlog of messages when the problem became apparent.</p>
<p>Any tips would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Control-J shows all the files.&nbsp; Works fine.&nbsp; Explorer and Edge simply choke on downloading any files and many people are having this problem.&nbsp; It will start up, download a very small piece, and die.&nbsp; This is non-wireless on a very stable network.&nbsp; Every
 other browser and app works perfectly with the exception of Microsoft's ill fated Mail program that somehow works with every other vendor's mail EXCEPT their number one rival Google.&nbsp; No answer there either.&nbsp; You click the button and before anything can even
 reach google servers it gives you a big fat error posted in other message threads.&nbsp; It also happens to people after reaching the server so there are some workarounds for some people but for many - none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The explorer edge download problem has been happening for many months now and without any fixes or response from Microsoft other than the usual - DO A CLEAN INSTALL.&nbsp; Unacceptable from a multi-billion dollar company that has taken so much money from corporations
 and leaked personal data over the years.&nbsp; Am I upset?&nbsp; Yes a bit because when I install a product,&nbsp;I expect it to work.&nbsp; Other companies get this.&nbsp; I don't expect "It just happens" the&nbsp;other vendors mail system that fails is their main competitor and there
 hasn't been any fix for months - in spite of contact with Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This explorer issue is another issue that is very sad - it will force many to just abandon using Edge altogether and use Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or half a dozen great browsers out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to pull it acts together on helping users fix these type of problems on Windows 10.</p>

            Basically I found there was no download directory for edge to download too, once did the following edge now downloads fine.
<p>Change download location in Edge browser in Windows 10</p>
<p>If, for whatever reason, you want to change the default download location in Microsoft Edge browser in Windows 10, just compete the given below directions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Close Microsoft Edge browser, if it’s running.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open Registry Editor. To open it, type <strong>Regedit</strong> in Start search box or Run command box and then press Enter key.</p>
<p>Click Yes button when you see User Account Control dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following key:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppContainer\Storage\</p>
<p>microsoft.microsoftedge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\MicrosoftEdge\Main</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> On the right-side, right-click to reveal the context menu, click
<strong>New</strong>, click <strong>String Value</strong>. Rename the newly created String value to
<strong>Default Download Directory</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double-click on the newly created Default Download Directory, replace the default path in value data box with the path to the new download location. That’s it!</p>
<p>For instance, if you want to make F:\ISO\Windows 10 as the new download directory, then enter the same in the Value data box and then click OK button.</p>

            Edge wont load. I have to use Internet Explorer or chrome to do anything on the net. Try to load edge back on the computer and the start screen is on for 1sec them off.

</p><p>It probably told you to look for more detail in the CBS.log but you might find some timestamp context in a more general diagnostic, such as the Windows Error Reporting section of System Information, first.</p>

</p><p>No I can not see it under products on my MS account and I am pretty sure I downloaded it from MS and I also paid for it on MS page, but it has been quite some time ago. I can't really say when the installation happened, because the date of installation changes
 every time I get an automatic update. I wonder if I have been using different e-mail to log in at the time. I will try to do some detective work.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows defender</h2>
                    I have tried to run the scan on Windows defender for my computer. Regardless of which scan I run, the quick scan or any of the others it runs about 20% of the way and then hangs up my computer. I've tried rebooting it and running it on a couple of occasions
 but it does not work. I am wondering if I am protected real time even though the scan is not working and I would like to know how I can get the scan to work so I can keep my computer free.

    <title>Lookup Formula Error with Dates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasper85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lookup Formula Error with Dates</h2>
                    
<p>I'm hoping someone can help me with this lookup formula?&nbsp; It should be easy but for some reason it's not working completely. I'm getting some correct data extracted but not in all cells. &nbsp; I have Microsoft Excel 2007.</p>
<p>My Workbook contains 4 sheets:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Sheets #1:&nbsp; Contains a 2011 year calendar</strong></span>(each month is setup to visually look like a wall Calendar) with Columns A, C, E, G, I, K, M being the date cells<strong>(egs. In Cell C9 (=Date(2011,1,3);
 Cell C15 (=Date(2011,1,17); Cell C21, =Date(2011,1,17), etc.</strong> and then the cell is formatted to visually show the day number only - in this case<strong>17</strong> .</p>
<p>Then there are 5 empty rows below each day of the month in Columns B,D,F,H,J,L,N which the first 3 rows of each day have a formula (first row = Gold Events; 2nd row = Silver Events and 3d row = Bronze events. The events are extracted from Sheets 2 (Gold),
 3 (Silver) and 4 (Bronze).&nbsp; (Using January 17, 2011, as an example:&nbsp; The event from Gold would go in cell D22; Silver in cell D23; Bronze in cell D24).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Sheets #2, #3 and #4: These separate sheets are Sponsor Pages:</strong></span>(Sheet 2 the Tab is labeled: Gold; Sheet 3: Silver; and Sheet 4: Bronze). Each sheet contains several rows of Data.&nbsp;
 Column A1 to A50 are specific event information.&nbsp; However, the only two rows that I'm working with to achieve the results on the calendar are:&nbsp; Row B4:BA4 (contains the Event Dates - these dates are typed in as text -egs. January 17, 2011) and Row B5:BA5 (contains
 the Event names).</p>
<p>Here's my formula for the 3 individual rows on the calendar working with January 17, 2011:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>In Cell D22:</strong> </span></p>
<p>=IFERROR(LOOKUP(C21,'Gold'!B4:BA5,'Gold'!B5:BA5),"")</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>In Cell D23:</strong> </span></p>
<p>=IFERROR(LOOKUP(C21,'Silver'!B4:BA5,'Silver'!B5:BA5),"")</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>In Cell D24:</strong> </span></p>
=IFERROR(LOOKUP(C21,'Bronze'!B4:BA5,'Bronze'!B5:BA5),"")
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Results:</strong> </span></p>
<p>Cell D22 should be a blank cell as there is nothing scheduled on the Gold events for that day.&nbsp; For some reason it shows an event that was on January 15, 2011.</p>
<p>Cell D23 and Cell D24 show the correct events as they are indicated on Silver and Bronze.</p>
<p>I'm don't work a lot with formulas but thought this was fairly straight forward but I'm now stuck.&nbsp; All help will definitely be appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you in Advance!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Graphics Issue on Applications - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shadeslayer202  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Graphics Issue on Applications</h2>
                    Hello, I am having some issues with Windows 10 and its performance on certain apps running, specifically related to graphics. Starting off, for several builds of Windows 10 TP, I've had some issues watching videos on Youtube, and some videos would just
 render as a black screen. Now, in Windows 10 TP build 10122, I cannot play PC video games. League of Legends appears as a black screen, and Minecraft has a strange black border. I know it is not an application error, as it only started after installing Build
 10122. As for the Youtube videos, they only occurred about 2 builds back. Please let me know if you need any more information to help me resolve this issue. Thank you.

<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve imported my Facebook events to Outlook.com, and it was working properly for a while, but for now it doesn’t update the Facebook events.</span></p>
<p><span>For example: I refuse a Facebook event days ago, but it still active in Outlook.com.</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve checked the settings of Facebook calendar in Outlook.com, and show, that the sync failed.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve also checked in my desktop Outlook (RT 8.1), where I add Facebook as a separate internet calendar (with the same webcal address, given by Facebook), but there is everything is fine, the update is working. So the issue only affect
 the Outlook.com.</span></p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Neil,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for the feedback. Here is how I export my Facebook events (here I got a webcal link):</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/152652248136178?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/help/152652248136178?locale=en_US</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In Outlook.com I chose subscribe for a new calendar option, I gave the webcal link, saved, and all the events appeared. It was working for a while, but last week I saw that the sync failed. I deleted this calendar, and re-add with the
 same method, but now it show, that the last successful sync was more than a week ago.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In my Outlook RT / 8.1 I followed this and used the same Facebook webcal link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/view-and-subscribe-to-internet-calendars-HA010167325.aspx#BM2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/view-and-subscribe-to-internet-calendars-HA010167325.aspx#BM2</a></span></p>
<p><span>There, the subscription is working without any fail.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One additional thing: </span></p>
<p><span>As I saw during the subscription process in Outlook, there is an option, which says, that “updating the online calendar, according to the publisher”. (Sorry I use the Outlook in Hungarian, so I don’t know the proper English sentence.)
 I haven’t found similar option in Outlook.com.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<div>The subject area is there at the top of the writing panel and it shows "Add a subject". The problem is, it does not look like a Textbox where you can type, so most people would think it is just a label and can't find where to type. If you click at the

            Thanks John, This only solved half the problem. The subject line appears only 50% vertically. There is also the visibility issue on the participants list on the left. The first participant in the list is only partially visible and appears to be hiding
 behind the blue title of outllook. See attachment. Well just realised i can not attach any screen print outs in this forum

<p><span>I also suggest that you optimize your browser. This will serve, as initial troubleshooting that shouldn’t be overlooked. All bases should
 be covered, and browser efficiency should be ensured since Hotmail is a browser dependent service. Check this link out to know how to do this:</span></p>

<h2>            Side-by-Side Configuration is Incorrect - Can I Get the Replacement .dll&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've spent the past few hours roaming forums for solutions to this problem. I've tried several, and so far nothing has worked . . .</p>
<p>Last night I turned on my PC and tried to open MS Word 2010, only to receive the following error message:</p>
<p>"[file path and name here]" - The application has failed to start because the side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log for more detail."</p>
<p>Well, I checked the event log, and sure enough, I found a laundry list of side-by-side errors. The latest was listed as:</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>Activation context generation failed for "C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~4\Office14\ONFILTER.DLL". Dependent Assembly Microsoft.VC90.CRT,processorArchitecture="x86",publicKeyToken="1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b",type="win32",version="9.0.30729.1" could not be found. Please use sxstrace.exe
 for detailed diagnosis</p>
<p>Under Details:</p>
<p>Microsoft.VC90.CRT,processorArchitecture="x86",publicKeyToken</p>
<p>C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~4\Office14\ONFILTER.DLL</p>
<p>As of now, I can't open any MS Office applications (oddly enough, Wordpad still works). The most helpful thread I've found so far (link copied below) offered a number of suggestions, but nothing has helped. To date, I've tried:</p>
<p>1) performing an sfc/scannow, which indicated that corrupted files were found but didn't seem to fix anything.</p>
<p>2) Running a check disk with both "<span>Automatically fix file system errors" and "<span>Scan for and attempt
 recovery of bad sectors" selected,&nbsp;again to no avail.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3) Restoring to two different restore points (both restore attempts failed).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4) Downloading C++ 2008 Redistributable x84, as well as the SP1 Package ATL Security Update, as
 recommended in several threads. Still no luck after downloading and restarting.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So far, most of the cases I've seen online involve guys working with C++, trying to download a new
 program or upgrading from XP to Vista. I literally turned on my PC to find my Office suite FUBAR'd, so unless Microsoft triggered an automatic update that I didn't see, I have no idea what could have caused this.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, I've got just enough techy in me to know when I'm in serious trouble; I am a layman looking
 for answers and quickly running out. I sincerely do not want to have to try a full recovery, so I'm hoping someone here can help me with one final attempt. I saw it mentioned somewhere that Microsoft might be able to send me a functional copy of the .dll file
 noted in the error message above. So, a) is this possible, b) would it work, and c) can anyone walk me through the installation process?</span></span></p>
<p>Link&nbsp;to the&nbsp;advice I've followed thus far:</p>
<p>(<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7music/thread/7673bf12-87c2-48ca-b5ae-b8aa85e295dc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7music/thread/7673bf12-87c2-48ca-b5ae-b8aa85e295dc</a>)</p>

<p>Okay, much as I hate to say it, I found the solution. In the end, I simply bit the bullet and upgraded to Windows Seven. I suspect that a full reboot with Windows Vista would work as well (meaning that, yes, the problem is with the OS and not with the affected
 application), but then that would only leave you open to the same issue in the future. I've been running on Seven for a couple of weeks now and haven't suffered a reoccurrence. Nor, I might add, have any of the smaller Vista-related issues popped up since.</p>
<p>I wish there were an easier, less-costly way, but this is what worked for me. I wish you all the best of luck, and may the almighty help the guy who released Vista upon us all if I ever get my hands on him!</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

    <title>Delete All Skype Contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> passe43  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delete All Skype Contacts</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way I can quickly delete all of my Skype contacts?&nbsp; I have not used it in years and apparently it got hacked.&nbsp; Now I have A LOT of random contacts to get rid of.&nbsp; I'd like to just delete my whole Skype account, but Microsoft decided I would also
 have to delete my Hotmail account (thanks <strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong>).&nbsp; I would just switch to a Gmail account only, but this email goes to a lot of my stuff sadly...&nbsp; So is there a way to select all contacts to delete at once or did Microsoft
 stupidly take away an amazing feature like that?&nbsp; I can't seem to do anything off Skype.com, but I can only select one at a time through my hotmail email account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help me!</p>
