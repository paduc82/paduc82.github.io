<h2>            Getting rid of Bing from Internet Explorer</h2>
                    Recently had Bing appear in my Internet Explorer search bar and what ever search engine I have set as default something in the system changes it to Bing. It then brings up the Manage add ons box and one can delete/remove any of the search providers except
 Bing. <br />
<br />
I consider this inappropriate behaviour from Microsoft that they have done this without notification and that they do not allow the removal of Bing from the system. This is once vagain an issue of whose computer system is this. I paid for it and I should be
 able to decide what is and is not on my system.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE - set Search provider as you wish.<br />
<br />
Tools - Manage Add-ons - Search Providers - Select the Search Provider you want by clicking on one<br />
you can Move it UP or DOWN the list - Set the one you want as the Default (Usually the 1st choice)<br />
and you can REMOVE any you do not want on list. Then on LOWER LEFT&nbsp;check -&gt;&nbsp;Prevent programs<br />
from suggesting changes to my default search provider.<br />
<br />
Add Search Providers to Internet Explorer<br />

More than you need but a tip on where it is in registry<br />

You could also do this from another computer to correct your list.<br />

<br />
================================================<br />
<br />
Run through these to find the cause if needed :<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still installs it<br />
and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right. Permitted<br />
are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run<br />
<a href="http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php</span></a><br />

<br />
<br />
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware&nbsp;UPDATE it and then run it as<br />
a scanner. <br />
<br />

<h2>            failed reservation due to reinstall of windows ultimate</h2>
                    I have a Windows ultimat installed on a ssd drive. The ssd drive failed so I had to make a new clone of the original HD. because I cloned month ago before Windows reserving was offered, I had to update a bunch of updates, and among those the reserving
 app. But now my reserving is not active any longer and I can not replicate the reserving. So what about the free update? is that lost for me?

            <p>any consumer with windows 7 or 8.1 installed/activated can do a manual in place update to windows 10 by going to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>what I did was download the .iso file first there and burned it to a dvd and copied it to a USB thumbdrive so I have 2 backups of the windows 10 install media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>once you do the update you have 30 days to roll back to your windows 7 ultimate if you decide you don't like 10 or have too many&nbsp;technical issues ... you also have until july 2016 to do this update for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>just as a side note if you are using a Nvidia graphics card there is a not small group of people having issues with NVidia cards so you might want to wait&nbsp;until NVidia gets it's act together.&nbsp; Intel and AMD&nbsp;partnered with Microsoft every step of the Windows
 10 way so their drivers are working fine.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook emails appear in sent folder but receiver does not receive it</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes, my outlook 365 emails are not received by my receivers - including sent to myself. However, they appear in sent folder. This is for both, send from my notebook as well as sent from Outlook.com. The size of email does not matter, with or without
 attachment. Other emails to the same addressee arrive as normal. This is a very bad problem. My clients were waiting for my email which I thought has been sent long ago.</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Trying to upgrade to Build 10576--getting bounced over space when I actually have more space than MSFT says I need</h2>
                    <p>I have tried several time consuming times to upgrade Win 10 Build 10565 (which has the label "Evaluation Copy" for no explained reason.&nbsp; I thought that was gone with 10240 in July but "Evaluation Copy" is back agai<strong>n.&nbsp; At 41% installed after the 100%
 download it stops and gives you a button that says in so many words you need to fix things and then you get a message "Wind have ows Needs More Space" you need 6.44 GB.&nbsp; Please see the pic of this message directly below.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Since Windows 1 I have learned a couple things. Progress bars are often totally inaccurate.&nbsp; Many many error messages from the Error teams are notoriously inaccurate in all kinds of ways.&nbsp; So I have extrapolated this is just more of the same.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>In other words when the installation stops at 41%&nbsp; and leads you to the message pictured below, that message is totally worthle</em></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>ss</em></span>. I have
 watched for a year now as well meaning posters here have laid down edicts that you need 15 to 20GB to install a new build and I have proved over a dozen times with builds that is just not true.&nbsp; Ususally in my hands, you need about 8.5GB. So my main question
 and I'd appreciate it if someone at Redmond would chime in is why put this message out there for users if it is meaningless.?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b35f629-fb3e-4137-8629-4dc34054d75e" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;I've made sure I have more than 6.44 GB every time I try this<strong>.&nbsp; I don't have a lot of extra space on this tablet, so I've had to
</strong><strong>move the Windows ~BT folder that has a good deal of extra files you dont need to my external HD.</strong><strong>&nbsp; It doesn't matter if I have between 9 and 10 GB, it still stops with the same annoying messages saying I need less space than
 I actually have. I imagine if I were able to format I could get it in, but the problem with that is if I format I know longer have Windows Update and the only way I can format is to use the Recovery area like I did when Gabe provided the .iso for 10565.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be no reason whatsoever for MSFT not to provide an .iso with every new build but that's the way they are rolling. It would help those of us who are having our time wasted getting over 4 GB more space than they say you need and still getting
 bounced after a considerable time installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I appreciate if anyone can enlighten me and please save your time if you're going to say you need 20 GB or</strong><strong> so.&nbsp;
</strong>Even if MSFT has posted that requirement somewhere, the burning quesiton is why is the box I pictured coming up with specific requirements of 6.44 GB and I've proved with Disk Management I met that requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>There is a pull down on the message for space I pictured that allows you to substitute your external HD presumably to confer some kind of space addition. That's puzzling since I've never seen Windows be able to install on an external HD.&nbsp; I did put
 in 500+ GB on one of my external HD's via the pull down and I got a message that they would do some mysterious activity and let me know when I could try again.&nbsp; I haven't seen this help though.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way I could uninstall Office and pick up 3-4GB or I could play games moving the new WinSX folder to my external HD but it's not going to help.&nbsp; I tried already with over 9GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Also what in the world do they actually mean when they say "Choose another drive or attach an external drive with 10GB availabl</strong>e?&nbsp; I already have two external HD with considerably more space than that plugged in as shown by Disk Management.&nbsp;
 We all know you can't install a Windows OS to an external HD although I have seen people publish that fiction in years past on these forums and Technet as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks again for any&nbsp; help with this.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern and will assist you to resolve these issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is to inform you that you require 20 GB space to install Windows 10 64 bits on your system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For further information please refer the following article.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Cleaning out your PC on a regular basis frees up drive space and helps it run better. One of the easiest ways to clean up files you no longer need is by using Disk Cleanup. Also since C: drive does not have enough space to upgrade the system. You won't
 be able to upgrade the system because the total space of the Hard disk is 29.82 GB out of which 20-24 GB is occupied by Windows. The rest of the space is consumed while installing updates as well as the personal data. You need to have a primary partition of
 at least 100 GB which we recommend.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Try the following steps and check if that fixes the issues.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Refer the following article to increase the space and install Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Note: The above article is valid in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also use a flash drive to install Windows 10 on your system.</span></p>

 you can do to clear space.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Further I put up a .jpendg of Windows telling me i needed 6.44GB to install and in fact I have made more space available.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Further I requested that someone address the interface you can see where MSFT and Windows tells you to connect an external HD of at least 10 GB and I have external HDs connected and selected on that interface above that have hundreds of Gbs and you

<p>I have tried several time consuming times to upgrade Win 10 Build 10565 (which has the label "Evaluation Copy" for no explained reason.&nbsp; I thought that was gone with 10240 in July but "Evaluation Copy" is back agai<strong>n.&nbsp; At 41% installed after the 100%
 download it stops and gives you a button that says in so many words you need to fix things and then you get a message "Wind have ows Needs More Space" you need 6.44 GB.&nbsp; Please see the pic of this message directly below.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Since Windows 1 I have learned a couple things. Progress bars are often totally inaccurate.&nbsp; Many many error messages from the Error teams are notoriously inaccurate in all kinds of ways.&nbsp; So I have extrapolated this is just more of the same.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>In other words when the installation stops at 41%&nbsp; and leads you to the message pictured below, that message is totally worthle</em></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>ss</em></span>. I have
 watched for a year now as well meaning posters here have laid down edicts that you need 15 to 20GB to install a new build and I have proved over a dozen times with builds that is just not true.&nbsp; Ususally in my hands, you need about 8.5GB. So my main question
 and I'd appreciate it if someone at Redmond would chime in is why put this message out there for users if it is meaningless.?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;I've made sure I have more than 6.44 GB every time I try this<strong>.&nbsp; I don't have a lot of extra space on this tablet, so I've had to
</strong><strong>move the Windows ~BT folder that has a good deal of extra files you dont need to my external HD.</strong><strong>&nbsp; It doesn't matter if I have between 9 and 10 GB, it still stops with the same annoying messages saying I need less space than
 I actually have. I imagine if I were able to format I could get it in, but the problem with that is if I format I know longer have Windows Update and the only way I can format is to use the Recovery area like I did when Gabe provided the .iso for 10565.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be no reason whatsoever for MSFT not to provide an .iso with every new build but that's the way they are rolling. It would help those of us who are having our time wasted getting over 4 GB more space than they say you need and still getting
 bounced after a considerable time installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I appreciate if anyone can enlighten me and please save your time if you're going to say you need 20 GB or</strong><strong> so.&nbsp;
</strong>Even if MSFT has posted that requirement somewhere, the burning quesiton is why is the box I pictured coming up with specific requirements of 6.44 GB and I've proved with Disk Management I met that requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>There is a pull down on the message for space I pictured that allows you to substitute your external HD presumably to confer some kind of space addition. That's puzzling since I've never seen Windows be able to install on an external HD.&nbsp; I did put
 in 500+ GB on one of my external HD's via the pull down and I got a message that they would do some mysterious activity and let me know when I could try again.&nbsp; I haven't seen this help though.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way I could uninstall Office and pick up 3-4GB or I could play games moving the new WinSX folder to my external HD but it's not going to help.&nbsp; I tried already with over 9GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Also what in the world do they actually mean when they say "Choose another drive or attach an external drive with 10GB availabl</strong>e?&nbsp; I already have two external HD with considerably more space than that plugged in as shown by Disk Management.&nbsp;
 We all know you can't install a Windows OS to an external HD although I have seen people publish that fiction in years past on these forums and Technet as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks again for any&nbsp; help with this.</p>

            <p>Hi Win8to10</p>
<p>
</p><p>That <strong>'more space' </strong>dialog box is already aware of all the space that is available on your hard drive, including the
<strong>6.60GB </strong>on the <strong>C: Drive</strong>. It is saying what you need is another
<strong>10GB</strong> in addition to that existing free&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An <strong>Upgrade</strong> install&nbsp;as opposed to a <strong>Clean</strong> Install always&nbsp;requires a lot more disk space. A Clean install simply installs a new system, an Upgrade must replace an existing installation, while it is still running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when upgrading Windows must have room to create all of the files that will be used to replace the existing installed files. These files will be created in
<strong>Temporary</strong> folders and <strong>staged</strong> there until they are needed to
<strong>replace the existing</strong> files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a folder named <strong>Windows.old</strong> that contains a <strong>
large percentage</strong> of the files&nbsp;from the&nbsp;previous installation of Windows. The installation must also include enough disk space to create another Windows.old folder for the files in the&nbsp;current installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"Also what in the world do they actually mean when they say "Choose another drive or attach an external drive with 10GB
</strong><strong>available?"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows installation program can use <strong>External Storage Space</strong> to stage temporary files until they are needed, such as the new
<strong>Windows.old</strong> folder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have more questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>why u need loads of space is incase the instilation fails then it can rolll back to the previous one</p>
<p>
</p><p>also lets say the file is 5gb</p>
<p>
</p><p>thats because its compressed to 5gb</p>
<p>
</p><p>when it installs it can decompress to 40gb</p>
<p>
</p><p>rember they are adding ****</p>
<p>
</p><p>its like on android,, an app is 10mb,, but it needs 140mb to install</p>
<p>
</p><p>but after instilation the app is 10mb....</p>

I'm having this same exact error. I have 1000+ GB free on other internal drives, but windows won't let me put the install files there. I've got very little space on my main SSD because it's old. =)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I'll probably leave the insider preview program to avoid getting bugged about not enough space for updates.

    <title>Regarding InPrivate browsing in IE11... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james_555logs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Regarding InPrivate browsing in IE11...</h2>
                    <p>I cannot get a detailed answer anywhere, so hopefully you folks can help...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use IE11 on Windows 7.&nbsp; I want to use InPrivate browsing, but I'm told (not&nbsp;by Microsoft)&nbsp;that my search history will not be cleared when I close the browser.&nbsp; Then I'm told (Microsft Support Page) that search history IS cleared when I close the browser.,
 thus my confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use Google search, will InPrivate clear the history?</p>
<p>How about Bing?</p>
<p>Also, on my omnibox is the IE logo e.&nbsp; What type of search engine is that and will it save search history?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

<p>The answer 'could be' that What you do while InPrivate will be cleared on instance closure.&nbsp; To clear all history for all sessions/windows/tabs, InPrivate and not; &nbsp;under Safety is the Delete Browsing History option (Ctrl + Shift + Del)</p>

            <p>OK,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the replies and info :)&nbsp; I finally had time to test some things and you are all correct - when closing the browser (in this case Firefox 32.0.1)&nbsp; from private browsing mode, the google search bar is cleared of everything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other things that I learned: if you right click in the google search box, you can clear the google search history and toggle on and off the "show suggestions" option.&nbsp;&nbsp; (So, yeah, you can teach old dogs new tricks :)&nbsp; LOL)</p>

            <p>You can log in to your Office account on www.office.com/myaccount&nbsp;and remove your daughter's computer, so you will not loose one of your installations when you will install it again. There is new possibility with Office 365 Home Premium users, it is called
 sharing subscription. So you can send her invitation through your account and after&nbsp;she can install it and she will get extra 20 GB to her OneDrive. More info:</p>

<h2>            WM6 - PIE and Windows Live &#40;Hotmail&#41; problem - JavaScript</h2>
                    
<p>I have an AT&amp;T Tilt running WM6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I start PIE and&nbsp;try to go to&nbsp;Hotmail.com, I'm redirected to the Windows Live signin screen, but after a few seconds&nbsp;it changes to a screen with an error message about Windows Live requiring JavaScript and that
 I&nbsp;should go to&nbsp;the browser's help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two questions:</p>
<p>- How do I enable JavaScripts?</p>
<p>- Where is PIE's help?</p>

            PIE comes with limited support for Javascript and there is no way that I know to enable it in PIE. You might want to try another browser.

<p>I have tried the Windows Mobile 6 emulator and sites with JavaScript runs without problem even hotmail. Why Microsoft provides and emulator that does not work as the OS on the phones, at least this is true for IE.Mobile in WM6.</p>

<p>This is not a WM6 issue. This is a Web Site issue. When I use the AT&amp;T Tilt the user agent is "HTC-8900/1.2 Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows CE; IEMobile 7.6) UP.Link/6.3.1.17.0" so it seems the web site does not recognize this
 browser and not includes the JavaScript functions. The problem is replicable using any device if the User Agent is changed. Web Sites should include this user agent in their sites to support this device.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some body knows how to add this functionality in .NET framework 2?</p>

<p>The question I have does Windows Mobile 6 support Javascript?&nbsp; The WM5 device I have does not work on websites that use Javascript.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;WM6 does support Javascript could someone please go to my website with a mobile phone running WM6 to see if the maps work?</p>

<h2>            Email&#47; outlook and Alias</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have observed an issue with outlook option of creating aliases. I have created one alias long back, which I do not use as primary e-mail. At the same time some one else was able to create e-mail/alias with same combination of letters and I started getting
 mails marked to the other person in my inbox.</p>
<p>After seeing this, I was shocked and now I am wondering if my e-mails are really secured, because if two people can get same aliases then there is possibility that my primary e-mail could be alias of some one else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hypothetical Example -&nbsp;</p>
<p>My email ID (primary)- abcxyz (at the rate) live (dot) com</p>
<p>My email Alias - abc(dot)xyz (at the rate) outlook (dot) com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some one else has e-mail ID/ Alias - abc(dot)xyz (at the rate) outlook (dot) com (because I am getting many mails that were intended/ marked to this person - not relevant to me)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not able to understand logic behind this. Can some one from Microsoft Outlook team look into this?</p>

            This is a peer-to-peer forum, unfortunately we can't look into it and the forum software removed the addresses which makes it a bit harder to understand. :( 
<br />
<br />What likely happened was someone mistyped their address as your alias instead of their own, or the person sending the mail mistyped the address, or they used to use the alias and deleted it, which made it available to you. 
<br />
<br />FWIW, I get my daughter in law's email because our addresses are 1 letter off and her dentist typed her address wrong. For whatever dumb reason, they can't seem to get it fixed. :(

    <title>How do I lock in section breaks in Word 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billhezlep  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I lock in section breaks in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>I am 84,500 words into a seven chapter technical document&nbsp;and I am having a major problem with section breaks, particularly continuous breaks. I have to include quotes from 19th and 20th century House and Senate (Congressional) documents and from relevant
 legal documents. Most of the quotes are several paragraphs but some are much longer. I have a Section Break Continuous&nbsp;at the beginning and end of each quote and the quotes are at a reduced column width and line space, to set them apart. But as I write or
 insert material&nbsp;and the document gets longer, the breaks change, by themselves from Continuous (or something else)&nbsp;to Next Page, or Next Even Page, even Next Odd Page, and I end up with large blank areas in the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;a continuous break was pushed to the bottom of a page by material inserted in front of it and it changed to next page and then&nbsp;changed back if additional inserted&nbsp;material pushed it a few lines further down, I would have no problem. But&nbsp;breaks that change
 never seem to revert. Correcting the changed breaks is almost impossible. If I change a Next Page Break back to the original Continuous Break, the PRECEDING break changes to a&nbsp;Next Page break, which pushes the entire quote down onto the next page. Which, of
 course, leaves a large blank hole in the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an experiment I copied the document to a file far, far away in a different universe and corrected a beak, then I corrected the preceding break, which had changed, and the one before that, and so on. I ended up working backward through an entire chapter.
</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>There is no need to use Section Breaks to achieve what you are after.&nbsp; It can be done by setting the left and right indent of the paragraphs containing the quoted text.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best thing to do would be to create a Style that has the required formatting and then apply that Style as and when required.</p>

<h3> mjmart61  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE 10 crashes every time I close it and other times as well.</h2>
                    I see that there are quite a few people with this same problem.&nbsp; I have tried all of the steps outlined in each suggested answer and nothing is working.&nbsp; It is very annoying.
<br />
I'm using Windows 8 Pro Pack.<br />
I'm using IE10 in desktop mode.&nbsp; <br />
I was going to try to put it back in metro mode to see if it does it there, but I can't figure it out.<br />
<br />
Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>That didn't answer&nbsp;the question <strong>"but can I limit screen time on the phone".</strong>&nbsp; It seems the short answer is no - family safety does not support this.&nbsp; I have a daughter using a Lumia 640 running Windows Phone 10 and am very pissed off that
 this gap was left open by both the OS itself as well as the developer community.&nbsp; Granted it's a slightly different "screen time" management issue where on the desktop you just don't get in (big hammer) vs. the phone where you'd be limited to phone/messaging
 (rock hammer).&nbsp; Now I have two choices - stick with the Lumia which she loves but I can't manage or switch her over to an iPhone which she hates but I can manage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What **** me off more is a seeing a pointless response referencing another thread which likewise doesn't answer the question.&nbsp; When the answer is "No, you can't" that's all that needs to be said, then take the feedback that a desired feature is missing
 and see if it gets any traction with the product group.</p>

<p>Ashish... or whomever at Microsoft that thinks they can ACTUALLY answer this question. Understood this a while ago, but I am very interested if this is an update that will be coming that will allow me to restrict use of my daughter's phone. I see the question
 in this thread was asked multiple times, and it appears you are being <span>
disingenuous</span> with your answers and it comes off very rude. I will ask again:</p>
<p>"IS THERE A WAY NOW, OR A WAY COMING, THAT ALLOWS PARENTS TO RESTRICT OR LIMIT SCREEN TIME ON THEIR WINDOWS 10 PHONES?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate a real answer for this.</p>

            Apparently it doesn't work. I set the screen time for my daughter as well and her Windows 10 laptop kicked her out. The phone seemed to work normally despite of the limit. Can't tell if that's the intended behavior or not though.<br />
<br />
How nice of Microsoft to not answer your question. Maybe they don't care about Lumias anymore either?

            Thank for the feedback. I think the same. Microsoft doesnt care about Lumia and we just hope the end of Lumia with Windows phone or the End of Windows Phone as well.

<h2>            Runs extremely slowly after Creator&#39;s Update</h2>
                    Programs now run extremely slowly, most notably the Octave Engine demo "OE-CAKE!" which ran perfectly fine, but now takes over 10 seconds to render one object. Barely over 11% of the CPU is being used while OE-CAKE is running, and the actual program uses
 just 0.2%. Other programs also run slowly, such as Chrome, which also has issues drawing a new bar at the top, causing tabs from other windows open to be shown. Nothing was installed after the update.<br />

            <p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Let's sort this out. Could you verify if the error <span><span>0x800F081F you've got has something to do with
<strong>.NET Framework</strong>?</span></span><span><span>If yes, try these steps:<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span>1. Delete everything under: <strong>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download</strong><br />
Those are left over from Windows Updates and no longer needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. From Admin Command prompt, run:<br />
<strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
3. Turn on Net Framework 3.5 from programs &amp; Features again to see if it helps.<span><span><br />

<h2>            Office 365 - This product key has already been used</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have purchased a license of the Office 365 Home edition for 5 users and devices. I have successfully installed the Office 365 on the first device (my wife's PC, using her MS account) - great so far. However, as I am trying to install the Office using the
 same product key on my own PC now (using my own MS account), I am receiving the error message mentioned in the subject: "This product key has already been used".&nbsp; What is the reason please?</p>
<p>Thank you very much for helping me solve my issue in advance. Marcel</p>

            With the Office 365 subscription, you can download Office in up to 5 devices. To do this you can do the following:
<br />
<br />1-Log in into your account from the computer that you want and install. Check the below link:
<br />
<br />Install:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-or-reinstall-Office-365-or-Office-2016-on-a-PC-or-Mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />2- You can share your subscription with your family. Check the below link:
<br />

<br />
<br />Follow this link to activate your Office:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/activate-office-2016-for-mac-7f6646b1-bb14-422a-9ad4-a53410fcefb2?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/activa...</a>
<br />
<br />Think about how many devices you want them to install on and discuss it with them. As the owner of the Office 365 Home subscription, you can deactivate any install from&nbsp;<a href="https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=13&amp;ct=1535107684&amp;rver=6.7.6643.0&amp;wp=MBI_SSL&amp;wreply=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.microsoft.com%2Fauth%2Fcomplete-signin%3Fru%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Faccount.microsoft.com%252Fservices%252Foffice%252Fsharing&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=292666&amp;lw=1&amp;fl=easi2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;...</a>
<br />
<br />if you find you're running out, but it's a good idea to set expectations up front. Learn more about this and what to do if someone doesn't receive an invitation in the How to manage who you've shared with, invitations, and installs section.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Have a question, is there way to find out why "cscript.exe" is accessing temp folder in my Windows 7 PC?<br />
This happens every 5 to 6 days at different times on my windows 7 PC.<br />
</p>
<p>Am aware of this as Mcafee Access Protection triggered a Antispyware notification everytime this happens.</p>

            When it happens, you could open task manager and look for it and right click on the process and open file location and there you could investigate more about the file. If it is from legitimate source and program leave it, otherwise you may report it as
 suspicious program.

                    <p>I'm using outlook.com in Chrome&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(117, 117, 117, 1)">Version 65.0.3325.181 (Official Build) (64-bit). Windows 7 x 64</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I select a message, click the drop down arrow at the top right of the message (next to the reply / forward icons) and select "print". Two icons then appear at the top "print" and "Cancel". I click "print" which takes me to a print preview window where I
 can choose my printer, the pages, layout etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the right is a print preview which is blank apart from a header and a footer. Select print from here prints a blank page except for a header and footer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I get MS support asking me the simple questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">this worked fine</span> 2 days ago before MS changed the layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I can print perfectly well from other web pages using Chrome</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested internet explorer...unfortunately there is no print preview but I can print the messages.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be compatibility issue between the browser that you are trying to use and the latest version of Outlook.com that you have. We suggest that you clear the browser cache and history to see if it will resolve the issue when printing into your Outlook.com.
 If the issue still occur, you can either contact Chrome support to address the issue or send us a feedback on
 future developments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's anything else that we can help you with, please do not hesitate to reply here and we will further assist you.</p>

            Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; Clearing the browser cache didn't fix it.&nbsp; Dissapointed (but not entirely suprised) that MS didn't check this in Chrome, considering it's the most used browser, before release.

<p>Hey everybody,<br />
<br />
I just started having this same problem about a week or two ago.<br />
<br />
Here's how I fixed it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Flipped the Outlook.com "BETA" switch to OFF</p>
<p>
</p><p>Print preview and print dialog function now works. like a charm.<br />
<br />
This appears to be an Outlook.com BETA issue, at least for me...<br />
<br />
Too bad because I like the BETA version of Outlook.com, oh well, that's why they call it BETA..expect bugs..</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the tech note: I am on Chrome with Windows 7 Home Premium....<br />
</p>
<p>..................more...................<br />
</p>
<p>These next things are side issues beyond the Outlook.com print preview failure involving a failure of Windows 10 upgrade, hopefully Microsoft fixes all this too:<br />
<br />
I could not upgrade to Windows 10 because it rendered my laptop's ethernet card non-functional, only the wireless worked.<br />
<br />
I am an audio/video designer, and Windows 10 upgrade also rendered too many drivers associated with my studio peripheral softwares NON-FUNCTIONAL. This is not acceptable!!!<br />
<br />
(I know I know many will be wondering why I am not on a MAC for the studio - considering)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Windows 10 upgrade twice, once when they first rolled it out, and then once again this past January, still all the same issues, so had to roll it back (twice now!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a paying customer (Using Office 365 subscription for my business and web development projects)</p>
<p>Note that it should NOT carry any more weight than the other people experiencing issues with Outlook.com, I am just emphasizing that for my buck, it's a money issue and I can't commit to the Windows 10 upgrade until these issues are resolved. I have way
 too much money already invested in this laptop and external peripherals and to upgrade to a machine that would be worthy of Windows 10 is not an option at this time...</p>
<p>
</p><p>...for the benefit of the Microsoft developers watching, here's the tech for the ethernet problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS G75V "ROG" is my machine</p>
<p>Windows Home Premium is my OS</p>
<p>Qualcomm Atheros AR8151 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (NDIS 6.20) is my&nbsp; Ethernet card<br />
<br />
Apps that would not work after Windows 10 upgrade:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Alexis MultiMix8 USB driver for outboard audio mixer<br />
2. Ableton Push and Live 9 Suite drivers for outboard MIDI in/out interface</p>
<p>3. HP wireless printer (all the internet functions rendered inoperable)...totally baffling, HP driver says "compatible with Windows 10" ????<br />
<br />
I am not sure if there were more but those were the big 4 issues that killed Windows 10 upgrade for me, so I did not test anything further, noting that the upgrade consumed a pretty large chunk of my time and rendered everything non-functional until I tried
 the upgrade and did some initial testing, then when it failed it took even more precious time to roll it all back. Not good!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for allowing me to add this hopefully valuable feedback for future development/correction!</p>

<h2>            OneNote error e000002e</h2>
                    Lately (within the past week) I can't sync any of my OneNote notes. Here's the sync status:<br />
<br />
Result: Can't sync<br />
There was a problem and we couldn't complete this task. Try again.<br />
Error code: e000002e<br />

I am unwilling to reset my phone or reset Office on my phone because I don't want to lose the local changes I've made. And I don't have any notes pinned to the start screen (pinning, then unpinning, then syncing also doesn't work). None of my notes are over
 50 MB (all of the notes combined are smaller than 1 MB).<br />
<br />
Ideas?<br />

            <p>Caution: Only try this after backing up your Office documents (Word, Excel, Power Point, etc.) to another location, since this process will erase them from your phone. Then on your phone, go to Settings then flick over to the "Applications" page (not "System")
 then to Office and press "reset Office". </p>
<p>It will ask you to confirm, so press "reset". Go back to your notes and you will see only the "Explore OneNote" page. Create a new note by pressing the plus sign and enter some dummy text (you can delete the note later). As you edit and close this note,
 the automatic sync will kick in. OneNote&nbsp;should be working as it did before.</p>

<h2>            Error Code 0x80070570 0x00000000 0x00000404</h2>
                    I've tried to download the recent patch for Elder Scrolls Skyrim Special Edition that was released on November 16, 2016 and I keep coming up with this error when it tries to update. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game, removed and reinstalled my
 gamer profile, and performed a hard reset of the console. The only option I see that is left is to return everything to factory settings, which I'd rather not do for one video game. Any ideas on how to get this problem solved? Any searches for error code 80070570
 and their solutions are generalized to Xbox 360 consoles, which doesn't apply to Xbox one systems very well.&nbsp;

            <p>I was getting as equally frustrated as you, cursing the Xbox One's name and so forth. But, I looked around on the settings on my console and saw that there was an update for the actual console itself.<br />
I waited for that to install and apply itself to the console, which went fine, having removed the disc.</p>
<p>I then inserted the disc of Skyrim, and tried the update again. Thankfully, I found this worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could give this a go, if you haven't already. I really hope it all works out for you.</p>

<h2>            After updating Office 2013, &#34;Account Notice&#34; won&#39;t go away&#63;</h2>
                    In my Office applications (Outlook, Excel, etc.) there is a red bar at the top saying "<strong>ACCOUNT NOTICE
</strong>We've run into a problem with your Office 365 subscription, and we need your help to fix it." and then with a button saying "Reactivate". Once I click the button it says to go to my account and a webpage comes up saying to install Office, even though
 I clearly already have it installed. I follow the process anyway and click install, once it's finished downloading and installing nothing happens and when I click to open up one of my programs i.e. Outlook, the same red bar appears. How do I get rid of this
 and what am I supposed to do?
