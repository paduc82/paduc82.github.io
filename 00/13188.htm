<p><span>Thanks for your information. Now I know that
</span>the transport rule was not triggered bacause it was set activate on 10th Feb 2017.</p>
<p><span>And based on my experience, to i</span>nclude third-party domains that can send mail on behalf of your domain<span>,
 you can&nbsp;add the sending server IP address to SPF txt record. </span></p>
<p><span>For detailed information, please refer to this article:

<p><span>Besides, adding the IP in allow list under connection filtering section in the O365 portal is used to bypass emails sent to Office

<p><span>If the method in the article above doesn't work, and&nbsp;as this question is different from the first one ,in order to let other community

<h2>            Obtain ALL the necessary music licenses. Is it possible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I just sync'ed a lot og music from my pc (Xbox music on win8) but when I want to play a song, I get a message saying "Obtaining license, make sure to have a wifi or data connection..." Is there a way to get all the licenses in one take? I put the music on
 my phone so I could listen to it when im on vacation, but if I have to get a license when I want to hear a song, then its not to much use. I will not have a data connection when im abroad, so it would be really nice if there is a way to get alle the licenses.</p>
<p>So can I do something about this or do I have to cycle throug all the songs before leaving for vacation?</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Sorry for the slow responsetime.</p>
<p>I used the Windows phone desktop app to sync my music.</p>
<p>Yes my music pass is active.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>... Just this weekend I forgot about this bug, and went away on a little weekendtrip, and found myself not being able to play half of my songs because a data connection was needed. Since I was not in another country, I didnt want to enable data roaming.
 Very annoying since I had just spent a lot of time making a suitable playlist for the trip :) Luckily I found a free wifi hotsopt and was then able to cycle through all the songs in my playlist to ensure alle the licenses was downloaded. Took about 10 min
 to do that, so it would be nice if the app just would download all the licenses automatically.</p>

            The first thing to try is a reset by holding the power button and volume down button together for approximately 12 seconds until the phone vibrates.<br />
The phone will now automatically restart but will not remove any user data from the phone.<br />
You will probably need to reset the date and time again though.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't help then you may have a defective phone which you should then have it inspected by Nokia.

<p>Hello, victovic2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting and welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience it is causing you. By the way, how was the phone now? Is it still doing the same thing? Is it happening to the default camera only or same with the other camera app? Did something happen to your phone prior to the issue? Is your
 phone's software up-to-date?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may check if there's an available software update for your phone by going to
<em><strong>Settings &gt; Phone updates.</strong> </em>Note that a stable internet connection is needed. We encourage you to use Wi-Fi instead. You may also consider doing a
<strong>'full reset'</strong> by going to <em><strong>Settings &gt; About &gt; Reset your phone.</strong></em> Make sure to backup your files to avoid data loss. Here's how:&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/basics/back-up-my-stuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/basics/back-up-my-stuff</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>

            purchased the phone in September and now the camera does not function at all. No camera app will open the camera, just force boots back to home screen. Doing a factory reset on this phone is a joke, just look at the google results on endless gear spinning.
 Never have I been so disappointed in a flagship device.

            My camera died this evening. I was at a wedding and now I notice when I start anything which tries to open it, it goes back to home screen... and this is happening 2 weeks after I took it from second send to Nokia "care" center. This is disgusting. Never,
 never, never buy Nokia. They will refuse to change it, just bring it back and forth to stay for months for fix and then when u get it back... bring it again. The most disappointing thing is the support. Guys. U are just not there for us. Many more months will
 pass for me in looking for solution and I just hope the law will help me in the end.

            Hi, Hristo. We're sorry to hear this. As the camera is main feature of the Nokia Lumia 1020, having issues with this function is really frustating IMO.<br />
<br />
Based on your post, you have visited the Care Point again. Correct?<br />
<br />
Have you tried any troubleshooting steps to resolve this? If not yet, you may try the steps in this link:

            Nokia's main selling point for the 1020 is the camera; also Nokia's biggest design flaw.<br />
I've had my phone replaced 3 times within 6 months of purchase due to faulty cameras. The camera today, has yet again broke.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I'm tied into a 3 year contract, however I can safely say I will never purchase a Nokia phone again. Might even sell the handset and use the sim in a different phone.<br />
<br />
The Nokia handset is far too unreliable. Hate having to payout that does not work!

<p>Although the Nokia Camera App works OK on my 1020, when I select Front Facing the app crashes taking me back to the start screen. I've rebooted the phone. I've removed/reinstalled the app. Still no joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's been quite a while since I used the Front Facing camera so I have no idea how long this has been broken. How can I get this working again?</p>

<p>Hi Jenna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems you have got a work/school account from your university. You can set up OneDrive for Business following steps below.</p>
<p>1. Access OneDrive for business cloud library.</p>
<p>If your work/school account has the related license for OneDrive for Business services, you just need to access Office portal (https://portal.office.com) with your work/school account. And then click the OneDrive tile. If it's the first time you access OneDrive
 for Business, you may need to wait for a while. System will set up it for you. After setting up, you can upload files to your OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65fca9ca-c230-4ba0-9c43-92b3289e5854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65fca9ca-c230-4ba0-9c43-92b3289e5854" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Sync those online files to your computer. </p>
<p>You can install the new sync client (if you also use consumer OneDrive and sync those files, you already have the sync client for OneDrive for Business, they use the same sync client) on you computer to sync these files. Edit them in the synced folder with
 desktop applications. Changes will be synced back to those online versions. </p>

<h2>            outlook.live.com&#8217;s server DNS address could not be found - problem on Chrome, Safari and Safari - Mac user</h2>
                    Like others who have posted I have not been able to access my Hotmail account - on Chrome, Safari or Firefox. &nbsp;I use a Mac and access to all other sites seems to be fine. &nbsp;When I go to msn.com I am logged in - so can see there are messages in my inbox
 - but when I try to click through, I get the same error message above. &nbsp;I have tried clearing the cache (Chrome), restarting etc as advised in other responses but not luck. &nbsp;I am not very tech savvy so some of the advice given I am unsure of how to follow
 - or it seems to be for Windows users. &nbsp;I would be grateful for any advice. &nbsp;Thank you.

<p>If only one domain is down out of many (I have had this intermittent problem several times over the last few days) it is very unlikely that there is an issue at the ISP. &nbsp;In fact, the domain owner (Microsoft) is actually the one responsible for advertising
 their correct IP address via DNS - NOT the ISP. &nbsp;The OP said that other browsers do not work either. The above response is a pretty simplistic answer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an issue here that needs to be investigated and pronto. With the exposure of the fact that hackers are attacking email systems, a name resolution symptom for a major email system is a potentially serious issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Escalate it and get more facts...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having the same problem for a while now, about 1 or 2 months. What I experience is outlook.live.com being unreachable from Firefox/Chrome/Internet Explorer, even after clearing cache and running the browser in Incognito mode. What I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Using a different DNS other than my ISP, such as google (8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4)</p>
<p>* Restart DHCP/DNS client, running "ipconfig /flushdns"</p>
<p>* Disable/enable the network adapter</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that works is to restart the PC completely, only then I can access outlook.live.com again. My OS is Windows 7 Home Premium SP1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, last time I tried to re-enable the network adapter it became unresponsive and I had to reboot as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a DNS problem, it's something that Windows is somehow doing wrong, but I have no idea what it is. I also recognize this is a difficult issue to debug, if there's anything I can do to provide more information I'm happy to do so.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Outllook 2013 Error 0x800CCC133 on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Error message when sending a new email was replied on Aug 16 2015 by MVP-Outlook Robert Sparnaaj&nbsp; stating " It is a known Windows 10 upgrade bug. To fix it see:&nbsp; Outlook can't send after upgrading to Windows 10".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This "fix" involves using "Window Resource Checker - sfc /snanow ".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a basic user I'm a little concerned about using this "fix" (a Windows Resource Checker)&nbsp;and wonder just how long a&nbsp;Windows 10 upgrade will be issued&nbsp;to correct the annoying&nbsp;Error, which frustrates new emails from Outlook being issued and simply&nbsp;left in
 the "Outbox".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;look forward to an early response. Thanks. Peter Walling&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>display multi columns through text boxes linked to a combo box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> poliasks  say:</h3>
<h2>            display multi columns through text boxes linked to a combo box</h2>
                    <p>I have a combo box with 3 columns. After some research, I realize it is Access' normal behavior to display only the left-most column after an item is selected, and, in order to display the 3 columns together, either I need to concatenate the three columns
 ahead of time or I have to set up text boxes linked to this combo box. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to use concatenate as I can't figure out a way to align each of my three columns in the drop down list. So I choose to use text boxes. So far my&nbsp;after_update even code&nbsp;works well to link the text boxes to the combo, but here is what I can't
 do:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't visually integrate the text boxes and the combo box together (meaning, I can't use the text boxes to cover the combo box, and somehow set the text box as "front" and the combo box as "back"; currently I have to put the two sets&nbsp;into two separate
 lines). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any recommendations? Thanks!</p>

            <p>I was about to reply to this yesterday in the Answers forum, and we had a power cut for the rest of the afternoon, and when the power returned I couldn't find the thread, presumably because you had marked it as answered :(</p>
<p>You can automate this from Word using a macro e.g. as follows. </p>
<p>The macro assumes that the data is on Sheet1 of the workbook using columns A to C. The macro names the templates from Column A and uses the header and footer information in Columns B and C. It will produce as many templates as there are entries in column
 A.<br />
</p>
<p>Put the path of the worksheet where indicated. <br />
</p>
<p><br />

<p>I have duplicated this answer in the other forum.<br />

    <title>How to show crosstab query data in Access form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> qa144  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to show crosstab query data in Access form</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have a form with few textboxes and a subform to show some data. My first query will run and append data to a table. This table now will be source for my Crosstab query. The object here is to run Crosstab query and show data in the subform. With my limited
 knowledge, I wrote following code to achieve my objective. Unfortunately it returned me error message "Compile error: Invalid use of property". My code is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><pre><code>Private Sub cmdRunQuery_Click()


DoCmd.SetWarnings False

DoCmd.OpenQuery "qryCarrierPackageAppend", acViewNormal, acReadOnly
DoCmd.Close acQuery, "qryCarrierPackageAppend"



Dim db As DAO.Database
Dim rstSnap As DAO.Recordset

Set db = CurrentDb
'Open Snaptyep Recordset

Set rstSnap = db.OpenRecordset("qryCarrierPackageCrossTabBilledProduct", dbOpenSnapshot)

'Now display records in a form


Set sbfrmCarrierPackageCrossTabBilledProduct.Form.RecordSource= rstSnap
Set sbfrmCarrierPackageCrossTabBilledProduct.Form.RecordsetType = Snapshot
Me.sbfrmCarrierPackageCrossTabBilledProduct.Form.Refresh

rstSnap.Close

End Sub
</code></pre>
<p>May I request your help to achieve my objective.</p>

            Okay. Access will actually create a subform for you when you do that. Instead, just add an empty subform control on your form and select the crosstab query from the source object drop down.

<h2>            How to change the shading in this statement template&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a template I downloaded here: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/CT010151389.aspx?CTT=3#ai:TC001129452" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/CT010151389.aspx?CTT=3#ai:TC001129452</a>&nbsp;It is called Billing Statement (Blue Gradient Design), in case the url expires.</p>
<p>I'd like to change the color of the fading shading in the table from the current blue to something else. Yet, when I select the shading tab in the Border and Shading dialogue, there is no present color shown. If I pick one, it replaces with a solid color--no
 fading effect.</p>
<p>How can I change the color and keep the fading effect?</p>

<div>Although it is far from obvious, the color in the table actually is in a </div>
<div>text box or rectangle (some sort of AutoShape) behind the table. If you </div>
<div>display the drawing toolbar and click on the Select Objects tool (the white </div>
<div>arrow toward the left end), you will be able to select this AutoShape. </div>
<div>You'll see that you have the AutoShape selected because it will have the </div>
<div>green Rotate handle. You can then right-click and choose Format AutoShape </div>
<div>and change the fill color. </div>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone doesn't show any Updates. It makes no mention of updates at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's running 1.0. Under settings I have the option to check via mobile data, I tunr this switch on and off, as I have read that this sometimes activites the check. But nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone is connected to wifi, and is unlocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should I do? I'd like to install Whatsapp on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>

<p>No, where / what is the software recovery tool??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried the Nokia Sotfware updater suite, but it doesn't work with this model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had 3 different SIM cards in the phone from 3 different countries. None of them tell me I can update the operating software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And also it is on wifi, so the updater should check via that. Shouldn't it?</p>

            Hi.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help with this, but I am confused. I have tried it with a number of different SIM cards from a 3 different countries, including Vodafone, and the phone is set to not check with Mobile data.<br />
<br />
And I have tried with a number of different wifi access points, public and private, and my ISP doesn't restrict my internet access.<br />
<br />
So I don't see why the problem lyes there?<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

<p>If you insert&nbsp;a SIM, a network configuration is loaded from the internal storage. Some of these configurations are broken (unintentionally) because they block Wi-Fi in parts or total. Therefore, your network operators might matter; it is just a guess for
 your case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, your ISP(s) could matter because all are in the same region and/or use something special which might block the contact to the Nokia update servers. Again just a guess. Without any information, this cannot be analyzed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Finally, your Nokia Product Code could be missing (or blocked) from over the air updates (OTA); intentionally or not. Again, I cannot double check this because I am just an end-user like you without access to that
 OTA database.</span> see below</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I see here in the public available database: Nokia Software Recovery Tool allows to update to the latest firmware. On the short run (and mid-term run) this is the only solution I am aware of because I do not know why your Nokia Asha 501 does not find
 its update over the air.</p>

            I learn new things every day. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Have downloaded and used Nokia Software Tool 1.5 and it has updated the 501 software to Asha 1.4.<br />
<br />
So that's good thanks again.<br />
<br />
Strangely, now the phone won't connect to the home wifi network that it was connecting to when it was running 1.0. I've re-entered the password correctly etc.<br />

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Within a document library on SharePoint Online I'm seeing inconsistency between what is showing up in the "Shared With" column vs what I see when i right click on a folder and click "Shared With". &nbsp;In this particular situation, some of the people in the
 "Shared With" column have left our organization a long time ago and I can't figure out how to get their names out of the document library column. They don't appear when i right click on the folder --&gt; click Shared with --&gt; and review.</p>
<p>It's making our users nervous so thanks for any insight you can provide. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi MLSchuk,</p>
<p>The behavior you saw is by design, as the Shared With column displays any accounts that the document was previously shared with. For more information, refer to:

<div>I am trying to find a way to allow columns in a table to be independent of each other, so when the height of a row in one of the columns change, the other columns are not affected.</div>

            Your screen shots appear to be corrupted, but the general answer is no; you can size cell width independently in various rows, but you can't change cell height in various columns. What you can do is create multiple shallow rows and then merge and split
 cells to create cells of different height. In some cases, it may suffice just to remove cell borders selectively; in other cases, you'll actually need to merge cells. For example, if you have 12 rows, then you can have a cell of any height from 1 to 12 rows
 anywhere in any column; you could have one column with three cells 4 rows high and another with four cells 3 rows high, or any other combination of cells within any column. You can also split cells within those rows, and you can merge a split portion with
 another cell above or below.

            When you choose, for example, "Link Tables...", and the Link file dialog is displayed, there should be a dropdown list at the bottom of the dialog for "Files of type:".&nbsp; If you drop down that list and scroll to the bottom of the list, do you see an entry
 for "ODBC Databases ()" ?

            <p>Arshad's answer is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can format the colour and highlight color of the font that is the result of making a choice from the drop down list options. No coding is required to do this. You can do it from the Ribbon or from the Format Text dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can not colour the options that appear when you activate the drop-down list.</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p><span>I would like to print out my weekly or monthly chart to show my doctor if I visit him. The normal print over the browser isn’t very well. I need a special print view that brings a good layout to print or to save as PDF-File.
<br />
I use also Office 365 and I need a way to download the data (for example biking) in a excel sheet. That is for my doctor even better to read and compare with her medical cardio program.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I use a Microsoft Band 2 and the Health App on my Lumia 650. For overview I use the Microsoft Health Dashboard (dashboard.microsofthealth.com).
</span><span>That device is very important for me because I can record my trainings and get healthier after a bad sickness.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thx for helping</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update 2016-06-03</p>

<p>My laptop had Windows 7, Office 2003 and used Cisco vpn software and all worked well. The company has upgraded to Office 2010 and the email part of the VPN connection does not work. I can still ping the server and get a good reply, however Outlook says trying

<p>Just to make sure that nobody had played with the firewall settings, I did a system restore and brought the system back to when it used Office 2003 and all works as normal. This time I did a clean install with Windows 7 and Outlook 2010 and same problem
 came up. I then tried doing another re-install but this time with Windows XP and Office 2010 and all works well.</p>
<p>Server is Exchange 2003</p>
<p>Any idea as &nbsp;to how I can resolve this matter</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Polar ProTrainer 5 - backup data missing</h2>
                    I use Polar ProTraining every day. when I took backup sunday i discovered that the latest days was not incorporated. They are not to be found in the usual place. seems dissappeard&nbsp;since 24 Mars. And when I run PPT5 as an administrator it is evident that
 these days are absent.&nbsp;PPT5 do ot find them&nbsp;&nbsp;and are no where to be seeen. <br />
For a loong time since I found the missing files in kompatibility but now I cannot find these. no longer in use? (prise the lord if so)&nbsp;<br />
They should be here :<span>
<p>C: users/fhh/appdata/local/virtualStore/Proga…</p>
<p>but appdata is no to be found i fhh and I do not find&nbsp;them elsewhere.<br />
Why are you doing this so difficult !!!!<br />
&nbsp;So my question is : where do I find my missing files?<br />

            I'm not aware of any changes. I suddenly discovered the missing files when I tok the usual sunday backup by loading&nbsp; the whole Polar into a portable disk. not using the build in backup option. I guard this 20 years of training.&nbsp;<br />
they are nowhere to be found on C: the files are named - it'a a date system like this : yearmonthdaynumber of training that day like this : 19032402.hrm and does not show in search on C: there are missing files from 24 to 31 of mars. it happens when i run PPT5
 as administrator and are present if I do not run as admin. al older tranings are present in any case.
<br />
Question : so where goes the files when I run PP% as an admin?<br />
<strong><span>C:\Users\Public\Polar
 ProTrainer</span>’. are not in use.</strong>

            in the PPT5 each year has its own folder containing each day as previsly explained. and the missing files are not present there, but shows in the program when it is not run as administrator so they must be a place on C: but I can't find them.
<br />
Where ar they supposed to be?

<p>jeg finner ingen mapper som inneholder de forsvunnende filene. de skal visst ligge i AppData, men finner den ikke.</p>
<p>når jeg søker på C: etter appdata så kommer det opp en hel haug, men når jeg søker etter virtualstore kommer det ikke opp noen.</p>
<p>Søk sier at de skal være her C: brukere\fhh\AppData\Local\virtual store\Progra.... men når jeg åpner fhh så finnes ikke AppData der og heller ikke finner jeg VirtualStore i noen av de andre mappene der.</p>
<p>spørsmålet er : hvor er de blitt av?</p>
<p>
Sorry ! in English :<br />
I do mot find the files in any folder. they should be in AppData but it is vanished. seeking C: Appdata it show alot, but nothing on VirtualStore.<br />
C: users\fhh\Appdata\Local\VirtuaStore\Progra…. but when I open fhh&nbsp;AppData&nbsp;is not there and VirtualStore is not in any folder there either<br />
Where are they gone?<br />
And this goes for my Laptop also. Is there some wrong with the latest builds. Laptop has the latest</p></span>

<p>none of the latest training files are present in the 2019- folder, but are visible in the program so they must be on the C: somewhere.</p>
<p>I cannot take backup because they are missing in the 2019</p>

<h2>            Excel formula to find largest negative value</h2>
                    <p>Good day Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want a formula in Excel 2007 to find the largest negative value in an array. The array is in one column and consists of both positive and negative values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched online and found this suggested formula, =MAX(IF(B5:B30&lt;0,B5:B30)), but it does not work for me. I keep getting #VALUE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>A formula such as =IF(AF30="Stopped",G30,VLOOKUP($AD30,Data_D!$A$6:$G$2256,6,FALSE)) is a "standard" formula, there is no need to confirm it with Ctrl+Shift+Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula =MAX(IF(B5:B30&lt;0,B5:B30)) is an array formula because the first argument of IF is normally a single condition, but here there is a condition for each of the cells in B5:B30. Hence, IF(B5:B30&lt;0,B5:B30) does not return a single value, but an array
 of values. Such formulas must be confirmed with Ctrl+Shift+Enter.</p>

            Did you confirm the formula with Ctrl+Shift+Enter? That is essential for such a formula, to make it an array formula.
