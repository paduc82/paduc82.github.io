    <title>issues printing a PDF file in IE 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            issues printing a PDF file in IE 10</h2>
                    I am trying to print a PDF file generated from a link in an email. The file will print fine using Chrome, but when using IE 10 nothing happens. This is on a&nbsp; laptop running Windows 7, 64bit, using a Canon printer. All updates are current, as are the drivers.
 The page will print fine on my desktop; I have reset everything in IE 10 to the defaults, uninstalled and re-installed Java, and verified that the OLE Controls are registered. Any suggestions?

            We are also having the same issue -&nbsp;This just became an issue for our IE users this week. &nbsp;We are working around it the same as you mentioned (by saving the PDF to desktop and then printing it ) because clicking print within IE doesn't do anything anymore.
 &nbsp;It has always worked fine until this week. &nbsp;Any insight from the masses (Microsoft support) as to why this is an issue now? &nbsp;The one other reply to your question was directing us to another program to install, however I'd much rather make IE work as it always
 has and not add another layer of issues to the mix. &nbsp;Thanks in advance to anyone with a resolution.

<p>
</p><p>Near the bottom of that Post is a recommended tool to recover deleted partitions.</p>
<p>it is called Paragon Rescue Kit. It makes a USB key with the Rescue Kit installed on it to do the repairs.</p>
<p>This takes lots of reading on your part to understand so read all instructions and maybe get someone you know to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be able to recover what you have lost but no guaranties .</p>

            As the question is how to install Win10 on a clean computer, using the ISO all you need to do is use the keyboard key during booting that opens boot menu(varies from system to systems) select the device which has Win10, let it run when it comes to select
 where to install click on the HD and delete any partitions and let it install when it asks for a key just hit I don't have one when it is finish it will ask for a key I found that Win7 keys still work (as of Sept 28th) haven't tried since otherwise you will
 need to buy a Win 10 key.&nbsp;

            <p>The System partition is not normally the same as the Boot partition. System only needs 100-450 MB. &nbsp;Windows (C: drive) is the
<strong>Boot </strong>partition. It is best to remove ALL partitions before a clean install of Windows to a hard disk, unless you are trying to preserve the existing OS (or a data partition) like you were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting a partition does not actually wipe all of the data, but you would need to use recovery software to try to recover anything from a deleted partition. There are various solutions available online to try to recover a deleted partition. If you really
 need to recover anything, the important thing is not to write any data to the disk. Anything recovered has to be written to other storage media.</p>

    <title>Re-Install Entourage Mac 2008 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgebrodbeck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-Install Entourage Mac 2008</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I installed Office Mac 2011 a few days ago and decided this morning to completely un-install Office 2008 (from online instructions) totally forgetting about the fact that Entourage is my email software (Dooh). This included preferences, licensing helper, license
 file, application support, receipts, Microsoft user data (still sitting on my desktop) and all Snow Leopard files (/private/var/db/receipts).<br />
<br />
I have not emptied the trash yet and also have the original 2008 installation disk.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
1. Can I just re-install Entourage from that disk and if yes how?<br />
2. To get all my info back (Email folders, address book etc), which files do I need to rescue from the trash and where do I put them back to?<br />
3. Will I need to set up my email accounts again?<br />
<br />
Your help to get me back on track is much appreciated.<br />
<br />
George B<br />
<br />
PS: I like Office 2011 so much that I will upgrade to Outlook 11 and use that for my emails once I've done the rescue mission.<br />
<br />

            1. Can I just re-install Entourage from that disk and if yes how?<br />
<br />
Ans- I doubt you can install just Entourage from your installation disk. You need to install complete Office Suite. You can then remove other applications like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
<br />
<br />
2. To get all my info back (Email folders, address book etc), which files do I need to rescue from the trash and where do I put them back to?<br />
<br />
Ans- There must be an Entourage Identity or database in Trash. Restore it back to MUD folder. The path will be- ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2008 Identities/<br />
<br />
3. Will I need to set up my email accounts again?<br />
<br />
Ans- You may not need to create a new account, but i would recommend you to create a new account and then use the restored Identity with it.

<p>You can insert alt-enters where you want to force new lines within the cell.</p>
<p>If you see a little box where that alt-enter is, then you'll have to format the<br />
cell to make sure wraptext is enabled.</p>
<p>If you're creating a formula and want to force a new line, you can use something<br />
like:</p>
<p>="this is line 1" &amp; char(10) &amp; "This is line 2" &amp; char(10)<br />
&nbsp;&amp; text(a1,"mm/dd/yyyy")</p>

<p>If you select the cell and then hit F2 the cursor will be at the end of the last line. ALT+ENTER will get you a new line below.</p>

This is so stupid that I have no words to explain it. Just watch and bang your heads as hard as you can at some wall.<br />
Also I want to see feedback from all over the world, not only from my country. It is a GLOBAL program. Plus allow us to vote to comments up and down. Allow us to report spam and not useful feedback. I want better connection with the team and better recognition
 of Insiders who actually do something useful. Divide the Insiders by those who signed up for the program before release and after release of Windows 10. Allow some levelling of Insiders based on our knowledge. I am a software engineering student and instead
 of using the fast stable Chrome I bang my head and waste my time trying to report Edge errors that seem to be not fixed. Can't see notification when they have been triaged(looked at) by engineers. I want&nbsp;to leave the program because&nbsp;I am so angry about the
 person who decided that anyone can&nbsp;simply join the program and post BUL**T. At&nbsp;least separate the Hub by two easily switchable parts - one for Insiders that are in the program before you allowed anyone to join it and those who joined before that.

            We don't know if you would or not in today's world, as for being angry suggest that you go and read some of the postings from the start of Windows 10 Preview/Insiders and you will see a lot of things have changed because of Feedback from Insiders, I have
 posted at least three times about how the Preview/Insiders program is being run and how just anyone can join, but it is still the same after all it is MS forum and program so no reason to get angry.

            JoeNamco please don't judge me for my words, i was really angry. When your WHOLE Feedback Hub is full of things like "Why i don't have Microsoft.NET" in the Extensions for Edge and random repeating words with no comments, and when you only see 10 or 15
 such feedbacks and nothing more with <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NO</span></strong> option to mark as spam and downvote and when you are limited to feedback that is posted by users of your country you will understand me. Maybe you are from
 a country which has many Insiders like USA but it seems that either for some reason only stupid feedback shows for me or here at my country only stupid people become Insiders. I also start to feel stupid for participating into a program that is not made to
 motivate users and provide them with fast and easy ways to help. I don't know for the developments that you have seen but i can tell you that the program (not the product) was way better in its first days that it is now. :(

            <p>&nbsp; There are a great number of posts in Feedback that I cannot see a purpose to as well.&nbsp; Many have no relevance to how I use Windows, so to me seem utterly pointless.&nbsp; But others use Windows in ways I don't.&nbsp; It's possible there are issues in Windows that
 I will never encounter because I never use certain aspects of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; As a software engineer student, you may have learned that no matter what you design, if the user can't understand it or doesn't like it, it's useless.&nbsp; The basic user has to have input into basic functionality design.&nbsp; The basic user is going to do stupid
 things.&nbsp; One of the first things I encountered in programming was error trapping.&nbsp; You have to let as many technical and non-technical users get daily use and abuse on your software before you can see what has to functions have to be fixed or even blocked.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Division of Feedback... We should also further divide the groups by those who are technical experts from those who only think they are.&nbsp; The Feedback could require an affidavit of technical expertise, credentials... And each post could be given a reliability
 rating based on the education level of the Insider providing the Feedback.&nbsp; Maybe Feedback on design should be limited to those who hold a degree in software design or engineering, since they would know best what the user needs.&nbsp; A time division?&nbsp; Would that
 include anyone who was on the Insider Program prior to 1990? Does expertise in the release of Windows 3.0 translate to expertise in Windows 10?&nbsp; Is there a specific cutoff date? Say, only those who joined the Program within the first 30 days of the announcement
 of Windows 10 testing?&nbsp; Or maybe Windows 8/8.1 testers?&nbsp; They may have some relevant knowledge.&nbsp; Windows 7 pre-release testers can't have anything useful to propose since they're all brain-washed into believing that aero is king.&nbsp; And forget about anyone who
 ran Windows XP prior to it's release.&nbsp; XP is dead.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Levelling of Insiders....&nbsp; That would be fun.&nbsp; Make it a game.&nbsp; Award Experience Points based on the number of posts.&nbsp; Maybe award Microsoft (formerly Bing) Points for every Helpful vote your posts receive, or every UpVote a Feedback receives, or every
 time a post is marked as Answer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm just a hobbyist user.&nbsp; I don't design hardware, I don't write software.&nbsp; I use Windows and some of Microsoft's other products throughout my daily life.&nbsp; Sometimes it does exactly what I want it to, sometimes it refuses and throws error messages at
 me.&nbsp; An error message doesn't mean something is broken.&nbsp; It may, but it also may be because I asked it to do something it wasn't designed to do.&nbsp; Sometimes, it doesn't function as designed.&nbsp; That's the time I send in Feedback.&nbsp; Sometimes it does things I didn't
 ask it to do.&nbsp; More feedback or a Forum post.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is my Feedback relevant?&nbsp; As a simple user? Microsoft seems to think it may be.&nbsp; They asked for it.&nbsp; Is my Feedback relevant to every other user of Windows 10?&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; But Microsoft has given every user who joins the Insider Program a voice.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Every user has the ability to post in the Feedback hub.&nbsp; It's Microsoft's decision to solicit feedback from it's software users, regardless of gender, race, national origin, color, religion, education level, technical expertise, or ego.&nbsp;

    <title>VBA to copy sheet or range from workbook to workbook with wildcard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelfrye  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA to copy sheet or range from workbook to workbook with wildcard</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to write a macro that will open multiple workbooks and copy the sheet or range of data back to one workbook.</p>
<p>My challenge is that this is done weekly and the filenames of the workbooks have the date included.</p>
<p>The beginning of the filename is the same and would like to be able to us a wildcard for the rest.</p>
<p>I currently use this while both files are open</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWindow.ActivateNext<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets("Sheet1 ").Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range("A2:I15").Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Copy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows("EDD Status by Month.xlsx").Activate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range("A2:I15").Select<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :=False, Transpose:=False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.CutCopyMode = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to be able to run the macro and have it open each file copy and paste and move on to the next file.</p>
<p>The weekly files are named </p>
<p>ABCDE 01-17-12.xlsx</p>
<p>DEFGH 01-17-12.xlsx</p>
<p>IJKLM 01-17-12.xlsx</p>

<p><br />
Sure, but that would only find files Like ABCDE-anything-here-.xlsx. That would mean you'd find update all ABCDE files of any date, but I&nbsp;thought the objective was to update files with any prefix but only the given date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best thing is try the example, adapt to your needs, but only work with backups or non critical files until you have got it as required.

<h2>            Outlook 365 stopped working after the May 10 Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>My Dell laptop updated automatically last night to the Windows 10 update (may 10, 2016) and now my Outlook 365 has stopped working completely. Each time I start it, it shows this message
</p>
<p>Obviously Windows is not finding the solution...</p>

<h3> mike2874  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email Address Gobbledygook</h2>
                    <p>I put Office 365 on my mother's computer under my 365 Home license. She's using outlook.com as her email and Outlook as her email client on her computer. Outlook wasn't syncing her email I think due to Microsoft switching to Exchange and deleting the account
 and starting over was supposed to be the fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I deleted her account but didn't pay attention to the warning I needed to back something up... maybe not smart. I created a new profile entering her name Pat C and email I'll call *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Her new profile syncs plus sends and receives email just fine... but something's weird going on. Inside of Outlook it lists her email address as gobbledygook it's something like outlook.37ej39.07d.outlook.com instead of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. I've already deleted
 the profile but I believe the profile itself listed it as *** Email address is removed for privacy *** but if you looked at the Properties of the account it listed it as outlook.37ej39.07d.outlook.com. The gobbledygook numbers &amp; letters aren't exactly as they were listed but you get the
 picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried creating new Profiles plus doing an Office Repair but I always get the same random number &amp; letters for her email. Nor do I ever see this gobbledygook during the setup process... only after it's finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway to fix her email when using Outlook... her email is fine outside of Outlook?</p>

<h2>            Query to link table Yes&#47;No field with text field in another table</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi</span></p>

<p><span>I have 2 tables</span></p>

<p><span>tblLike</span></p>

<p><span>tblShop</span></p>

<p><span>In tblLike there is<br />
PersonID (autonumber), PersonName (text), Cakes(Yes/No), Fruit(Yes/No), Juice(Yes/No)</span></p>

<p><span>In tblShop there is<br />
ShopID (autonumber), ShopName(text), Sales(text)<br />
each shop can only sell one thing either Cakes, Fruit or Juice.</span></p>

<p><span>How can I create a query to pull out the shops which sell the items with a tick in tblLike</span></p>

<p><span>So I could have:</span></p>

<p><span>PersonID = 9876, ShopID = 1 (cakes)
<br />
PersonID = 9876, ShopID = 2 (juice)<br />
<br />
</span></p>

<p><span>or<br />
<br />
</span></p>

<p><span>PersonID = 9876, ShopID = 2 (juice)
<br />
PersonID = 9876, ShopID = 3 (Fruit)<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically I am looking for a way to link a Yes/No field (=-1) in a record to other records that are text fields</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Is this possible</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Thank you</span></p>

            <p>The reason this is complicated starts with incorrect database design. In a relational database (unlike a spreadsheet) you should not define column values as attributes this way. Think skinny rather than wide:</p>
<p>tblPerson</p>
<p>PersonID</p>
<p>PersonName</p>
<p>maybe email address, other contact info</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblProducts</p>
<p>ProductID</p>
<p>ProductName</p>
<p>Now you can see the huge benefit: if you ever decide to sell another product, all you have to do is add a row to this table, not add additional fields and fix up existing queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblLikes</p>
<p>PersonID long int PK</p>
<p>ProductID long int PK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now people can have one or more likes, and your queries become trivial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably also need:<br />
tblStores</p>
<p>StoreID</p>
<p>StoreName</p>
<p>StoreLocation</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblStoreProducts</p>
<p>StoreID long int PK</p>
<p>ProductID long int PK</p>
<p>This table will currently have 1 entry per store, but that could change if a store in future will sell two products. All you will have to do then is add one row in this table, and everything else stays the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And don't forget to enforce relations in the Relationships diagram.</p>

            As Tom points out, you are 'encoding data as column headings'.&nbsp;&nbsp; A fundamental principle of the database relational model is the Information Principle (Codd's Rule #1). This requires that all data be stored as values at column positions in rows in tables,
 and in no other way.<br />
<br />
For an illustration of how to automatically recast a badly designed table like this into a set of correctly related tables see UnencodeColumns.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />

<p>Hi ShahanwajShaikh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Configuring <strong>BitLocker</strong> on your Windows is a good way of securing your files and your system from any possible intrusions. In order for me to either direct you to the correct channel or provide you the right troubleshooting, I would like to
 know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your computer connected to a domain?</li><li>What is the make and model of your <strong>Windows 10</strong>?</li><li>Do you get any error message?</li><li>Have you tested if the issue is happening on a different user profile?</li><li>What is the version and build of your <strong>Windows</strong>?
<ul>
<li>You can have this checked by pressing the <strong>Windows button + R</strong> on your keyboard to access the
<strong>Run</strong> box, then type <em><strong>winver</strong></em> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026181/windows-10-find-my-bitlocker-recovery-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> as a guideline on addressing your recovery key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to keep in touch with me for further assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I understand, you are having a problem with using Publisher on different resolution.&nbsp; Thank you for reporting this issue. In order to investigate it further, there are few questions I have
 for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; What is your DPI setting for each of the monitor?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Can you clarify how you how did the issue occurred?&nbsp; Were you moving the pictures/text boxes within the publication or outside the publication (scratch area)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>May</p>

<p>Hello James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly ask the CIO to post announcement in internal group than every user subscribed to that group will receive email notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I would request you to kindly go through below points for better understanding regarding the email notification:-</p>
<ol>
<li><span>The user should be subscribed to the notifications he wishes to receive that can be set under edit settings -&gt; Notification in user profile.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>If the user is online in Yammer when the post was created, Yammer checks if the user has read the message or not. If the user reads the message, logged into yammer with any device than in notification button it will show next to message button, no
 notification email will be sent. </span></li></ol>
<p>If the user does not read the message, a notification will be sent after 15 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>If the user is not online in Yammer, the notification is sent immediately. By not online we mean he is not logged in to Yammer from any device.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Microsoft is making some changes to how notifications work in Yammer, here is a summary</span><span> as below:-</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>logic has been added that holds email (15 minutes) and push notifications (2 minutes) while you are active on the Yammer web site or in the mobile app</span><span>
</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>After that delay Yammer will check that a message thread is still unread before sending an email or push notification to avoid notifying you about things you've already seen on the web or in the mobile app</span><span>
</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>To make it easier to triage your Yammer emails by providing very explicit explanations for why you're getting the emails</span><span>
</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Some changes to the format of email notifications, Tuck has provided Microsoft with feedback on what we did not like about examples we have seen</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Developed new business logic for what triggers email notifications and will send notification emails for the following scenarios:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>new announcements</span><span> </span></li><li><span>when someone mentions you on Yammer</span><span> </span></li><li><span>when someone is added to a direct message</span><span> </span></li><li><span>when a non-group participant is added to a private group conversation</span><span>
</span></li><li><span>when a message thread conversation in your Yammer Inbox goes from read to unread</span><span>
</span></li><li><span>when someone replies directly to your message</span><span> </span></li><li><span>when someone sends you a new direct message</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>With the exception of the above scenarios, Yammer will stop sending email notifications if you haven't read a conversation thread since receiving a previous notification for the same conversation. In other words, lack of engagement will be seen as
 lack of interest.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Of course this is all subject to&nbsp;your notification preferences. If you disable email notifications then no notifications will be sent.</span></p>
<p>Please find the link for more details on <a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__techcommunity.microsoft.com_t5_Yammer_Yammer-2DEmail-2DNotification_td-2Dp_16083%26d%3DDgMFAw%26c%3DM-KQspD_LQogCbR-BWCHOaeDEPOhF8vWqHZTaiwxT3c%26r%3DcgwJ8LpujZGEAsWM3brnq2o1y1_2pJhdDSRkTWwfLHY%26m%3DV2ysL67zThsY7wSDhqMK402G_Y245hPZBp4sNz7I-_w%26s%3D7cKJT9A9U_SkT1iwa1bwvhTbbVSozK4vi_UcvIT-c1Y%26e%3D&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cv-mahtiw%40064d.mgd.microsoft.com%7C7e3f120d13d5441e932108d476d196e6%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636264089951994367&amp;sdata=VWSLLVphuo4iiSPWmgnTk7n1gvQdzjnFqCxmZiWucLU%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>As&nbsp; the announcements are made it triggers an email-notification for same. The result is that a lot more people are likely to read Announcements than regular posts. The approximate average is that 5 times as many people in the group are likely to read and
 act on your post.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi TommyGrundy,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates. As Skype for Business and Skype are two different software, they are vastly different even though they share a similar name. You can transfer the files in Skype for Business to another Skype for Business user and you can
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/set-up-skype-for-business-online/allow-users-to-contact-external-skype-for-business-users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
allow users to contact external Skype for Business users</a>, but it’s infeasible for you to transfer files from Skype for Business to Skype. If it’s inconvenient for you and you really want the related features, it’s recommended for you vote it on
<a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available/suggestions/15365583-allow-the-transfer-files-between-skype-and-skype-f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the related feedback page</a> and your comments will be valuable. Your time and understanding is highly appreciated.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windown Phone 10 &#40;Creators&#41; calendar does not synch, but email does</h2>
                    <p>Since I was pushed Creators on my Lumia 950, my email works fine, but my calendar does not. I cannot tell if the issue started with the OS update or with the Outlook Mail and Calendar app update.&nbsp; The back end is Office 365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation is some of the calendar items come through from O365 fine, some do not appear (but show on the O365 site and on my laptop Outlook offline calendar. And since my work calendar data moves around a lot, I cannot trust what shows on the phone as
 some items stay at the original times and not what was changed and reflected in O365 and Outlook. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is sort of a permanent app, I cannot remove it and reinstall it.&nbsp; Ideas?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi. Since all the apps mention required internet connection, kindly check if you have a stable internet connection. To verify this, access any website using the phone's browser. You may also toggle between cellular data and WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's no issue with your connection, you may try uninstalling and reinstalling the apps. However, note that your app data will be deleted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the Messenger app, you may check with the developer to confirm if the call feature is included on the Windows Phone version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>which is logical really. However the user often adds more text in the email before sending so I dont capture this as the is message sent before i can save it. Maybe i could put a message box out to confirm that the user is done and then do the save and send
 from Access?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
</blockquote>
No, Once the e-mail message is generated, if the user edits it, I don't think Access can capture that. So your best bet is to put a reminder for the user to save the message. Or allow them the edit the contents of the msgtxt variable and force the send.

<h2>            9841 will not load at all.</h2>
                    <p>Cannot install build 9841 on a HP G60 laptop which has ran 8.1 just fine. After language and preferences screen install now was chosen &amp; then I get Windows setup screen covered by a load driver dialog box saying: A media driver your computer needs is missing.
 This could be a DVD, USB or Hard disk driver. If you have a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive with the driver on it, please insert it now. Note: if the installation media for Windows is in the DVD drive or on a USB drive, you can safely remove it for this step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inserting a DVD with all the latest drivers from HP produces: No device drivers were found. Make sure that the installation media contains the correct drivers, and then click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers on USB produce the very same result. I am stalled now and cannot load 9841 at all.</p>

            <p>Please note, Windows 10 is still in development, if your intention is to upgrade your Windows 8.1 installation, you should not do so at this time. Try dual booting instead:</p>
<p>
create a partition and install the Technical Preview there:here is how you create a partition in Windows 7 or Vista:
</p><p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dual-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f03%2fdual-1_thumb1.jpg%3fw%3d361%26amp%3bh%3d187" height="187" width="361" /></a></p>
<p>Open a Run command (Press Windows key + R) on your keyboard. Then type <strong>
diskmgmt.msc </strong>then hit Enter on your keyboard.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can click Start, right click Computer &gt; click Manage &gt; click Disk Management.</p>

<p>Enter the amount you want to allocate. Depending on the architecture of Windows&nbsp;10 you want to try. If you are using Windows&nbsp;10 32 bit, you can allocate 16 GBs or 20 GBs if you using the 64 bit version. Another factor is disk space for applications, page
 file and drivers.</p>
<p>Click OK.</p>

            <p>The reason for loading this was the loss of the original hard drive so I am starting with a new one that has no OS on it at all. I did, however set up a partition using G-Parted so that there is only one partition formatted in ntfs.</p>
<p>I do find that others with this unit have had the same problem due to the failure to locate the hard drive. I am not sure of the correct driver it wants nor where to locate one. Attempts to load windows 7 on this drive worked fine and I since removed it
 so I could load the Technical Preview but no joy. There is just something different about how the program loads.</p>

            PowerPoint aliases all visual media, both videos and still photos, giving them a slightly blurry appearance. This is not media compression. Type, vector graphics and autoshapes are not affected.

<h2>            Streets and Trips replaced by Bing Maps</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Streets and Trips for many years. &nbsp;My current version is 2010. &nbsp;I have 4500 stick pins on my Streets and trips and I need to keep them. &nbsp;I understand Microsoft has discontinued Streets and Trips and recommends Bing Maps. &nbsp;I saw the video
 on Bing Maps and it looks great, however, I would like to know if Bing Maps will install in my computer and if I can transfer my Highlights and Stick Pins FROM Streets and Trips TO Bing Maps and then count on this process working?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>            How to convert WKS file to XLSX file</h2>
                    <p>I have important files in the old WKS format which can be opened by Microsoft Works.</p>
<p>I need to access those old files.</p>
<p>I now have the Microsoft Excel 2010 installed in my new computer running on Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: &nbsp;How can I convert the wks to xlsx file format?</p>
