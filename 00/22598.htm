    <title>Doubt about the effect of repeated incomplete chargings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> longtalker---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Doubt about the effect of repeated incomplete chargings</h2>
                    Since my mobile phone starts charging automatically every time it is connected to the PC via USB cable, I was concerned that this would damage the battery in the long run (I do data transfers via USB quite often). But then I read somewhere (cannot remember
 where, but was a reliable source) that, because the battery is Li-Ion, it does not care how often you (partially) charge it, and whether it is full or not when you unplug the charger. So I continued to connect my phone anytime I needed to, without worrying
 about the battery.<br />
<br />
Recently, my laptop charger's jack got dented, which made it cling only very feebly to the laptop, and thus unable to provide continous voltage to the PC. This meant that when I moved the laptop around, I would constantly hear the beep that the PC makes when
 the charger is plugged/unplugged. Since I did not have time to get another charger, this went on for a few days and completely ruined my battery, to the point where now the laptop won't last even 10 minutes on battery.<br />
<br />
So apparently, frequently plugging and unplugging the charger tremendously shortened its life - which made sense especially when I remembered the classic recommendation of not using up "battery cycles" by unnecessarily plugging and unplugging it all the time.<br />
<br />
This is what got me confused. If my laptop's battery (which is a Li-Ion, just like the phone's battery) has died after a damaged charger rapidly - and many times - connected and disconnected it from AC voltage, why would the phone's battery not be affected
 by me repeatedly connecting and disconnecting it from the power supply whenever I make a USB transfer? I would very much appreciate it if someone who understands how batteries work better than I do were able to clarify me on this - many thanks in advance!

            What damaged your laptop's battery was not repeated plugging in and unplugging, it's far more likely to be battery depletion due to not being plugged in long enough and because the amount of current being supplied to it was reduced due to the poor connection.<br />
<br />
You might also be able to reverse the damage with a few complete charge-discharge cycles like you have to do when the battery is new, but it does look like one or more cells in the battery have died.<br />
<br />
Now, also bear in mind that the kind of intensity involved in charging your phone's battery is far lower than is used to charge the laptop's battery. Your battery will not be damaged by plugging the phone into a USB port. There's no way a manufacturer would
 make it so easy to damage the battery in normal use. Think of the warranty claims and possible class-action lawsuits...

<p>Hey, thanks for your reply.&nbsp;Bear with me just a bit more...:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"it's far more likely to be battery depletion due to not being plugged in long enough"</p>
<p>- Yes, that's what I fear will happen to my mobile's battery as well, since I don't keep it connected for long (just enough to transfer my files).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Your battery will not be damaged by plugging the phone into a USB port."</p>
<p>- I didn't think just plugging it into a USB port&nbsp;would&nbsp;damage it, but would&nbsp;repeated one-minute chargings&nbsp;not do so?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I know the current through a USB port is smaller than that through a regular charger, but if it is enough to (eventually) charge the battery, then it is probably also enough to damage it through repeated one-minute chargings (if said hypothesis is
 true...)</p>

<p>I'm not a battery doctor, but I stayed at a Holiday Inn express once. Here's my theory... The battery in your laptop is probably 3 or 4 cells in series (a LiPo battery puts out a standard voltage of 3.7 volts per cell). I don't know how smart the PC is about
 keeping those cells in balance, but if one or more of the cells gets out of balance (i.e. it's voltage is 3.2 volts while the rest of the cells are 3.8 volts), when you start drawing down the battery with usage the one cell dies long before the others and
 the computer considers the battery to be dead.&nbsp; Possibly repeated mini-charges can cause the cells to become out of balance (? - like I said, I'm not a battery doctor), or maybe one of the cells developed an internal flaw... it happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battery in your phone is a single cell, so balance of the cells is not an issue.&nbsp; The cell developing a flaw is still a possibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, batteries do have a limited number of cycles that they can be charged/discharged, so I usually try to run mine down fully and recharge it fully each time.&nbsp; However, the worst that can happen is that you'll need to go get a new battery, so I wouldn't
 lose sleep over it if I were you.</p>

            You didn't understand what I was trying to say because you're too polarized on the "one minute charge is bad" thing.<br />
<br />
Depletion is bad for LiPo and Li-ion cells. Charging them for short periods of time in itself is not what's going to damage them, it's letting them go flat by not doing it enough. If you want, you can charge a battery with 120 bursts of 1 minute or however
 many it'll take.

<h2>            problem office 365&#47;outlook  ATT Uverse , windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Helping setup an older ladies new desktop with Uverse. &nbsp;The only thing she wants to use is outlook. &nbsp;Purchased office 365 from Ebay, &nbsp;installed and brought up Outlook. &nbsp; I &nbsp;used the various in-bound &nbsp;out-bound info &nbsp;Att-Uverse &nbsp;had given me. &nbsp;I was not able
 to setup outlook, &nbsp;it failed every time. &nbsp; Called Att-Uverse, &nbsp;Some 3rd level tech person finally logod on to her system and also tried a number of things. &nbsp;After 30 minutes of trial, he &nbsp;dropped his connection &nbsp;and the phone call and never called back. &nbsp;
 When I tried to call back the same phone number for Tech support &nbsp;I got busy signal.</p>
<p>The lady has called Uverse and they want to charge her 178.00 &nbsp;to come and setup her outlook. &nbsp;This is outrageous and I will advise her to return the Uverse and go with another provider. &nbsp; Hope someone from ATT will see this post and will give me a solution.
 &nbsp;I live an hour away from the ladies house and it is very hard for me to go to her house.</p>

Thank you so very much. &nbsp;I followed the steps provided in the instructions for Outlook 2013 and it worked like a charm the very first time. &nbsp;I was able to send and receive emails. &nbsp;It was a double success this morning as I used &nbsp;TeamViewer (Another excellent
 application) &nbsp;and accessed my friend's desktop (save me an hour drive), &nbsp;and was able to setup her account. &nbsp; With clear instructions and great applications like TeamViewer, &nbsp;people like me who know somethings about computers are able to solve some problems
 and not pay ridiculous amount of money (UVerse wanted $178.00 to come and fix outlook !).

<p>
</p><p>Good to hear everything has been squared away - there's nothing a on-site tech could do that the couldn't have been done remotely if the right info was used/applied. Just means that the tech(s) weren't familiar with configuring an email account in Outlook
 using the correct AT&amp;T settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a general note, one thing for everyone reading this to remember when contacting their ESP's (email service provider) support desk, is that many do not provide support on configuring specific &lt;email clients&gt; particularly when it comes to the various versions
 of Outlook. They stop at providing the email account settings which generally are on the ESP's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More specifically, there is a big difference between asking an ESP support tech "How do I configure my email account to work with Outlook" and "what are the correct POP or IMAP settings for my email account?". It's not uncommon for a tech to say that "we
 don't provide Outlook support" which too many people mistakenly interpret as "Outlook doesn't work with XYZ provider". Email account settings on the other hand are universal regardless of which email client is used and it's a matter of learning how to correctly
 configure that email client for whatever protocol (POP, Imap etc) is desired.</p>

            I did reply via my email, &nbsp;but today received another email telling me i had not answered. &nbsp;Thank you so very much Karl, &nbsp;I followed the instructions given for Outlook 2013 and it worked like a charm the very first time. &nbsp;Appreciate your help very much.
 &nbsp;It is for people like you, &nbsp;who semi knowledgeable people like me can solve issues and refrain from paying high fees.

            <p>Hi Karl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having similar issues with my Outlook 2010. However, the article you mentioned at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/article.html#!/email-support/KM1010505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.att.com/esupport/article.html#!/email-support/KM1010505</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>has been removed. i am at a loss and my system admin also cannot figure out why my outlook just does not connect from home while I never had this issue in last 10 years. Another co-worker is also having the same problem. Wondering if this is due to a switch
 to AT&amp;T uverse or a Microsoft update that caused our issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or guidance will be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

</p><p>#1 I restate the issue I am facing: My work email resides on an Exchange Server and we use Outlook as our email client. In the last 10 years I have never had a problem using Outlook at home. But ever since I moved to AT&amp;T Uverse Internet, my Outlook does
 not work. I keep getting the message: Trying to connect... The Inbox does not get updated. I neither receive emails nor can I send any emails.&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>Aside from being extremely confident that this is a "settings" issue, you're not the only one who has complained about accessing AT&amp;T accounts. Don't use AT&amp;T so have no idea what the correct settings should be so this is as far as I can go on this.. By
 the same token, as mentioned before, Outlook doesn't do anything differently when connecting to an account and if it was a universal issue, would mean that every user using AT&amp;T &amp; Outlook would not work and this forum would be lit up like a Christmas tree
 with complaints</p>

            <p>Hi Karl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally resolved my issue and can finally connect to the work exchange server from home after 4 months. Here is what I found:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
The problem is not with email configuration. It works fine outside the home where we have Uverse.&nbsp;Connect&nbsp;to public wifi at an Airport or a hotel or at a friend's place with a different ISP and there is no issue. I tried the AT&amp;T test tools but the connection
 failed every time. Finally I went into the router settings, checked a few configurations and then made the following changes:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
1. Open Network and Sharing Center</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
2. Manage wireless networks</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
3. Select the Network at your home that is Uverse</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
4. Click on Adapter Properties</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
5. Make sure to check: Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
6. Now select it and click on the 'Properties' button</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
7. Ensure that 'Obtain an IP address automatically' option is checked by default</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
8. Now Select the option: Use the following DNS server addresses:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
a. Preferred DNS Server: Type 8-8-8-8</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
b. Alternate DNS Server: Type 4-4-4-4</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
9. Click 'Ok'</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
Now you should be able to connect to your Exchange server. Mine did after 4 months of not working or giving the message: 'Trying to connect..'.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Should you have problem connecting to your exchange server outside of home, you will have to go back to step 7 and select: Obtain DNS server address automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
I just resolved my problem and have not been outside so cannot say for sure if you will have connection problem or not while in a different network.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Office 365 account and use various applications across devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the recent (11th July 2018) word, office, ans powerpoint update on my One Plus 5 phone with an Android OS, these three apps have stopped working. Steps I have already tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstalling and re-installing the app several times. </p>
<p>2. Signing out and in from the office controller app.</p>
<p>3. Re-starting my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, nothing has worked. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note: One note, one drive, and outlook continue to work fine. However, there hasn't been an update on these apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Also, word, excel, and powerpoint are working fine on my windows laptop, and iPad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help resolve this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

Did you clean the cache and data of the app before unistalling?<br />
Are you able to do a master reset on the phone?

<p>Okay, so I cleared the cache, and app data. Then tried opening the app, didn't work. Next, I uninstalled the app, reinstalled it. The app opened breifly, i got a message on the lines of "getting your data," then the app crashed. Now, the same error message
 as earlier is popping up "word keeps closing."</p>

            This could be a bug with last update and that phone. To do a master reset here are instructions.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.hardreset.info/devices/oneplus/oneplus-5/hardreset/first-method/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hardreset.info/devices/oneplus/onepl...</a><br /><br />Note: This delete all your files, so if you are doing this make sure to have them backed up

<p>Sorry, I misunderstood. I thought you were referring to some way in which I could restore the original settings of the app or roll back the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I am not going to hard re-set my phone. Too many complications in that process and too much to loose to try and make these three apps work! I think I'll explore google or other alternatives and hope that the next update fixes these issues.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>What does Microsoft do with my contacts list&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hfm47  say:</h3>
<h2>            What does Microsoft do with my contacts list&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I tried to sign up to receive email information from the program related to the Windows 10 upgrade and during the process I was informed that Microsoft wants to have access to my contacts list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that is a very serious request, so there must be a fair bit of documentation about why Microsoft wants access to my contacts list -- where might that documentation be found?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly will Microsoft do with my contacts list?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who at Microsoft will be able to view the list?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I will probably have more questions as those answers come in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try to use the search tool here for answers, but without any luck, so if I made a mistake during that search, please forgive me.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Charley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Office Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From where did you purchase Office 365 subscription?</p>
<p>How did you install Office 365 on the computer? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The email account which you used to sign-up while purchasing or redeeming the Office 365 is the one which gets associated with the subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, try to activate Office 365 using the registered Microsoft Account and verify the status.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still face any issue with activation then provide us the detailed information about the product purchase and installation which will help us to analyze and assist you in better way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
        </p>

                    <p>I need to edit an email address in outlook email.&nbsp; However, the menu on the left does not contain a link for contacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then I went to People in Outlook and tried to edit there.&nbsp; That did not work because the entry has no Edit link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the other links in both places but could not find anything that enabled me to edit my contact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me how to edit without those links.</p>

I checked in another browser--still no Edit option.&nbsp; I don't know what Private mode is.&nbsp; I googled it, and what I found pertained to sending outgoing email --I could not find anything relevant to Edit.

<br />In order to paste screenshot please use the Insert image option. If you will just copy paste it will not post the image.
<br />
<br />So you have opened a browser in Private mode (Incognito for Chrome) and you still do not see the option to edit when you click on the contact ? Did you try to delete it and recreate it (save information somewhere, like on sticky note) ?

<p>So I clicked Prt sc and then I clicked Insert image, but apparently I have to save the image before I can insert it.&nbsp; I don't know how to save a Prt sc image--can you explain?&nbsp; Anyway, the only reason I am sending it is to prove that there is no Edit option.&nbsp;
 Will you know what to do when you see that?&nbsp; If not, why send it?</p>

</p><blockquote>Dear Janet, <br />
<br />
In order to paste screenshot please use the Insert image option. If you will just copy paste it will not post the image.
<br />
<br />
So you have opened a browser in Private mode (Incognito for Chrome) and you still do not see the option to edit when you click on the contact ? Did you try to delete it and recreate it (save information somewhere, like on sticky note) ?

    <title>Referencing a different range in Excel Worksheet using VBA - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Referencing a different range in Excel Worksheet using VBA</h2>
                    <p>I hope someone on here can help me with this.&nbsp; I am a novice with VBA, although I can usually work through most issues by searching.&nbsp; I have a VBA routine that loops through a range of data, and if a certain condition (True or False) is met, should return
 the value of a range in a different row and column.&nbsp; I have tried .Offset and .Cells methods with no luck.&nbsp; Here is my current version of code:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)</p>
<p>&nbsp; Dim MyCond As Range&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Dim MyRow As Integer&nbsp; ' Lookup row # of Condition Cell<br />
&nbsp; Dim MyCol As Integer&nbsp; ' Lookup column # of condition Cell<br />
&nbsp; Dim nRow As Integer<br />
&nbsp; Dim nCol As Integer<br />
&nbsp; Dim nRange As Variant<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Unprotect</p>
<p>&nbsp; Range("A1:AD101").Interior.ColorIndex = 2<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each MyCond In Range("BK1:BK101").Rows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If MyCond.Value = "True" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyRow = MyCond.Row<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyCol = MyCond.Column<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
' This section used just to make sure correct values are returned.&nbsp; Will delete once Sub functions properly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox ("Lookup Row: " &amp; MyRow)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox ("Lookup Column: " &amp; MyCol)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox ("Lookup Value: " &amp; MyCond.Value)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nRow = MyRow + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nCol = MyCol - 12<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nRange = Range(Cells(nRow, nCol)).Value</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox ("Reference Value: " &amp; nRange)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This is where I am having current problems (RT Error 13 - Type Mismatch)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ElseIf MyCond.Value = False Then GoTo rLoop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ElseIf MyCond.Value = "" Then GoTo Quit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
rLoop:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next MyCond<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Quit:<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Protect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should nRange be dimmed as something else, or am I just screwing this code up royally?&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Excel AddIn - Bing Maps - Where can I find the doumentation&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to use Bing Maps, but need to understand better how it works.&nbsp; I'm looking for technical documentation in order to answer some specific questions.&nbsp; Here's one such that I've not gotten a response to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Bing Maps add-in for Excel allows the display (marking on a map) &nbsp;of multiple addresses&nbsp;contained in&nbsp;a spreadsheet table.&nbsp; The address markers on the map, however, are too big for my purposes.&nbsp; I've not found any documentation for this add-in.&nbsp; DOes
 anyone know if documentation exists and/or if the address "marker" can be changed?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas about where to find Bing Maps documentation?</p>

            You have installed the Maps appllication and the map data, did you also install the voice? This can also be done with the Map Loader software.<br />
<br />
If the voice files are absent or corrupted, no error is generated, you just get silent guidance. If you have installed voice files already, make sure in the Nokia Maps settings that the same option is selected for voice guidance. For example, if you have installed
 English but in the settings US English is selected, you hear nothing...<br />

<h2>            Conditional Formulas in Excel 2010 to Measure&#47;Report Workflow Times</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am trying to create a formula for a stoplight chart monitoring how long a draft document is in staffing from point-to-point where several points have different target processing times. For example, one reviewer may have 2 weeks to review and sign a draft
 document before it is considered late, while another may have only a week. I need to be able to look at the cell with the date it was sent to the reviewer versus the cell the reviewer signed it. If the cell the reviewer signed it is blank, I need the formula
 to calculate how many days since the document was sent to the reviewer.<br />
<br />
=IF(B1="","=(TODAY()-A1)","B1-A1")<br />
<br />
Then I'll apply conditional formatting to determine whether it is green, yellow, red.

<h2>            How do I revert to my Google homepage in IE10 and windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since downloading some pc games to my desktop the homepage in&nbsp;IE 10 homepage opens to&nbsp;<a href="http://th.hao123.com/?tn=sft_hp_hao123_th" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://th.hao123.com/?tn=sft_hp_hao123_th</a></p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 Home Basic&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this came about because I forgot to "untick" a box so&nbsp;letting my homepage be changed.</p>
<p>I can't remember what game supplier was involved.</p>
<p>I thought if I added this to my list of 'restricted sites' it would suffice - but no good.
</p>
<p>I have tried to search and delete any program files that&nbsp;this kind of name - but no good it comes back again</p>
<p>I really only want my 'google' setting back.</p>

<h2>            Issues with IE rendering after latest 9860 build</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the 9860 build with no problems but on starting IE, i got a message indicating that IE was being upgraded then the rendering got &nbsp;messed up. Since IE seems to be the rendering engine for lots of the OS, the problem manifests itself outside the
 browser as well. Here is what the Win 10 Feedback app looks like now. This is just one example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running a Dell Inspiron All-in-One with less than ideal video drivers though i did not have this with the earlier build (i posted on that here before). I don't have any issues with Chrome.</p>

            Go to Windows Update and check for update. Then install all available updates, especially KB3008956. Restart your computer. The issue will be fixed.

<h2>            How to correct Office Lens doesn&#39;t update OneNote successfully but does create a Word docx on OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>I have been a heavy user of Office Lens on my Lumia 920.&nbsp; Today, with no apparent changes, Office Lens began consistently&nbsp;to fail&nbsp;with OneNote.&nbsp; On my Windows 8.1 computer, OneNote gives a message, "Content Not Available Yet.&nbsp; Sorry, it looks like this page
 was added from another computer and hasn't synced yet.&nbsp; Click here or press ENTER to reload this page."&nbsp; The page is present both in the Windows 8.1 Microsoft OneNote app and in the web version of OneNote, but the content is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Lumia 920's Office Lens app,&nbsp;when I Tap to open, I get the message, "Page not found&nbsp; This page has been deleted."&nbsp; Actually the page is present in OneNote on OneDrive but appears to be corrupt or incomplete.&nbsp; I have tried repeated uninstall
 and reinstall of the Office Lens app, with power off / power on between uninstall and reinstall.&nbsp; I have tried using a different OneNote notebook to store the page One Lens creates, rather than the default notebook and section.&nbsp; I would have tried an uninstall
 of OneNote itself but the WP8.1 system on the Lumia 920 doesn't permit that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, Office Lens does successfully send pictures to Camera Roll on OneDrive.&nbsp; And, most encouragingly, Office Lens does successfully create Word docx items on OneDrive, even if it fails to create a OneNote page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug on the Microsoft front end app or backend services for Office Lens creating OneNote pages?&nbsp; I know there was a Windows 8.1 patch that just went in, but I am unaware of any direct relationship with Windows Phone 8.1.&nbsp; Are nonetheless&nbsp;the patches
 relevant?&nbsp; Is there something I can do to remedy the problem?&nbsp; I have been using Office Lens almost every day, some days quite heavily.&nbsp; The Word docx functionality serves me as kind of a work-around, my personal workflow has become heavily dependent on OneNote
 and I would be very disappointed to have to give it up and use other tools.</p>

            <p>My Windows phone Office Lens today has successfully created OneNote pages today, and&nbsp;yesterday's incomplete or corrupt pages appear to have been recovered.&nbsp; I changed nothing.&nbsp; Did anything change in software of systems management with backend systems for
 OneNote on OneDrive?&nbsp; Is there a status page that would let me know about in-progress and completed incidents like this one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, this problem appears to be closed.&nbsp; Thanks to whoever took corrective measures to recover the Office Lens OneNote OneDrive system.&nbsp; I really like Office Lens and am pleased that it is working again.</p>

            My environment is seeing a very similar issue as well.&nbsp; I suspect that KB3087985 is the cause, as uninstalling this update and restarting the computer seems to fix the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also found that running sfc /scannow would temporarily fix the issue after
 a reboot, but it would&nbsp;come back eventually.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>SFC is a function built into Windows known as System File Checker.&nbsp; A high level overview would be that it checks the integrity of certain system files and "fixes" any problems it finds.&nbsp; Off the top of my head I don't really know much more about how it
 works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run it, you would go to Start, type cmd, and choose the command prompt.&nbsp; Type sfc /scannow into that window and press enter.&nbsp; It will count up to 100% and let you know what it finds when it is finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, it has been a temporary fix for the problem for us.&nbsp; It always comes back and I still don't have a long-term solution.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, when we had tested at our end using slicer after converting the data into
<strong>Table or Pivot table</strong>, Slicer used the custom list and provided the output as same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had tested at our end by referring to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-slicers-to-filter-data-249f966b-a9d5-4b0f-b31a-12651785d29d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Use Slicers to filter data</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps we followed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Added some sample data to Excel workbook and converted the data to table:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8240126-b6da-4861-8308-f5c2e74f0784?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8240126-b6da-4861-8308-f5c2e74f0784?upload=true" /></a>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7980d665-de07-4123-bc3d-22e73052e12d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7980d665-de07-4123-bc3d-22e73052e12d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Select any cell in the table&gt; Go to Insert&gt; Click on the Slicer in Filters section&gt; it prompts with a window (Insert Slicers)&gt; Select Month&gt; Ok</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc361258-1395-42bf-a3ca-e0e9814939a8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc361258-1395-42bf-a3ca-e0e9814939a8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. See the difference between Slicer if we enable <strong>Use Custom Lists when sorting
</strong>in Slicer settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Custom List when sorting is enabled:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Use Custom List when sorting is disabled:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/870d07f7-a9dc-4d9d-84b8-c0e229053b81?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/870d07f7-a9dc-4d9d-84b8-c0e229053b81?upload=true" /></a>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcaa6c62-a541-492b-8653-4867e882aaaf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcaa6c62-a541-492b-8653-4867e882aaaf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: To open the Slicer settings, right-click on Slicer window and click Slicer settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. So, when we use the Use Custom Lists when sorting, it inputs the data as shown in the table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, we suggest you check the order of months represented in table or pivot table and check whether Use
<span>Custom Lists when sorting is enabled in Slicer settings</span>. If still it shows incorrect, please provide the Excel workbook via private message (to protect your private information) which help us to test at our end.</p>

<h2>            Office 2016 and OneDrive for Business</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>This may be a blunt question, but I can't seem to figure out whether the just released Office 2016 (as part of my Office365 subscription) includes OneDrive for&nbsp;Business.</p>
<p>As OneDrive for Business was not part of the preview release, I was reluctant to install the preview.
</p>
<p>I noticed that with the release today, the sites mention that an updated version of OneDrive for Business will be released later this month. When I try to install Office 2016 it states it wants to uninstall my current (2013) version of OneDrive for Business.
 Obviously I need this to work.</p>
<p>Thanks for your responses.</p>
<p>Ronald van Barneveld</p>
