<h2>            Not a fan of the Store &#40;Beta&#41; layout, would like to hear other users&#39; opinions</h2>
                    <p>When comparing the layout of the Store (beta) to the old Store I feel like the everything has become too crowded.&nbsp; I am using a 23" 1080p display so it is reasonably large, and I liked the way the old store scaled to my display.&nbsp; I wonder how this would
 look on a Surface or other device with a smaller, higher resolution display (if someone has one I would like to hear about your experience).&nbsp; My expectation is that it would seem even more crowded.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that having more padding (blank space) between the apps would make it&nbsp;easier to view, and more space between the sections would make the organization easier to understand.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being able to click on the app developer's name to view their other apps is extremely important to me, and makes it easier to browse the store.&nbsp; I also find new apps this way when I enjoy using an app by a particular developer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I miss the forward and back key functionality that the old store had.&nbsp; Since I have forward and back keys on my mouse it makes it easy to navigate modern apps.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scrolling also needs to be addressed.&nbsp; I've seen others post about this already but this makes using the mouse much more difficult.&nbsp; Whenever you scroll over a horizontal section that section is&nbsp;scrolled instead of the page.&nbsp; The only way to scroll down
 the entire page is to move the mouse into a blank area or to move the mouse to the side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I would like to know if other people have these issues with the store as well.&nbsp; Maybe people who are used to other app stores think that this layout&nbsp;is easy to understand.&nbsp; I wouldn't know since I've only really used the Windows 8 / Windows phone
 8 stores and the Play store on mobile.</p>

            <p>You can only change the color of a&nbsp;shadow if the font is Wordart. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A workaround would be create your text, copy, place the copy on the original. Give&nbsp;the&nbsp;text&nbsp;a color, nudge, send it to the back.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 calendars</h2>
                    <p>When I try to open my home or office calendars (WHICH HAVE PREVIOUSLY WORKED) I get an error message saying it cannot open C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Apple\Internet Services\APLZOD.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at the addins this files is shown as C:\......APLZOD32.dll and this is the file I can see in explorer. Any idea why Outlook is looking for APLZOD.dll and not APLZOD32.dll</p>

<p>I think you have&nbsp; a good point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hanging in there, solving one little part of the problem at a time, until I have finally resolved the final part.&nbsp; I got iCloud disconnected and reconnected, and the calendar came back.&nbsp; But I lost my only contact group, and had to replace it.&nbsp; But
 I couldn't!&nbsp; I could add contacts, but groups just wouldn't be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted (again), and discovered that the group contact function had returned.&nbsp; It was the last part of this problem, which I never considered a really big problem.&nbsp; Annoying as hell, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what I had done from the start was to re-install Outlook, get rid of iCloud, re-install iCloud, (restarts at every step) (by this time my iCloud calendar had returned, as had my iCloud contacts).&nbsp; When I thought I was done I discovered my ONLY contact
 group was missing.&nbsp; And the means of making a group was gone.&nbsp; I restarted again, and the group function was restored.&nbsp; Then, all I had to do was to re-stock my group with contacts to send e-mail to.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; Finally.</p>

<p>OK.&nbsp; In the last 24 hours I've handled 2 computers with this APLZOD.DLL problem.&nbsp; the first one took me all day yesterday.&nbsp; The second took about half an hour.&nbsp; I don't know what the Microsoft support folks will come up with.&nbsp; Nor do I know what the Apple
 support folks will do.&nbsp; I only know that they will continue to accuse each other while your computer fails to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my second computer I fixed the problem fairly quickly by doing a complete uninstall of iCloud for Windows followed by the install of iCloud for Windows.&nbsp; This fixed up my Outlook 2016 profile so that everything works the same as it did before the MS security
 updates clobbered Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, I had previously run the installation repair function of iCloud for Windows figuring that this would be good enough.&nbsp; It wasn't.&nbsp; You must uninstall iCloud for Windows and reinstall it.</p>

<p>I found it interesting that this happened to my laptop a week or two after I got my W10 update.&nbsp; I can't prove it, and it might have been two weeks, not the next day, but it never happened prior to the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use the EASE assistance from Century Link, which costs me $10 per month.&nbsp; Well worth it.&nbsp; I used three technicians, each with a somewhat different take on things.&nbsp; Not bad, just different.&nbsp; One did an operation to reset my computer to two days earlier.&nbsp;
 It didn't work because there may have been a problem with anti-virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last tech seemed to know exactly what was happening, and she did the iCloud uninstall and re-install, which fixed nearly all the problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last problem, the one about losing my only contact group, took some doing, and a restart, but I fixed it on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only Microsoft involvement I had was in this forum, and I never contacted Apple support.&nbsp; Maybe I should have.</p>

<h2>            Opening .msg files coming up with permission error while Outlook is open</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a customer who is unable to open .msg files while Outlook is open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The users are all admins of their own computers, and have the correct permissions when accessing the saved .msg files stored on the network share - I've even copied the .msg files on their desktops and still the permissions error message comes back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .msg files will only open if Outlook has been closed down (not just minimised). What's going on??</p>

            <p>Hi Careless_adi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the screenshot. I would like to confirm the following information to determine whether it is an Outlook client side issue.<br />
<br />
â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Which <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Outlook-do-I-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c#bkmk_32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook client version</a> are user using? Please provide us with detailed information about this.<br />
â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How many users are affected by this issue and the problem has recently appeared?<br />
â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does this issue happen to every or specific .msg files?<br />
â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Try to check this issue via starting Outlook in safe mode to see whether an add-in is the problem. For your reference see under
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-can-t-start-Microsoft-Outlook-2016-2013-or-2010-or-receive-the-error-Cannot-start-Microsoft-Office-Outlook-Cannot-open-the-Outlook-Window-d1f69da6-b333-4650-97bf-4d77bd7abb85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Start Outlook in safe mode and disable add-ins</a><br />
â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Please try to create a new Outlook profile to troubleshoot this issue. Here is the article for your reference:<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/kb/829918</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the troubleshooting steps above donâ€™t help, then please create a new Windows user profile and performing a clean reinstall the latest Outlook application program to see whether the problem still occurs.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t access account even after changing password.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Keep resetting password and then can't log in - small business desperate for help!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have logged in as my husbands name as my accounts keeps saying that my password is not valid.&nbsp; For the past few days everytime I log in to my hotmail account it says my password is not valid and prompts me to change it - I am doing this every time I log
 in.&nbsp; It is now saying that I have reset my password too many times.&nbsp; I run my business from this account and I can't access any emails.&nbsp; I have changed my password to something different every time and then it lets me in until I log out and then I can't get
 back in again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I have had my paypal hacked yesterday and money taken out of my account - I have sorted this changed all passwords and they are all different - could this be linked - can I not get in to my email because it has been hacked???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is now saying I have had too many attempts and to leave it 24hrs before trying agin to reset my password - I am desperate to get in to this account - I have half of my accounts in it and I am terrified of losing them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help or advice would be much appreciated - I am desperate!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h3> lisazq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendar Print View Issue</h2>
                    I have three half-hour appointments one after the other, which when I got to print in weekly view show as overlapping. Why do they not display one after the other like they should? It appears to be a problem with Outlook because other appointments and
 calendars with back to back appointments display correctly - ie one after the other.&nbsp;

                    <p>I redeemed MS rewards points for a $5 Amazon gift card, but received a completely blank email save for some MS branding and tile. Already contacted support, but since MS support is rarely empowered to solve problems, they just sent me here.</p>

            I had the same issue, had them resend the email, received it blank again.<br />
<br />
However, visit the following address:<br />
https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/redeem/orderhistory<br />
<br />
You can see all of your Rewards history there. Find the reward you are having an issue with, click on the Order Details button for it. That will reveal the Amazon code, which you can copy and paste into your Amazon account / Redeem a Gift Card.

<h2>            How do I unsubscribe from Bing News emails&#63; No &#34;unsubscribe&#34; option</h2>
                    <p>I don't even remember signing up to receive Bing News email, and yet I receive a daily message from Bing. Their emails do not include a link to unsubscribe at the bottom - what it says is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">You received this email because your account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is subscribed to the Bing News email alert. To stop receiving these emails, use this link to manage your interests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I'm brought to a page to manage interests (seemingly for MORE email). I can't delete "my interests" (which are just News Near Me and Weather Near Me). There's no actual indication of how to fully unsubscribe from emails from Bing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance you can provide will help! I'm not looking for information on how to customize my homepage, or anything like that. Just want to stop receiving these annoying and completely irrelevant emails!</p>

<h2>            How can I unstall MS Office Professional 2007 Trial version&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded MS Office Professional 2007 Trial in 2008? I believe it was. I did purchase Office 2007 Ultimate after that. I didn't know if I should remove any previous versions so I never removed the trial version from my computer. I continually have&nbsp;issues
 opening Excel and Word. I want to delete the trial version but an error message says the product installation was&nbsp;corrupted and I need to run again from the CD, DVD, or other original install source.&nbsp;I cannot run again since it was a download from so long
 ago. I thought if I uninstall the trial version of Office, the Office Ulitmate may work properly.&nbsp; How can I uninstall the trial version??&nbsp; Thank you for any help you can offer.

    <title>Office Outlook 365 reflecting huge number of emails when there are - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> auntmja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Outlook 365 reflecting huge number of emails when there are none&#33;</h2>
                    Ever since I downloaded free trial of Office 365 and then since downloading paid one-year subscription, my Outlook 365 is reflecting "4294967295" unread emails in my "Inbox," when indeed there are no emails in my Inbox. This huge number goes away when
 there are actual unread&nbsp;emails in my Inbox, but as soon as the actual emails are read or moved and/or&nbsp;my Inbox is empty, this annoying number is reflected in blue by Inbox name. Two agents have tried to solve but to no avail. Does anyone have any ideas and
 know how to fix? I have tried the quick repair, as well as full online repair, and uninstalling and reinstalling, and turning off and unplugging computer and then plugging in and turning back on. Nothing is working--that huge number is still being reflected
 as unread emails. Does anyone have any ideas? Could it be related to corrupt driver? Any help or ideas would be much appreciated!

            Thank you for your reply. I'm using Outlook in the Microsoft Office 365 subscription package. I followed the steps you suggested, but still that huge number is reflected as unread messages in my Inbox when in actuality there are no messages in my Inbox.
 Someone mentioned that it may be problem with&nbsp;the Office 365 driver? Do you know anything about that as a possible reason for the problem?...Thanks again for trying to help me solve this problem.

            <p>A device driver is a program that controls a particular type of device that is attached to your computer. There are device drivers for printers, displays, CD-ROM readers, diskette drives, and so on. Since MS Outlook is an application itself, it does not
 need a driver to run. We suggest that you run MS Outlook in Safe Mode and see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how to open Outlook in Safe Mode:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> on your keyboard.</li><li>Then type <strong>outlook.exe /safe </strong>and press Enter.</li><li>Check if you will still experience the same issue. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we recommend that you reset the navigation pane on Outlook by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> on your keyboard.</li><li>Then type <strong>outlook.exe /resetnavpane</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>

<h2>            OWA - Online archive has no &#39;Conversation View&#39; available</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In OWA (Outlook Web Application) in the Online - Archive folder, it does not have 'Conversation View' in the Filter options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However conversation view is available in the Inbox folder Filter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please let me know if this is available and if so, how I go about enabling it, via OWA settings or via 365 Admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is not a feature available please let me know so I can tell people at my organisation that were wanting this function :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Nik</p>

<p>Hi Nikolas Taili Siosiua,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you mean the filter "Show as Conversation" is&nbsp;invisible for In-Place Archive (Online Archive). And yes, as you thought, the feature is&nbsp;unavailable for&nbsp;In-Place Archive folder. If you want this feature, it's recommended to submit your feedback
 and thoughts about it via&nbsp;<a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office365.uservoice.com/</a>. Uservoice center will help us to know where can be improved for our products and Microsoft set a high value on customers'

<h2>            14372 wont work with my HP Deskjet 2050</h2>
                    <p>When update 14372 came around my printer disappeared from the list of printers.&nbsp; When I hit refresh it takes about 5 minutes to finally detect it.&nbsp; However the thing it installs doesn't function.&nbsp; It looks right but the device doesn't show up in applications
 as a printer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to remove it and reinstall, including unplug etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that has worked to fix it is to go download HP's software and install it.&nbsp; This has never been necessary for this printer in Windows 7, 8 or even 10 until this build.</p>

            <p>You have to remember you are working /using unfinished software. Minor changes will still be made, and some items don't&nbsp; work yet.</p>
<p><br />
Most of the time Windows doesn't put in a full package for the printer, its only really basic Drivers, to get full functions you need software from the manufacture - try downloading the latest software from HP, which was May 4, 2016 .

Thanks Sherri, you are so right.&nbsp; In the past I always had trouble with McAfee and it was diffacult to get rid of.&nbsp; I have used Norton now for several years and even though McAfee is used by them, it has been OK.&nbsp; I did call Norton and they told me that the
 Windows Defender and the Windows firewall both automatically turn off because all I need is Norton and it does so much more than the WD/WF&nbsp; it's OK if their off.&nbsp; While I did know the win firewall was auto turned off by Norton, I did not know the win defender
 was also turned off by Norton.&nbsp; And since I was getting messages from Microsoft that my win defender software update failed, I guess Microsoft doesn't know that either, since they keep trying to download it.&nbsp; I'M not sure how to stop that.&nbsp; Anyway, all is
 well now that I know what caused the issue.&nbsp; I should end with, stupid me.&nbsp; Well, we live and learn, don't we.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks again.

<p>According to the post below, Windows 10 automatically disables Defender when it detects another&nbsp;antivirus installed in the computer.&nbsp;The last paragraph in particular.</p>

<p>I don't understand his answer but, if you go back through this threads replies you will find out why the Win Defender will not function.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Many problems have already posted fixes but, so many people don't read all the previous posts and they miss it or
 ignore that their query "&nbsp;may have a solution "&nbsp; that Microsoft suggests them to look at before they post their problem, because it may already have been answered.&nbsp; I know because I did the same dumb thing :)</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Secure Message - Missing Sign in or One Time Passcode Options</h2>
                    <p>One of our users received a Microsoft Office 365 encrypted message with a message.html attachment.&nbsp; When she opens the attachment, she sees the usual information:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From:</em></p>
<p><em>To:&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"To view the message" etc..etc.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>What she does not see is the "sign in" or "use one time passcode" option.&nbsp; After reviewing the message.html file, I see:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>style='display:none;</em></p>
<p>Is associated with lines which would display the "sign in" and "use one time passcode" options.&nbsp; After removing the&nbsp;<em>style='display:none;&nbsp;</em>from the message.html file and saving it, I am able to see those options.&nbsp; Can anyone provide some guidance
 on this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not use Office.&nbsp; We really need our users to see the one time passcode option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi NJAX,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I should say Microsoft never sends such an email which requires the customers to sign in or the so-called "passcode". So, I suspect it might be a phishing email. Please do not click to read it (especially the url there) or you can provide it in
 the <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/new">
Private Message (PM) </a>so that we can help check it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>
