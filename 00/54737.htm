<h2>            XBL &#38;quot&#59;Continued&#38;quot&#59; Harrassment &#38;amp&#59; Solutions</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">One of my amazing friends is being constantly
<b>harrassed </b>on <b>XBL</b>. She utilizes the "<b>Submit Player Review</b>" &amp; "<b>File Complaint</b>" options attached to the
<b>harrassing </b>profiles. However the person/people that are constantly harrassing her
<b>continue </b>to do so by creating <b>new/dummy </b>accounts. Assuming that <b>
<span style="color: rgba(0, 153, 0, 1)">Xbox</span>/<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Microsoft</strong>
</span></b>is smart enough to <b>block </b>the <b>IP Addressess</b> of those members and not just Gamertags, I'm left to assume that either the harrassing person/people are smart enough to
<b>bypass <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Microsoft's</span></b> methods or that <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">
<strong>Microsoft's</strong> </span>methods are just being implemented <i>
frustratingly</i><b> slow,</b> without any significant options to utilize. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">My friend messaged me on
<strong>XBL</strong> this morning stating that this ordeal is making her consider not gaming anymore as the consistent harrassment takes away from the happiness that gaming has provided her for so many years. That message broke my heart as I realized how powerless
 a lifelong gamer can be against hateful people online. <b>Cyber bullying</b> really should be
<b>illegal</b> if it isn't already. Be that as it may, my efforts to contribute to any type of solution led to me coming up with my
<i>recommended </i>solution that <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Microsoft</strong>
</span>implement the option for <strong>XBL</strong> members to enable <b>
automatic message blocking from <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">unknowns</span>/<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">non-friends</span>/<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">strangers</span></b>.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">I think that all
<b>360</b> users in addition to <b>X1</b>, (Xbox One), users would benefit from having the "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>options</strong></span>" to either:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)"><i><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">block messages from XBL members not on their friends list</span>
</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">or
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)"><i><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">block messages from XBL members not on their friends list that are less than a year old</span></span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">With the implementation of either option, tenured members would still be able to receive messages from their friends as well as add members of
<strong>XBL</strong>, new &amp; old. <strong>XBL</strong> members that want to message to a person that automatically blocked messages fron non-friends would need to have the other member add them by informing them to do so through contacting them in person or
 through their usual website for communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">The most important part of implenting these features though would be for either
<i><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the "Send Message" option to be removed from view by those automatically blocked</span></i> or
<i><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">a notification be sent to users letting them know that person can only recieve messages from friends/tenured members</span></i>. This would prevent any misunderstandings from happening in regards to one person claiming
 they sent a specific message while the other claiming they never recieved. One of the most
<b>annoying </b>features <b>currently </b>on the <b>360 </b>is that game &amp; party invites can be declined without the host knowing causing them to patiently wait &amp; wonder if their invite was declined or seen at all. Speaking of which, please add the option for
<i><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">users to receive a notification when their invites are declined/deleted</span>
</i>so that they know to move instead of pointlessly patiently waiting for nothing, (been there, done that, it sucks).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">Lastly please add the option to
<i><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">block all friend requests</span></i>, similar to whats offered by
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 153, 0, 1)">Xbox</span></b>'s major console competitor. Some people
<b>don't </b>want a maxed out friends list and actually <b>prefer </b>having a <b>
small friends list</b>, (such as myself).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">In summary
<b>please </b>add these <b>options</b>/features to the <strong>360</strong> &amp; <strong>
X1</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)">-

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">*Note - my recommendation for the addition of the option to "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">block messages from XBL members not on their friends list that are less than a year old</span>" refers to actual "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">XBL
 memberships</span>" less than a year old <strong>not</strong> blocking actual infants. However, I suppose though if an infant had a profile created for it after it was born its profile would indeed fall into the category I am requesting to be created. Sorry
 infants <strong>:(</strong></span></p>

<p>Has your friend considered....ignoring their messages?</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">The answer to your question is that she is a very <strong>
positive</strong> &amp; <strong>playful&nbsp;</strong>person, perhaps to a fault. She is/was looking to make new gaming&nbsp;friends with fellow gamers based on their
<strong>conversations</strong>, <strong>personality</strong> &amp; <strong>gaming</strong>
<strong>interests</strong>. In seeking new &amp; interesting people to socialize with she periodically checked all her messages. The fact that the people harassing her do so from
<strong>multiple fake accounts</strong> further makes it hard for her to identifiy &amp;&nbsp;ignore the
<strong>bad&nbsp;</strong>message senders&nbsp;from the <strong>good</strong> message senders. As
<strong>proper</strong> and <strong>polite</strong> as my friend is I kind of wonder if should actually could ignore recieved messages. She messaged me this morning saying that she is taking a break from gaming, which led me to checking this post.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Situations like these remind me of why Nintendo has been so
<strong>reluctant</strong> to implement a true quality&nbsp;online gaming experience, which was to
<strong>protect</strong> the <strong>innocence</strong> of <strong>kind-hearted</strong> gamers, kids &amp; adults alike, from the
<strong>cruel</strong> &amp; <strong>selfish</strong> people online that <strong>cowardly</strong> exist due to
<strong>anonymity</strong>. </span></p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">You are <strong>correct</strong> and thank you for correcting me on that.&nbsp;I realize now that&nbsp;I should have checked&nbsp;the privacy options currently&nbsp;offered&nbsp;before creating my post instead of only&nbsp;going off the outdated things that
 I rembered. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">However I still believe the other <strong>4</strong> of my 5 recommendations would make
<strong>XBL</strong> better. Furthermore, the reason why I recommended the option to "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">block messages from XBL members not on their friends list that&nbsp;{XBL memberships}&nbsp;are less than a year old</span>", was to allow members
 to enjoy <strong>social interaction</strong> among <strong>random gamers</strong> with<strong> genuine profiles</strong> without the inclussion of interactions with people that created
<strong>last second expendable profiles</strong> for the sole purpose of <strong>
harassment</strong>. My friend has come across <strong>many</strong> fun &amp; interesting people that she has become friends with through games like
<strong>Halo</strong> &amp; <strong>Diablo</strong>. If she would have used the option to "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">block all messages from non-friends</span>"/"<strong>Friends Only</strong>", (which disables voice communication in addition to text
 communication with random people),&nbsp;she wouldn't have&nbsp;been able&nbsp;to "get a feel" for the type of people she was
<strong>randomly</strong> gaming with &amp; might not have been <strong>encouraged</strong> to befriend those same random people that sent her friend requests and whom&nbsp;she now calls
<strong>friends</strong>.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">In regards to the <strong>4th</strong> option, my friend has
<strong>not</strong> performed it because&nbsp;she has met a lot of her&nbsp;<strong>good</strong> friends through the conversations she had&nbsp;from
<strong>random</strong> gameplays with them in games such as <strong>Halo</strong> &amp;
<strong>Diablo</strong>. Being that she is primarily being harrassed by <strong>mulptiple fake profiles</strong> the inclusion of an option to block profiles with&nbsp;<strong>XBL Gold</strong> memberships
<strong>less than a year old</strong>&nbsp;would be a more suitable alternative than blocking
<strong>all</strong> voice &amp; text&nbsp;communications with people that aren't on her friends list. She does not wish to block communication with any
<strong>potentially</strong> amazing people just because of her harassers. Unfortunately&nbsp;if the best options you can offer are options she is
<strong>already&nbsp;</strong>aware of then the only thing I can <strong>immediately</strong> do for her&nbsp;is remind her of them. However I still would like to see the implementation of the recommendations I have mentioned in my original post, exlcuding&nbsp;the "Friends
 Only" option, which a fellow member has greatfuly&nbsp;pointed out already exists. </span>

New XBL Account Security FAQ</a> link you have have attached, in addition to other posts, to see if there is anything further than can be done. The real purpose of this post though, in addition to helping my friend,&nbsp;is to serve as&nbsp;a reminder that online harasment
 is <strong>still</strong> going on and&nbsp;to see if <strong>new</strong> &amp; <strong>
better</strong> solutions to this <strong>ongoing</strong> problem are actively being&nbsp;researched &amp; sought by
<strong>Microsoft </strong>instead as opposed to everyone just s<strong>ettling</strong> with the current anti-harassment measures offered.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">I understand what you are <strong>trying</strong> to say. However it
<strong>seems</strong> that your words&nbsp;are actually&nbsp;advocating/implying&nbsp;<strong>online harassment</strong> as&nbsp;being
<strong>acceptabe</strong> and that <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Microsoft</strong>
</span><strong>shouldn't</strong> try to do anything more to&nbsp;prevent <strong>online harassment</strong> from continuing to occur. Thoughts like that probably&nbsp;are the reason why my friend has
<strong>stopped</strong> gaming and the reason why she has requested her profile be
<strong>terminated</strong> on the social gaming site, (gamertagpics), that&nbsp;her harassers originated from.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Honestly, its just sad overall as to how the <strong>
internet</strong> is more &amp; more becoming a place for <strong>cowards</strong> &amp; <strong>
cruel</strong> people that <strong>abuse</strong> the established rules &amp; sytsems while those that follow them are just continually suppose to "<strong>take it</strong>". Being that I don't value the addition of new friends &amp; actually
<strong>appreciate</strong> having a <strong>small</strong> friends list, would-be harassers don't bother me as "<strong>Mute</strong>" &amp; "<strong>Block</strong>" are two of my favorite features on
<strong>frequency</strong> that&nbsp;my friend has been receiving them I'm not sure how
<strong>tough</strong> I'd actually be</span>.</p>

    <title>Desktop icons - Align to grid - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Desktop icons - Align to grid</h2>
                    <p>This small little issue has me stumped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I know it's a bit ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my SP2 I had my desktop icons set at "Align icons to grid", which for some reason won't align them on the right hand edge of the screen.&nbsp; They will only align a full icon space from the right hand edge.&nbsp; If I turn "align icons to grid' off then I can
 move them where I want, but my OCD wants them aligned correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only reason I thought they might not arrange to the right hand side is because of the charms bar....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?.....</p>

            <p>Aligning to the right is the Apple world for OS/X and probably the only thing you can do is shut off "alignment" for the icons and just do it manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows world always align to the left.&nbsp; The Charms Bar menu would get in the way and would bug the heck out of you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, you do have the capability to shut off alignment and manually place the icons anywhere you want.&nbsp; They should stay that way when you switch desktops/shut down, restart, etc.</p>

            <p>Thanks James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'll just have to be content with manually placing them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What I meant about aligning though was that I can place icons on the far right hand edge, but when I select 'Align icons to grid' they move only one place to the left (not all the way to the left.&nbsp; It's as though the 'grid' that they align to does not include
 the far right edge.&nbsp; If that makes sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the screenshot, the icons are set with 'align icons to grid' but they 'will not' align on that right edge.&nbsp; Is this the same across the board with the Surface Pro / Windows 8?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I've just repeated what I said in the previous post, but hopefully the screenshot explains it clearer.</p>

            <p>That is probably because of an invisible "zone" for which the Charms Bar menu resides.&nbsp; The left size also has a "zone" for the slide out "active app" panel that comes out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may look weird but in manual mode, you have full control on your icon placement.&nbsp; I know a lot of people do that to separate critical apps and files from the general purpose apps and files.</p>

            Did the System ever enrolled in Insider program for Windows 10? The reason I am asking this is because beta builds aka Insider builds of Windows 10 have a specific expiry date and when the date reaches the system cannot boot at all.

            <p>Thanks for your reply. I read the "Project to a wireless display with Miracast", and, as I stated in my original post, I do not see anything about a "wireless display" under "Devices/Project". Could that be because my PC came with Win 8 and I did the free
 upgrade to Win 8.1?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, when I go to the "Project to a wireless display using Miracast" page, I get a message at the bottom of the screen that says that my PC is running Win8, not Win 8.1. &nbsp;I checked that in Control Panel/System, and it says "Windows 8" in big letters,
 and then to its left, it says Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>I also went online and asked Microsoft which version I am running, and it said "Windows 8". So I am now more confused than before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, please help me to determine which Windows I am really running. If it is Win 8, should I update to Win 8.1, and if so, how do I do that now? &nbsp;I thought that I already did it. Arghhhhhhhhh......</p>

            <p>I have determined that my Dell Inspiron 15 laptop is running Windows 8.1, so thanks to anyone who helped me figure that out.</p>
<p>I still want to mirror my laptop screen to my Roku stick and therefore to my TV. As I have said before, when I click on "Devices"and then on "Project", I do not see any choice about "wireless". There are only the following choices: "PC screen only", "Second
 Screen only", "Extend", and "Duplicate". No "Wireless". So what should I do? Do I need to buy another piece of hardware? Is there some software that I can download? Please advise.</p>

<p>Hi Impluse Blade,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for replying and providing more details. Since this issue is concerning purchases you've tried to make via the Microsoft Store, then you would definitely need to use the link I provided before to contact them to see what they can do to assist
 you. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here on the forums we do not have the tools to do so. Your best bet is to get in touch with the Microsoft Store Support personnel who can assist you more fully. I do apologize if you have had a frustrating experience with them at a prior time; however, if
 you do contact them again, I'm sure you will reach a different agent and can be assisted in the correct manner to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/28808/microsoft-store-contact-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Microsoft Store Support</a> this link contains details on how to reach them via computer or phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps out.</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday I accidently got a trojan virus, Anti-Spyware Soft. I'm fairly confident I removed the virus (deleted registry's, ran Malaware which found other instances of the virus' attack) but now my computer will only boot into safe mode.
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I made sure the box wasn't clicked in the msconfig menu. I tried pressing F8 and using the startup repair utility, which found no problem. I cannot do a system restore as there are no restore points. This is extremely frustrating and I'm at my
 wits end, what do I do?</strong></p>

            When in safe mode click on Start, Run then type in msconfig and click OK.&nbsp; On the boot tab check to see if Safe Mode is checked under Boot Options.&nbsp; If so, uncheck it and try rebooting.<br />

            <p>Many thanks for response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem relates to the "Edge" browser page .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although IE 11 is very slow opening the favorites tool bar when open is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However on the "Edge" page favorites toolbar the sub folder menu(Say for banks) refuses to open and when you attempt it the toolbar field keeps fluttering as though it is trying to open it. Individual sites(like Amazon ) are responding .</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all relates to Windows 10 which has gone very slow since upgrading to it last November.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading other posts I feel something serious is wrong with the programme.</p>

</p><p>In the meantime you may like to know I spent 3 hrs with a Microsoft support engineer that started removing programmes off my machine by remote control. Even telling me C cleaner and MalWare Bytes were not necessary then went on to install a cleaner of their
 &nbsp;choice called WLC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did various virtual memory adjustments and I finished up with an even slower browsers across Edge/IE11/Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last damming comment was both our computers were not powerful enough for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funnily they were both accepted to update in November 2015 and for a period of 4 weeks seemed &nbsp;to be ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However after the so called automatic removal of previously installed Windows 7 by Microsoft things have gone downhill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if other users are experiencing the same problems as I feel suspicious happenings are being made by Microsoft and they need to be brought to task</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for coming back to us with the information.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since the issue is with Microsoft Edge, let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if that helps. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to delete browsing history, cookies and cached and check.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open Microsoft edge and click on (<strong>…</strong>) button.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Go to settings and click on <strong>Choose what to clear
</strong>tab under <strong>clear browsing data</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And clear browsing history, cached and cookies.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, try the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to reset Microsoft edge and check if this helps. Follow the below steps.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Navigate to the location:<span>&nbsp;</span><span> <br />
</span><strong><span>C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe</span></strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Delete everything in this folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type Windows Powershell in search box.&nbsp; </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on Windows Powershell and select Run as administrator.&nbsp;
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Copy and paste the following command.&nbsp; <span><br />
</span><strong><span>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" –Verbose}</span></strong><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><br />
</span><span><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> The Reset Edge Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Edge Settings feature might also reset parental control
 settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Edge Settings feature. Resetting Edge isn't reversible, and all previous settings are deleted.</span></span></span><span><br />

<p>Much improved thank you Billion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However IE 11 is still slow.&nbsp; Any ideas how to correct.&nbsp; Have done a reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also reinstalled Chrome which improved the time to open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that if you start importing favorites to the Edge toolbar it can get confused if you have two inputs from IE &amp; Chrome at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also still get the toolbar in Edge jumping as though not settled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I did manage to do a system restore by using Safe Mode so all my happenings with the 3 hr Microsoft agent playing with computer have hopefully been retrieved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further advice would be appreciated</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, try the below method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to uninstall/reinstall the network adapter driver and check. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>Device manager</strong>.</p>

Right click on the <strong>device </strong>and click on <strong>uninstall</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Once you are done uninstalling the driver, restart the computer. It will automatically install the generic network adapter driver.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If this doesn’t help to fix the issue. I suggest you to update the network driver. Skip step3 from the above steps and right click on the device and click on update.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above method did not help to fix the issue, I would suggest you to<strong>
</strong>go to the computer manufacturer website and download the latest updated network driver. If the network driver is not available for Windows 10, try installing the available driver in compatibility mode and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why your external monitor is changing the resolution. These may include a connection issue or an incompatible driver which results to the problem. Answering the following questions may help us in uncovering the underlying cause
 of the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Were there any changes made on your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Which Windows version are you running on your computer?</li><li>Have you recently installed an update on your computer?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If there was an update specifically for <strong>display</strong> <strong>drivers</strong>, we recommend rolling back your driver to its 2015 version as an initial troubleshooting. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Device </strong><strong>Manager </strong>and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Expand the <strong>Display adapters' </strong><strong>arrow </strong>to view your display drivers.</li><li>Right-click your <strong>display </strong><strong>driver </strong>and select <strong>
Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Driver </strong>tab.</li><li>Select <strong>Roll </strong><strong>Back </strong><strong>Driver</strong> and roll back to its
<strong>2015 </strong><strong>version</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After doing so, we suggest following the instructions provided in this <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-window?utm_source=twitter%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to temporarily prevent a
 driver update from reinstalling in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have clarifications.</p>

    <title>Why does Kinect have no good games&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dpm95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Kinect have no good games&#63;</h2>
                    It has maybe 2 good games that I bought, Kinect Sports, and joyride. I only play one when family comes over. But where are the good hardcore games? Anything that looks like a hardcore game (rise of nightmares) sucks! Why arent they able to make a fun hardcore
 game for Kinect!? They can make a good dancing game but nothing for the regular gamer?? It's BS. Kinect sucks, if you are a regular gamer, on the fence about buying it, don't buy it. Biggest waste I made in a while. No good games for the regular gamer.

<p>The sales numbers show that its more than a gimmick, but its hard to say how long it will keep people interested.&nbsp; It seems like you can exhaust your options with what it can do.&nbsp; I do like some of the enhancements you can use with Kinect.&nbsp; Like ME3 for
 example. &nbsp;</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Still I just don't see Kinect having major staying power.</p>

<p>Sales numbers don't provide legitimacy to gimmicks- they merely prove they are a popular fad.<br />
<br />
Kinect is a rough one in that the technology is interesting, but its practical use as a gaming device has proven extremely limited (waggle mini games etc).<br />
<br />
These Kinect "enhancements" are a good indicator of its poor use as a gaming device. Shouting voice commands in ME3? Couldn't/shouldn't that have been implemented with a normal mic? As is, it screams "gimmicky Kinect nonsense" to me...</p>

<p>Than&nbsp;you for you answer and courtesies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The portable device manager was set to manual so I changed to automatic and worked for a couple of times,
</p>
<p>Then changed &nbsp;it back to manual and worked one of two times.&nbsp; The computer shuts down with out a problem when the portable device enumerator is disable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what are the problems if I let the portable device enumerator disable all the time?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>n.b. the computer does not give me any error massage the only think that says is shutting down but of course keeps doing that all the time without shouting down. this happened since I upgraded from window 7 x86 to window 8.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 GPU Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> omniiro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 GPU Issue</h2>
                    <p>Greetings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently running Windows 10 on a MacBook Pro (15-inch, mid 2010).&nbsp;I'm facing a very severe issue in Windows, and I'm just done. I can't do it. I need help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try to do something even remotely heavy in Windows 10, my display turns black and returns, only for me to see that the application that caused the crash has stopped working. I am familiar with this issue, as this also happened in Windows 7 when
 I installed it last week. "Nvidia Windows Kernel Mode Driver XXX.XX has stopped responding and successfully recovered". The message doesn't come up in Windows 10, but I know that the issue is the same. Another thing to note is that it also happens randomly
 on web browsers like Chrome (and also randomly when scrolling). Note that everything is I've spent TOO much time trying to solve this issue. This issue is NOT present on the macOS side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the uncountable solutions I've tried include: reinstalling graphics drivers, installing old drivers, reinstalling Windows 7, installing Windows 10, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I want to utilize this MacBook for specific work, but macOS doesn't meet my requirements. So, I installed Windows. But this problem has been nagging me for weeks. I'm losing my mental stability, losing sleep, having trouble in my personal life- overall it's
 a very messy situation. I finally thought I should take this to a forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry that anyone had to read this whole thing, but I really need help, so I tried to list the details. This is very important to me. Any help would be highly appreciated, trust me.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            Your MacBook Pro is not listed as supporting Windows 10 and that is likely why:
<br />
<br />Mac computers that support Windows 10
<br />
<br />The following Mac models support 64-bit versions of Windows 10 when installed using Boot Camp. Use About This Mac to see which Mac you have, then check this list to see if it supports Windows 10:
<br />
<br />    MacBook Pro (2012 and later)
<br />    MacBook Air (2012 and later)
<br />    MacBook (2015 and later)
<br />    iMac Pro (2017)
<br />    iMac (2012 and later)
<br />    Mac mini (2012 and later)
<br />    Mac mini Server (Late 2012)
<br />    Mac Pro (Late 2013)

<br />Your best option is to reinstall Windows 7 or consider installing Windows 10 in a virtual machine.

<p>Hi, Andre. </p>
<p>I'm well aware of Apple's statement that Windows 10 is unsupported on my MacBook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, that's simply false (or poorly worded). They do not provide "direct" support. I've seen reports of other people who also run Windows 10 flawlessly on their "unsupported" MacBook. A bit of trickery is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for clarification, I had installed Windows 7 the first time I used Boot Camp, instead of 10. And when 7 showed issues, I reinstalled it, but still got the same damn problems. So, I switched to 10.&nbsp;</p>

            You are attempting to run Windows on probably what would be one of the most Anti-Windows brands there is. Apple is not concerned with optimizing their software for Windows, its actually of no benefit to them to do so.
<br />
<br />They are very guarded with human resources and prefer allocating it to projects within the company that are mutually beneficial: macOS, iPad, iPhone, Apple TV.
<br />
<br />So, yes, it might work to some degree on your configuration, which Apple themselves deem as vintage, but its just not officially supported.
<br />
<br />Also, one of the important clauses in Windows 10's support agreement, Windows 10 is considered supported on your configuration only when the manufacturer supports it. 
<br />
<br />What I would do, is try using an older version of Windows 10, such as version 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<br />
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>I see. I'll give it a go and inform you of my results. Thanks for trying to help, really appreciate it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One unrelated question though. What's the difference between Windows "Final" and "Insider"? Is "Insider" like a preview build or something?</p>

<p>Okay, I am extremely dumb. Excuse me for my stupidity. I can't believe I left one of the most important details out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thing is, my display crashes ONLY when I am using my graphics card. As in, the display will crash and recover only when the graphics driver is installed or active. However, if I boot up in Safe Mode or if I simply use Microsoft's built in VGA Adapter (enabled
 by uninstalling my driver), the crashes don't occur and everything works fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, this doesn't cut it. The application I am trying to run requires DirectX and a compatible graphics card. It notices that my driver is not installed and advises me to update, before shutting down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, TERRIBLY sorry for not mentioning this. Hope this helps somewhat.</p>

            Insider refer to preview versions of Windows still in development. 
<br />
<br />Final, refers to the current commercial release (Windows 10 1803 or an earlier version).
<br />
<br />Once again, I suspect we are seeing signs of compatibility issues relating to your configuration and Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Could you try collecting the hardware ID for your graphics adapter then post in a reply here?

<p>So I should give this driver a go? I'm currently using 342.01, and I've noticed that an older driver (2xx.xx, not sure the exact one I used) are more stable. However, when that driver crashed, I ALWAYS had to do a hard reboot. It wouldn't recover. Again,
 same case on both Windows 7 AND 10. I'll let you know what happens after I install this one. Thanks a lot!</p>

            <p>1&nbsp; I suggest that you add the name of your WiFi card to your question title.&nbsp; This will encourage those with experience of that type of card to respond to your question.</p>
<p>1.1&nbsp; Get the name:- Right-click on the <em>Start</em> button, select <em>Device manager</em>, click on the
<em>Network adapters</em> group to expand it, note the name of your WiFi card.</p>
<p>1.2&nbsp; Look back on this webpage, underneath your question you will see <em>Edit</em> [in blue], click on it, change the title then click on
<em>Submit</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; From your description, I suspect that your WiFi card driver has been updated &amp; it is the new driver that has the problem [this situation is not unknown for Dell WiFi drivers - many
<em>Dell Wireless 1397 WLAN Mini-Card</em> users have had this problem].&nbsp; Go back into
<em>Device manager</em> [1.1 above], select your WiFi card, right-click &amp; select <em>
Properties </em>then the <em>Driver</em> tab.&nbsp; If the driver has been updated then the
<em>Roll back driver</em> button will be active so try that.&nbsp; If there has not been an update then the&nbsp;<em>Roll back driver</em> button will be greyed out &amp; inactive in which case my suspicion was incorrect.</p>

                    Hi there,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have read through the other threads with the same problem of my windows running on a loop at the "<b>configuring updates: stage 3 of 3 a 0% complete</b>" and so far I have had no luck with the suggestions.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So far I have tried:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Do nothing - same screen but continuous looping of the screen</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>F11 goes into the stage 3 of 3 screen</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>F8:</div>
<div>Safe mode - lists of loaded things/ numbers then a please wait, then same screen</div>
<div>Safe mode with networking -&nbsp;<span>lists of numbers then a please wait, then same screen</span></div>
<div>Safe mode with command prompt -&nbsp;<span>lists of numbers then a please wait, then same screen</span></div>
<div>Last known good configuration (advanced) - same screen</div>
<div>Directory services restore mode - lists of loaded things/numbers, then turns laptop up, upon switching on again choice of start windows in repair (doesn't let me do that) or normally - back to same screen again</div>
<div>Debugging mode - same screen</div>
<div>Disable automatic restart on system failure - same screen</div>
<div>Disable driver signature enforcement - same screen</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Start windows normally - same screen</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<div><br />
</div>

Hi Maurice,
<div><br />
<div>I have tried the "disable automatic restart on system failure" allowing it to restart itself and then I have tried both &nbsp;"safe mode with networking" and "safe mode" and have waited. The computer loads exactly the same "configuring updates: stage 3 of 3
 - 0% complete" each time. It loops and keeps loading this screen too, so it doesn't halt on the screen but restarts itself to this screen.</div>

<p>Give a summary, and mention that you are unable to boot into Windows Vista.<br />
</p>
<p>The forum is a better avenue for conveying graphical help, plus the help is one-to-one.<br />
You need to see if a startup in some kind of recovery tool is possible.</p>
<p>With that said, IF you have a previous Offline system-image-backup of your system {from before this "disaster"} then do speak up.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This troubleshooter works for both Vista and Windows 7 however you should not mix the<br />
OS's. So if you have Vista you only use&nbsp;Vista disks and methods.&nbsp;Same for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>These can't be done in part or just tried - start at the top&nbsp;- follow every step until
<br />
the issue has been resolved.</strong><br />
<br />
You can use the solutions&nbsp;in this KB&nbsp;- 4 methods and I listed a little help for them below<br />
<br />
The update is not installed successfully, you receive a message, and the computer restarts<br />
when you try to install an update in Windows Vista and Windows 7<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: Start Windows Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;with the Windows installation media, and then<br />
use the Repair feature <br />

You can also do a Startup Repair from Safe Mode accessing the Recovery Options if you<br />
have them available or use the DVD as above.<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong>: Start the system in safe mode, and then use the System Restore feature<br />

<br />
<br />
You can also do a System Restore by booting up with a Vista or Windows 7&nbsp;disk.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3</strong>: Use the Downloads at the end of this article - note versions for Vista/Windows 7<br />
x86 32 bit and Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;x64 64 bit.<br />
<br />
The update is not installed successfully, you receive a message, and the computer restarts<br />
when you try to install an update in Windows Vista and Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358</font></span></a><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 4</strong>:<br />
<br />
At the Command Prompt or Recovery Options or a Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;disk boot<br />
<br />
Type or copy and paste these in one at a time (not the press ENTER)<br />
<br />
c:windows\winsxs\ in the commandprompt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
press ENTER<br />
<br />
DIR pending.*<br />
press ENTER&nbsp; and you should see the pending.xml<br />
<br />
ren pending.xml pending.old<br />
press ENTER.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is the older complete Method 4<br />
<br />
Use the System Recovery options or Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;Boot Disk to rename the Pending.xml<br />
file and edit the registry:<br />
<br />
On the System Recovery Options page, click Command Prompt. <br />
<br />
Type cd C:\windows\winsxs, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
Type ren pending.xml pending.old, and then press ENTER. <br />
<br />
Type regedit, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
Select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
<p><br />
On the File menu, click Load Hive.</p>
<p><br />
Locate the following folder:<br />
<br />
C:\windows\system32\config\components</p>
<p><br />
When you are prompted for a name, type Offline_Components.</p>
<p>In Registry Editor, locate and then delete the following registry<br />
subkey:<br />
<br />
HLKM\Offline Components\AdvancedInstallersNeedResolving </p>
<p><br />
HKLM\Offline Components\PendingXmlIdentifier</p>
<p><br />
Exit Registry Editor: <br />
<br />
At the command prompt, type exit to exit Registry Editor.<br />
<br />
Press ENTER. <br />
<br />
Restart System<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Once you are in Windows again I would run the Reset here as a precaution.<br />
<br />

If you can't get into Windows you need a Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;disk - if you do not have one<br />
you can borrow a friends as the are not copy protected and the system maker will usually<br />
sell you the physical disk cheap (you are only paying for the DVD as you already own<br />
Vista/Windows 7). Or you can make a Repair Disk.<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Update causes security problems with Public Profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bearbryant55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update causes security problems with Public Profile</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I'm seeing quite a few Windows 10 computers that have received the latest update and suddenly have no permissions to the Public folder, and perhaps some other folders as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing noticed is that the icons will not work correctly on the desktop if they are in the Public Profile. Also, the start menu Tiles area to the right does not show up. The ability to Lock-Sign out-Switch account, is still there on the left of
 the start menu, but the image of the man's profile is not there, it's just black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this issue, maybe set all security in Windows 10 back to defaults through a powershell script? I have this issue on quite a few computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>well in Norway we start to learn english in 1st grade as our first foreign language. only child movies are dubbed to norwegian and there are hardly any norwegian movies so we passively learn english all the time. There is only a few people in Norway who
 doesn't understand english.</p>
<p>Many of the imigrants that move to Norway does not know norwegian when they move here so thay have to communicate through &nbsp;english. if they were to buy an xbox and chose their location as "Norway" it is impossible (according to xbox.com) to change it and
 it is kind of annoying to be forced to make a new account.</p>
<p>The translations also looks stupid too.</p>
<p>Luckily it is only the TEXT that is translated to norwegian. If the dialog were to be traslated too... oh god it would be horrifying.</p>

forums.xbox.com/.../default.aspx</a> and that's where topics like this really belong. I do agree we should be able to choose English regardless of where we live but yeah... By the way! You can fix Halo 4 by changing your locale to UK in the console settings.
 That's what I did when I got fed up with the Finnish translation of that game :P</p>

                    <p>My top of the line Surface book i7 with 16GB RAM and Performance Base has stopped responding to touch and pen activity after the 1709 update. &nbsp; Windows updates would also fail until SoftwareDistribuiton and Catroot2 were wiped (REN to .bak). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then WinUpdates installed a cumulative and 9 drivers but still no touch and again the error for updates has returned. Thoughts?</p>
<p>Considering temporality removing the PC from AD so that GP &amp; WSUS restrictions are removed.&nbsp; No drivers are supplied from WSUS in our environment.&nbsp; (Which is a big issue with our 1200 clients on campus)</p>

<p>Hi Kris, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you're receiving such error when downloading Windows Update, here are a few things you could follow to get your issue resolved:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: You may reboot your PC and use a different Internet connection. If you're using a regular cabled Internet connection, you may use WiFi connection instead. Windows 10 will start to download the updates. If not, you may proceed to
 try the next method. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Download and run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Troubleshooter</a></strong> for your version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Please see <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix Windows Update issues</a></strong>.

<p>Updates are now working but only when connected by VPN to our campus network.&nbsp; &nbsp;Updates did not resolve the issue with the touch screen.&nbsp; More research lead me to try the following:</p>
<p>Two-button shutdown</p>
<p>uninstall and reinstall of the HID Touch driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no touch on 1709</p>

<p>Since the issue still the same after trying some of the fixes, we suggest you to reset touchscreen calibration. Here's how:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the Windows logo key. (If you're using a mouse, select Start.)</li><li>Enter <strong>calibrate</strong>, use the arrow keys to highlight <strong>Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input</strong>, and then press Enter.<br />
(With a mouse, select <strong>Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input</strong>.)</li><li>Press the Tab key until the <strong>Reset</strong> button is selected, and then press Enter.<br />
(With a mouse, select <strong>Reset</strong>.)</li><li>Press the Tab key until the <strong>Yes</strong> button is selected, press Enter, and then follow the on-screen instructions.<br />
(With a mouse, select <strong>Yes</strong>, and then follow the on-screen instructions.)</li><li>After your Surface removes the recalibration data, test the touchscreen to see if it responds appropriately.</li></ol>

<p>I've had problems with my pen since 1709 too. (New battery, so that's not the issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cap click, double click and hold all work properly. It's just the touch that doesn't.</p>

<br />
<br />Windows 10 which includes DirectX 12 includes the necessary run times for older versions of DirectX. So, you should be able to install older games using compatibility mode.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running in compatibility mode doesn't seem to work and I have tried editing the registries but it has had no effect, it keeps asking for DirectX 9 dlls which I don't have on my machine (more specifically d3dx9_43.dll is the common one to appear in errors)
 and the games I'm having issues with are mostly only 2-3 years old and I have got them working on another windows 10 machine before with no issues. Might there be an issue with DirectX 12 on my machine where it doesn't like running DirectX 9 compatibility?<br />
</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>

            This seems to be a compatibility issue with the game and Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Under such circumstance, your best option is to probably setup a dual boot configuration with a supported operating system and run the game there. 
<br />
<br />This is if your hardware can still run Windows 7. Most modern computers especially those with Skylake and Kabylake processors or AMD Ryzen don't support Windows 7. 
<br />
<br />If yours does, then here is how you do it:

<p>- Posting the name of the game, and if it is on disc or a download from Steam or another on line retailer can be helpful,</p>
<p>and the vast majority of games released from 2002 onward are compatible with Win10, but....</p>
<p>- There has been a lot of trouble with Win10 and DX errors being generated when trying to launch a new game, or when trying</p>
<p>to reinstall DirectX because of that error.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The real issue is commonly a corrupted .NET.</span>&nbsp; Win10 just doesn't seem to have a appropriate error message, so it pops out a DX error<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>- Failing that, try updating your Windows. This has helped another person with the same issue, but he didn't say if the update</p>
<p>was a cumulative/security update, or if he did a version update to v1809.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- If neither of the above helps, you may have to try using the DX Registry key fix (Option #6)&nbsp; in the article below...</p>

<p>
</p><p>- Another person who posted here a while back deleted the whole DX Registry folder. A radical fix, but it worked for him.</p>
<p>Do be sure to make a backup of the DX registry folder before deleting it.</p>
<p>Reboot after deleting the folder, and Windows will apparently rebuild the DX Registry folder during the reboot.</p>

</p><p><em>"Might there be an issue with DirectX 12 on my machine where it doesn't like running DirectX 9 compatibility?"</em></p>
<p>- I doesn't work like that. DX12 is just the newest version of DirextX, and Win10 is the only Windows version that can use DX12.</p>
<p>There are only a few DX12 files, but Win10 has all the old DX9,10 &amp; 11 that are required by games.</p>
<p>Very few games actually benefit from using Compatibility with an older OS, and most of them are the disc based version.
</p>
<p>Download versions that may otherwise have a problem are almost all fixed to run on Win10 buy Steam or other retailer.</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main game I'm having issues with came out about a year after windows 10 in mid 2016 and I have run it on a windows 10 machine before with no issues, so I don't think it is a compatibility issue. Unfortunately, my hardware is not compatible with windows
 7 as I am using a Ryzen 5 so I don't think that will work for me unfortunatly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<div>Hi BossDweeb,</div>
<div><br />
<div>The main game I am having issues with is Stellaris (https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/) released in mid 2016 so I don't think its a game age issue. I repaired .NET but it didn't seem to have any effect, I am up to date with Windows, the
 registry key fix didn't seem to have any effect either and when I deleted the registry, it wasn't recreated when I started my PC.</div>
<p>
</p><p>Also I can't find any d3dx9_XX.dll above 30 in either directory.</p>
        </p>

<p>Ah well !&nbsp; For a while I had been hoping the .NET repair was going to be the go to solution for this mysterious inability to</p>
<p>reinstall DX with either the <em>DX Web Installer</em> or <em>DX Redist (June 2010)</em> installer package, but it's only looking good about half the time.</p>
<p>A lot of people with this problem have just installed a game from Steam, so it looks like the games doing a auto reinstall of DX is
</p>
<p>somehow stuffing things up (games used to ask before reinstalling and potentially corrupting DX files in the process).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I assume you have merged the deleted Registry key back into Registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I can't find any d3dx9_XX.dll above 30 in either directory."</em></p>
<p>- Hmm, highly irregular, and mysterious.&nbsp; _30 goes back to 2006. Are all DX10 ( _33 &gt; _43) and DX11 (_42 &amp; +43)&nbsp; there ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah! I almost missed your edit in your OP. Have you copied over all missing d3d&nbsp; files, including XInput, XAudio and</p>
<p>XACT (also audio related) files ? Doing so could avoid a similar issue in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- By way of determining if the problem is actually fixed, once all DX files have been copied over are you still unable to reinstall DX using the</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
- DirectX Redist (June 2010)&nbsp; -</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; installer package ?</p>
<p>(A two step procedure. First unpack the contents of the installer to a new folder. Then run the
<em>DXSetup.exe</em> from within that folder.</p>
<p>This folder can be deleted after the re-install of DX is completed).</p>
<p>- Note that the Web Installer should have installed any missing files, but for repairs the Redist is required, as it overwrites all DX files.</p>
<p>.</p>
