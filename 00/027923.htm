<h2>            Office Reminders very slow</h2>
                    Does anyone know why it takes more than half a minute when I click on a Task Reminder in the Office Reminders window for a window with details of that task to open?&nbsp; Why so excruciatingly slow?<br />

<p>I had the same issue (error number), but after rebooting it allowed me to install the new build. However, my machine is now bricked! The download &amp; install went fine. At the end when it reboots to apply the new install everything went south. The hard drive
 shows as a 12 bit DOS partition, is not bootable, I cannot FDisk it, and utilities such as "Spinrite" cannot access the drive. Oh well, I guess that's what this testing is for. So, proceed with caution.<br />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Online App Workflow 2013 stuck in Not Started and Existing Workflow stopped working since few days ago</h2>
                    <p>Hi, we are running E3 Office 365 SharePoint, and we have a custom built SharePoint App on it, it's using Workflow 2013 for approval process, it has been in use for few months, and since 3-5 days ago, the workflow stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Internal Status of new workflow is stuck in Not Started, not history log or anything. And the initiator is remain as Anonymous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Existing running workflow doesn't move to the next step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. We tried manually starting the workflow, the same thing happens, it stuck in not started status.</p>
<p>4. This only happens for Workflow 2013's workflow. Workflow 2010 is working.</p>
<p>5. We redeploy a same SP App into new site collection, it's working as intended, but the existing live/production one are still not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Redeploy the app is not possible because we have a lot of information and audit trail reside in the app already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The conclusion that we made is that it's some issue with the back-end, and we really need to get people to look into this as soon as possible, as it's a live system that whole company are using. The support that we got from using Admin Center is not helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the site collection in case it helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://*******.sharepoint.com/************/</p>
<p>
</p><p>(<em>Private information removed by forum moderator</em>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance if anyone can look into this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know what's the different between this case vs the case as follow:</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_sharepoint/sharepoint-online-workflows-stuck-at-not-started/1a045f6e-d831-4794-a8d7-a0fb55343cd5&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are tons of threads leading to "Back end issue", we're facing this huge issue on business critical system and currently there MS support ticket are not helping at all, they just keep dragging the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know is there any way that I can get faster support on the issue? Or anyplace I can make complain? This is totally unacceptable for corporate level of support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Crayon Vendor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it the exact same behavior as last time, as mentioned in your first post?</p>
<p>
</p><p>===============</p>
<p>1. Internal Status of new workflow is stuck in Not Started, not history log or anything. And the initiator is remain as Anonymous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Existing running workflow doesn't move to the next step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. We tried manually starting the workflow, the same thing happens, it stuck in not started status.</p>
<p>4. This only happens for Workflow 2013's workflow. Workflow 2010 is working.</p>
<p>5. We redeploy a same SP App into new site collection, it's working as intended, but the existing live/production one are still not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Redeploy the app is not possible because we have a lot of information and audit trail reside in the app already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>===============<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, I'd like to get the ticket number for the last time the technical team helped you out so that we can check from the backend. You can access &nbsp;your private message

            Yeah, but like I said, before I upgraded my sim card to the this new LTE supported kind I still had the 4g icon. I thought that after upgrading to the LTE sim card I would get the LTE icon ans speeds but I still only see the 4g logo and the speed is the
 same as with my old sim card, nothing changed for me.

            Could have been you finally recieved a strong enough signal to connect LTE. Your phone will fallback from 4G LTE to 4G then 3G.

<p>Hi ASHRAFP. T,</p>
<p>To check the issue, I would like to confirm the following things:<br />
1. &nbsp;Whatâ€™s the version of hybrid server?<br />
2. &nbsp;Have you made some changes on hybrid server recently?</p>
<p>In order to determine the current status of the move requests, please perform the following steps:<br />
1. &nbsp;Connect to Exchange Online through PowerShell (Not via the Exchange Management Shell (EMS))&nbsp;<br />
2. &nbsp;Run the following to check the status of any moves.<br />
Get-MigrationBatch |fl *status*,Identity&nbsp;<br />
Get-MoveRequest |fl *status*,Identity</p>
<p>Please provide the outputs here for checking.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>Thank you so much for your reply. I heard that windows 365 has the grayscale view. I'm thinking of installing windows on my Mac. Your thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, &nbsp;I give you props for coming up with an add on but as you stated it doesn't work in 365 mac. It does sort of ha ha. &nbsp;I installed it &nbsp;It doesn't give you options and it's hard to get back to the color look but at least you can see what it looks
 like on the screen. &nbsp;I think you so much! Julie</p>

    <title>Need to restrict the characters length of the document name field - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> falguni vaishnav  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to restrict the characters length of the document name field while uploading in the document library&#40;SharePoint&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>i have created a document library which have nintex workflow running on it for sending the document uploaded using docusign to different users.</p>
<p>recently i faced the issue as: my workflow was suspened n it didnt sent the document to the intended user for signing via docusign, as the subject field in the docusign email does not accept more than 100 characters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>N the workflow sends the combination of the document id and name, in which the name of the document which was uploaded was too big to fit in the subject line of the docusign.</p>
<p>Now i have tried to search for the setting through which i could put a restriction(validation of length) on the characters of the document name while uploading the document in the library. but i was not able to find any such out of box setting through which
 i could edit the properties of the upload browser window nor i was able to find the "name"(which i guess is sharepoint's per-defined column) column in the library settings.</p>
<p>i search the library settings even the site settings but could not found any solution.</p>
<p>If anyone can suggest me what out of box way i can use to solve the above issue.. that would be of great help...</p>

<p><span>There is no out of box solutions to restrict the character number of the default Name column in SharePoint Online. I suggest you post a new thread in our

<h3> tedsinclair  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t open Word docs in Publisher 2013</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We're trying to open Word documents in Publisher 2013 (on a Windows 7 PC), but when the document starts to open and convert the file we get this error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>There is not enough memory to convert the text formatting.</i></div>
<div><i>Windows is low on memory. Save your work and close other programs to free up memory, and then try again.</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Other notes:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>* Windows is not really low on RAM. There is over 2GB unused when this occurs.</div>
<div>* This issue occurs on even the simplest Word docs, such as a doc with only the word "Test" in it.</div>
<div>* Word 2010 and Publisher 2013 are installed.</div>
<div>* The same issue occurs with both Word 2010 and Word 2013 documents.</div>
<div>* The issue occurs on multiple PCs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            To answer questions from both responses:
<div><br />
<div>1. To open the Word documents, we are launching Publisher, going to Open &gt; Computer and navigating to the file, and clicking Open in the file open dialog.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Word file extension is .docx.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. We have tried pasting into a blank Publisher document. paste works, but the formatting does not come though very well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. The issue is the same with all Word documents we've tried, which is a lot.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. Publisher files open without any problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, I have tested opening some of the same Word files in Publisher 2013 on my personal system at home, and they open fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>

<h2>            Adobe XD on RS5</h2>
                    <span>The first Redstone 5 update broke Adobe XD CC (probably a problem with sets as XD is a UWP app). The app would open on a white screen, hang for a few seconds, and crash. I had to take my laptop off of the skip ahead ring due to this issue.

 Does anyone know if this has been fixed in more recent updates?? I've seen nothing about it in changelogs.</span>

            Have you checked with Adobe as you are using a beta build which hasn't been released to any 3rd party developers for code check.&nbsp;

<p>I submitted the problem on the Feedback hub and it said it shared the information with Adobe. I didn't think to ask their support or anything, so I'll look into that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Update: I checked on their forums and they said they don't focus on bug fixes for beta builds of OSes</p>

            Update: As of build 17666, XD is still not working. Does the same exact thing as before, but I will say it hangs for a second longer before crashing.

<p>Thank you for you assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Why?&nbsp;</em><em>That is an unusually complete troubleshooter.&nbsp; What all did you try to do with it?</em></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I didn't (and still don't) believe it is the correct diagnosis in this case mostly through process of elimination:</p>
</p><ol>
<li>I haven't changed file system permissions and registry permissions. Nor is group policy being used to manage permissions on my PC.</li><li>I can find no reports of anyone with Redstone 5 being able to successfully run XD. If the cause was that "<em>Registry and or file system permissions may have been changed from their defaults</em>" I would't expect it to affect every machine (as some would
 presumably still be using these defaults).</li><li>Adobe XD runs on stable versions of Windows 10.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid I am not a Windows native so the the Process Monitor diagnostics has been hard going.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I captured filtering to events form the&nbsp;process to "<strong>XD CC.exe</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Filtering by&nbsp;<span><strong>WriteFile</strong>&nbsp;operations there is only one event and the result is
<strong>SUCCESS</strong>. It is for this file:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Adobe.CC.XD_adky2gkssdxte\TempState\logLevel.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>Filtering the result to anything other than <strong>SUCCESS</strong> returned more results, but that still left a few events and possibilities.&nbsp;<span>There are many unsuccessful results including
</span><strong>BUFFER_OVERFLOW</strong><span> on a
</span><strong>QuerySecurityFile</strong><span> operation and
</span><strong>SHARING_VIOLATION</strong><span> on a
</span><strong>CreateFile</strong><span> operation. Both for the same file:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px"><span>%LOCALAPPDATA%</span>\Packages\Adobe.CC.XD_adky2gkssdxte\AC\GEH\POF.dat</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Interestingly just before the&nbsp;<strong>SHARING_VIOLATION</strong>&nbsp;<strong>CreateFile
</strong>operation there is another <strong>CreateFile</strong> operation on the same file which results in a&nbsp;<strong>SUCCESS</strong>&nbsp;(these occur within three ten-thousandths of a second (0.0003) of each other).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speculation now but to me this suggests some kind of race condition. A quick glance at the Google results for "createfile sharing violation" indicates it is a problem others have grappled with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I am going to put my feet up now and leave this to Adobe.</p>

<p>Exactly. </p>
<p>
Adobe XD is working fine on 1803 and I think MS is playing a bit too much with the UI shell that they are unintentionally breaking other things. BTW they fixed the issue related to the XAMLUI.dll in 17677.&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>They have been playing around quite a bit with the reveal effect and UI in general.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started a similar thread on XD forums and just finished a call with their support executive. We all are having issues with RS5 builds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope MS fixes it with the next build.&nbsp;</p>

            It doesn't close.&nbsp; You have set the option to hide the Taskbar handle when you minimize it.&nbsp; Right-click the Outlook icon in the Notification Area of the Taskbar (near the clock) and uncheck "Hide When Minimized".

    <title>Office 2016 Error Notification - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ang77kv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 Error Notification</h2>
                    So I just installed Office 2016 on my new laptop, but whenever I open Word, Powerpoint, or Excel I always get a notification box that reads "We're sorry, but Word/Powerpoint/Excel has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly, and
 will need to be closed as a result. Would you like us to repair now?" I clicked "Repair Now" but it only closed the document I was working on. This notification continues to pop up whenever I open any of these applications. Is there a way to fix this?

<h3> lucho1970  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synchronizing outlook contracts on my Android</h2>
                    <p>I recently reset my Android phone, Galaxy Note4. My emails, contacts and calendars were working fine before the reset.</p>
<p>Now, no matter what settings i look at our where i set up my accounts, i cannot get sync working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Google calendar is always empty, it used to show me my appointments from the outlook app. When i try to edit a contract, that is maintained in my outlook.com account, it appears to edit, but always goes back to what it was. Meaning that i have lost some
 contacts that i thought i added!</p>
<p>I am using the outlook app to manage my outlook (hotmail.com) accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried previously to add those accounts to Android directly with no success.</p>
<p>I really just want to get rid of Android and go back to Windows phone, but it's what I'm stuck with now and i need it working!</p>

    <title>How can one get Outlook to reflect multiple mobile phone entries per - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> delboy42  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can one get Outlook to reflect multiple mobile phone entries per contact</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I am migrating from Nokia to HTC tytn, the latter as you all know runs on Win mobile 6. Nokia permits you to store multiple mobile numbers per contact and it, but&nbsp;when you do a sync with outlook only one mobile number entry is shown, the others are lost. Is
 there are way of resolving this issue? Perhaps either through tweaking with outlook or a third party software to bridge the gap?

<p>Rather than initiate text messages by opening up the text messaging application and then selecting Menu &gt; New &gt; and letting the text messaging application select a mobile number for you, try initiating new text messages from the Contacts application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open up the contact you want to send the text message to, move down to the phone number that you want to send the text message to and select Menu &gt; Send Text Message.&nbsp;</li><li>Then the text messaging application will open up, create a new text message and insert the number you selected in the TO field.</li></ul>
<p>Creating text messages in this fashion allows you to send a text message to any phone number you've got for a contact.&nbsp; You won't be able to change the label on the phone number fields, but you won't be limited to only sending text messages to one phone
 number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, you might accidentally send a text message to a landline, in which case, you'd probably get some kind of "failure to send" message.</p>

<h2>            Pivot tables compatibility between Excel 2013 &#40;Windows&#41; and Excel 2016 &#40;Mac OS X&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I also noticed the problem with Excel 2013 and Excel 2011 (Mac).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spreadsheet that contains a pivot table that was created on Excel 2013 and has worked well on windows. When I open the same file on Excel for the Mac, all data is displayed correctly. &nbsp;Upon refresh, the pivot table is blanked out (loses all field
 information). If I recreate the pivot table, then open the file back on a windows machine, the pivot table appears blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that Pivot tables are not cross compatible between the two different operating systems. Has anyone else noticed this? If so how did you work around it?&nbsp;</p>

            Here is my workaround with dealing with the incompatibility of pivot tables between Excel 2016 (Win) and Excel 2016 (Mac). &nbsp;If the pivot table is created in Win, then opened in Excel 2016 Mac; the pivot tables will not work. &nbsp;You get that silly "Alert"
 message in Mac Excel 2016. &nbsp;So I acquired the ODBC driver from Actual Technologies (very helpful folks) and pulled the data from MS Access into Mac Excel 2016 to create my reports first in Mac Excel 2016, which includes slicers and "getpivot" formulas. &nbsp;Then
 I opened the file in Win Excel 2016. &nbsp;Win Excel 2016 is able to work with the file and doesn't suffer from the compatibility issues going in the other direction. &nbsp;So, the moral of the story is - create your pivot report in Mac Excel 2016 first, then port it
 to Win Excel 2016. &nbsp;It's working for me fine for now, although data updates now originate on the Mac and not on the Windows machine.

<h2>            Outlook IMAP not communicating properly</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook 16 on two machines and email on my phone, all via IMAP.</p>
<p>The problem I'm having is the same on both PC running outlook.</p>
<p>Mail messages appear in outlook properly, when a message is marked as read it will reflect the read status across all machines, and again if you mark a message as new it will reflect across all machines...this is where the problem starts.</p>
<p>No matter what you do with that message after changing it's status twice the status will not change on either machine with outlook but will on phone and in thunderbird downloaded as a test.</p>
<p>Example: New message comes in, I reply, I mark it as unread all from my phone.</p>
<p>On both PC outlook will show that message as replied to and new</p>
<p>I later mark that message as read on any machine and in outlook that message will remain new until I mark it read on each machine individually.</p>
<p>The send receive status bar at the bottom of outlook will pop up as if the program is working every time I change the status of an email on my phone but the message will not change.</p>
<p>Outlook is definitely communicating with my server but the message status inside outlook is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have verified server settings with my host and use the same settings in thunderbird for a test and that client works perfectly.</p>

<p>I installed updated (even though it's supposed to be automatic, but there were updates)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run the offx tool with 2 results:</p>
<p>"OutlookKLAsAddin.Addin_" is in the registry as "DoNotDisable" - I cannot find this addin to remove it or disable it</p>
<p>
</p><p>"BITS Service is not running" - I run the automatic FixIt tool and a scan afterwards still shows the same</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, I can toggle a message between read &amp; unread, the messages status will change correctly in webmail and in thunderbird but not outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even removed all outlook data files and started from scratch</p>

            We've already took steps that are potential in resolving the issue with your IMAP account using your Office Outlook 2016. On our understanding, the issue may have been with the IMAP server that you're into. We suggest contacting the Outlook.com team in
 this <strong><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/billing/office/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>, in order to get the IMAP setting that will suit your need.

                    <p>I am not receiving emails consistently.&nbsp; I am getting phone&nbsp;messages and subsequently received emails&nbsp;asking if I got an earlier email, and I have not received it.&nbsp; I have already checked and the senders are in my address book and safe senders list.&nbsp; I have

<p>Thanks for the response!,</p>
<p>Your method wont work though because the file hasn't been saved. The GetObject( ).Application &nbsp;has no file name to work with. Does GetObject have any other properties that may be useful?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Process" is another application that generates reports, one at a time. It is one of those<strong> legacy apps</strong> that only does one thing: Create an excel file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is left up to the user to save the file and close the file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 100 reports. and the were normally processed on at a time</p>
<p>The idea is to quickly create all the reports, ( all together or in groups of 25 or so) and then use a macro to access each report, while it is still open, extract some data, and then close the file without saving it.</p>

<p>Try using any Non-Excel Office app to find all the instances of Excel and process the workbook in that instance, kind of like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim xlApp As Excel.Application<br />
Set xlApp = GetObject(, "Excel.Application")</p>
<p>
</p><p>While Not xlApp Is Nothing</p>
<p>'code to do what you need with the file</p>
<p>xlApp.Application.Workbooks(1).....</p>
<p>xlApp.Application.Quit</p>
<p>Set xlApp = GetObject(, "Excel.Application")</p>
<p>Wend</p>

<h2>            Accelerators  not working in Internet Explorer 11</h2>
                    <p><em>Original title: Accelerator (Internet Explorer 11)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I recently upgraded to IE 11 and have not been able to get the accelerators working like previous versions of IE.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I launch IE in normal mode, I just don't get any accelerators when I highlight texts and right-click:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/702a2525-6e06-46e8-bd5c-6cc90fb81e7a" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Strangely, when I launch IE&nbsp;with "No Add-ons", I get the Google search accelerator (only):</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26661704-caf4-427c-83bc-a16c0bdd2a32" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Btw, I have four other accelerators (Google Translate, Google&nbsp; Maps, Google Preview, and Google News) which are just not appearing in either mode of IE 11.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any solutions? Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Since you are not facing this issue when add-ons disable, it is due to add-ons.</p>
<p>Open Internet Explorer and in tools-&gt;Manage Add-ons , disable all add-ons and try reproduce this problem and then enable add-ons once by one and see which once causing this problem.</p>
<p>You could select a text and it gives you a small blue icon (Accelerator) and you could click on it to see all Accelerators.</p>

</p>
<p>No, I have not installed any programs since it was working correctly. There are several programs that update themselves automatically&nbsp;eg Windows / Adobe / AVG etc which may have changed without my knowledge.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I opened IE in no add-ons mode and I get the same result - I click the blue box and the box disappears.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Btw, I have four other accelerators (Google Translate, Google&nbsp; Maps, Google Preview, and Google News) which are just not appearing in either mode of IE 11.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any solutions? Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Accelerators only show when the context from which they are called matches their action....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>for example....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you highlight some text on a page then only Accelerators that accept a text selection will appear in the list of Accelerators on the context menu or the Accelerator icon.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you just click on a blank area of a web page, then those accelerators which accept a url for an action will appear....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>some parts of webpages may not actually be empty... they may contain parts of other websites embedded in the webpage of a different site. Your IE security zone settings may be preventing Accelerators to Restricted websites from showing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When asking internet related questions it is helpful if you can include the address of any websites you are having issues with.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thx.<br />

You should save the picture as an image in your PC first and then attach it to this post, if you just try copy and paste it ,it will detect as a long characters and won't work.</p>
