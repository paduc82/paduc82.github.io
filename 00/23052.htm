    <title>Unable to open embedded files in Excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to open embedded files in Excel 2010</h2>
                    Unable to open embedded files of any type...xls..xlsx...pdf...etc..&nbsp; Double clicking on the embedded icon, only highlights "drawing tools" on the bar, no error message appears.&nbsp; The icon is editable after clicking, but it appears to be a picture type file.&nbsp;
 Right clicking does nothing.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Based on the size of the file, the data in the embedded file does appear to be contained in the main file, so it's just a matter of being able to get to it.&nbsp; Appears to be related somehow to macro security settings, but after turning "off" security, still get
 same issue.<br />
<br />
It is EXCEL specific, able to open embedded files in WORD 2010.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thank you

            Was finally able to get this one figured out.&nbsp; I have Hyperion Essbase loaded on my laptop.&nbsp; I had to go to Tools&gt;Add-ins and uncheck the two Essbase add-ins listed.&nbsp; It worked, am now able to open embedded files.<br />
<br />
Going forward,&nbsp; I will need to go back in and check them anytime I need to use the Essbase add-in I guess.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />

            At first I thought you could add the #777 number (or whatever number your provider uses to connect to the EVDO network) to your contacts and password protect the dialing of that number, that would be one way. I still have yet to figure that one out. I
 have a Samsung i760 and I think I found something that may work. If you have the ability to turn the phone portion of the device off, you could try and connect to the internet through IE. A message should pop up saying that it could not connect and give you
 the option to go into the settings. In my phone I was able to change the EVDO access number to something other than the number designated to data calls, like 611. Then turn the phone back on. I'm not sure if I'm still getting data connection fees, but it's
 worth a try. Just remember that if you want to use EVDO to turn the phone portion off and go through the process again to change the number back to the original number. I have Verizon as a carrier, and my phone also supports802.11b/g WiFi connections, which
 I can turn off through my connection manager.<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<p>Interesting approach, i'll have to try. But since i use my Data Connection from time to time (my phone has WiFi but there is usually no network available&nbsp;when i need the connection :-) ) I would prefer a simpler solution. I would have to&nbsp;change
 the&nbsp;settings everytime i want to make a data connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another solution is to change the network that is used to connect to the internet in the "Network Management"-Settings. But that requires too many clicks to be practical.</p>

            I found that it was ActiveSync that was continuously connecting. This started happening once I had set up a connection to Google Sync (which emulates an Exchange Server).<br />
<br />
<br />
In ActiveSynce, under the "Schedule..." menu, I changed "Sync during" from "As items arrive" to "Manually"

    <title>How to stop multiple email selections &#39;deselecting&#39; before you - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petebbb  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop multiple email selections &#39;deselecting&#39; before you have finished carrying out more than one &#39;action&#39;</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>Outlook mistakenly 'deselects' multiple email messages following a 'single action'. How can I stop this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Example, (especially relevant to users upgrading from Entourage): Because Outlook does not support Projects, everything that was a project in Entourage, when imported into Outlook, gets a Category label with the suffix '(Project)'.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Following an import I now have thousands of emails with the Category: ''Category Name'(Projects)'.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The the suffix '(Project)' is of no use to me in Outlook. How do I get rid of it ? You would think the easiest way would be to select Category as a Column header, then shift-click to select all the emails in a single category, choose 'Clear All' from the
 Categorize Menu, and then select a pre-existing duplicate Category name (from the pull-down list), which does not have the suffix '(Project)'.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Only that doesn't work, because, following the first action, (Clear All), if there are more emails selected than can fit in the viewing window, (for me there always are), or if there are over a certain number selected, (I have yet to determine exactly
 what triggers it), the selection is cancelled. DISASTER !! This means that I have wiped, say, 300 emails of their category without being able to assign a fresh category and they are now mixed with hundreds of other emails and scattered to the wind !</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The very fact they were given a category is because the subject matter was not included in the Subject line, or equally, because the subject was quite diverse, making this a very difficult situation to recover from.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Unfortunately I cannot simply edit the imported email's Category name, (from, say, 'Blue Folder (Project)' to 'Blue Folder') because I already have existing emails with that category name and Categories will not allow duplicate names.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One workaround is to create a new folder and move the selected emails to it. That way, when the selection is deselected after the 'first action', one can 'Select All', safe in the knowledge that one only re-selecting the correct emails. You can then give
 them a different Category and move them back to their original folder. However, this is a laborious, TIME-CONSUMING, workaround. Better if one's original selection STUCK and stayed stuck through however many actions you undertake, until clicking on a single
 email, deselected the selection.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not sure if this is a bug in Outlook, or considered a safety feature. If the latter, (I.e deliberately designed not to act on emails that you cannot see in the viewing pane), then it's really annoying. Perhaps it could be a tick-box option in Preferences
 for more experienced email users?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a real concern, not only for me, (I have multiple projects in multiple Entourage Identities, going back many years, and all waiting to make the jump to Outlook), but for anyone in Outlook wishing to carry out more than one function on multiple
 emails.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is it &nbsp;bug or is there a solution?</div>
<div><br />

            Almost no one used Project and they are not supported in&nbsp;Outlook. I don't have any experience with Projects. You asked how to delete the category and I explained how to do that. Other than removing the category name I have no idea how to fix your particular
 problem.
<div><br />
<div>You&nbsp;might want to go back to&nbsp;Entourage and export the data in a different format. Eaglefiler imports from&nbsp;Entourage and might be a better way to manage projects than&nbsp;Outlook.</div>

<div>-----------</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hi Diane. I think you've got sidetracked by the Projects example I gave. That was only an
<i>example</i>. The problem need not have anything to do with Projects or Identities, those examples just happened to be relevant to me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So - forgetting Identities and Projects - here's the question again - as taken from the first line of my original question to this forum:</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Outlook mistakenly 'deselects' multiple email messages following a 'single action'. How can I stop this?</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>Also, is this action deliberate or considered a bug?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Perhaps someone else knows about this? If so please feel free to chime in. Many thanks.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>OK, step by step.</div>
<ol>
<li>Lets say your inbox contains 1000 emails. Some have Categories assigned to them, a good proportion don't. It's a mixed bunch.</li><li>You want to change the category of 300 of those emails. You select 'Categories' in your sorting pane and then shift-click to select the 300 emails whose category you wish to change. So far so easy.</li><li>From the Categorize menu you select 'Clear All'. This clears your 300 emails of their category,&nbsp;<b><i>but it also deselects, (un-highlights), your 300 emails so that you now cannot assign a fresh category to them without individually finding them first</i></b>,
 as they are now scattered to the wind and indistinguishable from other non-category emails.</li></ol>
<div>If Outlook did not deselect, (unhighlight), the 300 emails you could clear their original category and assign a new one without the time-consuming task of going through your 1000 emails, chasing down the right ones to assign !</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note 1. in this scenario you need to keep the original category name, (for a sub-set of emails), so the easy solution of simply editing and changing the original category name is not an option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note 2. The three steps above are exactly as describe in my original Question, headlined, '<i>How to stop multiple email selections 'deselecting' before you have finished carrying out more than one 'action</i>' ,&nbsp;only&nbsp;without any reference to Projects
 or Identities which, (although relevant, and a good example), seemed to be a distraction.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Question:</div>
<ol>
<li>Is there a solution?</li><li>Is Outlook's annoying auto deselect of a selection ‚Äì&nbsp;<i>before you have finished working with them</i>&nbsp;‚Äì by design, or a bug?</li></ol>
<div>I hope that clarifies. Many thanks.</div>

<div>Hi Diane. Thanks for your response. Taking it step by step:</div>
<div><br />
<div>OK, your first five bullet points concern Finding and Selecting, which i don't have an issue with, so I'll move on to your remaining four points - which, I cannot see how will work, because:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. The category is already in existence and Outlook does not allow two identical categories. (please see my Note 1. above).</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. And in any case, the act of adding a category, (your bullet point 6), deselects the selection, sending me back to square one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Additionally, if by 'put in Preview pane below' (your penultimate bullet point), you are suggesting a workaround which will corral the emails in a separate folder, guaranteeing &nbsp;the right re-selection, then I'm aware of that and, (as stated in my first
 forum message), this is the very tedium that I am trying to avoid.</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>
<div><span>To put the problem in perspective. I am importing 10 years of email into Outlook from 10 different Entourage identities, (one per year). Each year's Identity holding approx' 30 different folders and
 across the folders there are approx 50 different categories.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Each category (originally a Project in Entourage) will be imported into Outlook with an added suffix. This is not my doing, but added by Outlook and is their way of saying, 'Projects are no longer
 supported, so we are labelling all you projects as Categories, but including the word '(Projects)' in brackets. Hence a Project that was once called 'Red Archives' in Entourage, becomes 'Red Archives (Project)' in Outlook.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I can understand Outlook thinking that adding the suffix is being helpful, but it's not, (just swapping the Project label for the same name, only as a Category label ‚Äì now that would have been helpful
 ! And we wouldn't be having this conversation).</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>So how to get rid of the additional bracketed word? Having a selection 'stick' thus allowing more than one 'action' to be carried out on the selection, would be the obvious answer, but I guess it's
 not to be.</span></div>
</span></div>

            You can have multiple categories assigned to an item. I don't understand <i>
"<b>The category is already in existence</b> </i>" If the category is already&nbsp;assigned&nbsp;why would you be adding it a second time?

            I've read somewhere that it has been removed for privacy.&nbsp; But it seems that if skype must ensure privacy and remove something, they should bring Time display back but make Location private!!&nbsp; Knowing someone's location definitely invades privacy, but
 knowing their TIME surely doesn't!!&nbsp; Correct?<br />

<h2>            Feeds in Internet Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am having issues with Internet Explorer in 9879:</p>
<ol>
<li>None of the feeds from blogs.msdn.com and blogs.windows.com can be displayed in the desktop IE after subscription. For example, you can navigate to
<a href="http://blogs.windows.com/ie/feed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.windows.com/ie/feed/</a>, if you subscribe to it and then open it from the Feeds pane, it ends up with Unable to download feed page. All other feeds seem to work (and even
 these before subscribing).<br />
<br />
</li><li>On the feeds page for all those that display, none of the controls in the right pane (search, filter, properties) work.<br />
<br />
</li><li>That includes the subscription box at the top: I cannot subscribe to feeds from the feeds page anymore. I need to open the Feeds pane and click the Subscribe to Feed button.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Feeds are not refreshing automatically. If I right-click on the Feeds pane and choose Refresh All, that does not work either.&nbsp;I need to go through each of the feeds individually and click Refresh. Note that these refreshes even the ones that to cannot be
 displayed.</li></ol>
<div>
<p>That seems broken quite a lot. Does anyone see the same behavior?</p>

<h2>            Transposing data with a cell reference &#34;jump&#34; built in</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully I can describe this properly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a massive address download which is presented in rows for each line of the address - I am happy transposing this to a second worksheet in the row layout that I require to be able to upload to our database, however, I do not want to transpose line
 by line which would take forever, so would ideally like to be able to copy the formula down.... This is not to be!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I copy the formula down, it continues from the first cell reference in the range and not the last so C12:C17 will copy down as C13:C18. I want it to start from C18 etc. There will also be occasion to "jump" a cell row altogether so would want C12 to
 "jump" to C14</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have asked Google in every way I can but to no avail. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey Raymond,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the suggestion given by Robear above, try pressing the <strong>
F11</strong> key on your keyboard to exit Full Screen view. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That should cause Internet Explorer to display in a window instead of taking up the entire screen and hiding the Taskbar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

            Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you would like to disable OneDrive for Business on your laptop.<br />
<br />
If you refer to the legacy OneDrive for Business (Groove.exe), it is installed as a part of Office suite. If you want to disable&nbsp; it, you can just exit the program.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3ee8e07-c205-494d-a07c-35ddbb608631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3ee8e07-c205-494d-a07c-35ddbb608631" /></a><br />
If you refer to the new OneDrive sync client with your work account signed in (OneDrive.exe), you can unlink it by right clicking on the cloud icon&gt; Settings&gt; Account&gt; Unlink this PC. You can find the version of OneDrive you are using via this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-version-of-OneDrive-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Which version of OneDrive am I using?</a><br />

<p>Hi TWu,<br />
<br />
Here are the answers to your questions.<br />
For the 1st and 2nd question, you can refer to the article below for the details about in-place hold and litigation hold.<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff637980(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff637980(v=exchg.150).aspx</a><br />
<br />
For the 3rd question, if a user delete an email in your mailbox, it will go to the deleted items folder in your mailbox. Then after 30 days, the email will automatically go to the recover deleted items folder and will stay 14 days by default. During this period,
 the user can recover the email himself referring to the article below.<br />
<a href="https://portal.office.com/support/help.aspx?sid=recdelitems&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US%23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/support/help.aspx?sid=recdelitems&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#/</a><br />
After the email will be automatically deleted from the recover deleted items folder, the email will go to the purge folder and then the end user can‚Äôt recover the email himself. It is required to contact an admin of the Office 365 tenant to help use
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd298021(exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">eDiscovery search</a> to recover the email. You can refer to the article below for more details.<br />
<br />
For the 4th question, if you mean you export emails into a PST file from an Outlook client, the emails will not be removed from the mailbox and will still be kept in Exchange Online. If you want to import the PST file into another email account in the Outlook
 client, you can refer to the article below<br />
<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/praveenkumar/archive/2012/10/16/single-item-recovery-in-exchange-online.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.technet.com/b/praveenkumar/archive/2012/10/16/single-item-recovery-in-exchange-online.aspx</a><br />
<br />
For the 5th question, based on my research, you can‚Äôt delete an email permanently with immediate effect in Office 365.
<br />
<br />
If my understanding is not correct about your question, please provide us with more details about your requirement.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</p>

<h3> maria nordstrom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate Sites- How to delete them</h2>
                    <p>So my company has been doing some Sharepoint cleanup, but we are having a few issues with a few of our sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of our sites, brings up between 4-6 sites every time we search it. I have tried deleting the group in the Sharepoint admin center, but doing that doesn't remove all of the sites. Each site still brings up a home page, but when I try and go into Site
 information (within the site) to delete them that way the site information button is gone from the site settings drop down menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then I went back and restored the original group, and I tried deleting them through the site information button. It will let me delete one site that way, but when I search, the sites still come up. I tried to delete the remaining sites through site information,
 but the page for it never loads on the remaining sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I delete this site and all the other sites with this name at once?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted many other sites with little to no issue, why is this one different?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each of these sites also has the same URL EXCEPT each URL ends in a different number;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://&lt;company&gt;.sharepoint.com/sites/LSSStateCenter37</p>
<p>https://&lt;company&gt;.sharepoint.com/sites/LSSStateCenter10</p>
<p>https://&lt;company&gt;.sharepoint.com/sites/LSSStateCenter67</p>
<p>https://&lt;company&gt;.sharepoint.com/sites/LSSStateCenter19</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on this would be much appreciated</p>

            Hi Maria,<br />
<br />
To delete these site, we suggest you delete them using SharePoint Management Shell. Here are the two commands you could use:<br />
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/remove-sposite?view=sharepoint-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Remove-SPOSite</a>: removes sites from the site collections list and moves it to the Recycle Bin<br />

<br />
About why the sites are different, you could try searching the audit about these URLs in Admin center, see if there are anything worth noticing.<br />
<br />

            I mean my main concern at this point, is that when I run to see what sites I have in the powershell, it is pulling up duplicates of sites still, even though when I search them in sharepoint they no longer come up.&nbsp;

                    <p>I had problems launching my Office 365 products. I first tried repairing it without success. Then I uninstall Office 365 and tried to reinstall several times. But each time after downloading 58% I get a message that:</p>

<p>Dear Vladimir and Andres,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp; you so much for your prompt responses. Much appreciated.</p>
<p>I have tried all your suggestions before but I tried again this time and I get the same problem.</p>
<p>Funny thing is I have been using Office 365 for a long time. It is only now that I am encountering this problem.</p>
<p>Maybe something wrong with my PC. I will have to consult a technician to try to solve my problem unless somebody else has other suggestions.</p>
<p>Once again thanks and have a nice day.</p>

            Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Disable your Antivirus utility temporarily, then try installing Office again.
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.
<br />
<br />Forgot your account details? See I forgot the account I use with Office.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forgot-the-account-i-use-with-office-eba0b4a2-c0ae-472c-99f6-bc63ee2425a8?wt.mc_id=scl_installoffice_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forg...</a>
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, do the following depending on your version of Office.
<br />
<br />If you signed in with a Microsoft account, from the Office home page select Install Office &gt; Install. (Office 365 subscribers should select Install again).
<br />
<br />This begins the download of Office. Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the install.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We only speak English here and this forum is for MSE and malware-related questions while your post in what seems to be Simplified Chinese seems to relate to Facebook connection issues.&nbsp; We do not have a version of Answers in that version of Chinese.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We only speak English here and they only speak English where I need to send you to resolve this problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To do this, assuming you are using Internet Explorer, get the Bing Translator add-on at:
<a href="http://www.ieaddons.com/en/addons/detail.aspx?id=205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ieaddons.com/en/addons/detail.aspx?id=205</a> and install it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then you can use it to type what you want to say in Simplified Chinese and translate it to English, copy the English version, and post that in the appropriate forum.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can then use it to translate replies back into Simplified Chinese.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That's how I created this post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once you‚Äôve done that, please proceed to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.facebook.com/help/</a>&nbsp;for</span><span> assistance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If you need further help from Microsoft, please go to

<h2>            PowerPoint crashes when using Language Pack to change display lanaguage</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<div><span>I'm using Office Home &amp; Business 2013 JAPANESE edition at my job. Then yesterday we installed a language pack (ENGLISH) for it.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
Now I can use MS Word and Excel in both English and Japanese (by changing the display language), however Powerpoint doesn't work. Each time I try to start Powerpoint (with the display language set to English), it won't start. It gives a blank error message
 (i.e. a typical windows error box with the red cross thing, but no text at all), then immediately quits.<br />
<br />
</span></div>
<div>
<p><span>I can start powerpoint in Safe Mode, but this is a hassle to do each time. Or if I change the display language back to Japanese, then powerpoint will start normally. MS Word and Excel work fine, in both display languages.
</span></p>
<p><span>Things </span>I have tried:</p>
<p>Quick Repair</p>
<p>Uninstalling then reinstalling both Office and the Language Pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System:</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 7 64-bit<br />
</span></p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas how to fix it, I'd be really grateful to hear them. Thanks.

            <p>You probably already know this, but I'll mention it in case it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The language packs convert the Office user interface ... the ribbons, menus, messages and so on ... to different languages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be what you need (for example, so that a user who doesn't read Japanese can use Office). &nbsp;I'm guessing that's what you need, and if so, skip the next paragraph. ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you simply need to switch between typing Japanese and English, you can install the different languages in Windows, then use the language bar to switch from one language to the other on the fly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since safe mode is a workaround, I'd have a look to see what, if any, COM add-ins are installed and disable them all, test by starting PPT normally (ie, not in safe mode), then re-enable them one at a time, testing after each one is enabled. &nbsp;I doubt it'd
 be a VBA add-in at fault; safe mode doesn't disable those, no matter what anyone else may tell you, so safe mode wouldn't cure any problems they introduce.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd also temporarily set the Windows default printer driver to Microsoft's XPS driver if that's available to you. &nbsp;PPT can be cranky about printer drivers; the English language pack might cause it to go toes up when it encounters a printer driver in Japanese.
 &nbsp;The XPS driver is more likely to be language-agnostic, or so my theory goes.</p>

            <p>Thanks a lot for the suggestions. And you're right that I am trying to change the display language; the input language can be switched no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried disabling all the add-ins, but powerpoint will still not start. Actually, there was only one COM add-in enabled, called "Send to bluetooth" or something similar. As far as I can see, there are no Powerpoint add-ins enabled either. There do seem to
 be a few other add-ins of a different type (called "document editing" or something like that), but I assume they don't affect the startup much.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried switching to the XPS printer as default, but still no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help so far! If you have any other ideas, please let me know. </p>

            <p>If you do not use Bluetooth, then just on general principles, turn off the addin.&nbsp; Even though it does not appear to be the problem in this case, there were many similar problems when Office 2013 was initially released.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word crashing on startup is very often caused by bad addons.&nbsp; I could see a scenario where a langauge change might cause an addon problems.&nbsp; The problem going away in safe mode is a very strong (pretty much certain) indicator that the problem is an addon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try turning off the other non-com addins too.</p>

            <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've turned off all the add-ins, but powerpoint still crashes on launch. However, I should mention that a few times I seemed to have trouble with the autocorrect / smart tags section, where they appeared to re-enable themselves after I exited the Options
 menu and re-entered it a few times. Regardless, I have verified that all of them are disabled, but with no success. The attached image shows the add-ins page, in case I have missed something. Quick translation, from top to bottom:</p>
<p>„Ç¢„ÇØ„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éñ„Å™„Ç¢„Éó„É™„Ç±„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥„ÄÄ„Ç¢„Éâ„Ç§„É≥ = active application add-in</p>

<p>
</p><p>You know, you can also simply create a Windows shortcut with the SAFE command line parameter so that you can start by simply (double) clicking on the shortcut/tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some Word specific procedures. You can try to adapt them to PowerPoint to see if you can track down the cause of your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<span><strong>Trouble Shoot Word</strong></span>
<div>
<span><strong>A General Starting point when Word does something unexpected</strong></span>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word ‚Äúmenu‚Äô go to Tools and then Options, in Word ‚Äúribbon‚Äù go to File then Options, and study all of the various options, both turned on and
 off.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>You may even get lucky and find some other settings that you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always check Tools Options</li><li>When in doubt, right-click on something</li><li>If you‚Äôre wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each time the answer
 was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd use a Word table.‚Äù By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</li></ol>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<h2>            convert word document to a web page</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like to know how to compose a Word Text Document (2007), &nbsp;post it as a web page and / or post it as a clickable link from existing web pages. &nbsp;In short, I want a simple blank web page, without a default template in which I can type text and paste
 small file photographs. I would be a plus if the URL could be indexed / searchable.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There are all kinds of options in the word menu that seem to point in that direction and they seem to almost work, but they just will not open. It is interesting that I have tried Google Docs and with a similar result: one in ten attempts post correctly
 and the rest inform me that the assigned URL does not exist. I wonder if those similar experiences are indicative of some necessary and basic gadget or code that is missing?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The results are the same in all my&nbsp;browsers; I run Windows 7 / 64 bit and Word Home and Office 2007. And no more than a year ago I installed the latest service pack for this product. Please try to keep your answers ASAP (As Simple As Possible). I am a
 competent computer operator, but I am not a guy who is&nbsp;comfortable&nbsp;writing&nbsp;code.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks -- -- Tom Hagood&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Apple Mail and Outlook 2016&#58; Exchange server &#34;s.outlook.com&#34; is not responding</h2>
                    <p>I have been - unsuccessfully - to add my outlook.com account to Apple Mail (v8.2) and Outlook 2016 Preview on my Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions I found at:&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/send-receive-from-app which tell me to use Exchange Active Sync and the address "s.outlook.com". &nbsp;Every time I try to add the account - in either app - I am told:</p>
<p>"The Exchange server 's.outlook.com' is not responding."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried other variants to this address like 'm.hotmail.com' and m.office.com' but none of these are working. &nbsp;I am using my full email address as the username and an app password created from my account center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the network utility I am able to ping 's.outlook.com' without a hitch so I don't think it's a connectivity issue. &nbsp;Does anyone have an answer as to why this connection cannot be made; it works fine on my iPhone and iPad.</p>

            You you actually have an exchange account? As it turn out I don't have. &nbsp;So I can't sign up, cheapest MS exchange account you can get is $10 per month.&nbsp;

</p><p>I've Tried setting it up myself and I believe you have uncovered a Bug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried myself both in Outlook 2011 and 2016.&nbsp;And got basically the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you <span>either open Outlook 2016 (Preview)</span>&nbsp;and click on the Smiley button then on Sadface and report and mention have same error on 2011 outlook. And I would also go to help menu &gt; feedback that is also report Bug also mention
 it doesn't work on Outlook Preview as well.</p>

            <p>Outlook.com does not support Exchange at this time. &nbsp;Only the Office 365 and Enterprise type accounts (the ones you pay for) support it. &nbsp;You can't upgrade outlook.com to one of those, so you have to sign up for a new email in order to make it work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is frustrating many as outlook.com works seamlessly on Windows 7 and 8.1 desktop Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for those of you who keep suggesting IMAP, this is only good for email, what we want is a complete solution, Email, Calendar and Contacts. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you read the link in my original question you'll see that in their own instructions they say to use EAS.</p>

            <p>However, EAS is not supported by Apple Mail on OS X. (It *is* available for Mail on iOS.) Mail on OS X only supports full Exchange, not EAS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to use the Outlook application from MS Office for EAS. Outlook 15 for Mac (the app) has an account type specifically for Outlook.com that uses the correct settings.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open existing or save new due to &#34;permissions&#34; on MacBook Pro and 365 Word</h2>
                    I have been using Office 365 on my MacBook Pro for a year. I have never had a problem. I have always saved files to my HD. Today I can no longer open existing documents or save new documents. When I try I receive a "permission" error. Office is up to date,
 as is my Mac. I signed out of 365 and back in, still nothing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
ANY ideas?<br />

    <title>N97 mini power button problem &#40;presumably&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nnn_74  say:</h3>
<h2>            N97 mini power button problem &#40;presumably&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Basically my problem is the same as described by many users, N97 mini won't power up. Battery is fully charged, the contents of the phone can be accessed on USB / PC, tried powering up with and without the battery, with and without the sim card, with and
 without the power cable etc. and tried the four finger salute using various setups described earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When plugged in, the charger works normally, the Nokia screen with the hands comes up, then turns darker, then goes black. At this point, the power button again does nothing but both the screen and the button next to the red and green phone icon buttons
 bring the screen back to life (to the charging screen).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has me thinking it's probably the power button itself that's gone, not the system or other parts of the phone. All my files are backed up (which I did before trying the hard format) and I can access everything on the hard drive through the PC just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way jump start the phone, like powering up through using the USB connection and the PC for example?</p>

Very time consuming after adding a new task, having to select 'New Task' to add another one.<br />

            A. Delete you gmail account and add it again. 
<br />
<br />B. 
<br />1. Go to gmail account 
<br />2. Click on profile pic &gt; My Account 
<br />3. Sign-in &amp; Security 
<br />4. Click on Apps with Account access 
<br />5. go down and set Allow less secure apps to ON. 
<br />
<br />Just do it once and check whether it works or not. If it works, make it OFF again, if you are more security conscious. Then you can opt for 2 step verification in gmail.

<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Below are general troubleshooting options for Outlook. Try one by one and and check after each step
<br />
<br />1. Create new Outlook profile to rule out corruption in Outlook profile. - <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/create-an-outlook-profile-ha102749460.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Repair your Outlook data files - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-64842a0a-658a-4324-acc6-ef0a6e3567cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Disable Anti-virus temporarily. 
<br />
<br />4. There is a possibility that some Add-in is causing the problem. To rule this out, start Outlook in safe mode. Hold CTRL key and click on Outlook icon. Don't leave CTRL key, till it asks for the confirmation about safe mode. 
<br />
<br />5. Login to Windows with a new profile to rule out problem in Windows profile. 
<br />
<br />6. Right click on Outlook icon and run as Administrator.
