<h2>            My laptop battery is dying very quickly and I can&#39;t roll back on a driver update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop battery is dying much faster all of a sudden. I had already made an energy report through command prompt and it says that i'm using about 56% of a full charge from when I bought this battery and yet my laptop will die within 20 minutes. Prior to
 this issue, my laptop would last about 3 hours. I've attempted to roll back on an update but I can't. The option is just greyed out. I only just installed WIndows 10 last week. There's nothing to roll back onto. How can I fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Battery life </strong><strong>is totally reliant with the hardware</strong> itself, not with the operating system or any software. It is possible that your battery encounters some issue coincidentally after the update, causing shorter battery life

            <p><span>Hi</span></p>
<p><span>Windows could not find backup devices on your computer. The following information might explain why this problem occurred:</span></p>
<p><span>Incorrect function.<b> (0x80070001) </b></span></p>
<p><span>Please close the backup application and try again.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Possible cause:</span></b><span> This issue may occur if you have an EISA partition that is marked as active on the hard disk.</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this issue, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp; Start Disk Management. To do this, click<b> Start</b>, type <b>diskmgmt.msc</b> in the Start Search box, and then click diskmgmt.msc in the Programs list. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Continue. <br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Right-click the primary partition that you want to make active, and then click
<b>Mark Partition</b> as <b>Active. <br />
<br />
</b>3.&nbsp; Exit Disk Management. <br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Restart the computer by using the Windows 7 DVD. <br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; Set your language preference, and then click <b>Next. </b></span></p>
<p><b><span>Note </span></b><span>In most cases, the repair process starts automatically, and the System Recovery Options menu is not displayed.

<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp; When the repair process is complete, click <b>Finish. <br />
<br />
</b>10.&nbsp;Restart the computer by using the hard disk. <br />
<br />

            Thank you for your reply.
<div><br />
<div>I should be more clearer. I could able to start the backup, looks like it was copying files to my external hard disk. It ran into that error at a certain point.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have already checked that the drive is marked as active.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do I still perform the repair process?</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Error code 0x80070570 every time whilst trying to download games</h2>
                    
<p>So I got my xbox yesterday. After getting over some stumbling blocks at first (it was in a constant reboot loop) I finally got the thing running and staying on, however games will not install! I have tried with both Fifa and Assassins creed and every time
 get the error code&nbsp;0x80070570 stating that the file is corrupt and to retry. How many times can I possibly retry though? Has anyone else encountered this or found a fix?</p>

<p>My Xbox did this to both Call of Duty Ghosts and Assassins Creed IV Black Flag in the same day. I have both games in their physical disk forms. I also have a physical disk of Battlefield 4, which works without a hitch.</p>
<p>Whenever I put Ghosts or Black Flag into my Xbox, however, the words "Installation stopped" will appear over the tile showing the game. When I select that tile for Black Flag, I get a notice which says the following:</p>
<p>"Something went wrong</p>
<p>Give it another try. If this happens again, let us know by entering 0x80072f78 at xbox.com/errorhelp so we can investigate."</p>
<p>From there, I am prompted to close. The url xbox.com/errorhelp redirects me to
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/error-code-lookup?icid=furl_errorhelp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../error-code-lookup</a> and when I type in that particular error code, it thinks that I'm using an Xbox 360 and am having trouble signing in to Xbox Live. &nbsp;Not exactly helpful. My next step is to order the game to install again. It starts
 at 0% (when I have ALREADY downloaded and played this game in the past while connected to Xbox Live), and switches between "Queued" and 0% for awhile before telling me that the installation has stopped again. From there it's a rinse and repeat sort of thing.
 Of course, as I was typing this I was doing exactly what I was describing so as to be able to recount it all faithfully, but this time instead of sitting at 0% it started at 0% and then jumped all the way to 92%, which it is currently sitting at, occasionally
 going back to "Queued." Selecting the 92% installed game tile does nothing. I'll update this part as things change.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have Ghosts. When I would select the tile while it was saying "Installation stopped" it would do nothing at all. It wouldn't give me the error code Black Flag gave me. It would do nothing. Restarting the installation would yield the
 same problem of switching between 0% and Queued and then stopping the installation again. It might be worth noting that when I first turned my console on when this problem started occurring, I had put Ghosts in and was trying to play that. When it told me
 that the installation was stopped right off the bat, I had the option to either cancel the installation or retry the installation. I believe I told it to cancel, merely thinking that this was a basic problem with it downloading some sort of patch and being
 stopped half way through, and it just needed to be canceled and redownloaded. And then my problems stopped. If I recall correctly, when I first turned my Xbox on, in addition to seeing the Ghosts tile with its "Installation stopped" I could also at that time
 see the Black Flag tile with its own "Installation stopped" on my Xbox dashboard. Oh, also when I first canceled the installation of Ghosts, it acted as though I had never installed the stupid thing before, and told me that some 1300+ MB needed to be downloaded
 (presumably for patching purposes) as per usual when you first put a new game into the console. I don't think it did that with Black Flag, but I could be mis-remembering.</p>
<p>Hopefully some of that is helpful, because I would certainly like this problem to be resolved.</p>

<p>UPDATE TO THE ABOVE:</p>
<p>So, I turned my Xbox on today to give it another shot, and... It just worked this time. It continued downloading Black Flag from the 92% wall it had been stuck at, and at 93% it was telling me that it was ready to play, and the game seemed to function fine--my
 save files were also intact. After it completely finished installing, I switched it out for Ghosts, which also installed properly--although it had to go all the way from 0% to 100% as is necessary with installing a brand new game to your console. In any case,
 both games seem to be functioning now, so I don't know what went wrong. Theoretically it could be that my Xbox One was having a hard time getting a solid connection to the internet, and its response was to have a psychotic melt-down, but... I'm far from convinced.
 Whatever it was, though, the issue is now resolved for myself, which is a big relief. I wish anyone else who has this or similar problems luck.</p>

 is missing. safe mode works, user names and password box shows up and i have been using system restore to go back to b4 the update, but every few day the window auto updates again and same thing reoccurs, and i am getting tired or going into safe mode and
 doing a system restore, just need a permanent fix for this.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
After a Restore or before the issue comes back.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Windows Updates - upper left - set to download and notify you so you can select which to install.<br />
<br />
Also do stop Driver Updates which are almost always old and problematic.<br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After a restore and/or before the issue comes back - you can make a Restore Point before each update and<br />
determine which is causing the issue. If a lot of them then install 1/2 and use a process of elimination<br />
to find the bad one and Right Click on it and HIDE. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>Honest Hearts and Dead Money Opinions - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Honest Hearts and Dead Money Opinions</h2>
                    
<p>I'm quite annoyed by both the game add-ons. Dead Money was seriously boring for me as the atmosphere was dull and dark it just made me want to get out of there as fast as possible. That collar and the high pitch radios really was a challenge and frustrated
 me along the way and I think it was a silly idea. Honest Hearts was really good and I did enjoy it a lot, but it was too short. It took me under 2 hours to complete which brought me to a huge disapointment. The next DLC better make up for these two. What is
 your thoughts and opinions on these DLC's?</p>
<p>Fallout is the best game ever. Always will be.</p>

<p>So DM was a silly idea becasue was frustrating to you. That was the point of the DLC to be frustrating , to make you think instead of make you go running all the way ala rambo. I am sure that if DM were too easy there would have complaints about the DLC
 for that...the devs make a challenge and the gamers that can't deal with it talk crap about it for not be so easy. gamers gamers...</p>

<p>Only thing I liked about DM were the new weapons like the Police Pistol and especially the Automatic Rifle (BAR); I didn't care much for the Gold Bars as they just take up room in my inventory. I enjoyed Honest Hearts also for the new weapons but also because
 I thought the landscape was beautiful; the red rocks, trees that actually had leaves on them as well as swimming in a river without slowly becoming irradiated. I guess I'm just easy to please, lol.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Silent In The Trees,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If your touchpad isn’t working, it may be a result of a missing or out-of-date driver.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the instruction below.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.&nbsp; On Start Windows logo <strong><span>Start button</span></strong>, search for
<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>, and select it from the list of results. Under
<strong><span>Mice and other pointing devices</span></strong>, select your <strong>
<span>touchpad</span></strong>, open it, select the <strong><span>Driver tab</span></strong>, and select
<strong><span>Update Driver</span></strong>. If Windows doesn't find a new driver, look for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>2.&nbsp; If those steps didn't work, try uninstalling your touchpad driver: open
<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>, right-click (or press and hold) the
<strong><span>touchpad driver</span></strong>, and select Uninstall. Restart your device and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3.&nbsp; If that didn't work, try using the <strong><span>generic driver
</span></strong>that comes with Windows. Here's how: in <strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>, right-click (or press and hold) your
<strong><span>touchpad driver </span></strong>&gt; <strong><span>Update driver software</span></strong>... &gt;
<strong><span>Browse my computer for driver software </span></strong>&gt; <strong><span>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</span></strong>, select
<strong><span>HID compliant mouse</span></strong>, select Next, and follow the instructions to install it.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope it helps,</span></span></p>

<h2>            Skype for Business 2015 - Unassigned numbers&#47;assigned numbers&#47;auto attend</h2>
                    <p>Morning Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have on prem Skype for Business 2015, Exchange 2010, unified messaging managing voicemail and auto attend (not in use currently).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have discovered a problem after setting up a test account and assigning a number to it.</p>
<p>When a Skype account is enabled I assign a number to it from our pool. Our unassigned number range is set up in Skype for Business Server 2015 control panel under Voice Features and includes all numbers in our range (I think this is correct).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it stands Auto attend answers any calls to numbers that are not assigned to users.</p>
<p>The issue is that for new users auto attend is answering the call if you dial the number, if I call from with Skype for business (PC or Mobile) via username it calls correctly. If you call via the number (actually dialled) I can see it forward to the Auto
 Attend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing this is a simple configuration issue but I am lost and need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Alx</p>

<p>I am trying to transfer data from my PC to an iMac. I know my ip address. I'm running an ethernet cable from the pc to the router, with another ethernet from the iMac to the router. The iMac cannot connect with my PC. I've disabled the Firewall and have

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect a wired PC  to my wireless PC network</h2>
                    I have three desktop PC and two laptops, all running Windows 7 Home Premium or Business. I have a Netcomm WB9WMAXXN N300 Modem Router, running the latest firmware. Both laptops and two of the desktops are in a wireless network and can happily share printers
 and access the internet. I recently upgraded the wired desktop to run Windows 7 Home Premium. It is connected to the router with a wire, it can access the internet but I want my son to be able to access the printers that are attached to the otehr two desktops.
 I have tried creating a homegroup but not even all of the wireless pcs can join it. I'll create it on one of the wireless pcs and then go to the next one and it can't find the the homegroup. I've made sure none of the computers are in any home group, but they
 still can't find a newly created homegroup. I don't mind what type of network it is, so long as we can share theprinters.<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Ghost box</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Surface Pro 3 a couple years ago for my wife and at some point in the past year a box would appear on the upper right of the screen at login and trap the mouse.&nbsp; To get rid of it you had to touch it on the screen and request to close it.&nbsp; I
 reset the computer but the problem still exists.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Looks like some kind of Accessibility tool is running then.&nbsp; Any clues from Alt-Tab?&nbsp; If it is the Magnifier you could use various keystrokes to modify it or turn it off.&nbsp; Win-Esc for example.&nbsp; Otherwise I would try Narrator to see if it gives you any clues
 about it.&nbsp; Win-Enter.&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, although your OP made it sound like you were having this symptom in the Login screen your images make it look as if it appears later.&nbsp; In that case what you could do is use ProcExp for its Task finder tool and see if that helps identify this object
 for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW this looks familiar somehow (e.g. something I once had the Answer for) but I can't remember what exactly it would have been.&nbsp; Otherwise, one thing it reminds me of is the box that appears when a user does a press and hold (when that Touch option is
 enabled), so if it is enabled, try disabling it and see if the symptom changes.&nbsp; Also, of course, you could try disabling Touch completely, in case it is a symptom of a spurious Touch interrupt on a particular area of your screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p><span>Thanks for the advice--I rebuilt the machine using the recovery methods Barb outlined above, then tried the things Robert suggested--with no luck. &nbsp;I finally fixed it, which is the good news. &nbsp;the bad news is that
 i had to disable the touch screen driver to do it. &nbsp;My wife doesn't use the touch screen anyway so it's not a big loss, but it still bugs me that the functionality has to be limited in order for the machine to work correctly. &nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Best AA batteries for Xbox One controller, Scuf one and Canon and Sony - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vianew4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best AA batteries for Xbox One controller, Scuf one and Canon and Sony Digital Camera </h2>
                    Looking for the longest lasting AA batteries for my Xbox One wireless controller gamepad that can double as batteries for 2 digital cameras we have at home Sony and Canon, I have tried many LR6 alkaline batteries like Duracell and Energizer and rechargeable
 one and their playtime is very limited and disappointing, we play mostly games like Call of duty, Halo, Destiny, Grand theft auto and Minecraft. I use the original Xbox One Controller and my hubby uses the SCUF One controllers both accepting AA batteries.
 Thanks for any expert suggestions.

I found these batteries

            Hi Shelby.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This requires the full printer software package being installed and maintained so that the printer will maintain it's connection to PC to scan in either direction.  
<br />
<br />Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Admin, copy and paste in the following command and press Enter:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash). 
<br />
<br />4 Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  
<br />
<br />5) If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />If that method doesn' work to remove the driver and restart, try this one:  <a href="https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/remove-uninstall-a-printer-driver-from-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/remove-uninstal...</a>
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> tpwbus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Scheduler error &#34;One or more of the specified arguments are not valid.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I've recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 on our PC and I've encountered several issues with Task Scheduler. Most of them I have managed to resolve but there is one which is raising the same error every time. This task always worked with no issues
 in previous versions of Windows. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Excel workbook stored on my desktop which I want to open on a daily basis. Since Windows 10, task scheduler has been unable to open this workbook, instead it just opens Excel with no workbooks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting and reinstating the task (using the Create Basic Task option) and it apparently creates the task correctly, but when I run it I come up against the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then if I open the task properties, I am unable to even click "OK" - even if I've not made any changes to it. Instead I receive the following message: "An error has occurred for task [taskname]. Error message: One or more of the specified arguments are not
 valid".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions to get this sorted out?</p>

            <p>Just found out that if the task is run under domain account (domainname\username) then when you open the task properties there is only username showed and that's why we can't edit the task. When you change the username to a proper user (find one in the directory
 or type yours in the domainname\username format) then you can save the changes fine.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(you need to create a file)</span></p>
<p>If Wordpad opens the file correctly, then it's most likely a internal issue with Excel.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes there is little chance that that the User Manager Service would be disabled on most systems which was the solution offered by that last OP - though if nothing else works it should be checked.<br />

Another possible solution is to perform a Refresh which keeps Apps and Data though it does remove programs.<br />

More troubleshooting methods to help if needed :<br />
<br />
</p>
If needed create a new Admin Account and copy your files to it.<br />
<br />
You can use the Built-In Admin Account to create your profile and to move<br />
files (however do not use this account on a regular basis because if it corrupts<br />
you are toast).<br />

<br />
<br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a <br />
new one (remember to always leave an Admin Account that is unused except <br />
to test and fix).<br />
<br />
In&nbsp;the instructions of the link below use these instead of #3. Follow&nbsp;all the others<br />
under Work Group (if&nbsp;you are on a Domain you should be working with TechNet).<br />
<br />
3. In 8/8.1 and 10 use File Explorer -&nbsp;Click on the Drive where users are (usually<br />
C:\ ) - then View tab - tick Hidden Items box &amp; on far upper right of ribbon Options<br />
- Change folder and Search options.<br />
<br />
Fix a corrupted user profile &lt;- method works on Windows 7 and Windows 8<br />
- Windows 10 also.<br />

    <title>Abysmal wifi speed on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> namck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Abysmal wifi speed on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've checked that drivers are up to date. I have 2 different wifi cards and 1 usb wifi adapter. I tried just about everything. Reception on other devices is fine, including a device located in the same spot as computer. It's strictly the computer after updating
 to Windows 10. My wifi speed starts fine but will quickly go down to about 0.1 to 2 mbps (instead of 15+) Nothing seems to fix this, other than a Network reset, after which speed is fine again but quickly degrades.<br />
<br />
I'm on Windows 10 Pro, v1709 Build 16299.371<br />
<br />
Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>No program is hogging the connection</li><li>Speed degrades on multiple wifi adapter simultaneously</li><li>Can only be fixed by a Network reset</li><li>Steadily degrades over time after a reset</li><li>No wifi problems on other devices, even in same location<br />
</li><li>Drivers up to date</li><li>Speed degrades to 0.1-2 mbps with short, temporary bursts to full speed</li></ul>
