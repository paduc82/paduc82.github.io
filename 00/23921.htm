I don't know which post you are talking about, but I did not have a Windows 7 machine until a few months ago. (I held out and did not install Vista but wanted to avoid Win8.) Anyway I was delighted when I was able to install Works 4.0 and install the Y2K patch
 which updates it to 4.5a. I can't imagine why I would have said it would not run on Win7, but if I did I was wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know if it will run on Win8, so this may be a moot point. I just wanted you to know that at least one person was running Works 4.5a on a Windows 7 pro machine.</p>

            <p>I was able to get 4.0 to install on Windows 7 and then updated it to 4.5a with the Y2K patch that MS used to provide. It seems to run just fine. The patch does not appear to be available anymore on the MS site, but if you want to try it, I uploaded it to
 yousendit and you can download the file to your computer and then run it. I don't think it will break anything else, but you might want to set a system restore point just in case. Here is the link to the file:
<a href="https://www.yousendit.com/download/UW16MWZPdzhtUUZESjlVag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.yousendit.com/download/UW16MWZPdzhtUUZESjlVag</a>&nbsp;It will only be available for a short time, so donwload it soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Works 9 may run on Win8, it will not open all of the Works 4.5 formatted files, and it is has been discontinued anyway. MS has dropped Works. So even if you do get Works 4.5 running you might want to plan on transitioning to a different program.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Palcouk suggested if you don't want to pay for MS Office then you could consider libreoffice. Two other free alternatives; OpenOffice:
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.openoffice.org/</a>&nbsp; and Kingsoft Office Suite Free 2012:
<a href="http://www.kingsoftstore.com/kingsoft-office-freeware.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.kingsoftstore.com/kingsoft-office-freeware.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have your old computer with Works installed do a Save As and convert your word processing files into .rtf files and your database and spreadsheet files into&nbsp;.csv files. You can open those in most other office programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if you figure out a way to get Works running.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was told that&nbsp; Works 9.0 does everything that Works 4.5 did.&nbsp; It that true?&nbsp; I&nbsp;have also seen Works 9.0 Plus.&nbsp; What is the difference?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to download at yousendit.com like you said but Microsoft found a problem in the download.&nbsp; So I do not think it downloaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Despite all the indications that MS Works 4 (4.5a) does not work on Windows 8... it is working on my PC. &nbsp;I recently bought a new m/b &amp; Win8 to upgrade from XP Home Edition.
<div><br />
<div>I have been able to open wps, wks, and wdb files. &nbsp;(Haven't tried editing the spreadsheets or database files, so I don't know if some stuff doesn't work. &nbsp;But at least I can read the old files.)

Thanks for taking the time to post. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I understand you correctly, that your copy of Works 4.5a was already installed on an XP machine and that you updated that machine to Win8, and Works continued to function? You didn't have to reinstall or do a fresh install of&nbsp;Works? You said a new 'm/b'...did
 you mean a new motherboard and wouldn't that mean a fresh install of the operating system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like legacy software will often continue to work if previously installed and Win8 is an upgrade. However if you try to install the same software on a new computer with Win8, you may not be successful. Or did you do a fresh install?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again wrightjt.</p>

            I purchased a new HD, MB, optical drive, etc... &nbsp;Old OS (XP) is on old hard drive, Win8 installed on new HD. &nbsp;Works 4.0 installed fresh under Win8, then upgraded to 4.5a (y2k fix.) &nbsp;So, it's a fresh install, even though it required the old CDs. &nbsp;(The whole
 exercise was a royal pain--twice, once for each of the dekstop PCs I have. &nbsp;But MS Works install was simple... and worked.)

Thanks for the clarification. One more question. Was Win8 32 bit or 64 bit?&nbsp;To be honest&nbsp;I don't know if you can even get Win8 in 32 bit.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must admit that I am delighted to hear that you can&nbsp;run&nbsp;Works 4.5 on Win8, This is one of the legacy programs that I still use.&nbsp;In my&nbsp;opinion&nbsp;Works 4.5 was the best version of Works...it went&nbsp;downhill after that.&nbsp;Though I have Office I find that I prefer
 Works 4.5 for many things I do. For example I have databases that were created in 1991. It is also nice to hear of someone else out there that still appreciates Works 4.5. There are not many of us left.</p>

            Skyfire is the best browser, it allows you to use your phone exactly like a computer. There is a default setting in the phone but i can't get third party browsers to appear there.

<div>Agreed, the fact that these settings are even there would suggest that it was planned that the default apps be user definable. Unfortunately they can't be changed and as I stated in my previous post I just don't know whether this is by design, omission
 or flaw. Hopefully it will be resolved in a future firmware update, maybe even the v2.1 firmware due on Mon ;)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It would be great to be able to set Skyfire as the default browser as even in beta it's hands-down better than the built-in one.&nbsp;</div>

<p>how do you get these (any) applications onto the mobiles, do you&nbsp;go to&nbsp;the sites like you do on the PC and then download?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where&nbsp;are the settings for the web browser on the N97?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sorry for all the newbie web-related questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>There are different ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Downloading directly to your phone. Go to m.skyfire.com on your phone browser</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Through PC. Go to www.skyfire.com, hit the big red download button. There would be three options there, with one the method posted above. Option 2 would be sending a link to your phone, enter your
 number and country in the required fields. You will recieve a message on your phone with a link to open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Option 3 would be downloading the sisx/sis file direct on your PC. Choose the phone model you use and follow the instructions. After you have downloaded it, move it onto your Phone via USB or bluetooth, open it through file manager and it will install.&nbsp;</p>

<p>thank you chanchan05</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>option 1. seems the easiest.</p>
<p>i have put the website into my PC favourites, for future reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i was not able to access sis files last week when i was looking at the Biongo thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i will consider if the browser needs to be changed over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i found Default applications&gt; Browsing internet&gt; and all it says is &gt;Web. there doesn't sem to be anyway to change browsers although i guess that option would appear after i installed another browser....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Which protocols are used in configuration?<br />
Nokia Mobile VPN does not support L2TP/IPsec VPN, but instead it supports IPsec/IKE VPN protocols

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use VPN Policy Server, if such is installed in your network and your IT Admin has given instructions to use it. Otherwise, you need to setup the VPN Policy manually. You can find more info about VPN Policy at:</p>
<p><a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/nokia-mobile-vpn/compatibility-and-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/nokia-mobile-vpn/compatibility-and-download</a></p>
<p>Look at the step-by.step guide at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like said in another post, Nokia Mobile VPN supports IPsec/IKE VPN protocols. You need to check if that is supported in the VPN GW you are using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Get Microsoft Office Programs To Open&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, I'm really hoping someone can help me out. I've been trying to solve this problem for several days now and i'm getting quite frustrated. Anyway...</p>
<p>I upgraded to Windows 7 on a Dell laptop from a Windows XP HP Desktop computer. On my desktop computer I had installed Microsoft Office Home and Business 2010 Beta (the collection with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and some other programs...) It worked fine on
 that computer and I had no problems at all. I have installed Laplink to transfer my files/pictures/programs, etc from the Desktop computer to the Laptop. I have successfully transferred everything over to this computer...I think. But when I try and open the
 programs like Excel and Word my mouse goes to the hourglass like it's loading but nothing ever loads.</p>
<p>So I tried taking that verson off and downloading a new trial version (i'd rather have Home and Student anyway). It asks for the product key to activate it...I enter the key sent to me in the confirmation email and it says it's not a valid key?</p>
<p>Any clue how to get Excel and Word functional on my laptop?</p>

</p><p>Yes, I have cleared my browser cache for multiple browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, iOS Safari) on multiple devices on multiple internet networks.&nbsp; The issue persists; I am able to delete past search history, but I do not see an option to turn off
 search history going forward. I only have one Microsoft Live account.&nbsp; I have changed my default search engine to another provider while waiting for this to be fixed. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Smittychat,</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials - How to completely remove it</h2>
                    I need help in getting remnants of Microsoft Security Essentials off my Dell Dimension 8400 (it runs on Windows XP Professional)<br />
<br />
I removed the program itself a long time ago (probably a year or so ago most likely with Revo Uninstaller).<br />
<br />
I now just use AVG Internet Business Security Edition for my security needs.<br />
<br />
However, I have a very hard to remove redirection virus that every so often hijacks hyperlinks in my browsers (Firefox, Chrome).<br />
<br />
I've been running software like OTL, JRT, MRT and the like to remove it. These programs request that you close down all antivirus software while they are running. Accordingly, I close down AVG Internet Business Security Edition.<br />
<br />
However, I keep getting messages from these programs (OTL etc) that I'm running Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE). The message is that MSE is actually active and scanning for viruses!<br />
<br />
This makes no sense. I can't find the MSE anywhere on my system. It doesn't show up in Revo Uninstaller, the Windows Control Panel Add/Remove Programs Module or Task Manager. As I said above so far as I can remember I deleted MSE with Revo Uninstaller about
 a year or so ago. Revo Uninstaller claims to wipe out every last trace of a program including files and registry entries.<br />
<br />
I can only assume that somehow MSE is still lurking somewhere on my system in some hidden folder or in some other guise perhaps under another name.<br />
<br />
<i><b>So I'd be very grateful to hear from any forum members who've had a similar problem with MSE or can explain what is happening here. In particular I'd like to know of any methods/software that fully expunge MSE from my system. I've tried using MicrosoftFixIt,
 but that didn't work.</b></i><br />
<br />
I thank forum members in advance for any help they can give me. I very much appreciate your efforts. This really baffles me.<br />

<h2>            Silent icon on lock screen and glance screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Silent icon on lock screen and glance screen was disappeared before sometimes. I thought maybe they will bring it back with new updates, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>Is it a problem on my device? Or it happened on all devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's an important feature, sometimes I forget that my phone is on silent mode and with this feature I can see that my phone is on silent mode or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>

<h2>            How do I change the week number displayed in Outlook for Mac&#63;  &#40;version 15.16&#41;</h2>
                    <p>The week that spans 27 December 2015 to 2 Jan 2016, displays as "(Week 53)" on Outlook for Mac version 15.16, when I set the first day of the week to Sunday. Even if I set the first day of the week to Monday, 28 December 2015, the week still displays as
 "(Week 53)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other versions of Outlook allowed you to set the first week of the year, but I cannot find that setting in this version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I know the ISO standard does number this week as 53, but the company I work for is numbering the weeks differently, so my calendar display in Outlook will be off by one week for the whole year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I just out of luck, or am I missing some way to configure this version of Outlook to mimic the week numbering that I have to work with for 2016?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this functionality going to be added back to this Outlook version?</p>

<p>In Word, if you rest the mouse pointer in the left margin so that it displays as an arrow pointing to "north east" and then left-click, the first text line will be selected, as you have noticed. This is by design.</p>

            <p>There is no formula that will insert rows or columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a Macro that will take your list after you sort it and put a blank row at hour changes.&nbsp; All you have to do is put it into a regular code module and then edit the two Const values to point to the column with your date/time entries in it and to the
 first row with a date/time entry in it.&nbsp; Then you can run the macro from the [View] or [Developer] tab after you sort your list.</p>
<p>

&nbsp; 'note: 'Date/Dates means date time entry)<br />
&nbsp; Const firstRowWithDate = 2 ' change as needed<br />
&nbsp; Const columnWithDates = "A" ' change as needed<br />
&nbsp; 'working values you do not need to be concerned with<br />

    <title>OpenVPN Connect still not working in build 10074 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nhaling2xhale  say:</h3>
<h2>            OpenVPN Connect still not working in build 10074</h2>
                    Why has this issue still not been addressed? I switched from the "fast" ring to the "slow" ring after problems with VPN in the 10069 build and reverted back to 10064. Now I get build 10074 in the "slow" ring and the VPN issue is still not fixed? It seems
 to me like this is something huge that should be addressed. Any help on getting my VPN back up and running again without having to rollback for the 2nd time? I use the OpenVPN Connect for part of my business so it's crucial that it works.

<h2>            E-mails lost after account rename. Inbox empty</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Inbox is empty after renaming my @hotmail.com to @outlook.com.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried renaming and got a message saying the service was currently unavailable, but it appears my account was still renamed. No mails were moved however.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There's no folder on the left hand side of outlook.com with my E-mails and the E-mail recovery feature under "Deleted" gives 0 results. I did not get a prompt asking me how I wanted to save my old E-malis.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>All my old e-mails are currently missing and I'm not receiving any new mails sent to the old address (It seems they are delivered somewhere though as the sender isn't receiving a message about the messages being&nbsp;undelivered). Mails sent to my @outlook.com
 address are properly delivered to my inbox</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I get my e-mails restored?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>
<div><br />

            Good luck anyway. I got the run-around for months. Eventually I just&nbsp;did an "undo" on the account rename which brought back my old mailbox. I set up Outlook 2010 Connector and copied all of my mail to a local file in Outlook, then renamed my email address
 back (which generated a second, new mailbox for me), and used Outlook to copy all of my mail back in. Not the solution I was looking for, but after more than a month I realized Microsoft was not going to resolve this for me, and to this day I've never received
 a response from them that they have or are making an active attempt to fix my mailbox.

<p>The page you referred me to (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-to-set-up-a-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-Office-365-69f58e99-c550-4274-ad18-c805d654b4c4) got me on the right track.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of trying to bend stock wordpress to my will, I installed a plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/) that allows to send mails via SMTP. As such, I have created a mailbox</p>
<p>in O365 and use an authenticated user to send the mails. Which of course works without hassle. Should be out of the box wordpress functionality if you ask me, but anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for putting me on the right track.</p>

            <p>Hi Harry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have an issue with adding a Microsoft account on Windows 10 build 10240. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know the details below to assist you better with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Do you get any error message/code while performing the task?</li><li>Did you face the issue in previous builds of Windows 10?</li></ol>
<p>I would like to inform you that Windows 10 Insider previews are beta versions, certain features may not work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this situation I request you to perform a<strong> SFC scan </strong>and check if you can add the Microsoft account. It allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>

            I still have the problem. It happened on all builds. I can set up a local account and change it over to a Microsoft account, but then if I reboot the computer it comes back up with critical error, and Cortana and the start button will not work. So if for
 some reason I can not reboot.&nbsp; When I get it to work I like the operating system. The Browser needs some tweaking. I hope this problem disappears with the real thing. Thanks

            <p>Could you guide us through your install process?&nbsp; How are you upgrading to the new builds, have you ever done a clean install (<strong>don't do one now</strong>)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you install using a Local Account, you have to bypass setting up the Microsoft account.&nbsp; If you are doing that, does the system work normally while in the Local Account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been builds where you are already in a Microsoft Account even though it shows the option to log into one.&nbsp; I have not tested to see if that situation still remains in the recent builds because I don't want to mess up my installs right now.</p>

            <p>Cortana has always needed a Microsoft account to work...&nbsp; The Store should open and ask for a Microsoft sign in if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The symptoms for the problem I was referring to will, on the Account page, show you as logged in with a Microsoft Account, but still display the option to switch to a Microsoft Account.&nbsp; This may not be what you have.</p>

<p><span>Dear SharePoint User,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, an
</span><span>user needs to be a member of one of the following groups at the site collection level to be able to use SharePoint Designer and modify SharePoint content.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>Site Collection Administrators</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>Designers</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>Owners</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>Please first check if you have the corresponding permissions first.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>Meanwhile, I’d like to confirm whether the issue only happens in the specific site. What site do you want to open in SharePoint Designer 2013, a modern team site, a classic team site, an Office 365 group
 site and so on? </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, check the following to see the result.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Make sure that the log-in account in SharePoint Designer 2013 is the work and school account. If no, switch the account to see the outcome.<br />
2. Use Windows Explorer to open these 3 locations and delete all the files below. Then reboot SharePoint Designer 2013 to see the outcome.
</span></p>
<p><span>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Web Server Extensions\Cache<br />
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\SharePoint Designer\ProxyAssemblyCache<br />
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WebsiteCache</span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Some such issues may be related to the custom script feature in the affected site is not turned on. I suggest you do the following and then re-open the
 site in SharePoint Designer 2013 to check the outcome.</span></span><span><br />
<span>a. Download the SharePoint Online Management Shell from
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>b. Connect to the affected site via the SharePoint Online global administrator account with the following commands.</span></p>
<p><span>$adminUPN="&lt;the full email address of a SharePoint Online global administrator account, example: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;"</span></p>
<p><span>$orgName="&lt;name of your Office 365 organization, example: contosotoycompany&gt;"</span></p>
<p><span>$userCredential = Get-Credential -UserName $adminUPN -Message "Type the password."</span></p>
<p><span>Connect-SPOService -Url https://$orgName-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential $userCredential</span></p>
<p><span>c. Type Set-SPOsite &lt;SiteURL&gt; -DenyAddAndCustomizePages 0 to turn on the feature.

            You can't open "modern" sites in SPD. Another reason to stick with the classic version.

<h2>            CRM Email Router on-premise stuck at  &#34;STOPPING&#34; status</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>(We have CRM On-Premise 2011)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, <strong>I tried restarting MSCRMEmail Service but it always stuck to "STOPPING" status.</strong></p>
<p>The stop and start buttons became disabled that time that is why I waited more. But no luck.</p>
<p>As a resolution, I force stop this service using the taskkill and start the service again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would just like to ask if any of you encountered this same issue and what could be the possible problem? and the resolution maybe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly let me know your thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you :)</p>

<p>Hi GSC Christell,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this problem always occur when you restart the MSCRMEmail Service? If you see any error message when the service stuck to stopping status, please give us a screenshot of the error message for analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here is an article related to stop and start the Asynchronous Service for your reference:

<p>Hi Barry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, it happened twice.</p>
<p>First is when I manually selected the restart button.</p>
<p>Second is after our auto restart, using batch file that runs everyday through task scheduler, of Email Router Service</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to restart it and will give you an update about the error log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am just curious what might be the possible cause of this Stopping status.</p>
<p>Any thing would be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again. More powers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Christell :)</p>

                    I recently connected my phone to the corporate Exchange server. The first time I connected, I was informed that security policies would have to be enforced. I accepted, and was prompted to specify a PIN (Prompt after 30 Minutes, Simple PIN). When I entered
 a PIN and clicked done, I got this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Password Error<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alert<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An error ocurred saving password settings.<br />
The device then locked. When I click unlock, I am prompted for the PIN. I enter the PIN I just entered, and I'm presented with the password settings dialog again. I'm forced to change the password again, and receive the same error. If I try to use the same
 password, the device responds&nbsp;'Password policy settings require that you update your password at this time.'<br />
<br />
I've confirmed that the passwords I've tried meet the password policy that should be enforced. The password is saving, because I have to use the new password in order to unlock the device.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? All my photos and contacts are on the SIM, but I think my notes are still on the device, and I hate to lose them.

<p>Eric - I can't ever unlock the device. When I try to unlock it prompts me to change my PIN, then I change it, get the error saving settings, and it re-locks. Then I have to use the new PIN (that I just changed to) to try to unlock, and the loop continues.<br />
<br />
Linley - I haven't been able to find a way to change the security settings without unlocking the device. ActiveSync requires that I unlock it first, and that's where I get into the unlock/required-to-change-pin/relocked loop.<br />
<br />
Looks like I'm probably stuck resetting the device :( Thanks anyway y'all, I appreciate the brain cycles.<br />

<p>hi itservicedesk7048,</p>
<p>firstly, please confirm and check the following information.<br />
1. whether these users have signed in with another account in the office application.
<br />
2. whether these two entries are listed in the <strong>connected services</strong>. (under
<strong>file &gt; account &gt; connected services</strong>). <br />
3. if so, please check whether there is a “<strong>remove</strong>” option listed behind the services. you can remove one to see whether there is any improvement.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=59bc849c-0ed5-4ca1-838f-45b9a86d27cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d59bc849c-0ed5-4ca1-838f-45b9a86d27cd" /></a></p>
<p>if there isn’t a “<strong>remove</strong>” option or you can’t remove it, please capture a screenshot about “<strong>connected services</strong>” for our reference, we will continue to discuss the situation based on the update.</p>
<p>to insert a screenshot, please click on <strong>use rich formatting</strong> and select the
