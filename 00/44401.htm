    <title>Boot problem - Dell Inspiron&#47;Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Boot problem - Dell Inspiron&#47;Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am currently unable to start up my Dell Inspiron laptop. This started a few days ago when, after shutting down on the previous night, I turned on the laptop and it started to boot up but got stuck at the picture. The log-in box did not appear and, although
 the hard drive seemed to be working away, nothing else happened. Since then, every time I try to start the laptop, it just picks up from the same place and does the same thing. Because I cannot now close the laptop down and can only hit the power button, the
 machine cannot reboot from the start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried breaking into the restart with F2 and F12 and have gone through the diagnostics (with no problem found), I cannot resolve the issue, although I must admit to having little computer knowledge and don't know where to start. Is there anyone who
 can help me with this?</p>

            Hi Kev,<br />
<br />
<br />
To help you with your concern, kindly answer the following questions:<br />
<br />
1. What is the name of the diagnostics that you performed?<br />
2. What were the changes made on your computer before the issue occurred?<br />
3. Do you see any error messages?<br />
<br />
You can check the solution provided by <strong>Amit(Kumar) </strong>on this <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/windows-10-wont-boot/054b85d8-e1f0-41b1-ae33-669e49711ee2">

            <p>Hi Ariel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your questions, I would say:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp; The diagnostics performed were those listed if you hit F12 on boot-up. As I said, there were no problems found, so I assume that this indicates that there are no hardware issues here, just a software glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp; I didn't make any changes to the computer, and I am not aware that any updates were downloaded (which has caused problems in the past). I simply shut down the computer as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp; I don't see any error messages - all I can see is the nice random picture on start-up, but the machine never gets to the sign-in boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your assistance.</p>
<p />

            Thanks for the details. Try to boot Windows in <strong>Safe mode</strong> and check if you can log in. If that still does not work, we nee to perform a
<strong>repair </strong>on your computer using an ISO/installation disc to fix the issue.

    <title>How do I set&#47;change the default orientation when I flip the lid on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> granitestatecolin  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I set&#47;change the default orientation when I flip the lid on my convertible laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had done this before under Windows 7 and 8, and it may be the same in Windows 10, but I can't remember or figure it out: I just want to set the default orientation when I flip the lid (converting my laptop to a tablet). Windows always flips it to Portrait
 Mode, I want it to flip to Secondary Landscape (upside down). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this has nothing to do with "Auto-Rotate" which is all about using the accelerometer to set the screen based on which side is physically facing up. Turning that on and off works fine, but doesn't help with my problem. What I'm talking about is
 the default screen mode that is set when you rotate the screen on a convertible laptop where the screen flips around and folds down over the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still don't understand what I'm describing, this problem at least applies to the convertibles with a rotating pivot in the middle of the screen (the kind where the screen rotates and can flip back onto the keyboard so it becomes a tablet). Imagine
 that system is in laptop mode sitting on a desk. Now, without picking it up, simply rotate the screen and close the lid, so it is now in tablet mode. By default, this changes the screen orientation from Primary Landscape to Primary Portrait. Because Windows
 squashes all open Windows to fit in the narrower screen width in portrait mode and never restores them to their proper size when going back to Landscape, I almost never want to to use Portrait. So I want to change it so that the default orientation change
 is to Secondary Landscape (flipping the screen upside down, which would be facing me still since the screen itself flips when you rotate it to turn it into a tablet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I can't find anything on the Internet about this, I can only assume that my goal is unusual, which just seems crazy to me. I can't believe that I'm the only person who cares what their convertible laptop does when rotating the screen. Any help would
 be hugely appreciated. This is driving me crazy.<br />

            <p>I know that. That's not what I'm trying to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That sets the current orientation. I can also do that even faster by just pressing Ctrl-Alt+ an arrow key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm asking how do I set the DEFAULT ORIENTATION when changing to tablet mode. Currently, it has a default orientation of Primary Landscape in laptop mode (as you'd expect -- this is what all laptops have). But when converting to a tablet by flipping the
 screen around and folding it down onto the keyboard (probably equivalent action to removing the keyboard from a Surface Pro), the default orientation is Primary Portrait.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is that second default orientation I want to change permanently from Primary Portrait to Secondary Landscape (Landscape Flipped in the Display Settings), which is the same as Primary Landscape, but rotated 180 degrees. The point is partly that I don't
 want to have to set this every time I flip it to a tablet, but also and even more important that I don't ever want it flipping to Portrait on its own, because that mangles all of my windows even when it goes back to Landscape mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find where to set this. If I recall correctly from how I set this in Windows 8.1, there was also no setting to do this (not at all sure my memory is right on this), but rather I had to save my preferred orientation when I was in the tablet mode.
 I can't find where to do that either.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That must be an Insider build, because my system is up to date (on release builds) and is only at 10586.218.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, even if I had that and it fixed the problem, where is the setting to change the default orientation on flipping the lid? How do you set the default orientation? Frankly, if there's a way to do that, maybe it works even in the version I have and&nbsp;I

            <p>I finally figured out the solution, but this may only apply to my particular Fujitsu model (T904) or that plus a few similar models.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Fujitsu Display Manager</li><li>Go to the Dock/Undock tab</li><li>Flip the screen around so that it is physically in&nbsp;tablet mode (note this is NOT the same as "Tablet Mode" in Windows where everything runs full screen, this just means that the screen is folded around so you can't access the keyboard)&nbsp;</li><li>Set the screen orientation (and any other desired attributes, if there's something else you want to change when physically in tablet mode)</li><li>Press the "Save current profile" button.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>That's it. Now when you flip the screen so the computer is physically configured as a tablet, it will use the orientation you set, instead of the original default portrait orientation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key lesson here for anyone is that it is NOT a Windows issue, but rather specific to the tablet model. I don't have a Surface Pro or Surface Book to compare, but I'd curious how Microsoft handles changing the orientation when flipping the screen around
 on the Book. Maybe they don't.</p>

<p>You can do 3 either before or after steps 1 and 2. The key is that with the Display Manager open, having the system in Tablet mode, then change it to the mode you want, then save.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you never changed it to the mode you want. You can change it manually either through Windows display settings (right click on Desktop and select Display Settings, then change the Screen Orientation) or possibly by pressing Ctrl-Alt and the
 arrow keys (each key selects a different orientation, if you have this capability active).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the one you want, then save the current correct mode in the Fujitsu Display Manager WHILE IN TABLET MODE.</p>

<h2>            Icon labels has a background color.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Icon labels background</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am working with Windows XP Professional and am customizing my desktop.&nbsp; In the past, somehow, the labels which appear beneath the icons on the desktop were "transparent"--the type just floated above the image in the wallpaper.&nbsp; Now, there are little chunks
 of solid color with the type arbitrarily lighter or darker.&nbsp; How can I change the labels to transparent?<br />

            <p><span><span><span>Hi UtMansMan,</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community!</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>Based on the description provided it looks like the icon labels&nbsp;have the background color. This issue can occur if the settings are not checked correctly.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>Try these recommended troubleshooting steps and check if the issue is fixed.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may follow these steps and check if it helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a) <strong>Right</strong> click on <strong>My Computer</strong> and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b) In this dialog, click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab &gt;
<strong>Settings</strong> button under the <strong>Performance</strong> section.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c) Now <strong>scroll down</strong> to the <strong>button</strong> where you‚Äôll find a checkbox for
<strong>‚ÄúUse drop shadows for icon labels on the desktop‚Äù.</strong> Make sure that you check the box.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Also try these steps and check:</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) <strong>Right-click</strong> on the <strong>desktop/Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click the <em><strong>Desktop</strong></em> tab. </span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the<strong> <em>Customized Desktop</em></strong> button. </span>
</p>
<p><span>d) Click the <strong><em>Web </em>tab</strong> in. </span></p>
<p><span>e) Make sure nothing is checked in the Web pages list. </span></p>
<p><span>f) Make sure the <strong>‚ÄúLock desktop items‚Äù</strong> checkbox is not checked<em>.</em>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>If ‚ÄòMethod 1 or 2‚Äô doesn‚Äôt help, you may check in Display Options in Control Panel if High Contrast is selected under Accessibility. If it is selected, unselect it and check if the issue persists.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span><span>Hope the information helps. Please revert if you have any questions with Windows and we will be glad to assist.</span></span></span>

<h2>            Blu Ray App not available</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>yesterday i got my new Xbox One console. I wanted to try everything, so long it works fine but for the Blu Ray Player App.</p>
<p>As i inserted a Blu Ray Disc the store appeard and forced me to install the Blu Ray Player App. But here it becomes funny, as i wanted to purchase the app, the button was just in light grey and the text said: not available. The same for the media Player.</p>
<p>Are there any problems with these apps and Mircosoft is already fixing it? Or is the problem on my side?</p>

<p>I would very thankfull if anyone could help.</p>

<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>
<p>Restart your console</p>
<p>Check your network connection.</p>
<p>If it isn't still working, there may be a problem with the Xbox Live Service, but try reloading the Xbox Store (if you haven't downloaded the app yet), or try restarting your console again. If that didn't work, check your network again, that should help.
</p>
<p>If you are having problems, go to Settings&gt;All Settings&gt;Network&gt;Network settings, and tell me what your NAT type is, because that can help me find help for you.</p>

    <title>multiple errors on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            multiple errors on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - multiple errors</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed Windows 10 was not updating automatically anymore so I went into settings to do a manual update. When I opened settings the right hand portion with update, defender, etc. showed up but on the left hand side nothing showed up and after roughly a
 minute the settings screen closed on its own. After that I went into computer management/event viewer and found that there had been 176 errors today alone, computer was only on for four hour. Is there a way to update from Microsofts web page and is there a
 way to repair windows 10 to correct these errors?</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Not receiving any Xbox achievements playing games on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> awesmdiver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not receiving any Xbox achievements playing games on Windows 10 Redstone builds.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Ever since I upgraded to Redstone builds, 14XXX I stopped receiving any Xbox achievements while playing games on my PC.&nbsp; They work and I can obtain them fine on the Xbox One but when I play a Windows Store game, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Microsoft Solitaire
 Collection, Oxenfree or any other game. I get absolutely no achievements including not only locked one, but anything as simple as even kill counters, etc.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>For example, I just played Microsoft Solitaire on my PC with build 14316 and one of the simplest achievements to get is "First One's Free" where you basically just have to turn over your first card.&nbsp; Since I was using this game as a "test" I turned over
 my first card and nothing.&nbsp; No achievement notification popped up, nothing showed up in the Xbox app.</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>So, figuring now that since NO games are getting achievements it might be related to the Redstone builds as that is the about the timeframe when they all stopped by received, i.e. for me very early February.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then installed the Microsoft Solitaire game
 on a VM of build&nbsp; 10586.164 and upon logging into Xbox Live and playing my first game, no sooner did I turn over my first card, I got the action center notification that I received the "First One's Free" achievement but the achievement showed up in the Xbox
 app too.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>I had contacted Xbox support and they said nothing was wrong with my account, so it has to do with something in the Redstone builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else seen this type of behavior?</p>

<div>Also, this is on a variety of devices.&nbsp; My Surface 4 with Redstone builds do not work, but my other table with release, 10586, works fine.</div>
<div>I am going to update my tablet to Redstone to see if that changes anything, but based on when I stopped receiving achievements it is the same item I upgraded to Redstone builds.</div>

<p>On your desktop, right click properties, under screen saver make sure "on resume, display login screen" is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOT</span> checked. You can also disable screen saver there.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard and Mouse not working with Surface Dock and Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded to Windows 10&nbsp; I on my Surface Pro 3 with a Surface Docking station.&nbsp; My Microsoft Sculpt mouse and Ergo Keyboard pair has a dongle that is connected to the ports in the dock.&nbsp; The computer will not recognize the mouse and keyboard.&nbsp;
 When I move the dongle directly to the Surface USB port, they are both recognized.&nbsp;&nbsp; This issue did not happen with Windows 8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleting the drivers as well as the Mouse and Keyboard center and it did not work.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same issue.&nbsp; The only way I can get the docking station to recognize the USB dongle, is to power off than on the docking station.&nbsp; This only started happening this past month.&nbsp; There appears to be some patch that is causing the&nbsp; issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Deleting protected folders</h2>
                    Hi, when I replaced a dying hard drive, I saved the 'program files (x86)' folder on my desktop. I've now removed everything I needed from it and would like to delete it. I have managed to delete all the files in the folder and subfolders, but I can't delete
 the folders themselves. I've updated my permissions so that I have full control and I&nbsp;am signed in as the administrator on my computer, which is not on a network. I've been able to rename the folders, but when I try to delete them, it still says I need permission
 from the administrator. What can I do? Thanks!

            <p>The next thing you should try is to take ownership of this tree of files/folders.&nbsp; By default, Administrators are granted the "TakeOwnership" privilege, so while logged in as an administrator, open an elevated command-prompt window as before.&nbsp; When it comes
 up, attempt to take ownership of these folders using the following command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; takeown /F C:\Users\quartet1977\Desktop\fluffy&nbsp; /A /R</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above command will [should] assign ownership of the entire tree to the Administrators group.&nbsp; Once you have ownership, as an&nbsp;administrator user, you should be able to grant yourself access to the folders:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; icacls&nbsp; C:\Users\quartet1977\Desktop\fluffy /grant Administrators:F&nbsp; /T /C</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then after that, you should be able to delete the folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If "takeown" complains that you don't have privilege, then you need to check to make sure that Administrators are granted the "TakeOwnership" privilege...&nbsp;&nbsp; From a command prompt, type:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; gpedit.msc</p>
<p>When the Group Policy Editor comes up, navigate to:</p>
<p>&nbsp; Local Computer Policy -&gt; Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Settings -&gt;Security Settings -&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local Policies -&gt; User Rights Assignment </p>
<p>and in the right hand pane, look for "Take ownership of files or other objects" and make sure that this privilege is assigned to "Administrators".</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH,</p>

    <title>Cancelling Xbox live Membership - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cancelling Xbox live Membership</h2>
                    
<p>I have had an account for 3 years now which I have been trying to cancel the membership for, but I cannot do this as I don't have any access to the email because I have lost the password. I have tried many attempts of getting the password back of the email
 by answering the security questions, and trying to submit forms, but I have never succeeded at getting the email back as I don't have enough information to prove that I am the owner of this account.</p>

<p>So I was wondering how I can cancel this membership without having any access to the email.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but a faster way to speak to an Agent is to go to <a href="http://xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com</a> - sign in there if you can - then go to

<p>you should be able to cancel the account through xbox.com, but if not try contacting microsoft or your bank because I'm assuming your being charged for your xbox live account. &nbsp;If nothing I said helped then call and have your bank cancel your card and send
 you a new one. &nbsp;That should stop the unwanted transactions on your xbox live account. &nbsp;the account should revert to silver when gold runs out. &nbsp;I'm not too sure why you want to cancel the account but if your trying to create a new account or already have just
 leave your old account alone. &nbsp;Hope this helped a bit.</p>

</p><p>Let's ensure that the Task Scheduler is running. To do so, type Services in the Cortana search bar and press Enter. On the new window, look for Task Scheduler. Right-click it and select Stop, then Start. Also, manually check for updates by typing Check for

            Hello, I am trying to run the Windows 10 Xbox program in full screen mode. &nbsp;The controller used is irrelevant, as is the games. &nbsp;I just want the Xbox program itself to run in a full screen (ie no window) mode. &nbsp;

<h3> kidshamrock7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Terraria Sale Price</h2>
                    
<p>Yesterday (02/16/15) I purchased Terraria at the regular price of $15.00. Confirmation # 567172085748338977. Today (02/17/15) I find its on sale for $2.99 since I have a Gold membership!! Needless to say I'm disappointed I was unable to take advantage of
 the sale price. Is there anyway I can be credited back the difference or be given a store credit for the difference? Please let me know, I would greatly appreciate anything that can be done. Thank you.</p>

<p>
<span><span>However, if you are getting this error while installing the windows updates, try resetting the windows update components and check if you are able to install.</span></span></p>
