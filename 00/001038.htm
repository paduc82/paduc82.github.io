<h2>            File Size</h2>
                    <p>I have a student who is trying to open a Power Point file with 144 slides and approximately 12 minutes of video. It won't open. She says it is 5 gig</p>
<p>Is there another reason why it may not be opening? She was working on a Mac Book of some kind. I think the file is just too big with all the video and the computer can't handle it. I would appreciate any suggestions on how to make it work. It was a group
 project for another class. Thanks</p>

<p>Can the file be opened in other computers? </p>
<p>Can the file be opened in PPT Online?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In part it depends on which "Bit" version of Office / PPT they have installed.&nbsp; Until January this year MS installed 32 bit Office by default. So, if they installed Office before this year there is a good chance they have 32 bit Office.&nbsp; 32 bit Office applications
 have an absolute 2-3GB file size limit (the limit is imposed by max number that 32bits can handle, approx 4GB).&nbsp; 64 bit Office is limited by the amount of RAM they have on the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find Office "bitness", go to File menu &gt; Account command &gt; About app-name button. At the top of the about dialog it will display the Office Application name, Version number and "bitness" (32-bit or 64-bit).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if they find they have 64-bit Office check how much RAM they have installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Windows Task Manager, &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;SHF&gt;&lt;ESC&gt; shortcut. </li><li>Click on the "Performance" tab</li><li>On the left is a column of specifications, starting with CPU then Memory</li><li>Under the Memory title it will show RAM used / total, ie 5.9 / 7.9GB (75%).</li></ul>
<p>If they have a low end computer with only 4GB of RAM, that could be a problem.&nbsp; There is another setting "virtual RAM" that can help trick computer into thinking it has more RAM than is installed, but I don't know how that would work with a large file.

            We can't locate any of the following: Library, AutoRecovery files. So what I have done is capture the screen shot of the error message as well as the details about her computer. I am not a Mac user, but I do know Office 365 programs well. I have tried
 to follow all your directions from the link above and nothing works. Her hard disk has a name, but other than that, we can't find any of the items mentioned. Here is all we know...if you can offer more help, I would appreciate it.

    <title>e71, Starbucks WiFi, Browser Locks Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marc877  say:</h3>
<h2>            e71, Starbucks WiFi, Browser Locks Up</h2>
                    
<p>I have an e71 (North America, unlocked) and the WiFi works fine everywhere except at Starbucks, including other public WiFi spots like Panera Bread.&nbsp; Once Starbucks log-in page
<em>fully</em> loads, the browser locks up.&nbsp; Interestingly the problem doesn't start until the page fully loads, I can move the cursor and even type for a couple of seconds.&nbsp; I've managed to connect once, after a bunch of tries but haven't gotten it to work
 since and I'm not sure how I managed to get it to work that one time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>sound like there is some code or banner or likely, on that web-page, that causes the nokia browser to lock up.</p>
<p>you could try to clear the cache on the handset, before connecting.</p>
<p>Or, as others pointed aswell, try the free opera browser.</p>
<p>(or get your coffee somewere else...<i>😃</i> j.k.)</p>

<p>By and large I've found Nokia's browser to work pretty well although there must be something about Starbuck's log-in page that generates an error that the browser can't handle.&nbsp; I was kind of hoping that someone found a solution, it's not like Nokia phones
 and Starbucks should be a rare combination.&nbsp; I've tried SkyFire (that doesn't work either but I think it needs an established connection before it will load a page) but not Mini Opera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quite frankly I'm not at Starbucks all that often but when I am, it sure would be nice for the phone to connect.</p>

<p>is it a starbucks or a at&amp;t hosting script and/or portal that you are running into?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is starbucks and/or at&amp;t forcing you to use a portal, then at&amp;t can host the the script within the portal code in order to view your browser contents. clear your browser first since your browser hx would be visible.?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i would want to know how the portal is coded. could there be a third party script on the portal, until you exit portal script?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you are in a controlled portal, so you remain on that portal when you surf, are you held within&nbsp; frames of the portal window, ie like surfing with a proxy?</p>

            <p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for choosing Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update error 80070643 can happen for several reasons. The most common cause is a problem with the .NET framework installed on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .NET framework is a part of Windows that’s used to build, deploy, and run programs. Since multiple programs use the .NET framework, problems can occur from hard disc corruptions or faulty program installations, which in turn caused the update to fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the steps below and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.<span>Windows Update error 80070643 can happen for several reasons. The most common cause is a problem with the .NET Framework installed on the computer. Windows Update error 80070643 can happen for several reasons. The most common

<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3. Run the .NET Clean up tool from the link </strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Components-PostAttachments/00-08-90-44-93/dotnetfx_5F00_cleanup_5F00_tool.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Components-PostAttachments/00-08-90-44-93/dotnetfx_5F00_cleanup_5F00_tool.zip</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4. </strong>Right click on the Windows logo icon and select Command Prompt (Admin). Execute the following commands.</p>
<ul>
<li>fsutil resource setautoreset true c:\</li><li>cd %windir%\system32\config\txr</li><li>attrib -r -s -h *</li><li>del *</li><li>Cd c:\windows\System32\SMI\Store\Machine</li><li>Attrib –a –h –s *.TM*</li><li>Del *.TM*</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Restart the computer in Safe mode with Command Prompt.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold Control + Alt + Delete buttons together.</li><li>Towards the bottom right, click on the Power Icon.</li><li>Hold the Shift key and select Restart.</li><li>Select Troubleshoot.</li><li>Select Advanced Options.</li><li>Select Start Up settings.</li><li>Select Restart.</li><li>Choose F6 or the number 6 to boot into Safe mode with Command Prompt.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5. Redo the step 3 in safe mode and restart the computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 6. Run Windows Updates and check if it helps.</strong></p>

<h2>            Ms. Excel function is not working when I try to drag the function to other cells</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>today I wrongly pasted some contents to one of the sheets on my Ms. Excel.</p>
<p>The cursor went loading for quite a long time and the Ms. Excel icon was blinking and the whole workbook itself went black except the toolbar, so I decided to force-close it.</p>
<p>When I did that, the Save/No pop up came up so I immediately chose Save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I tried to open the file again and it took a longer time than usual to open.</p>
<p>When it opened, I could see that somehow the content I copied was pasted through the whole columns in Ms. Excel (from the top to the bottom columns of Ms.excel, so it was very plenty of it).</p>
<p>So I chose the "Delete Cells" option on those columns. Once again, it took a very long time, but when it finally worked I tried to continue my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the SUM function on some cells and got a result. Like usual, I would drag the formula to other cells below, but instead of showing the right results, they only show the first result from the SUM function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now whenever I use a function, the results for other cells will only show the first result. I have to Save the file so the calculation results would come out right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here you can see the CL through CN columns. I use the same formula on different cells and it shouldn't be showing only "68". When I do ctrl+S, they would show the right results. I wonder if there's anyone who can help me with this. I'm working on my undergraduate
 thesis and this is very inconvenient...</p>

<p>I bought&nbsp;two iview CyberPC compute Sticks a few days ago. The little PC came with Windows 8.1 and upgradable to Windows 10.</p>
<p>Upgrading to Windows 10 build 10240 works with everything however when upgraded to the Windows&nbsp;insider build 10565 and 10576. The Broadcom 802.11n wireless SDIO adapter and its associated bcmfw2 drivers do not work. This happened on both sticks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spend the whole weekend trying to troubleshoot this problem where&nbsp;I have downloaded the latest Windows 10 drivers with no success in</p>
<p>getting the Wifi to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My conclusions is that there must be a bug on both these insider releases. If anyone has managed to get it to work, please</p>
<p>send me the information.</p>
<p>

<div>
<div>Hi Akheel</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks for your prompt reply and suggestions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have done all that you have suggested in your email before,</div>
<div>I am an IT Technician and have done these troubleshooting</div>
<div>all the time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In this case, I have also deleted the drivers in Windows 10</div>
<div>that are&nbsp;being used by the operating system. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>These are the other methods that I have used.</div>
<div>1. Deleted drivers in Device Manager and uninstalled.</div>
<div>2. Extracted drivers from Windows 10 build 10240 and installed</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directly using the dpinstall.exe</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ( This method is the closes I got which Installs the driver but towards the end of the installation says it was unsuccessful,</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then going back to device manager the driver is installed with a yellow exclamation mark)</div>
<div>3. I have also tried to use the System32 drivers that worked in Windows 10 build 10240&nbsp;by using the</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Device Manager update and browse into a copied System32 drivers from this build.</div>
<div>4. I have gone into the Intel site and downloaded the latest drivers but unfortunately, this stick I bought from ivew&nbsp;does not use</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the same wifi adapter&nbsp;as the Intel Compute stick.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I personally think that the insider releases 10565 and 10576 does not support the broadcom adapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any other suggestions is most welcome.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If You could help me to figure out how to tweak the macro below it would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;The Macro that I have below, names the report based on Cell BC1 &nbsp;and adds the current &nbsp;date in the subject line, saves the report in a folder "Daily Report"
 on my desktop and opens up the outlook application with the workbook attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like is for the macro below to be tweaked so that. it will insert the email addresses from cell AX2 into the To: for outlook. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In column AX2 of my excel spreadsheet it lists the email addresses that I want to send &nbsp;my spread sheet based on the name of the report. &nbsp;(If it matters it's a formula that determines the email addresses in cell AX2 and all the emails are in that one cell
 AX2 separated by ;&nbsp;</p>

            It's quite simple really, the easiest way is to install the WLAN Wizard from here:
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4195015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4195015</a><br />
<br />
When you want to start browsing, open up the WLAN wizard and it will scan for networks available. It will then list the available ones, and will let you know if they are open or not (look at the icon to the right of the network name, if this has a lock you
 need the WEP/WPA key).<br />
<br />
All you need to do is highlight the network you wish to connect to, click on it and then click "Start Browsing". It will automatically set up the connection, and launch the Nokia Internet Browser for you. Dead simple!

Either use Nokia PC Suite where you will find an "install application" option or put mini SD in a card reader and transfer .sis there and pop it back in your phone and install from there.

            <p>Adware displays advertisements, usually in a web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Junkware simply refers to software from not well known companies) that the user could have easily avoided installing but didn't pay attention and flew through an installer from another program, whether or not this piece of junkware.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think that this necessarily includes software that is actually junk. For example, Norton and McAfee products are junk, but people want and use them because they believe that they work (except for the security scanner someone might get from Adobe
 Flash Player). Another example is that the Google toolbar, and Chrome-which we know is very widely used and loved-comes bundled with Flash Player, but because users don't realize there's a checkbox to decline it, they ask for help removing it because it's
 unwanted.</p>

<h2>            MicroSD Card and corrupted Excel files - cannot reopen files</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi All, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a 128gb Sandisk Ultra MicroSDXC UHS-I Card as the hard drive space on my tablet computer (Running Windows 8 Pro with 64-Bit Op System) was very low and planned to transfer some data to SD Card to free up space on hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I transferred about 7 gig of data (Office 10 word, excel and Adobe PDF files) from the hard drive onto the SD Card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All files transferred to the MicroSD Card and all files can be seen on that card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then opened a couple of excels files (.xlsx) and made changes and saved the work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next day I attempted to, but could not open the same excel files. I kept getting the following message: "<em>Excel cannot open the file .... because the file format or file extension is not valid. Verify that the file has not been corrupted and that
 the file extension matches the format of the file</em>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to troubleshoot the problem by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working through all solutions in "<em>Repairing a corrupted workbook</em>" https://support.office.com/en-za/article/Repairing-a-corrupted-workbook-7abfc44d-e9bf-4896-8899-bd10ef4d61ab;. I've also tried to open the file using "Open and Repair" but cannot
 repair as says the file is corrupt.<br />
</li><li>Downloaded and used several Excel file repair software, https://www.excelrepairtoolbox.com and http://www.excelfix.com/download.shtml;</li><li>Downloaded and used EaseUS Data Recovery Software to attempt to recover original data on tablet's hard drive;
<br />
</li><li>Uploaded the corrupt files to GoogleDocs to open and download but GoogleDocs could not open the files; and<br />
</li><li>transfer the files from the MicroSD card back onto the hard drive of my tablet pc.</li></ul>
<p>None of the above have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss as to what to do? I've spent a day trying to figure the problem out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also discovered the same issue occurs with PDF files stored on the MicroSD card. I managed to successfully open and close a PDF file, but when I attempted to reopen the same PDF file I got a message saying the file is corrupt and could not open the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be most grateful to hear from anyone who has had this problem before and has been able to overcome it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks kindly,</p>
<p>Troy</p>

            <p>You edited a file on a SD card. </p>
<p>
</p><p>That can be an issue. The problem you are having is usually associated with USB drives, but probably (I'm not positive, can someone else confirm?) applies to SD's to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>USB use a specific type of "flash" memory that has a limited number "write" cycles.&nbsp; To extend the life of the flash drive WINDOWS (not the specific programs like Excel and Word) first saves the file to a "cache" file on the local HD. Then it writes whole
 "blocks" to the flash drive.&nbsp; If you do not "flush" the cache by properly shutting down the USB before removing the USB, the file is damaged.&nbsp; What actually happens is that part of your file is NOT written to the USB and your file is corrupted.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically for Word, the file structure is setup in a way that the useless formatting **** is written first and the actual body text, the IMPORTANT stuff to you, is last. This means that the important stuff is what gets lost!</p>

<strong>Safely Eject the USB Drive When The Icon Is Not Displayed</strong>

<p>Subscriber David Wiesner wrote to ask about a USB flash drive problem he has occasionally:</p>
<p>I often find that the tray icon in XP for my USB devices disappears in the middle of a session. I cannot figure out how to safely eject a USB device when this happens.
<br />
<br />
I tried turning off the feature of the computer getting rid of unused icons but that did not seem to help.
<br />
<br />
Even so, if I cannot figure out an alternative to clicking on this icon, taking it away because it has not been accessed is problematic. So this is two questions...
<br />
<br />
The first is how to keep that icon from disappearing and the second is how to safely eject without using the icon.
</p>
<p>As to David’s first question — how to keep the icon (presumably the Safely Eject Hardware icon) from disappearing, I don’t know. I don’t recall having this problem when I used WIndows XP.
</p>
<p>However, perhaps the reason I don’t remember it is that I know how to “Safely Remove Hardware” when the corresponding icon is not available in the Windows Status bar (now called the Notifications Area).
</p>
<p>The first step is to find the drive in Windows. Open My Computer or open Windows Explorer (in Windows XP, right-click on the Start button and click Explore; in Windows 7, right-click on the Windows Orb and select Open Windows Explorer).
</p>
<p>Find the USB drive in My Computer or Windows Explorer. Then, right-click on the icon for the USB drive. One of the options is Eject, which is what you want to do.
</p>
<p>By the way, if you have any program or window open that is using, or otherwise has open,a file or folder on that drive, you will not be able to eject it (or use the Safely Remove Hardware icon, even if it was visible).
</p>

It is simple to turn off Windows Caching to eliminate the need to use “safely remove hardware” before unplugging USB drives.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
But there is no indication of how much negative impact this would have on the flash memory (which is why caching is turned on in the first place.
</p>
<p>Using a throughput test is one part of the story. Copy a bunch of small files in one operation &nbsp;to a USB device in both modes and notice the 10-fold time increase from cached to non-cached, in non-cached mode the changes to the folder are written
 multiple times for each file that is copied, also the bitmaps of the used blocks on the device is written over and over again.</p>

Purchased a Lexar SDHC card, my first, four years ago;&nbsp; five months later, all the data on the card was gone.<br />
I had other backup, so was not a crisis.&nbsp; Lexar tech support told me to format cards before using them.&nbsp; Did that and had no further problems.&nbsp; Purchased a larger Lexar card later on and formatted it before use.<br />
Have no problems with it.<br />
<br />
I use the cards for backup and avoid running programs from them.<br />

 and even internally between ourselves within our O365 tenancy, the emails are being flagged as spam by the outbound spam filter, presumably due to the programme name.&nbsp; Understandably we can't configure this filter, but it is causing a problem as recipients
 are regularly finding the emails in their spam/junk mail folders.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hi olliedc,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, I understand that some emails sent to external and internal are identified as spam, and from your thought, it might be caused by programmer name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SPF record helps to validate outbound email sent from your custom domain. Please let your admin check and update the custom domain
<strong>SPF record for Office 365</strong>: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/set-up-spf-in-office-365-to-help-prevent-spoofing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/set-up-spf-in-office-365-to-help-prevent-spoofing</a> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Office365 anti-spam filter is inbound filtering, you may also let admin check whether there are any relevant spam filter policy configured in organization.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let admin run messages trace to check if these emails matched any organization configurations:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/message-trace-in-the-office-365-security-compliance-center-3e64f99d-ac33-4aba-91c5-9cb4ca476803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Message trace in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the meantime, I’d like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. About “Emails containing a certain phrase being identified as outbound (and inbound) spam”, if all emails that contains certain phrase, no matter they are send to external, or to internal, delivered to
 recipients’ Junk/Spam folder?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. For internal emails, if an email is sent to an internal user and went directly to junk folder, would you please share
<strong>this email <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-internet-message-headers-cd039382-dc6e-4264-ac74-c048563d212c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
messages header</a></strong> as well as <strong>a full screenshot of this email messages trace results</strong> to me via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Messages</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. How many users are affected in your organization?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<p><span>Thanks for your information. I checked these message headers, in their “<strong>X-Forefront-Antispam-Report</strong>”, there’s a value:
<strong>SFV: SPM</strong>,<strong> </strong>which indicates that this messages has marked as spam by content filter on recipient side. Here’s the reference:

<p><span>In this situation, I suggest you to submit the emails to spam teams for analyzing:

<p>
</p><p>I've now also obtained some "internal" headers... where an outgoing email has been marked as spam with an SCL of 5, but using the Exchange "Outgoing Spam" settings of Office 365 has caused the message to be BCC'd to an internal recipient.&nbsp; I've PM'd you
 a couple of these headers in case they are helpful, and will add message trace screenshots to that thread shortly.</p>

<p>Hi olliedc,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed that these emails have some headers like:
<strong>X-Microsoft-Exchange-Diagnostics-untrusted</strong>, <strong>X-Microsoft-Antispam-Untrusted</strong>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>X-Forefront-Antispam-Report-Untrusted</strong> except for that internal message which was Bcced to an internal user. You can use Message Analyzer tool to check them:
<a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/</a> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To locate whether these untrusted headers caused this issue, please let your admin create test
<strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Transport rules</a></strong> to remove these headers, for example to remove one header like following, and check if it is workable:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fc15464-25eb-4afe-9c2d-d3dc3b56a119?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fc15464-25eb-4afe-9c2d-d3dc3b56a119?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may let admin apply this rule on one test account to check it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, about internal email marked as spam, if convenient, could you please also provide a messages header that sent from an impacted internal account directly to another internal account? And how
 many internal user are affected?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p><strong><span>I am using Outlook 2010 and the company that I work for, they dont use Microsoft Exchange or any other feature such as IMAP protocol. So, whenever I need to use Outlook outside the office, I need to backup PST and
 to use it in other place. I really interesting in seeing any solution that I can use PST anywhere withou IMAP or Exchange. I was thinking to use an internet address that Outlook allows me to connect it directly - setting by account mail. I am not sure if it
 is possible, since it seems that Outlook doesnt connect to the internet address. Maybe I can be wrong, please let me know what it would be the best solution for my problem. tks.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p>Outlook has to be on an exchange for Outlook web access to be enabled (OWA). To use OWA the server admin has to grant permission.</p>
<p>The workaround for this would be configure the same account where u want to use outlook, but the calendar and other items would not be available.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>You can configure the account as a live account and&nbsp;synchronize it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Get Media Content Now in MMS messaging Windows Phone Lumia 735. Will not open pictures</h2>
                    Windows Phone Lumia 735. "Get Media Content Now" is now where all my pictures were that are in my text messages. When I click on it, it says Getting media content and does nothing else. Deleted nearly everything on phone in case it was full. This did not
 work. Data Connection turned off, restarted phone and turned data connection back on. This did not work either.

            <p>This is really weird because I just started having the same problem starting a day ago.&nbsp; I have a Lumia 928 with Verizon.&nbsp; All of a sudden, all of my texts with photos or group texts are showing "Get Media Content Now".&nbsp; When I click the option, it sits
 on "Getting media content..." and does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that has changed is that I started using GroupMe.&nbsp; The GroupMe app can be set to use your SMS service and I wonder if that has somehow screwed things up.&nbsp; I have restarted multiple times, tried going in and out of Airplane Mode and Wi-Fi and
 Cellular modes.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; I have 6GB memory free, so I know it's not that.&nbsp; I will try deleting the GroupMe app and see what happens.</p>

                    <p>I am using&nbsp; HP Pavilion 15&nbsp; au 114tx&nbsp; .

 off mode or in sleep mode.</p>
<p>Can some one help me to resolve this issue</p>
<p>I checked the battery condition on self-diagnostic test and found in excellent condition. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your support to resolve the issues faced by me. &nbsp; I did what you suggested in your above mail but sorry to say the status remains same and battery is not charging while the lap top is in use</p>
<p>

<h2>            Win8.1 stuck to update at 70&#37; Temporary issue with a server 801881d0</h2>
                    <p>The thing is that last week i did install Upgrade Advisor, it told me to update, I have updated successfully then moved to upgrade advisor and said to go in Phone Update to install win10 mobile as final step, then it reached 70% and then the error. So i
 did hard reset started from the beginin and removed the SD card. Nothing sovled the issue, NO there is no problems with my Internet nor it's slow, quite on the contrary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to upgrade to windows 10 on Lumia 730, before I proceed with Upgrade advisor I need to update the win8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Did hard reset</p>
<p>- Removed SD card</p>
<p>- Then tried to update, stuck on 70% each time and can't proceed with Upgrade Advisor</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have optic internet 200Mbits, over Wi-Fi 100Mbits, so it is not my internet connection. Always gives me the error at 70% not further not at any less, did 2nd hard reset, nothing changed all the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is MS stopped updates for win8.1 ???? Are we still possible to upgrade to win10 ????
<br />
</p>
<p>Is there a way to install manually the package by downloading it on PC and then copy the update executable to the phone and update it ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to update to 8.10.14234.375 From 8.10.14167.221</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any outages with the MS servers ???</p>

    <title>Overwrite cells not always available. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffreymartin249  say:</h3>
<h2>            Overwrite cells not always available.</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I'm trying to move a group of data (names and numbers) from an excel spreadsheet to a word document in order to print out some labels. Normally I create the spreadsheet (from another program), then copy the cells I want to make labels for. I open a word
 doc, start a mail merge, and select the template for the labels I want to print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I paste the clipboard to any cell other than the top-left cell, I have the option to "overwrite cells" which fits one name to a cell so I can print one name to a label. Easy and pretty much exactly what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless I want to start at the beginning. If I select the top left cell, I cannot use the "overwrite cells" option. It simply does not show up as available. This means I have to start not at the beginning, but use the right half of the page before flipping
 the sheet over, which is just weird and makes it harder to print large sets because I have to run each page twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to find the "overwrite cells" option for the first cell that I'm not looking at? The only thing I can see are the icons below "Print Special" but there are no other places I can find to select different paste options. he options menu doesn't
 have anything like this listed that I can find.</p>

            <p>Hello Jeffrey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would need more information to assist you with the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the Worksheet contains cells that are protected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, then you may unprotect the cells and try again.<br />
<br />
You may also provide a screenshot of the issue for better suggestion.<br />
<br />
Provide necessary information to better help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here's a set of screenshots and another attempt to explain the problem. It's fairly straightforward: the overwrite cells option does not exist for all cells, which is annoying and means I have to print everything by halves.</p>

            <p>Having the some problem as you. Here is how I deal with it:</p>
<p>1. Copy cell from Excel</p>
<p>2. Paste these cell into Word table somewhere else other than top-left using overwrite cell</p>
<p>3. Copy same cell from Word table you used in step 2</p>
<p>4. Now you can paste into top-left cell using overwrite cell function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows phone keeps shutting off</h2>
                    Phone started shutting down constantly last week, then told me my SD card was corrupted, went to car phone warehouse who said I may have a virus, told me to remove sd card, went back on Tuesday told them its still shutting down. They told me to claim on
 my insurance, which I did, cost me £60. Got a new phone. It did an update last night. Then it told me my new SD card was corrupted, even tho there's nothing on it yet. now its shutting down again, 8 times in half an hour. Is it the update that's done it? Really
 annoyed if I've claimed and paid £60 for nothing

<p>Hi Helen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's get this resolved by performing a soft reset. The soft reset is the same thing as pulling your battery (on devices where&nbsp;that is possible). This method will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem
 situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press and hold the <strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and
</span><span><strong>Power</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should
 not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            No , sorry soft reset hasn't worked, it didn't work on the other phone either when that started doing it. The only way I can stop it shutting down is by keeping it plugged in constantly. Which is no good if I have to go out. The battery is fully charged
 too. It's not as if the battery isn't holding power because it will automatically restart again but as soon as i try to use it, it shuts down again.

            I've just tried another soft reset, but to no avail. I unplugged the power cable and tried to turn the phone on but it won't get past the windows start up. As soon as the Microsoft heading comes on it switches off again Ana constantly tries to restart.
 But fails at the same point. But if I plug the charger in, it works fine. As long as it stays plugged in.

<p>If a soft reset didn't work, we suggest that you perform a hard reset instead. The hard reset will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on.</p>
<p>
You can reset your phone under Settings: <strong>System</strong><strong> &gt; About &gt; Reset your phone.</strong> Make sure to back up all of your files before performing a hard reset. Go to
<strong>System</strong><strong>&gt; Update and security &gt; Backup &gt;More options &gt; Back up now.</strong>

<p>Ok, I've done the hard reset, and up to now it seems to be working again. </p>
<p>I just have two questions........</p>
<p>1 - if it does another automatic update and starts shutting down on me again do I have to keep doing the hard reset every time.
</p>
<p>2- while it was restoring my backed up data it said it would send me a code. I waited ages so stopped it until it came, and carried on setting up my phone, I've got my verification code now but don't know how to get back onto restoring my data so I can put
 my code in.</p>

<p>ok, it seems i spoke too soon. The hard reset didnt work either. Although I did seem to get a good 2 hours before it shut down on me again. It also came up with an SD card error due to the unexpected shutdown its just done.</p>
<p>the SD card error seems to be given before the shutdowns start to kick in. Although this is a brand new&nbsp;sd card and has nothing saved on it yet.

<p>If performing a soft reset and hard reset didn't work, we suggest that you use the
<strong>Windows Device Recovery Tool. </strong>You can use the tool <span>to fix software problems on your phone. It'll install the latest version of Windows approved for your phone and remove everything else, including your apps, games, texts, call history,
 music, and photos. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Start by downloading and installing&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Device Recovery Tool</a> (for Windows 10, 8.x and 7). When the installation has finished, start the application and the main
 screen will appear:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d537bf4-4b85-46a1-aa70-845e21b67036" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The procedure to restore your phone using&nbsp;Windows Device Recovery Tool is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Connect&nbsp;the phone to your PC (using the USB cable that came with the phone).</li><li>After a few seconds, the PC should find the phone and you'll see the Phone Selection screen. Click your phone in this screen to select it.</li><li>After a few seconds more, the latest available firmware version for your device will be shown. Click the '<strong>Install software</strong>'/'<strong>Reinstall software</strong>'&nbsp;button to flash your phone</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Device Recovery Tool will then download and install the latest firmware + OS available for your phone
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Note!</span> Your phone will be reset to factory status when using this tool.</strong></p>

<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have same problem with my 950XL, it goes blank and non responsive every now and again. &nbsp;It goes off from there and I have to take battery out and put back again to use the phone then it tells me SD Card error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the Windows 10 software has a major issue that hasn't been addressed in the updates that have come out. &nbsp;I have been contemplating wiping my phone and pawning it off to go back to iPhone. I really like this phone but the bug and technical support
 is really a burden.</p>

<h2>            Samsung Omnia II won&#39;t show Mobile 2010 application icons after otherwise successful upgrade.</h2>
                    I've tried twice to upgrade to Office Mobile 2010 onto my new Samsung Omnia II but although the applications (MS Word, Excel, etc.) seem to load successfully (they load and run files already saved on it) , no icon appears for any of them.&nbsp; Through Activesync
 (Explore) I see they landed under Windows-&gt;Start Menu-&gt;Programs-&gt;Office Mobile 2010.&nbsp; Thus, I can't access the apps directly since there are no icons available on the Omnia II screen as I see on the web for Microsoft Office Mobile 2010.&nbsp; Verizon and Samsung
 were both of no use.

            Mobile Office 2010 loads onto my Samsung Omnia 2 (WM 6.5) but cannot be accessed directly via any icon - as it leaves no icon anywhere I can find to actually get to the applications.&nbsp; Microsoft indicates it will create one, new icon from which the various
 apps (MS Word, Excel, etc.) are available as additional icons.&nbsp; Tried loading twice to no avail.&nbsp; The program Shortcuts loaded themselves under Windows-&gt;Start Menu-&gt;Programs-&gt;Office Mobile 2010.&nbsp; The 2010 apps are indeed in there but I can use them only if
 I attempt to open an existing MS Word doc, for example.

<h2>            OneNote Pagination Question</h2>
                    <p>The normal view in OneNote is the "endless" page in both directions, the Page Width is "endless" vertically but doesn't show the whole page width horizontally (compared to what you see in Print Preview), and in Paper Size, you can only populate one page
 at a time. I'd like multiple pages, but I'd like them to fit within letter page print boundaries. Is there any way to see print boundaries in normal&nbsp;view or Page Width (like the dotted lines in Excel) or to work on more than one letter size page per "page"
 in Paper Size views?</p>

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to open a folder which i created a few months ago with several documents in. The folder used to be in my documents but has now gone, now the only place i can find it is in recent documents (i had it open yesterday) but when i click on it, the
 following message pops up:</p>
<p>"The item that this shortcut refers to has been changed or moved, so this shortcut will no longer work properly"</p>
<p>I have also tried opening some of the files which i know are in the folder, from the start menu (under word, excel etc) and this message pops up:</p>
<p>"The item referred to by this shortcut cannot be accessed. You may not have the appropriate permissions."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate it if someone could help me out with this as i am desperate to get the work in the folder completed.</p>

    <title>OneNote web clipper, hyperlinks not active - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> computermom54  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote web clipper, hyperlinks not active</h2>
                    When I use the OneNote web clipper to clip a webpage, the hyperlinks on that webpage are not active from within OneNote. I have been trying to move from Evernote to OneNote for my research notebook. &nbsp;Evernote maintains the active hyperlinks. &nbsp;With OneNote
 I have to click the page link at the top of the clipped note to reload it into my browser to access the hyperlinks. &nbsp;Is it designed this way or am I missing something? &nbsp;I have tried on Chrome, Firefox and Edge using OneNote 2013 and the Windows 10 OneNote
 app. I love OneNote for just about everything else over Evernote. &nbsp;However, it would be so much more helpful to be able to just click on the hyperlinks from OneNote to access the webpages. Thanks for your help!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
There are four ways we can clip in OneNote Web Clipper. The ready-to-click links we recommend in OneNote Web Clipper are
<strong>Full Page</strong>, <strong>Article</strong>, and <strong>Bookmark</strong>.<br />
<br />
After clipping the part you want, press Clip to save it in OneNote. We were able to replicate. Can you provide us a screenshot for us to check?

<p>You are expecting a bit too much from the web clipper :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To replicate a web page on a OneNote page OneNote would have to completely recreate (render) it. That means OneNote would need to have&nbsp;<span>a fully working web browser</span>&nbsp;included (and always be online to show external content). So what you
 basically expect is that the OneNote editor all of a sudden turns into a full featured "Edge", "Firefox" or "Chrome". It doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The web clipper offers two workarounds for this problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If you clip a page using "Full Page" or "Area" a screenshot of that page is created and sent to OneNote. This is what your picture is showing. A screenshot, like any bitmap graphic or digital photo, cannot contain functioning links. Those are just blue
 on white pixels. The upside of this method is that you have a fully accurate representation(!) of the original website. The downside, as stated, is that its just a graphics file. It is somewhat like opening a page in your web browser and taking a photo from
 your monitor with your camera which you insert onto a OneNote page. The main difference is that with "Full page" selected the picture is taken from the complete web page including the portions currently scrolled out of view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If you use the "Article" option when clipping a page, the web clipper (in fact a mechanism on Microsofts servers)&nbsp;<span>attempts</span>&nbsp;to recognize the relevant portions of the page (like headlines, text blocks, pictures...) and build you a
 very much simplified version of the page excluding advertisements, navigation elements and so on. The text portions of this recreation may also contain links which then remain fully working (although always pointing to the original web location, so clicking
 on such a link will open the target in your browser, not in OneNote, as .... I already said it ... OneNote does not include a web browser).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's all the same with the Evernote web clipper, just that it's recognition of relevant web page content is sometimes a bit more accurate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am using the "Full Page" clipping function. &nbsp;When you do the same clip in Evernote, the hyperlinks on the page are active. &nbsp;You can click on them to get to the appropriate page in the default browser. &nbsp;My question was concerning the same functionality
 in OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the answer is that OneNote is not capable of having anything but a "picture" of a webpage on a clipped note. &nbsp;Hopefully, this function will become available in the future. &nbsp;I know in the time that I have used the OneNote Web Clipper, it has greatly
 matured, adding many more functions.</p>

 Automatic bullet formatting is in the center section.&nbsp; Found this instruction online and worked perfectly.&nbsp; Hope his helps.&nbsp; This is the first time I've ever done something of this sort ( gone online and posted an answer ).&nbsp; I usually just find the answer
 and go about my day but seeing as how irritating this issue was for me, I felt the need to do my part and try to help others.</span>

<p>D.A.</p>
<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is about Outlook.com (former Hotmail) not Outlook in Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following your suggestion:</p>
<p>If by "Tools" you mean the cog icon - it leads to a list of 4 options:</p>
<p>- General</p>
<p>- Mail</p>
<p>- Calendar</p>
<p>- People</p>
<p>None is labelled "Mail Format"</p>
<p>
</p><p>In "Mail" there is no "Editor Options" (nor under the other three)</p>
<p>Also, I cannot see "Proofing" or "Auto-correct" etc.</p>
<p>These look more like Word-based things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thanks for answering.</p>

<p>Hi Julian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you're using Outlook.com, we just want to clarify if you are experiencing this on other browsers too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>
