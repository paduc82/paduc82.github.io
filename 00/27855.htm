<h2>            Installing on 2 &#34;PC&#34;&#39;s</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm about to register for the free upgrade from W7 to W10, but I'm curious, can I try out the W10 preview on a Virtual Machine before installing it on my actual hard drive?<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering as if I happen to dislike W10, I'd want to easily return to W7.

            Right now, you can use Windows 10 TP on any number of computers you wish&nbsp;in any configuration. This is beta software and&nbsp;Microsoft wants as much input as possible.&nbsp;If you are planning to do&nbsp;the upgrade path from Windows 7, It's advisable that you create
 your restoral media and back up your data should you want to go back to Windows 7 down the road.

            If you'll pardon my frank response, Windows 10 is not finished yet. What is available now are only preview builds of the various stages of development toward the eventual Windows 10. They are free, but that doesn't mean they're right for beginners.&nbsp;

            <p>The free upgrade from W7 to W10 will be available when Windows 10 is released. You can't do it now. I presume you mean you are about to register for the Insider Program so that you can get the Windows 10 Technical Preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most would recommend that you install it in a VM or as a dual boot.&nbsp; Personally I have it in a Hyper-V VM, which means it's about 1 mouse click to switch between the host or VM OSes. If you upgrade your W7 to W10TP now you won't be able to go back to W7
 without doing a complete re-install of W7.&nbsp; That in itself is enough reason not to upgrade.&nbsp; Further MS advise not running W10TP on any production machine because there is the risk of it failing and destroying data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that there are numerous people running it on production machines, but they have good backups of everything.</p>

While Hyper-V is a great out of box solution because of its tight integration and robust performance, it does have certain limitations and complexities. In particular, it does not play nice with other Virtual Machine utilities including VirtualBox itself and VMWare Player if you have it installed. Also, configuring it is not as simple as VirtualBox. For instance, VirtualBox makes network connections easier, I don't have configure switches and configure Internet sharing especially for wireless networks, it does all of that for me.

</p><p>You can install Windows 10 Technical Preview on any number of machines. Please keep in mind, the Preview expires October 15th 2015. You will be entitled to upgrade to the final release.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How much will Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has not revealed all the details about pricing for Windows 10 yet, but they did announce that Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users.

<p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device

    <title>Can I transfer Money between my old &#38; new Microsoft Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I transfer Money between my old &#38; new Microsoft Accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two Microsoft Accounts, one is from an old Xbox profile, account that I no longer use and my current Microsoft Account which I created for my new Xbox profile and my PC.</p>
<p>I must have had unused Microsoft Points on my old account as I received an email from Microsoft informing me that the Microsoft Points have been converted to real money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way for me to transfer the money over to my new account before I close the old account, it is only $19.00, however that could buy me new Xbox videos, games &amp; music.</p>
<p>The old accounts' Xbox live feature has long expired and I really have no use for it any-more, where as the money is very useful indeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the accounts settings and can not see an obvious way to do this, I do not know if it is even possible but it certainly should be.</p>
<p>If anyone can please answer my question It would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely I am not the only one out there that has needed to do this, please help!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S Sorry for the Category, Product &amp; Topic choice as there was nothing to pick that suited my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Momma'D,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your query in this community. I just tested in converting an old 1997-2003 Word document on my side and didn't encounter any issue. Here is the steps I performed:</p>
<p>1.Go to File &gt; Info &gt; under Compatibility Mode, click on Convert.</p>
<p>2.Save this document is .docx format.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/converting-documents-to-a-newer-format-34ec742e-f0f9-4d95-bbe3-3ee8e30a86fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Converting documents to a newer format</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per your description, you didn't convert your document successfully, may I confirm have you receive any error message when trying to convert your document?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if it's convenient for you, could you provide us a sample of that old file, we will try helping you convert it on our side.

            Unless you're wanting to add features to the document that are not supported by the older .doc format, there is no particular need to do such a conversion. If the problem is with opening the file, that suggests it has been corrupted somehow, as Word 2019
 is quite capable of handling&nbsp;Word 1997-2003 documents.

    <title>E-mail missing from folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> computeruser22  say:</h3>
<h2>            E-mail missing from folders</h2>
                    <p>Q1.&nbsp; I have folders along the side - some folders still have the e-mails but some are missing or seem to disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp; Can you archive a bunch of them easily?</p>
<p>b. How do you get back the ones that are missing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Q2.&nbsp; I was going through my junk e-mail a week or so ago and clicked on a box and then clicked block at the top.&nbsp; Instead of just deleting that one e-mail, it deleted all of them.&nbsp; Some of them shouldn't have been in the regular mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q3.&nbsp; How do you get e-mail that goes in your junk folder to go to your inbox the next time?&nbsp;&nbsp; I've clicked on "wait it's safe" but they still go there.</p>

    <title>Using Outlook 365 rules to move email and change the &#34;reply - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike howell &#40;mch&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Outlook 365 rules to move email and change the &#34;reply to&#34; address at the same time</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have three different mailboxes attached to my desktop Outlook 365 installation.&nbsp; One mailbox is a backup I ask my clients to use if my main mailbox fails.&nbsp; The trouble is, once folk start using my backup address, they forget to use my main email address
 once it is online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The failure of my mailbox is very rare, but it has happened.&nbsp; I want to solve the problem of my mail going to the backup address once everything is "back to normal".&nbsp; So I tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I created a rule in Outlook 365 that moves mail received addressed to my backup email address to my main company email address.&nbsp; With suitable filters to move real client's mail only, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I reply to the mail after it has been moved, Outlook understandably sends my reply with its return address set to the backup address.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; To correct for step 1, every time I reply to a mail moved by the rule, I have to change the email's "reply to" address to my main address manually using the conveniently supplied drop down box.&nbsp; Very clever me things...except I forget to change the reply
 address...very often...and so the email conversation migrates itself back into my backup address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Is there a way to create a rule that not only moves the email from my backup mail domain to my main domain and at the&nbsp;<em>same</em> time edits the return address to refer to my main mail account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Have I missed something, but I can't find a rule anymore that moves mail between mailboxes/folders using a company's
<strong>domain name only</strong>.&nbsp; The rules on offer in Outlook seem fixated on taking an entire email address as the matching criterion, not the domain name alone.&nbsp; How would I set up a rule that recognises&nbsp;<em>xxx@greencaterpillar.***&nbsp;</em>as from
<em>greencaterpillar.***</em><em>&nbsp;</em>regardless of the <em>xxx</em>?&nbsp; Maybe I imagined it but I could swear there was an option to do this in the past.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dunno, maybe the facility was in Thunderbird or Amazon Work Mail and I imagined it was in Outlook.&nbsp; Maybe I should switch back to using those products instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours in good humour</p>
<p>Mike H</p>

<p>Hi Mike H,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your detailed description in your post. As you can see from this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-the-account-used-to-send-email-messages-2bdd8d4f-e30f-4ec8-88a0-406ce7b23cc5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>, since Outlook will send your message with the same account the original email was sent to when Reply/Repay All a message, so you can not create a rule to auto change the Reply/To address in Outlook client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, about your second question, you can set a rule like below picture to move all emails from the same domain:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f415a971-991a-4c71-b5c9-3e80b605e89a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f415a971-991a-4c71-b5c9-3e80b605e89a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, to meet your requirement, &nbsp;you can ask your client CC your&nbsp;main mailbox when sending emails to your backup email as a workaround. By doing so, you can directly check emails in your mail mailbox and click "Reply" to reply your client with your main
 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, if to let your client manually CC your main mailbox is not convenience for yo and you are an Office 365 Business user, then you can also ask your admin to help you create a transport rule to CC emails to your mail mailbox, to create a transport
 rule, go to the <strong><a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/?rfr=Admin_o365&amp;exsvurl=1&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;Realm=M365x040231.onmicrosoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Exchange admin center</a></strong> &gt;
<strong>mail flow</strong> &gt; <strong>rules </strong>&gt; click "<strong>+</strong>" and select "<strong>Create a new rule</strong>", then set the rule like below picture:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf4f7433-96b2-4801-8c4f-6dd2af2802c4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf4f7433-96b2-4801-8c4f-6dd2af2802c4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope above information helps. Please feel free to let me know if there is anything unclear or you have any further concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

    <title>Bad auto-complete addresses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cleverusername  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bad auto-complete addresses</h2>
                    <div>Version of Outlook is 14.1.4. &nbsp;Server type is Exchange.</div>

<div><br />
</div>
One user has the "friendly name" of his own email address showing incorrectly and we cannot remove the bad entry. &nbsp;I have searched all over the computer using a number of suggestions from this and other forums to no avail. &nbsp;The entry simply doesn't show up
 anywhere in any of the places I've looked.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried searching from the Home tab, in Contacts, a global search and nothing shows up, yet when you start to type his address in, that bad entry pops up every time. &nbsp;I even went as far as searching the Address Book native app on the Mac thinking maybe
 it was there, but no. &nbsp;Also tried a Spotlight search in desperation, no joy.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When the autocomplete puts the address up in the pick list, there's no X to delete it. &nbsp;What I need is to clear this cache. &nbsp;I'm frankly a little shocked that this is such a pain to deal with.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Any help is greatly appreciated.</div>

<h3> rosemary8019  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Microsoft office Home &#38; Student 2010 is locked up on Word.</h2>
                    <p>It locked up when pulling in a template/macro from Avery for me to create business cards.&nbsp; I have system directions to resolve this.&nbsp; HOWEVER, I cannot access Word to complete the solution.&nbsp; How can I get to Microsoft Word to get to the Trust Center to enable
 macros?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HELP solution says to go to File, Options, Trust Center, Trust Center settings, Macro Settings, Enable all macros.&nbsp; MY PROBLEM is that Word is locked up when I open it with the file open I was working on along with a dialog box saying:&nbsp; "The Macro cannot
 be found or has been disabled because of your macro security settings."&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted the file through documents on set up, but that did not resolve it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have gone through the trust center for the other Office Home &amp; Student programs and performed these steps just fine.</p>
<p>Word is locked up so that I cannot even click on file.</p>
<p>In fact, once I open Word, the file continually shows up with the same dialog box (shown above), AND Word will not close.&nbsp; I have to do a forced shut down every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>What you may be looking for is "SmartArt".&nbsp; Go to Insert tab &gt; Illustrations group &gt; SmartArt command.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the list of "graphics" one of the categories is "Matrix". The problem is they are limited to 4 entries, except for the last one, "Cycle Matrix". That allows 4 entries, each with a block for additional bullet text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the File menu &gt; New pane, if you search for "Matrix"I found only one "template" which shows a SmartArt.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Publisher 11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edwardjackson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Publisher 11</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone tell me why the following occurs and a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only in a few of a total of 228 web-pages, when I save the HTML, the format of these pages is ruined. This necessitates creating another .htm page from a .pub backup each time I want to work on it in the future. I use windows xp and office 2003. Admittedly
 both are now dated, but I have no problems with 98-99% of pages, so why only in a few?
</p>
<p>

<p>Publisher does the best it can when it converts the pages to HTML format but not all print format has a accurate conversion. Simply put, Publisher does choke on some print formatting. And yes, if you want to change your web then you need to make the change
 in the original .pub file and generate new code...unless you want to learn how to edit the code directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix is to change the formatting or layout of the page to something that can be converted to HTML. If you want help figuring out what is breaking the page and how to fix it, then post links to each page where you are having the problem and provide details
 as to what is the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please state what browser you are using. In the past if a Publisher web could be made to work and look right in both IE and Firefox it enjoyed good cross browser compatibility.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSFT started deprecating the web building functionality as of Pub 2010 so you have no choice but to use older versions of Publisher if you want to build webs. Personally I prefer Publisher 2000 because it produces different HTML code that I find easier to
 work with...to make cross browser compatible. And FWIW I also use Pub 2003 for print work on several WinXP machines and one Win7 machine, so don't feel like the lone ranger. Most users felt that Publisher started going down hill after Pub 2007. Pub 2003 will
 run on Win10, so hold on to your installation media and key code:</p>

<div><span>- Office 2007 and newer are/were 'certified' to be compatible and Andre Da Costa found all versions back to 2000 would run with the exception of Outlook 2000.</span></div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With that said most people should be finding alternatives to Publisher for web building as by Publisher 2016 the web building functionality has been pretty much hobbled.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As you are saying u didn't have any security on but Windows defender is &nbsp;on, in this case yes it can be possible if any third party anti-virus is not installed then by default Windows defender gets enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please confirm what is locked by the password ?</p>
<p>Is it you are locked out of system, ?</p>
<p>When you say &nbsp;<em>I have </em><em>far too many errors so I am unable to update the program

            I have Web Root it's my window defender the program is locked by an unknown password. The notifications from windows that I do not have window defender on. I can't upgrade or send any information to Microsoft. The security system firewall is on as well
 as my webroot. All the errors they show is my windows defender isn't&nbsp; able upgrade. Thanks

<h3> crescent786  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I save a Word Document as PDF, there is a Shadow Font &#40;grey&#41; behind Arabic text</h2>
                    I was using Windows Vista and Office 2007 for creating documents that contained both English and Arabic Text.
<div>I saved these docs in PDF mode and then uploaded them to ScribD.</div>
<div>I had no problems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently, I changed to Windows 7 and Office 2010, now when I save these documents as PDF, I see no problem, but when they are uploaded to Scrib D, I find that there is a sort of grey shadow Arabic Letters, behind the Arabic text.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What should I do?</div>
<div>Whilst saving the document in PDF format I even experimented with the few options.&nbsp;</div>
<div>But then the problem persisted.</div>
<div>I even selected the option (Under PDF options) 'ISO 19005 - 1 Compliant'</div>
<div>No change.</div>
<div>What should I do?</div>

<p>As you were able to save the file as .pdf from Word and since you are unable to view the pdf file normally in Scrib D, you may have to contact the software vendor for further assistance.</p>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>
<p><span><span>Hi
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I have some serious problems when I try to using my new Microsoft Lumia 535 (Dual Sim) with my Microsoft account and useful apps as outlook, calendar and people (my contacts). In
 email + accounts there is a message ‚Äú‚Ä¶. is not updated‚Äù. When I click it another message appear ‚Äúerror outlook ‚Ä¶ is not possible synchronize with account dub402-m.hotmail.com‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ error code 85010014‚Äù. When I click on outlook apps in start screen the message
 is ‚Äúthere are not messages‚Äù then I try to synchronize folder but I take the same information in step 1. Furthermore I can send message! But there are not anything in the sent folder. When I click on calendar apps I cannot see the works which I can see when
 I connected via my computer (win 8.1). Finally when I connect my Microsoft account via www.hotmail.com and then clicking on calendar in the next screen I have two options: a. adjust calendar in your phone but not work b. going to site calendar.live.com for
 computers and work. But the most important is the absence of my contacts in the people and not synchronized phone contacts.</span></span></p>

 solution to me was to applied hard reset to Lumia. And this is the most interesting and serious problem: What will happen with my contacts?&nbsp;Remind you that my account not updated and the only way&nbsp;for backup is the cloud! I had gone in Nokia store but the employee
 did not able to take backup of my contacts...</p>

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Really sorry but I couldn't find any relevant relevant asnwers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that I have to Contacts folder for my email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Contacts</p>
<p>2. N√©vjegyek</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to delete the "Contacts" one, but I simply can't when I go to File-&gt;Account Settings-&gt;Contacts and click on delete, then it disappears from that list, but nothing else changes, and within a few secs when I go again to the Settings, then it is there
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to delete the folder from the Contacts page, but when I right click on the item, then the Delete Folder menu is disabled.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi D√∂r√∂gdi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many accounts did you configure in the Outlook 2016 client? If you have configured multiple accounts, every accounts will have a Contacts folder like the screenshot. From the screenshot you captured, the delete option is not available, which means that
 the Contacts folder is the default folder and it can not be deleted. It is just like the Inbox folder in the mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you only configured 1 account in the Outlook client, please check if the delete option is available to ‚ÄòN√©vjegyek‚Äô folder. If it is a folder you created, the option will be available. But the Contacts folder is not able to be deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you only configured 1 account in the Outlook client and the delete option is not available for both the 2 folders. It may be a server issue during migration or localization. You can see this article for reference:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4058701/contacts-folder-empty-and-your-contacts-are-in-a-different-folder-in-o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Contacts folder empty, and contacts are in a different folder in Outlook for Office 365</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know the detailed scenario for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>We would appreciate it if you could provide more details about this issue. Can you tell us if this is the first instance that your wife can't send an email to this specific contact? What is the email provider of this contact? Also, can your wife see
 the sent message on her sent items? </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a possibility that the message can be on the spam folder. Has your wife asked her contact to check his/her spam folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. Thank you. </p>

            <p>Yes it just started recently. Normally communication back and forth has been fine. The recipient uses Outlook as well. Not sure who the ISP is. His ability to receive email from me is fine and my wife and I live in the same house, use the same ISP and both
 have Outlook. (Mine is a different version and I have Win7)</p>
<p>He is not having issues with any other contact save my wife.</p>
<p>Interestingly the recipients wife who lives in the same house with him, uses the same ISP and has the same domain name with her email is able to receive my wife's emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes my wife's sent emails show in the sent folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No they are not in the recipients SPAM folder.</p>

</p><p>In the new Skype, there's no option to delete the entire chat conversations all at once. You can do it one by one: Right- click the contact you want to delete the conversations and select
<strong>Delete conversations</strong>.&nbsp;However, if you're using the classic Skype, simply click
<strong>Tools &gt; Options &gt; Privacy &gt; clear history.</strong> It will delete the chat conversation of all your contacts permanently.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Alright. This took me a long time, but I was finally able to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SHORT VERSION:&nbsp;</strong>For some reason, when I went to&nbsp;<strong>outlook.com</strong>, there was a&nbsp;<strong>cHAT</strong>&nbsp;folder on the left side. I right-clicked on that folder, pressed&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong>, then sync worked perfectly fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3cc1a4c-409b-4db8-8d5e-d4e2da8d9b30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3cc1a4c-409b-4db8-8d5e-d4e2da8d9b30" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>LONG VERSION:&nbsp;</strong>If you really want to know how to solve this problem, or the short version didn't fix/describe your issue, here's some troubleshooting steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<strong>outlook.com</strong>.</li><li>Click the&nbsp;<strong>settings&nbsp;</strong>gear icon in the top right corner. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c80757c-10db-4448-b413-7ae2061ecb2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c80757c-10db-4448-b413-7ae2061ecb2d" /></a></li><li>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Options</strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5318bf05-16e5-4b7b-bc51-b5870efa56be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5318bf05-16e5-4b7b-bc51-b5870efa56be" /></a></li><li>On the left side of the screen, choose the&nbsp;<strong>General&nbsp;</strong>tab, and select the&nbsp;<strong>Mobile devices</strong>&nbsp;category. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c08ea35-cb88-4cb3-9c19-9dd31358b495" target="
 you need to check another in the list on the left, hit close and keep trying until you find the non-syncing device. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/854dcca7-3e91-4705-97dd-7668b7dccac3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/854dcca7-3e91-4705-97dd-7668b7dccac3" /></a></li><li>Select the non-syncing device in the list and press the&nbsp;<strong>Start logging</strong>&nbsp;icon (looks like a piece of paper with an arrow pointing to the right). &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c410dec-ee85-4fa7-88a8-7a4407ebda0e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c410dec-ee85-4fa7-88a8-7a4407ebda0e" /></a></li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Yes&nbsp;</strong>in the resulting Device synchronization log. This lets you know that the resulting log will be emailed to your account.</li><li>
 file should open it.</li><li>If you are using multiple syncing devices (as stated previously), there may be multiple logs. In this case, for each log, try using Ctrl+F to search for the name or model of your non-syncing device. Start by using Ctrl+F with "model" or "friendlyname".
 Make sure you're looking at the right log for the non-syncing device.</li><li>If you are unable to find the name or model of your non-syncing device in the log, use Ctrl+F and search for "X-FE-ClientIP". There should be an IP address listed on the same line (four numbers separated by a '.'). In your web browser, go to&nbsp;<strong>whatismyipaddress.com</strong>.
 Confirm that both the given IP addresses are the same.&nbsp;<strong>NOTE: This will only work if your non-syncing device is the only one connected to your local network (ex. if you also have a syncing desktop connected to the same network as a non-syncing laptop,
 it will likely have the same IP address as the laptop)</strong>.</li><li>In my case, while looking through the non-syncing log for indications of error, I found a folder that is supposed to sync with NULL characters in the&nbsp;<strong>ServerId&nbsp;</strong>field. It looked like this in Sublime Text 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23de302a-c319-40a2-b47f-d7f82e68f260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23de302a-c319-40a2-b47f-d7f82e68f260" /></a>&nbsp;

 and selecting&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong>. After I did this, mail was able to sync normally on my non-syncing device. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d47c1512-58db-4eea-ab2a-5b7e7601f8c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d47c1512-58db-4eea-ab2a-5b7e7601f8c7" /></a></li><li>If your logs don't show a folder that is having issues, unfortunately this is where you'll have to pick up the troubleshooting. Maybe try using Ctrl+F and search for the word "error", or just look for something else in the log that seems out of place like
 the NULL character patterns shown above. Even though Microsoft Support has been failing us miserably with this issue, if you're able to contact their support team via chat or email and provide them the log file they might be able to figure out what the issue
 is. Hope this helps!</li></ol>

<p>Came home late last night to find the&nbsp;fans working laboriously&nbsp;on this laptop. WU still claimed up to date. Restarted&nbsp;Windows 10 and lo and behold WU finds&nbsp;new build.&nbsp;Win 10 now up to date with Build 14986.&nbsp;I'm not sure it was anything I&nbsp;did. The other day
 I even tried switching to the slow ring and&nbsp;switching back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish WIn 10 would just tell me it's not ready to update itself, instead of claiming it's up to date.</p>

    <title>Hiding owner&#47;lock files in Office 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alanmackay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hiding owner&#47;lock files in Office 2010</h2>
                    <p>We use a NAS box for all our file storage (Buffalo LS-XHL).&nbsp; Whenever you open any office file on the network (e.g. test.docx), a second file is created in the same folder (~$test.docx).&nbsp; I know&nbsp;that these are "owner files" as described here
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/211632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/211632</a></p>
<p>I also know that these are created even when the file is stored locally, however when it is a local drive the owner file is hidden...so no problems.</p>
<p><br />
However, on the network, the owner files are all viewable even if "hide hidden files" is enabled.&nbsp; My question is therefore: why aren't these given the hidden attribute on the NAS box?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Alan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE: This is an issue related to the NAS box and not to microsoft office.&nbsp; I've posted on the Buffalo tech forums and suggested a firmware change to Buffallo but I notice that many other users have also done this with no success!</p>

            You cannot stop Word from creating them, but whether or not they are hidden is a user setting related to Windows Explorer. Personally I prefer to know what files are lurking in the filing system, hidden or otherwise, as it can help with trouble shooting
 if it is noticed that these files are not removed when Word has finished with them.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I thought it may be because my phone number is now associated to multiple accounts. Is there a way of removing this across all accounts without having to go into each one individually. I'm not even sure if this is the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            windows media player</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I have had nothing but problems with windows 10 media player since I've had windows 10. When I try to stream music to my Blu Ray sometimes it works. most of the time I have to delete the device and
 add it all over again. When I do get it to work it sometimes will only play 1 song and then stop. Sometimes if I delete the playlist and reload it, it will play all songs, if not I have to delete the device and start all over again. Sometimes (rarely) shuffle
 works, most of the time it doesn't. I was ripping cd's and it was corrupting the song names and putting them in the wrong order or just not listing some of the song names giving track numbers instead. I have 2 devices with Windows 10 they both have the same
 type of problems. I just purchased Windows 10 for this computer 2 weeks ago and media player worked ok( it didn't shuffle and wouldn't stream playlists all the time) for the first few times I used it. And now it's mostly problems. I've gone to your websites
 and been given http numbers that link me to sites that seem to have nothing to do with this problem. I've read many forums say to do this and that, but they don't work. There seems to be a lot of agreement that this is an issue with Windows 10. I really want
 this problem fixed, but what I don't want is to get run all over internet to websites for the next 2 hours trying to get this fixed.Yesterday I spent over 2 hours trying to find help and ended up on the Microsoft Customer Support. I typed this letter into
 the reply box and received a response that I had contacted an Unmonitored Alias whatever the **** that is, and that I needed to contact Support Microsoft.com. With a name like Microsoft Customer Support one would think you could get help there. Why would anyone
 would put a response box on a support webpage that's UNMONITORED? &nbsp;It really isn't too hard to understand why so many people are totally pissed off about this. It seems that the goal here is to ignore the real problem (Windows Media Player) and just run people
 all over the internet until they're too sick and tired to deal with it anymore. How totally unprofessional. Just muster up the guts to admit there is a problem and fix it. My frustration with this is way off the charts and I really don't to hear about how
 sorry you are I just want the problem fixed NOW.</span>
