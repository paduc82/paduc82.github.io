            <p>Hi PTWoon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highest probability is that, even if you did uninstall MSE fully and properly (I tend to prefer the manual methods when I get into problems where being SURE is more than normally important), you probably have other conflicting products still installed
 (or you are infected already in which case you wouldn't want to re-install MSE yet even if it worked).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could try that, but frankly, I'd start with the next two paragraphs first and then stick that in before the "If you still have problems" part just to rule it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with <font color="#0072c6"><a href="http://experts.windows.com/w/experts_wiki/156.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://experts.windows.com/w/experts_wiki/156.aspx</a>
</font><font color="#333333">and make sure you have nothing installed (even if not used or ever used or even just a trial) that needs to be fully uninstalled AND removed (since remnants that cause this problem are notorious with AV programs).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please pay particular attention to <span><span><font><b>AppRemover </b>(which can scan for and remove multiple anti-malware products):
</font></span></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 102, 170, 1)">http://www.appremover.com</span></strong></span></a>.&nbsp; Also, check the FREE version of Revo
<a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a>&nbsp;to see if it finds any AV programs that need removal and then not only use Revo but find the program removal tool just to be sure from the link (or related links) in the prior paragraph
 or the program web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and reboot between every uninstall/removal effort to be sure it "took" - even the ones for MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have problems, then we'll need to discuss malware removal in more detail - but let's check this first and then move on to that only if necessary.&nbsp; After that, it just becomes a matter of making sure all the installation steps are being followed
 (including updating all else before starting and checking the date and time and so on) - but we'll get to that if it comes to that (and I don't think it will).&nbsp; I think you've most likely missed something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not quite ready to suggest you abandon MSE simply because it's being difficult.&nbsp; While some other product may seem to work (or actually may totally work just fine - that's totally possible too), the "warning" that MSE isn't working may be lost in the
 process and you may miss an existing potential conflict or infection that might pop in on you later (and even had time to grow "behind the scenes" in the meantime).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the fully manual removal procedures for MSE described in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">
<font color="#0072c6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</font></a>.&nbsp; Forget the Mr. Fixit or the standard Control Panel uninstall - do the manual steps since that's the best
 way to be sure (and we wouldn't have them there if the more automated methods always worked perfectly and without exception).&nbsp; Then reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, we can next try to verify your system is free from infections or just try again to install MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose to just try another installation, please follow these instructions to the letter
<a href="http://experts.windows.com/w/experts_wiki/89.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">http://experts.windows.com/w/experts_wiki/89.aspx</font></span></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose to check for infections, rather than do it yourself, let's be sure and let the experts do it for free.&nbsp; It may take a bit longer (but not too long I don't think if you spend time seeking one with good current response times) depending on their
 queue, but you'll be sure when they're done (and they may even help you install MSE as part of it though no guarantees there).&nbsp; I'll give you 5 choices so you can find one with the best response rate (all&nbsp;have fully certified expert specialists you can trust).</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t make OneDrive Personal and Business work on the same laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a brand new Surface 6 running Windows 10 Pro, v1809.</p>
<p>I am logged in to my organisation's OneDrive. This appears to work properly, with all the syncing and availability through web and Windows Explorer running perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a personal OneDrive account. I can log into that over the web and access my files that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what I want is to have both business and personal available via windows explorer and to have both appear in the task bar. If I go from the web login and click "Get the OneDrive apps" then I can click "Start OneDrive" and I do see two icons in the task
 bar, but the business one is blue and the personal one is grey. </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5edbea7c-46ed-4336-98a5-22d9d5d74ffa?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5edbea7c-46ed-4336-98a5-22d9d5d74ffa?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If I hover over the grey one it pops up with "OneDrive Not signed in". </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9e89d78-1c48-4e54-902e-df1736d3e129?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9e89d78-1c48-4e54-902e-df1736d3e129?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on it I see the large popup that says "OneDrive isn't connected". It then invites me to sign in. I put my personal email in to log in and it thinks for a moment and then closes the popup, but it doesn't ask for a password and nothing changes.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5bb5d63e-7206-40e1-b379-be81ae83843e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5bb5d63e-7206-40e1-b379-be81ae83843e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can create a completely separate login to the PC and use my personal Microsoft account to log in, in which case I can access and sync my personal OneDrive. But then I have to log out and log in as a different user. This is not what I want. I want to have
 both available when I log in to the PC using my work account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have seen screenshots of other people who have achieved this. They have a blue (work) OneDrive and a white (personal) OneDrive on the taskbar and both appear to sync on the same computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried the trick of clicking Run and&nbsp;%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset.
</p>
<p>But nothing changes after doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you can suggest anything I could try.</p>
<p>Thanks all.</p>

<p>Solved this issue. </p>
<p>Here's how in case anyone else is as stupid as me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to invoke One Drive personal by clicking "Get the OneDrive apps" here in my web folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc048fa7-f08d-4e3c-815b-ca226fd89656?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc048fa7-f08d-4e3c-815b-ca226fd89656?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then clicking Start OneDrive on the screen that came up:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9d4e91a-a475-4dde-a6da-f890d2e8b8aa?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9d4e91a-a475-4dde-a6da-f890d2e8b8aa?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This gave me the greyed-out OneDrive icon in the taskbar but wouldn't let me log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in fact what I needed to do was click "Add an Account" from the settings panel within my already running OneDrive for Business:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b0aac61-3e63-4ff3-844c-4ff45cded6e0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b0aac61-3e63-4ff3-844c-4ff45cded6e0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Everything I had read said OneDrive Personal and Business were totally separate applications. But it appears not.</p>

<h2>            Editing List of Figures&#58;  How do you remove part of a figure caption from the TOF&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am currently writing my master's thesis and stumbled upon a frustrating formatting problem.&nbsp; When I insert a caption below a figure, I usually label it something like: "Figure 1.1.&nbsp; Brain plasticity in the rat neocortex."&nbsp; However, after I insert that
 caption into the document, I add more text to further explain the figure to future readers.&nbsp; I do not want that additional text to be included in my TOF, but it is.&nbsp; I am confused as to why this happens because I never enter&nbsp;that extra text&nbsp;into the caption
 label.&nbsp; Is there some way to exclude this text from the TOF?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

 one that&nbsp; looks just like the caption style if you want it to look the same.</p>
<p>Place the cursor anywhere in the first (caption)&nbsp; paragraph and press CTRL+Alt+Enter.&nbsp; Word will apply the Style Separator--or special hidden formatting-- to the first paragraph mark it encounters, and the&nbsp; two paragraphs will appear to be one.&nbsp; Only the

<h2>            OneNote Windows won&#39;t synch</h2>
                    <p>Again, I find that my OneNote windows won't sync.&nbsp; I get an 0x80072EFF, plus a 0xE4010641 error in sync status.&nbsp; I can click on the link in the status section and open OneNote Online and my notebooks are there.&nbsp; I also tried closing a notebook in the Windows
 app, then opening the notebook in OneNote Online by clicking on the Edit in OneNote.&nbsp; That created a new notebook in Onenote with mismatched label.&nbsp; I moved the sections to a new notebook - thus recreating a new notebook, but when I tried to Share on Web,
 it will not connect.&nbsp; It says "unable to connect to Microsoft OneDrive".&nbsp; No error msg.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really, error's in OneNote are very hard to track down.&nbsp; Would be helpful to have English language errors and an error log.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Doug,</p>

</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I have only used 313MB of the 15GB allowance in OneDrive, so don't think that is the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; I am using Windows XP (yes, on a laptop, still works fine for me).&nbsp; And Office 2010.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; No changes to the laptop prior to this happening.&nbsp; Last successful sync was on 3/17/2017.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; I connect to my router with Ethernet cable, and to internet with 10mps DSL.&nbsp; No other connectivity issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; The last time this exact same problem occurred (2014) the cause was a change to SSL certificate.&nbsp; See this thread -
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onenote-mso_winother/onenote-2010-wont-synch-0x80072eff-error/890bc47d-08de-412a-be42-b1548c15a299">

<p>But I have checked and TTL is still checked, so that is not the case this time.&nbsp; Although it could be something similar.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did try to create a new Notebook, but could not connect to sync with online version either.&nbsp; Same non-helpful error messages.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp; I have read through all the articles which you suggested, but they are of no help.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For these types of technical issue, most other well designed connected software would have an error log and English language error messages&nbsp; My question is why doesn't OneNote have an error log with readable (English) error codes?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has somebody ever used the N9 with an external GPS device?</p>
<p>I am thinking to buying an external dedicated GPS receiver which will send the NMEA 0183 data over bluetooth to my N9 .According to the N9 specs this should work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How ever I took my N900 and started the app "columbus" to emulate a GPS device. My android devices work finde to use it as external GPS device, how ever the N9 seems to to be able to use it. It connects fine and registers the N900 as the external GPS device.
 How ever it is not able to show any GPS data. In some apps, it even tries to use the internal GPS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, before I buy an expensive external GPS device, could somebody confirm this works with a real GPS device?</p>

            Hi aspergerguy<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply!<br />
This encouraging, since the LD-3W also uses the official NMEA 0183 standard.<br />
<br />
DId you have to do any special settings on the N9 beside setting the GPS device to the external device? I.e. switching the 2 toggle switchs in the settings off?<br />
<br />
Also, does the GPS icon on top stay steady on or is it flashing (which IMHO would mean it still tries to use the internal GPS receiver?).<br />
Can all apps handle the external GPS signal? I.e. what show the apps GePeS or gpsmeefo?<br />
<br />
Since I primarly would need it for geocaching, it especially would need to work with cacheme for N9 (<a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/219788)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.ovi.com/content/219788).</a><br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your feedback!

<p>Will try to address some of the other queries raised when I have a bit more time although, as CacheMe is a paid application&nbsp;<a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/160806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.ovi.com/content/160806</a> I won't be installing it to
 try out for you. For GPS MeeFo and GePeS however, I should be able to report back whether "the GPS icon on top stay steady on or is it flashing"</p>

            Dear aspergerguy<br />
<br />
Thanks for your willingness to help.<br />
Last night I decided to go ahead and buy the Qstarz BT-Q818XT anyway. Since I am also running Android (Nitdroid project) on my N9, I have an alternative OS on which it should work for sure.<br />
<br />
About CacheMe: I am sorry I didnt realise the link got brocken. The correct one is
<a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/219788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.ovi.com/content/219788</a> .<br />
This is the free version for the N9. The one you saw is the payed version for the Symbian OS.<br />
<br />
Also, as a thank you, if you are interested in any of the non free apps listed on
<a href="http://store.ovi.com/publisher/George%20Ruinelli/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.ovi.com/publisher/George%20Ruinelli/</a> please let me know! Since I am the author, I can send you the files for free.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not very scientific but here are my observations as have only used Bluetooth GPS with Nokia Maps and GPSMeeFo previously so&nbsp;installed GePeS and CacheMe as well:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chose Bluetooth receiver and here are screenshots from GPS MeeFo &amp; GePeS:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freeimagehosting.net/1dtey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.freeimagehosting.net%2fnewuploads%2f1dtey.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This doesn't tell whole story as connection using GPS MeeFo seems stable with satellite icon staying steady although with GePeS it starts flashing after a short period although visible upon screenshot. Whilst not familiar with CacheMe it does appear to show
 correct location in url heading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did find that after closing either GePeS or CacheMe connectivity with Bluetooth GPS is unobtainable again, until you switch back to "Internal GPS" in "Settings" and then re-choose Bluetooth GPS. As previously mentioned as I use only Nokia Maps or GPS MeeFo
 this situation has never arisen before and may or may not make sense to you!</p>

            You obviously know what you are doing ( running android on N9, just HAVING an N900 ). So I am just curious why you can't use the build in GPS, I find it works very well even in areas with no data connection. Also, why android on an N9, I love swype and
 just wish I could put it on 808 ;)

<p>Perhaps there is an issue with my N9 GPS but as have used Nokia LD-3W with numerous Nokia devices I tend to always use it when travelling in vehicle!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could use the formula the following link to generate a list of all names with No in the third column -
<a href="http://www.ashishmathur.com/lookup-where-search-string-appears-multiple-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ashishmathur.com/lookup-where-search-string-appears-multiple-times/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This list can then be used in Data &gt; Validation.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd adopt a different approach and extract all the names with NO to a new list and then use that list for your data validation list like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Say the above columns are in A, B and C. use this ARRAY&nbsp;formula to extract all the names with a no in Col C</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=IFERROR(INDEX($B$2:$B$11,MATCH(0,IF($C$2:$C$11="Yes","",COUNTIF(<u>$H$1:H1</u>,$B$2:$B$11)),0)),"")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put this in a cell and ARRAY enter it and drag down as far as you want and it will extract all the NO names and when that's done it will return blanks cells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note the underlined bit in the formula. This reference must be the cell <strong>
above</strong> the cell with the formula in so in this case I used H2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook plugin download forcing use of onmicrosoft.com domain so cannot install local outlook email account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Hoping someone can help me out on this one - I seem to be caught in a bit of a loop that I cannot get out of.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attempting to download an Outlook Plugin&nbsp; ( Salesforce inbox ) from the MO Store.&nbsp; It prompts be to login to my company office 365 account that has the following format:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>when it then attempts to install it to my local outlook it forces me to use the 365 account or another MO email account ( that I don't have ). The problem being that my email&nbsp; that is linked to my local outlook 2016 is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>It doesn't recognise this as a valid account.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that makes sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

                    <p>Apparently I'm missing something. After I finish a yoga workout in the video section, how can I pull the data in to the exercise tracker? Honestly, if I have to manually enter the information, this app will be worthless to me.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
The exercise tracker allows you to track your daily fitness activity and maintain a record of your daily workouts. You can sync your tracker data across devices by connecting to&nbsp; HealthVault, a free&nbsp; online service by Microsoft.
</p><div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Swipe down from the top edge or right-click, and then select <span>
Exercise Tracker</span> under the <span>Trackers</span> section.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Based on whether you want to add a cardio activity or a strength exercise, you can tap or click the
<span>+ Exercise</span> button.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</li><li>
<p>You can either choose an exercise from your favorites list or enter an exercise name in the search box and choose from the suggestions. You can also press Enter for more results.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can modify the details of the exercise, which can vary based on whether it is a cardio activity or a strength exercise.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can additionally add a set of exercises as a circuit by tapping the
<span>Save as a new circuit</span> check box at the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can also edit the exercises inline at a later stage.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>The analysis tabs give you further information on the exercises you've added to the tracker.</p>
<p>
If you have a HealthVault account, you can sync it with Bing Health &amp; Fitness, so that you see your HealthVault data in the Health Trackers and data you add to Bing Health &amp; Fitness is saved to your HealthVault record.&nbsp; Connecting with HealthVault allows you
 to sync your health, diet and exercise tracker data across multiple devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p><p><span>Before you start:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bing Health &amp; Fitness connects with your HealthVault account using your Microsoft account.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you connected your Windows user account with a Microsoft account (recommended), be sure it’s with the same one used for your HealthVault account.&nbsp; You won’t be able to sign in to HealthVault with a different Microsoft account.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you haven't connected your Windows account with a Microsoft account, you'll be asked to enter your Microsoft account during the following steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you need to add your Microsoft account to HealthVault,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=324036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
you can add it now by following the steps in this knowledge base article</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>To connect Bing Health &amp; Fitness with your data in HealthVault:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;In the Bing Health &amp; Fitness app, tap or click <span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sync to HealthVault</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</li><li>
<p>&nbsp;Please read the Terms of Use and privacy statement.&nbsp; Also, note that the name of the person whose HealthVault record will be used in the Bing Health &amp; Fitness app is shown here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I´m afraid that´s not what Rauty was looking for. The question is: how can I get a whole workout into the tracker?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems you have to add every single step of a workout manually to the tracker, which is not very comfortable as you have to navigate back and forth between the workout and the tracker, instead of simply adding and absolving it. I think there´s not much
 fun in sitting hours of syncing workouts into the tracker, so please think of adding such a feature...</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 925 can&#39;t access network&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Since this morning, my phone won't connect to the mobile network.</p>
<p>If I put my SIM in another phone, the other phone connects fine.</p>
<p>If I put my SIM back in my phone, it says "No Service" near the tower icon.</p>
<p>If I manually search for networks, I see my home network listed, but if I touch on it, it says "Can't access".</p>
<p>I have used the "Reset phone" option in SETTINGS--&gt;&gt;ABOUT, and it erased EVERYTHING from the phone. All my Apps and contacts are deleted, but yet, I can't access the network. It just says "Can't Access" if I do a manual serch and tap on my home network,
 and says "No Service" near the tower icon if I select "Automatic" in network mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried setting both 2G and 3G in max connection speed, nothing happens-no changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My service provider is Airtel, I sent them an email, and they said they are looking into the matter and said they will try to resolve the issue in 48 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I don't think they can do anything, it doesn't look like a network problem, the SIM works perfectly in another phone, just doesn't work in mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was working fine last night, but since this morning, all it says is "No Service" and "Can't Access".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What could have gone wrong? The phone can see the network if I do a manual network search, just won't connect to it :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE: It says "Can't Connect", not can't access. Just checked it now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE2: Any idea anyone? Nokia Care charges insanely high amounts for repairs here in India, and they keep the phone for LONGGGG times, like the last time I had a problem, they took 34 days to return the phone. If there's something else I can try, please
 suggest... I'm freaking out! Any idea what could have caused this? Last time I sent this phone to care (when it took 34 days to fix), it was showing "SIM error". It's not showing that now, but could these problems be related? :(</p>

<p>I gave my phone to Nokia Care again.</p>
<p>The tech there thinks a pin inside the SIM tray is damaged.</p>
<p>Hope it doesn't cost much to get it repaired. No idea how the pin got damaged- i didn't remove the SIM card, not until the problem showed up, and the phone didn't fall off my hand.</p>
<p>Called up Airtel and asked them to close the service request they created for me, told them the problem is with my phone not with their network.. no point troubling them uselessly. :(</p>

                    For the last couple of days, when I sign in to my Hotmail account, I was told that I had a few days to get my security code. I wasn't sure what it was talking about and today is the last day. I have been told that I had to get my security code from an
 old account that is no longer active. I can't get the code. It is now saying that the account will basically be locked for the next 30 days. I use my hotmail EVERY DAY!! I am having the same trouble on the computer and my phone so it is the account, not my
 mobile account, like I first thought. How can I fix this quickly and get back to using the account like normal?

I confirmed that the other addressees did receive that email. I need my records to show that I did send it out, but the email I sent out isn't showing up in my "Sent Items" folder at all, nor is it in Outbox, Drafts, Trash, etc. How did the sent email completely

            It wasn't a group and I hadn't manually added any of the addresses to my contacts even, it was just the autofill function kicking in - I just double checked to make sure the address was correct. The group contained a combination of internal and external
 addresses. Out of that group, only one address returned the above error message. It was an external address. As most of the recipients later contacted me via telephone/email about the email I sent out, I know for a fact that everyone, with the exception of
 the address in the error message, definitely received it. Yes, I can send a message to each of the individual addressees, save this one - even when I sent an email to only her address, the error message came back.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I don't know what "GAL" is. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, I deleted this contact's detail from the autofill, and checked my Contacts list to delete it there too, then manually typed out the address after double-checking the spelling, of which I confirmed with the recipient. No luck, got the same error
 message again. <br />
<br />
That's why I'm quite upset that the entire message disappeared/never appeared in my Sent Items folder when only one recipient bounced it.

<p><br />
In your very first post you said, "I sent an email out to a group of recipients".&nbsp; First you say it was a group then you say it wasn't.&nbsp; Please make up your mind.</p>
<p>The GAL is the "Global Address List".&nbsp; In an Exchange environment, it's usually what you see when you open the Address Book interface.&nbsp; It's the company-wide list of addresses from the Active Directory where people's accounts are defined.</p>
<p>You don't say whether or not it's an outside address (outside of your domain), but I think you should enlist the aid of your Exchange admins.&nbsp; In an Exchange environment, it is often Exchange that sends messages to the outside world and Exchange that stores
 the messages n the Sent Items folder.&nbsp; Perhaps they can help you trace the flow of the message.&nbsp; I have never seen the behavior you describe and I've bounced many messages in my time.</p>

            Couple of things...<br />
GAL = Global Address List &lt;what you see when you click on "To" to select a name.<br />
If you can't send to the one address, it's *possible* that your domain could be blacklisted. You can verify at www.mxtoolbox.com
<br />
As to why you can't see it in your sent items, have you tried resorting your sent items? IE. click on the "Sent" heading and verify that you have emails showing before and after the time you sent it.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have OWA &lt;webmail&gt; available to you, have a look at the sent items there.<br />

    <title>Previously Flagged messages still not Archiving - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samsterid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Previously Flagged messages still not Archiving</h2>
                    <p>We have an employee running Outlook 2007 SP3, and we recently made the registry change to allow Archiving to use the Received date instead of the Modified date (ArchiveIgnoreLastModifiedTime).</p>
<p>After the registry change, the Inbox count went down from 15,000 messages to 8,000 - a good start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we noticed that Flagged messages were not Archiving, we marked some messages (in a sub-folder) as Complete, and Cleared the Flag on a few others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But these formerly flagged messages still won't Archive&nbsp; (tried a manual Archive on the folder.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only suggested fix I've seen so far is that the Outlook Profile might be corrupt.&nbsp; The Profile in question has&nbsp; 3 different mail accounts linked to three different&nbsp; .pst files.&nbsp; So
 creating a new profile and re-linking everything is not trivial (to me!)</p>
<p>I don't mind doing the work, but I haven't found a thread in any Outlook communities where someone has confirmed that creating a new Profile fixed this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Sam</p>

            We had a similar issues with flagged messages not archiving a long time ago with 3 of the employees.<br />
The only fix was to create new Outlook profile and link the pst files to it. This is how I could fix it.<br />
There is no harm in trying it out.<br />
<br />
Let us know if that worked.<br />

            I did nothing special, but the problem seems to have cleared up, everything is Archiving ok now. (Did not have to recreate Profile)<br />
