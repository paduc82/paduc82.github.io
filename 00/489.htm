<h2>            Printing Full Page PPT Slide</h2>
                    I am trying to print a PPT 2007 slide so that it covers the full page. It looks fine on the L/R edges, but there is a 2 inch border on the Top and Bottom edges I can't remove. Any suggestions?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I think you'll need to check your printer settings.&nbsp; Try Office button &gt; Print &gt; Properties.&nbsp; One thing to check is the Gutter size??</p>
<p>Also check that your slide size is the same as your paper size.&nbsp; Design tab &gt; Page Setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

            To expand a bit on what Rich wrote, PPT will try to fill the printed page with your slide but won't distort anything; that means that if your slide's proportions aren't the same as your paper's proportions, there will be extra border L/R or Top/Bottom.
<div><br />
<div>You can use Slide Size on the Design tab to change the page size, but if you do that with an existing presentation, THEN PPT will distort stuff to fit the new page size.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may instead want to create a new presentation, set its dimensions to match your paper size, then copy/paste everything from your existing slide to the new one and adjust the position/size of everything on the slide to suit your new layout.</div>

<p>When run via the GUI the rules are not run simultaneously but one by one in the order they are presented. This would be essential as the behaviour of some rules would depend on previously run rules. The macro appears to achieve the same ends. You can selectively
 run certain rules by adding further conditions into the loop.</p>

<p>When I run it manually via the gui, the progress status indicator shows that different rules are being applied at different times as it goes sequentially thru the inbox. It seems to me it loops thru the inbox sequentially and at each mail item it checks
 which of the selected rules apply, and then apply them.</p>
<p>The macro code from the link applies only one rule at a time. So this takes N x K amount of time where N is number of mail items and K is the number of rules I selected, compared to N when run manually.</p>
<p>Btw all my rules have "process no further rules" set.</p>

<p>Perhaps I could ask the question differently...</p>
<p>Can I write code to make the "run rules now" gui pop up and then check off the rules I want and click "run"?</p>
<p>This is where a record macro feature comes in really handy but there appears to be none.</p>

<p>I think you are mistaken about how the macro works compared with the GUI version. When a message is received, the rules are automatically processed sequentially in the order they appear in the GUI. If you run the rules manually, you can select a range of
 rules to apply and obviously only those rules are applied, but otherwise the rules are processed sequentially on each message. The macro is effectively the same as setting all the rules to run manually. However in my tests, the macro runs rather faster than
 manually selecting all the rules and running from the GUI.</p>
<p>Your other post questions whether it would be possible to select the records to process via the GUI from the macro. The answer to that appears to be no. There does not appear to be any access to the dialog from Outlook VBA that I am aware of.</p>
<p>You could emulate it by creating a userform and reading the rules into a list box from which you could select the rules that you wish to run fom that list and that would speed up the processing a small amount, but frankly I don't see what the advantage of
 the macro would be over the tools provided by Outlook. There seems to be some measure of wheel re-invention going on. :)</p>
<p>If I can quote from my own use of Outlook, I have a about 25 rules configured which caters for most of the messages I receive, all of which are moved to other folders according to a variety of conditions. The rules run automatically upon receipt and the
 messages filed until read. This leaves relatively few unprocessed messages in the inbox. For the purposes of testing the macro I moved a large selection of messages back to the inbox and processed them. Even with several hundred messages the macro only took
 a few second to run on a PC that is now getting decidedly long in the tooth compared with current hardware.</p>
<p>However if you insist, create a userform in Outlook VBA and call it frmRunRules. Add a large ListBox and a single CommandButton at the bottom each with their default names i.e. ListBox1 and CommandButton1</p>
<p>Apply the following code to the userform</p>
<p>Option Explicit<br />
Private st As Outlook.Store<br />
Private myRules As Outlook.Rules<br />
Private rl As Outlook.Rule<br />
Private count As Integer<br />
Private ruleList As String<br />
Private i As Long</p>
<p>Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()<br />
Set st = Application.Session.DefaultStore<br />
Set myRules = st.GetRules<br />
Me.BackColor = &amp;HC0FFFF<br />
Me.Caption = "Select the Rules to Run on the Inbox"<br />
Me.CommandButton1.Caption = "Run Selected Rules"<br />
With Me.ListBox1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .Clear<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Each rl In myRules<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .AddItem rl.Name<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next rl<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .MultiSelect = fmMultiSelectExtended<br />
End With<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()<br />
Me.Hide<br />
Set st = Application.Session.DefaultStore<br />
Set myRules = st.GetRules<br />
With Me.ListBox1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For i = 0 To .ListCount - 1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If .Selected(i) Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set rl = myRules.Item(.List(i))<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If rl.RuleType = olRuleReceive Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ' if so, run it<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rl.Execute ShowProgress:=True<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; count = count + 1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ruleList = ruleList &amp; vbCrLf &amp; rl.Name<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next i<br />
End With<br />
ruleList = "These rules were executed against the Inbox: " &amp; vbCrLf &amp; ruleList<br />
MsgBox ruleList, vbInformation, "Outlook Rules"<br />
Set rl = Nothing<br />
Set st = Nothing<br />
Set myRules = Nothing<br />
Unload Me<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Create a macro to call the userform e.g.</p>
<p>Sub RunMyRules()<br />
frmRunRules.Show<br />
End Sub</p>

<p>Thanks, Graham, for the code. Much appreciated. Like you pointed out however, I have no intention to reinvent the wheel. I was hoping to find, if it exists, a way to simulate the clicking on the gui to run the rules manually. But I will put your code in
 my back pocket for that next time when the need arises.</p>
<p>Necessity is the mother of all inventions, so they say.</p>
<p>The only reason I'm writing a macro to run the rules is that the outlook server version we had had a very low limit for rules. One can store gigabytes in a .pst file but they would not let the storage size on rules to be limitless. So a lot of my rules could
 not be set to run automatically.</p>
<p>I must respectfully disagree with you on the performance when running rules manually via the gui vs via that macro code from Sue. My inbox is 12.5GB and counting. My Inbox and most (say 10 of 20) of the subfolders within them have 5,000-10,000 items in them.
 I know, one can validly ask why, but I do get ~500/day. That's why the rules are critical for me. Moreover, almost all my rules are based on searching for specific strings in the full header - essentially sorting them into folders by email addresses or the
 label on the email addresses. Under such a scenario, if I were to run the rules manually via the gui, it takes ~5mins to go thru my inbox (excluding subfolders). When I use that macro, because each rule is looped sequentially, that's in the order of ~5min
 x ~10 rules. The actual run time may be close to ~30min.</p>
<p>Having said all that, we just migrated from outlook 2003 server to 2010! And I just tried checking all my rules to run automatically and it is no longer complaining there is not enough space!</p>
<p>So thank you very much for your efforts indeed.</p>

<p>Hi Jop van den Broek,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to us. We understand you want to configure team site libraries to sync automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature is currently enabled in the Insiders ring only. To try it, join the
<a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Insider program</a> or the
<a href="https://products.office.com/office-insider" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office Insider</a> program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The setting may take up to 8 hours after a user signs in before the library begins to sync. To use the setting, we must enable OneDrive Files On-Demand, and the setting applies only for users on computers
 running Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (version 1709) or later. Please do not enable this setting for the same library to more than 1,000 devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For details, we suggest you refer to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/use-group-policy#configure-team-site-libraries-to-sync-automatically" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Not sure what you mean with a base image in Microsoft as opposed to Linux&nbsp;Bob. If you mean the iso download file, the answer is there isn't one, yet! It is available as an update but not as a download file.</p>
<p>The latest download iso file is build 14372 </p>

Re Office for Mac 2011 &nbsp;- &nbsp;When I go to Envelopes I cannot access "Use My Address" to insert my address in Return Address. &nbsp;It is "gray" - inoperative. &nbsp;So are the little address cards next to Delivery Address and Return Address. &nbsp;It appears that my Address
 Book has become disconnected from Word. &nbsp;Also, when I got to the User Information dialog box via Word Preferences, it only shows my name. &nbsp;And, after I fill in the other info and click OK, the problem still persists and if I go back to User Information, it
 again is blank, except for my name. How can I reconnect my Address Book to Word?

            The problem got fixed with the help of a friend who checked it out and came up with the solution. &nbsp;It was to create a new Identity in Microsoft Database Utility and Rebuild the database. &nbsp;(Deleting the existing identities.) &nbsp;The Address Book is now reconnected
 to Word. &nbsp;Many thanks to all who provided help and assistance on this.

            Per my friend these were the exact steps followed:
<div>1. Make sure the Outlook application is closed.</div>
<div>2. Make sure you have the update installed and you are running on version 14.2.0 or higher. &nbsp;You can check by opening Word and going to "About Word."</div>
<div>3. Locate your identities folder using Finder. Probably in Documents; User Data/Office 2011 Identities. &nbsp;Make a backup of your entire identity folder, just in case.</div>
<div>4. Create a new identity using the Microsoft Database Utility, located in Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Office.</div>
<div>5. Go back to your identities folder. &nbsp;Now you should see two folders, one with your old identity, and one with the new identity. &nbsp;Each one of those has a "Data Records" folder that stores all messaging data.</div>
<div>6. Manually copy folders from the "Data Records" folder in the old identity to the "Data Records" folder in the new identity, except for the three folders that were already created in the new identity; i.e., "Database Headers," "Preferences," and "Recent
 Addresses." &nbsp;</div>
<div>7. Go to the Database Utility, select your new identity and tell it to rebuild the database. &nbsp;It will go through 5 steps and might take some time.</div>
<div>8. When you get confirmation that your database was successfully rebuilt, make the new identity your default.</div>

<h2>            One Note 2013 feature request - Edit Mode&#47; Read Only Mode</h2>
                    I am having trouble finding where to post this, so I thought I would start here. &nbsp;I love using One Note, and I wish there was a feature/add-in/ something, that let me put a notebook in "Read-Only" mode by default, then let me edit when I'm making changes
 by using a "Edit" mode. &nbsp;I've seen other people requesting a similar feature. &nbsp;I've used One Note and Atlas (Confluence), and I love how in Confluence it is easy to see the version history and I love how the documentation is read-only, unless you want to make
 changes, then you go into edit mode. &nbsp;The thing I love about One Note is the cut and paste feature and the searchability. &nbsp;If these 3 things (edit mode/cut and paste/searchability) were combined, it would be perfect!

            <p>This option isn't as good as a Read-Only mode would be, but it's the best that I could figure out and it's relatively simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Notebook and Section you want a Read-Only version of</p>
<p>Go to <strong>File</strong>, <strong>Save As:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Save Current: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Section</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Select Format: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">(*.one)</span></strong></p>
<p>Then click <strong>Save As</strong></p>
<p>Open Windows Explorer and find the file location</p>
<p>Right click and select <strong>Properties</strong></p>
<p>Under <strong>General, </strong>select <strong>Read-Only</strong> and Apply</p>
<p>You now won't be able to edit this file in Onenote</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you have to make a copy of your original Section and if you ever make any changes in the original, you'll have to go through the process again. But it's fast and simple. For my purposes (school), this works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing a "save as" for the whole notebook, but it wouldn't work for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Here's one fairly simple way that OneNote could implement this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add a new "View" to OneNote which is a read-only view. When this view is selected, then the UI works exactly the same as normal except that keyboard input that would change the document doesn't have any effect. This could also be a toggle on the "Home" pane.
 This would remove the need to deal with document permissions, require very little change to the app, and be fairly clear from a usability standpoint.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Richard
<br />
<br />There's a utility I often use for this exact thing called Mail Passview. It'll pull the password from your Outlook and display it in plain text. 
<br />

            First, you would set your SMTP server to authenticate using the credentials for the incoming server (POP3 or IMAP - whichever way you have your account configured)

<p>Hi Curtis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When adding a Gmail account, there are cases wherein it keeps asking for a password. The issue occurs if the Gmail account has two-step verification enabled and IMAP is disabled. To resolve this issue, you may need to enable IMAP and use an App Password.
 An App Password is a one-time password that you use instead of verifying yourself with two-step verification. We suggest that you follow the troubleshooting steps under "<strong>Fixing problems with adding a Gmail account to Outlook</strong>" on this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-Gmail-to-Outlook-20fdb8f2-fed8-4b14-baf0-bf04b9c44bf7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> so that we could check if that will help you set up your Gmail account successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if that works for you.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying out windows X for a while. The last update I made today after a month or so seems to have lost the capability to choose my keyboard layout at the login screen. I cannot login with another keyboard as I cannot type the password using another
 keyboard :-(.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something I am missing? How can I select a different keyboard layout at login? I am using Programmer's Dvorak Keyboard.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to remove the keyboard from the Control Panel and then add it once again. Check if that resolve the issue. We have tested in our system and was
 able to select the Dvorak Keyboard in the login screen. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the below steps to remove the Dvorak Keyboard from the control panel:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open the <strong>
Control Panel</strong> and type <strong>Language </strong>in search option.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
Options</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
Dvorak Keyboard</strong> and click on <strong>remove</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Restart the system and add the keyboard.</span></li><li><span>Open the <strong>
Control Panel</strong> and type <strong>Language </strong>in search option.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
Options</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
Add an Input method</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
Dvorak Keyboard.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p><span>Now check for the issue.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>In January, I upgraded from a Windows 7 to a Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also upgraded from Office Word and Office Outlook 2007 to Office 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been struggling with this issue for so long that I can't remember all the things that I've tried.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the problems that I've discovered is my confusion about the left hand bar in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this may be at the source of my problem. To solve this, I would like your help to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main folders/headings on the left hand bar of my Outlook is in this order under the title "Personal Folders":</p>
<p>1.Inbox</p>
<p>2.Archive folders</p>
<p>3.My iPhone email (I.e. @me.com)</p>
<p>4. My personal email folder - my most often used personal email account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem:</p>
<p>1. The first on top named "Inbox" receives some emails but not all. All the subfolders under this "inbox" folder are the old folders imported from my old outlook email. I want this "Inbox" to be total emails received from all my accounts. How do I do that?</p>
<p>2. My main personal account receives all the emails it receives, many of which do not appear in the "Inbox" folder above (1.) As well, this folder appears way down at the bottom of this left hand bar. I'd like to move it up before the list of the old imported
 folders.</p>
<p>3. All the emails sent to my business email account end up in my personal account folder above in (2.)</p>
<p>4. I want all the emails to my business email account to appear both in it's own dedicated folder as well as in the Inbox folder as in 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I change this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ellenhk</p>

<p>If this was an in-place upgrade win7 to win10, then you purchased/installed Office 2016 there would have been no import process, your original data and accounts would have been intact and all would appear in OL2016 as it did in OL2007</p>
<p>Personal Folders implies a pop mail a/c, not an IMAP a/c, such an account would usually be named as per the mail address.</p>
<p>Within MS Outlook, File&gt;Account Settings&gt;Email Tab............ what domain <strong>
Name</strong> and <strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>is shown for each mail account?</p>

            Dear Adi
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />Please try to use suggestions for login to Microsoft Account in this support article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12429/microsoft-account-sign-in-cant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12429/...</a> . If you will be still unable to login, try to recover your account. In this article you will find all possible ways of doing it <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17875/microsoft-account-recover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17875/...</a> . If you will still be unable to recover the account, then it is better to contact Microsoft Account Support for alternative recovery options <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12401/microsoft-account-get-help-by-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12401/...</a>
<br />They probably will be asking for safe proofs, so try to recollect what information you were providing while creating the account <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/...</a>
<br />If you do not remember your Microsoft Account, but you added a phone number to your account, than try to login with it instead of the account. If system will recognize the phone number it may give an option to retrieve the account by sending one time password to the phone.
<br />Hope this will help you retrieve your Microsoft Account.

            Unfortunately, at this time, no. If you ignored the warning and deleted it cant be recovered.   They really need to treat it like a deleted account and give you some time to undelete it - even 24 hours would be better than nothing. :(

            Hello,
<br />
<br />good day, I understand your concern.
<br />
<br />I understand that it is very important for you to recover your old account.
<br />
<br />      If you stop reactivating your account within 365 days, the account will be deleted and the address will be available to anyone who wants it within 60 days.
<br />
<br />· When an account is deleted from our system, the username is immediately available to be registered.
<br />
<br />· All information (emails and contacts) that was in the account is lost and will no longer be recoverable.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have doubts about this policy you can read "Microsoft Services Contract".
<br />
<br /> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/</a>
<br />
<br />Similarly, I will indicate a link where you will find a menu of options for you to write the affected account and an alternative account. After placing the accounts you will proceed to fill out a form.
<br />
<br />I recommend that you fill out the form with the maximum information that you can provide, I also recommend you do it from the device with which you started session in the affected account. If you need to know the issues or emails that you sent lately, you can ask the people to whom you sent the emails:
<br />
<br />"Recover your account."
<br /><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr?mkt=en-ES" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/acsr?mkt=en-ES</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope you manage to enter the account. :)
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have another question, you can communicate again to the Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />
<br />I wish you a good day.       
        </p>

            Because the address was used, it should be blocked for at least 5 years. You can try creating a new account with the address after 60 days but I'll be shocked if it is available.

<p>Is there a specific reason for wanting 64bit Office? - its only required in some circumstances.</p>
<p>If you allready have a 32bit Office component installed, 64bit wont be available

<p>Yes, in instances where I've installed x64 office 2010 / 2016 etc the applications seem faster to start and in actual operations Outlook for example seems much more responsive than it's x32 counterpart.<br />
</p>
<p>In this instance I have a new notebook computer that I want to install this new copy of office on but I find it easier to download it on my main desktop computer (and it has x32 office because I've been too lazy to uninstall and reinstall the x64 version)
 because my credentials for logging into office.com are stored in the browser and considering that I have hundreds of logins with dozens of different passwords I shouldn't have to get the password out of the browser to then have to login to Office.Com on the
 notebook so that I can download the x64 there. This is a case of the website being too smart for it's own good, I just want to download the x64 version and it should have an option to allow me to do that.</p>

    <title>Promotion - Free Groove Music 3 Month Code - Never Received Code - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Promotion - Free Groove Music 3 Month Code - Never Received Code</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been sent around to 4 different microsoft help chats, and I'm hoping that someone here can help me resolve my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On June 22, I received a promotion on my xbox one dashboard, offering a 3 month groove music code for signing up for a 30 day trial. I signed up for the trial directly on my xbox, but never received the code. My groove music trial expired on July 23, and
 now I'm without service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first contacted someone at microsoft support who told me that, because I had signed up for the promotion directly on my xbox, and not on the groove website, that I would have to contact xbox support regarding my code. I then reached out to xbox support,
 who did some investigating, and then gave me a reference number and told me to reach back out to microsoft support again. I contacted microsoft support, but they had no idea what I was talking about, and couldn't help me in the slightest. Finally, I reached
 back out to xbox support, and they pointed me here to these forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached a photo of the promotion that I signed up for in late June, and would be happy to provide the reference number that xbox gave me, should that be necessary. Thanks for any and all help!</p>
<p>

            Hello Microsoft, do you guys not see that there is a problem here???&nbsp; I have been dealing with this on the Xbox side of this (why I don't know, that is where customer support sends me for help on this).&nbsp; I signed up in June, paid for two months, talked
 to two customer service reps that had no idea what this promo was or is (one kept calling it Xbox Music), been passed onto the forums, and now we sit and wait???&nbsp; this is not good service at all.&nbsp; This should be something very simple to fix or look into.&nbsp;
 Someone please help us.&nbsp; I show that this has been extended until August 17&nbsp; https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/groove/bogo

                    Hi, I am trying to set up 2-step verification for OneDrive but the link "Set up two-step verification" on the Security Settings page (under Security &amp; Privacy in my account page) won't work. In fact, this link points to&nbsp;https://account.live.com/#.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you&nbsp; enabled the two-step verification on your account? If yes, you will need to have an app password to access your account when using a mail app from your mobile device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to rectify this issue, please create a new app password for your account. For more information, you can refer to this article:

 If you have scripting disabled or blocked in your browser the link won't work. What browser are you using? Any browser add-ins?

            Alas, I cannot help more. It is definitely something on your PC because I have no problem with any of the browsers you mention. If it were a general problem, I'd have as much trouble as you. Perhaps someone else will think of something I can't.

            The problem was solved by MSFT support: Two Step Verification may only be activated if there are 2 or more security proofs associated with the account (phone number, additional email). Once I added a security proof, everything worked fine.&nbsp;<br />

            That's good to know. I thought it was only one proof-the one that would receive the code. I have multiple proofs: three phones and four other email addresses.

<p>Microsoft has started blocking some 3rd party AV's</p>
<p>if they don't meet certain standards.</p>
<p>What you are using is total overkill.</p>
