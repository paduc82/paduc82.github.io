<h2>            Unable to update from build 9841</h2>
                    I have been trying to update from build 9841 to the latest one. Whenever I click on the update preview build, I get those circles which go on endlessly. I don't even get something&nbsp;like a&nbsp;progress bar to tell me whether or&nbsp; not is it even updating. Is this
 a bug? If so, what should I do?&nbsp;Is there any way I can download the new build from internet explorer? I don't want to download the whole os&nbsp;(4gb) again. Just the changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>VBA-xlsx to PDF Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathan anderson_995  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA-xlsx to PDF Issues</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with running a VBA code that i have previously not had an issue with. In fact, this code works sometimes and not others.
</p>
<p>Most recently my computer has gone through a windows update, which is not uncommon, The other change that was made lately is the (files) were recently moved to a 1TB Passport hard drive. (Not sure if this is an issue)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is suppose to happen---&gt;</p>
<p>The issue here is that this program is suppose to open .xlsx files located in a specific folder which is indicated on another sheet. When it opens this file it copies specific information, exports the file as a PDF into another folder,(Specified on another
 worksheet), it then closes the file, It then pastes that information that was copied into the Active workbook running the VBA script. This process is then looped over and over until all the files in the folder have been through the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues</p>
<p>What is going on is this, Everything functions normally except the export to PDF. It runs through the script fine, it even shows the file being published as a PDF. (However)- There is no PDF. When i go to the folder which it is directed to export the files
 into as PDF's nothing is there. I added a short line of code to the file to see where the file is being saved and it informs me that it is over righting the original file in XLSX form instead of saving it as directed. I understand this may be a bit confusing,
 If you need more information please feel free to let me know. (The actual Code is technically a lot larger than the small portion shown below, but for this issue the information provided should be enough for an evaluation.)</p>

 external function of saving before continuing. Exactly where is the best place to insert the line will probably require testing but I would start with immediately after the line to save the file. You might even require the line more than once in the code so
 if immediately after the save does not fix then because it is the save line that is giving the problem, I would also include one immediately prior to the save line like the following.</p>

            I added those lines and it still does not work. (I decided to move the files back onto the actual computer from the external hard drive and it works fine...) I don't understand why it refuses to work just because its on an external drive. Is there perhaps
 a security feature causing the workbook not to export as a PDF on the drive??

            <p>Can't be sure but I still suspect that an external process is not properly completing. Could even be&nbsp;due to the possibility&nbsp;of the external drive being slower than the internal drive. The position of the "DoEvents" within the code can make a difference because
 it needs to be immediately after&nbsp;the point that is&nbsp;not properly completing and to find that positions it needs experimenting. It&nbsp;can also be required at several positions in the code.</p>

            <p>I know in my mind what I believe it does so I will see if I can put it in words.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that&nbsp;it is telling the system&nbsp;to finish processing&nbsp;the code up to the point of the "DoEvents" command before&nbsp;commencing to process the code following the "DoEvents" command. Or in other words, chew up and swallow what is in the mouth
 before taking another bite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This explanation may not be exactly and technically correct but it is my understanding of what it does and I have repeatedly found that it fixes problems, particularly in loops, where a lot of processing is taking place. I have to use it in a visual progress
 bar that I have that allows the user to see how much processing has taken place and how much to go otherwise the screen does not get updated with the progress bar.</p>

            <p>Just a long shot but immediately after the change directory and before the save insert a stop command and then when the code stops, change the window back to the interactive mode and select "Save as" and see if you are at the correct directory; you don't
 need to actually save anything and can cancel the save and then change back to the VBA editing window and press F5 to continue.</p>

            <p>I used the stop command and went to the Save As and it was not in the correct folder. It was displaying the folder with the file that was opened using VBA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also-</p>
<p>I just realized that the myfile string is somehow (And Sometimes) connected to (C:\Users\Lenovo\Documents\) Which makes absolutely no sense, At no time is it directed to go to this directory. Furthermore it appears that all of the missing PDF files are in
 the documents folder. This is perplexing... Talk about a glitch..</p>

<h2>            lumia 925 battery drain and overheating</h2>
                    <p>&gt;Hi everyone, I want to ask. Is there any solution to Lumia 925 battery drain and overheating? All the time I search in discussion and forum, there's no solution or anything that I can do because all the advice don't make my battery lasts longer and still
 overheating and there's no answer from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Dear Microsoft, are you abandoned us all?, you can't just let us suffer with tons of problems. All the advice I get is to turn off many features of smartphone. But it does not make any changes and if I turned off those features, why should I buy smartphones?
 I have already do a hard reset, but it still drains quickly and always heating. This isn't an hardware issue because hundreds topic talking about this problem.thanks
</p>

<h2>            Unable to redownload an already purchased app</h2>
                    I am unable to redownload an already purchased app (thumba). I bought the app on my Lumia 610 and now I'm trying to download it on my new Lumia 800, but Marketplace is wanting me to buy it again. Also Zune doesn't say I've purchased it either.

            You need to make sure you set up the new windows phone to use the same windows live/outlook.com account on your phone as the primary account as the one you used on your older phone when you purchased the app.<br />
<br />
Also, when you go to download an app that you've already purchased, you will still select the Buy button.&nbsp; Then you should see a message that says something like, "you've already purchased this application, do you want to reinstall it?"<br />

<p>Whatever I do, WD won't start. I have tried all the suggestion I have found on the net.</p>
<p>One suggestion was to run appwiz.cpl and uninstall it from there, then re-install.</p>
<p>Curiously, if I run appwiz.cpl, WD does not appear.</p>

<h2>            Opening recordset with Where clause having variables instead of constants</h2>
                    <p>I am in the process of creating a set of applications for a local food pantry so they can keep better track of their operations.&nbsp; I am currently trying to open a recordset based on matching the current date and matching a foreign key obtained from a form.&nbsp;
 The examples I have seen with Where clauses all have constants.&nbsp;&nbsp; So </p>
<p>
</p><p>"Select * From Visits Where Where Pantry_date = #12/16/2014# AND household_idfk = 8;"</p>
<p>
</p><p>works fine, but it does not support the dynamic behavior I want.&nbsp; What I need is something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Select * From Visits Where Pantry_date = Date() AND household_idfk = Forms![client household]![household id] ;"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way of getting this behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little more background:&nbsp; the select is in a VBA module that gets invoked by clicking a button on a form.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 Row Height changes from 12.75 to 12.60</h2>
                    <p>Yes, I have a question in regards to Excel Row Heights changing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done work in Excel 2013 on Windows 7. &nbsp;The Row Height is a default 12.75. &nbsp;I save as a .XLS</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I take my work home to continue working on the Excel spreadsheet in Excel 2016 on Windows 10. &nbsp;However when I open up the file all of my row heights have changed from 12.75 to 12.60. &nbsp;Now for printing this effects the rows allowed on a page. &nbsp;I have
 attempted to change the row height to 12.75 BUT it reverts to either 12.60 OR 13.20.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set the default row height at 12.75 BUT ALL rows show a height of 12.60.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any insight to my dilemma? &nbsp;Ideally I want my row height to be the same in Excel 2013 as in Excel 2016.</p>

            Go to the calendar list's settings &gt; permissions and break inheritance. Remove all the groups/users there and create a new group for your 3 users with edit permissions. Add the users to that group. To ensure you still have admin access,&nbsp; don't delete the
 owners from the list's permissions.

<div>
<p>Please be informed, UniKey only supports:&nbsp;<strong>All Win32 platforms: Windows 9x/ME, Windows NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1</strong>.&nbsp;This may be the reason why it is not working in Skype that is installed on Windows 10 device.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>If this will be the case, I suggest to contact UniKey support to further assist you regarding this.

            I have got the same isue recently. However, I just found the way to resolve that. Everything I do is that installed Vietnamese IME, install basic pack afterward. Let's restart when the popup's screen was appeared. In addition, you have to reinstall Unikey.
 That's all. It sounds weird but worked for me!!!

    <title>Word 2016 Styles Pane Corrupted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterknight111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 Styles Pane Corrupted</h2>
                    <p>I have a large 200 plus page document.&nbsp; Styles are used extensively.&nbsp; The styles pane has started behaving very strangely.&nbsp; I am unable to select the style I want - another random style in the list is applied.&nbsp; When I click the style I want&nbsp;again the style
 applied moves to the next one up in the list from the one previously (and randomly) applied.&nbsp; This happens again and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disassembled the document, copied styles from an old clean version a few at a time, testing each time.&nbsp; After I got all the styles working in the styles pane I rebuilt the document into a number of smaller files (Part A, B etc) by copying text and using
 destination styles.&nbsp; It took hours!!&nbsp; &nbsp; I tested the styles pane at each paste and eventually&nbsp;all seemed to be working OK.&nbsp; That was yesterday.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;now the same problem has now&nbsp;occurred even with the smaller files I am working with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me nuts!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely I have just discovered the Style gallery in the Ribbon seems to operate OK.&nbsp;&nbsp; I never normally use this as I prefer the styles pane.&nbsp; When I click a style in the gallery it is applied and the style is highlighted in the pane, but when I click the
 pane the problem described above happens again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested the Word document on another machine with Word 2016 and the same behaviour occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am running Windows 10 on both machines</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone enlighten me as to why this happens and what I can do about it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Installing Skype on older Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>On my old Macbook2,1 (2Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo) with System OS 10.6.8 suddenly Skype was no longer usable. There always came the warning that I have to download the newest version. So I did install Skype 6.15. But Skype rejected the login. Then I made the registration
 for a MS-account. There the login worked with the Browser Firefox 48.0.2 - but still not with the Skype-app.
</p>
<p>Within the browser I could reach my Account, on a similar display with all my contacts an old chats.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I tried to open a new chat (camera or only phone) the program requests a plug-in. So I tried to install it. But the computer rejected and complained that the plug-in does not work with my OS-version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anyone encountered the same problem? What can I do?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sent Dec 17. </p>
<p>This no longer works with the latest "upgrade" to the requirements, but I desperately need to rescue /extract all my Skype contacts. This is a big problem as I use Skype for teaching with old macs that can't run the latest OS. Any ideas or suggestions would
 be appreciated.<br />

<p>Had the same problem, and then figured out that the number to put in the PLIST file is the number of the version (it was version&nbsp;<span>7.36.0.507 at the time).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>but if you go to the downloads, and choose 'download classic skype' you get the 7.59.37 version, so substitute this number for the&nbsp;<span>6.15.0.335, and it works!</span></p>

            Then I suggest you try Opera 8.65 for Smartphone. It's free and in beta version until the first of October. It's really a great browser. I use it on my HTC S620 Smartphone and its Pocket PC version on my Eten M500, which I bought of course. It was and
 still is a fruitful acquisition.

            How about Papyrus, which is #13 on Handango and won the Handango Champion Award for "Best New Application for S60" for 2006.<br />

<p>Hi Tor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Language settings on your device may affect how a certain Office app detects its language. To verify this, may we know if the same issue is visible when using other Office programs aside from Word? Have you also checked if your Office version is updated?
 Do you also happen to install a third-party keyboard application on this device? If so, is the default one displaying a similar behavior?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've notice that this thread has been idle for a few days. May we know if the issue has been addressed already?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not yet, you can configure the AutoCorrect on Word not to capitalize the letter "i" or remove the AutoCorrect option. To do this, simply follow the steps provided on this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/choose-autocorrect-options-for-capitalization-spelling-and-symbols-e7433b94-f3de-4532-9dc8-b29063a96e1f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we suggest you uninstall office on iPad press and hold on the Office App icons until they start to shake, then tap on the (x) in the corner to delete them. If you see no (x), make sure "Delete Apps" is not restricted under Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Restrictions.
 Please be reminded that before uninstalling create a backup of your files.<br />
<br />
After uninstalling, login to your account at www.Office.com/MyAccount and then you will be able to see the devices Office 365 is installed. You can re-install Office 365 again on your iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>HI, I have alredy removed and installed the app many times, no changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I can take the autocorrect off, but then word will act strange and the system lag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. You can also try disabling the auto-correct function on your device to see if that helps. We suggest you try on a different device to isolate the issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Good day and welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unusual that your contacts and profile information is different when you sign in to Skype for web.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible reason behind this is because you are not logged in to your account. I suggest for you to sign out of the
<a href="https://web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for web</a>, and sign back in using the Skype Name, email, or phone number you usually are using to access your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you forgot your Skype sign in details, please refer to this support page for help:
