    <title>Halo 5 co-op and general rant - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Halo 5 co-op and general rant</h2>
                    
<p>So I guess to play co-op with a live friend in one room, you have to do this:&nbsp; two game copies, two xbox one's, two tv's, and connect them both to the internet....and instead of lightning fast LAN speeds, you will be dependent on your internet's ping/lag
 in order to have a nice experience, right?</p>
<p>You also could just tell your friend to stay at home and meet on the internet at a certain time, which is pretty stupid.&nbsp; Or else you have a Destiny-like experience of trying to beg internet strangers to play the campaign with you...what are the chances
 of that?&nbsp; Especially to take a break for a day and then continue again at a future time.&nbsp; I guess you can just pretend the AI bots are your new co-op buddies. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I live in a rural area with no fast internet options I will have to choose between my satellite internet with fast download times but an average ping of 750ms, or the DSL internet, which varies all over the place from a doable ping of 150ms to bad
 pings of 350 or so, and download speeds varying greatly from 5 MIPS to as slow as 0.25MIPS. &nbsp; The cable companies refuse to install cable internet to my area, because of remoteness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm doubtful that co-op will be much fun anymore....really too bad, since what got me into gaming and the most fun ever was getting together with several buddies, and using LAN co-op to play Spec Ops, Halo, and Gears.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Also, I really thought that my day one xbox one would do everything that the 360 would do, only much better.&nbsp; Turns out in terms of gaming fun, the 360 was certainly a superior machine.&nbsp; The xbox one can't do LAN co-op, can't do split screen, no one ever
 talks on it, you have to beg internet strangers to play games with you, you're lucky to get a multiplayer game in 20 minutes on MCC from the time your start up the xbox one, etc, etc.&nbsp; The only real advance seems to be that games are prettier and more fluid.&nbsp;
 Fun-wise though, you're strictly on your own to make your own fun...leave your friends at home.</p>
<p>Also, why would I want to run Windows 10 stuff on my game machine?&nbsp; It's easier just to open my laptop and do stuff with a keyboard and trackpad, then to launch my xbox, try to hook up some keyboard and mouse, and make Word documents, or reddit comments
 etc.</p>

<p>I didn't miss it, I've heard there will be no splitscreen with Halo 5 and I think it's a huge mistake if they go through with it. One of the main reasons I originally loved these games was because of that couch coop.</p>

<p>Firstly, yes, it's been known for a while that Halo 5: Guardians will NOT feature splitscreen. Why? This is so that Halo 5 can maintain a 60fps frame rate at all times, and the highest possible resolution. Split screen would compromise this, and damage the
 visual fidelity. </p>
<p>I believe that Halo 5 should feature campaign matchmaking, just like Reach, but I think the game is probably too far in development to add this.
</p>
<p>Just so I'm clear, it isn't just the campaign that has the lack of split screen. ALL modes in Halo 5 will be without split screen.

<p>Eh losing split screen to make a better game will make a few people upset until they play...and then they'll get over it. I mean it's Halo. So yeah like Cal(Nogga) said, it's going to be in the top 3. Although I do think after a lot of player feedback they'll
 send out an update that allows it to happen in some form. Hopefully. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do you recognize the files?<br />
If there are files you saved from a specific program in the folder?</span></p>
<p><span>It is usually older programs will attempt to save files / settings to a location that requires administrative rights which results in Windows writing the files to the virtualstore folder. A marker is also created
 so that if the program accesses that file again, it will point to the file in the virtualstore folder. So you are using an older program or one not designed for Vista, and its saving to that location, you may try updating the program.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Depending on the files, deleting items from the folder may affect the programs, but yes, you will need to delete them manually.</span></p>

    <title>After using True image 2013 to clone HDD to a SSD, neither HD or SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edpotter  say:</h3>
<h2>            After using True image 2013 to clone HDD to a SSD, neither HD or SSD will boot straight to windows.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: refresh boot sector? </p>
<p>Question: Does the refresh process replace the mbr/boot-loader sector/partition?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was using True image 2013 to clone my HDD to a SSD. The SSD is 240GB, the HDD is 1TB, partitioned ~ 240/720 – and ATI won't clone just the OS partition. I noticed that the process was leaving a small partition (more than 10GB) on the SSD, because there
 was still a partition there. Sooooooo, I backed up the folders, cleared the partition in disk manager, and re-sized the OS partition. In my zeal at implementing this clever thought I somehow erased the boot partition BEFORE CLONING. Neither HD or SSD will
 boot straight to windows, hence the question about the boot partition. Is refreshing an adequate/correct coarse of action at this point?
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            First, I disconnected the former boot drive, (even though it had been reformatted,) the Gigabyte 970A MB, or the BIOS maker seemed to prefer the mechanical drive regardless. Without other drives to go to, the bios allowed me to select and save the Kingston
 SSD as a boot option. <br />
<br />
Then I used the bootrec /fixmbr/fixboot/scanos/rebuildbcd commands, then the bcdedit /set {default} C:, ect., commands, and the problem seemed to have been fixed.<br />
<br />
Apparently nothing is fixed, the computer is still having problems with booting. What's flashing onscreen between the BIOS screen and the Windows logo is MBR Error 3. Booting from the repair disk, auto repair says it can't fix it, and the bootrec and bcdedit
 commands were obviously ineffective. Just to be clear, <b>did you mean that a fresh install of Windows is the only solution if the above commands don't work?</b>
<b>The custom image (recimg) performed a few weeks ago doesn't include boot sector and/or MBR?</b>
<br />
<br />
Acronis services might have helped I believe, if I hadn't already removed it from the computer. Those comprehensive backup and cloud services were a little troubling, but then .....<br />

<div><span>Hi! I need your help. My Desktop started turning on and off every time I put it on , and after I turn it off once to check the plug if it's loose, the symptoms stop. Now my mom started using our desktop but for a moment the blue screen of death shows

 this time. I try it out on our different devices and it works, but in this one it doesn't. I search for the problem and the keyboard isn't listed in my devices. I tried to click the add a device but it doesn't work. Help me what to do now please&nbsp; :(</span></div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
It&nbsp;may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

            <p>These tablets cannot be upgraded.&nbsp; The new/upcoming battery type cover for the Pro 2 will work with the Pro and don't know if it is available yet or still bound for January for availability.&nbsp; That would double your battery life.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Most of the newer accessories to include the docking station is also backwards compatible as well with the 1st generation machines.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can keep up with the accessories at the Microsoft online store under the "Surface" category.&nbsp; There are some newer 3rd party accessories there as well.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
See the next message to fix the .exe issue if needed after you are sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
Try Safe Mode with networking - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot up.<br />
<br />
The top two methods allow the scanners to run and/or get AV.exe out of the way or removal.<br />
<br />
1.<br />
CTRL SHIFT ESC&nbsp; - Task Manager&nbsp; OR Right Click the TaskBar - Task Manager <br />
<br />
Processes tab - End Process on AV.EXE and then proceed with the Uninstall Guide.<br />
<br />
If needed use Start - Computer&nbsp; OR&nbsp; Windows Explorer&nbsp; to navigate to <br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware\mbam.exe&nbsp; or where ever it is installed at - if
<br />
needed Right Click the Malwarebytes - Properties - Shortcut tab -&nbsp;target line to see where it
<br />
is installed.<br />
<br />
Right Click on it and Rename it to ZZMbam.COM (or anything different than it is now) and
<br />
then double click on it and run it that way. You can rename it back later. Do similar with
<br />
other programs as needed. Use this method for others as needed - DO NOT ASSUME any
<br />
one program removes it all or that there&nbsp;is not other malware involved.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
2.<br />
Another method is to use these :<br />
<br />
Use Process Explorer to "Suspend" not Stop&nbsp;the Processes <br />
<br />
Then use AutoRuns to&nbsp;remove the malware startup items.<br />
<br />
Now use UnLocker to delete the files in the malware.<br />
<br />
You may have to do this one file at a time.<br />
<br />

<br />
AV.exe<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
<strong>There are MANY varieties of these with many names however all can be removed with
<br />
the same methods :<br />
</strong><br />
XP Internet Security 2010, Antivirus Vista 2010, and Win 7 Antispyware 2010 are rogue antivirus,&nbsp;<br />
scams to force you to pay for them&nbsp;while&nbsp;they have no benefits at all.<br />
<br />
<strong>How to remove ALL varities of this malware - please read the Removal Instructions
<br />
carefully.<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-antivirus-vista-2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-antivirus-vista-2010</span></a><br />
<br />
<strong>RENAME these as needed to allow them to run : (use another name with the .COM
<br />
extension instead of .exe)<br />
</strong><br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.
<br />
(If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes - free<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Run the Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool <br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; MRT&nbsp; find at top of list - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You should be getting this tool and its updates via Windows Updates - if needed you can
<br />
download it here.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(Then run MRT as above.)<br />

            Yes, you can install Windows 10 again.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Windows 10 Digital License
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

            As long as you do a clean Install of the same version that was installed before, you would find windows activated as soon as you reach desktop.
<br />Windows 10 uses a digital license where your Activation information is stored on MS Servers.

<h2>            Sidebar still showing hidden folders</h2>
                    <p>I recently unhid then hid my hidden folders in Widows 10. Within the Explorer window things look normal, but in the sidebar navigation pane the hidden folders are still showing up. For example, now my C: drive &nbsp;in the explorer bar shows $RECYCLE.BIN and
 System Volume Information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've put my settings to hide hidden items through the View checkbox and also in folder options, but they're still showing up. It's not a killer problem, but it's a constant annoyance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what's going on or how to fix it?</p>

            <p>Hi! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for helping me. I have restarted my computer when the troubleshooter ended.
</p>
<p>I cant login because the box where you input the password stays gray and doesn't let me type the password but then when I force the computer to shutdown and restart it, it lets me type the password.
</p>
<p>I am logged in in a Microsoft account, and I haven't made changes to my computer.
</p>
<p>I appreciate your help. Thank you. </p>

                    <p>Good morning,<br />
</p>
<p>I created .wim following steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 - Add Language Packs "PT-BR"</p>
<p>2 - FODs</p>
<p>3 - Add appx ( UWP)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the images, WIN Home single and multi language are working, but WIN PRO doesnt. I<span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">n sysprep the UWP applications are in Portuguese,
 but then we generalize the image the apps change to English language. </span></p>
<p>Exists one LIP or LXP for PT-BR language?</p>

<p>Hi Felipe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Language interface packs include Windows user interface text for a region, and can provide a better experience in countries or regions where two languages are commonly used. LIPs require at least one language pack (or parent language) to install.&nbsp; For example,
 the Catalan (ca-ES) language interface pack can be installed only if one of the following languages is already installed:&nbsp; English US (en-US), Great Britain (en-GB), Spanish (es-ES), or French (fr-FR).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you have installed Language Interface Pack, then you need to install a parent language in order for the LIP to function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Supported Language Packs and Language Interface Packs, you may refer to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/available-language-packs-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Available languages for Windows</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no Language interface pack (LIP) for PT-BR and you can find the same information from the section
<strong>Language interface packs (LIPs)</strong> in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/available-language-packs-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Available languages for Windows</a>; however, you can download the <strong>Language Experience Pack</strong> for
<strong>Portuguese (Brazil)</strong> from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/pacote-de-experiencia-local-em-portugues-brasil/9p8lbdm4fw35?cid=msft_web_collection&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Pacote de Experiência Local em Português (Brasil)</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, you may refer to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/add-language-packs-to-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Add Languages to Windows</a> and see if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still need help, then please elaborate on the issue, so that we can understand the concern and get back to us to help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Which version of Win 7 you are using in client side,it connected as a domain to win 2008 server.<br />
I hope win 7 system is not a work group.Home networks with one or more computers running Windows 7 may experience slow file transfer speeds, specifically when transferring files with other computers running different operating systems,
<br />
<br />
Disable and turn off Remove Differential Compression feature in Windows 7 may provide a solution to slow file copy, file move or file delete bug.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Click on Windows 7 Start button, then go to Control Panel.</li><li>Click on Programs link.</li><li>Under Programs &amp; Features section, select Turn Windows Features on or off link.</li><li>Uncheck&nbsp; Remote Differential Compression checkbox.</li><li>Click OK.</li><li>Wait for the feature to be deactivated.</li><li>When done, restart&nbsp; computer.</li></ul>
<p>If same issue post here for more help<br />
</p>

            <p>Hi
<span>LENARDKILPATRICK</span>,</p>
<p>Based on the description of the issue, I believe certain programs are freezing on the computer, Please be assured that we will do our best to assist you
<span>with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Please answer the following questions which would help us in understanding the issue:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which programs are you referring to?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Where there any changes made on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When your computer hangs, or freezes it’s disruptive and can slow you down. There are a few reasons your
 computer might hang, freeze or crash. Let’s fix the problem so you can get back up and running.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform the steps mentioned in the following KB article and check if that helps:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Windows hangs or freezes
</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681286</a>
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>
<span>P</span><span>erform clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps
 in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click<b>‘ Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click the
<b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click to select half of the check boxes in the
<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click
<b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected
 in the <b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may
 be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected
 in the <b>Startup Item</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether
 the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>

<h2>            &#34;This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action&#34; error on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When I right click my desktop and click personalize, click the customize button for the taskbar and many other things I get this error. The error goes on to say "please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the default
 programs control panel". However I have no idea how to do that. This isn't an urgent problem but because of it I cannot edit my taskbar, and the icons are quite a bit too small for me. I can still access control panel and personalization though if I search
 for it directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: I have also noticed that when I try to change what my default browser is (to chrome), a big window appears for a split second but then nothing happens. So I guess I also can't change my default browser. I am really starting to regret downloading this
 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example of what happens with chrome</p>
<p>https://i.gyazo.com/348289f7ee22ba85357f1f9df6bcabab.gif</p>
<p>The exact same thing also happens when opening anything in the action center</p>

<p><span><br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. We are glad that you have chosen Windows 10. It is disappointing that you are getting an error message while customizing your computer. Let me help you resolve your issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>This seems to be an issue with some corrupt system file. For now I would suggest you to run
<strong>System File Checker scan</strong>.<br />
<strong>System File Checker</strong> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. This article describes how to run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to scan your system files and
 to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows 8.1<br />
Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files.<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">

            I just installed Windows 10, and its nothing but problems. I share the OP's problem, and my startup tab won't open either. I have gotten 3 prompts to allow live update to work. SFC did not find any problems. This is very frustrating. I have gone from a

<h2>            Windows Media Player wont play anything</h2>
                    <p>Out of nowhere, all of my&nbsp;Windows Media Player videos will not play when I click on them. It would happen randomly and the only thing I have found that fixes it is when I restart the computer.&nbsp;"sever execution failed" is the message I get after about 20
 seconds of wait.</p>
<p>I would love to find an easy way to fix it when it comes up every other day or so</p>

<h2>            Windows Security keeps asking for network password.</h2>
                    I have a seagate NAS110 External Hardrive connected to my computer. Everytime I try and access files in it, a box pops up saying Windows Security and ask for a username and password. I don't have these, I don't think I ever set it up that way. How can
 I disable this? Or what can I do to change the information.

            My system restore don't work too. I don't understand the last link. It seem well for diagnostic, but I need solutions! I used the sfc/scannow fonction. My system seem all right. But I also tried step 5 and I get error 0x80070715. Also, I can't locate the
 registry&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;locate&nbsp;</span><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup/UpgradeInProgress. So I can't set that value to 0!</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>It seem that I got that problem since I got a malware that Avast did not detect. It shut off the firewall, that work again since I removed the malware with MalwareByte.</span></div>
