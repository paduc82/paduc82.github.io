<h2>            Two problems when replying to encrypted emails.</h2>
                    <p>I have two problems when I reply to incoming encrypted emails.</p>
<p>Perhaps they are related, perhaps not.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Configuration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>W10 Pro</li><li>MS Outlook 2016</li><li>gmail account of POP/SMTP type with digital ID on a USB token</li><li>ESET Internet Security</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem 1.</strong></p>
<p>When I open incoming encrypted email and press the reply or reply all button, a new windows opens for me to write my reply.</p>
<p>In the "to" and "cc" fields it shows the people to whom the reply should be sent.</p>
<p>Their email addresses are shown either in friendly form like "John Smith &lt;email address&gt;" or only the email address is shown.</p>
<p>After I finish writing my reply and press send, I get the following error message:</p>
<p><em>"Microsoft Outlook has problems encrypting&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">this message because the following recipients had missing or invalid certificates, or conflicting or unsupported encryption capabilities:"</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This problem applies only to the recipients for whom only the email address was shown.</span></p>
<p><span>I <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">work around this by manually deleting their email addresses and re-inputting their names, so that Outlook can collect their public keys from my address book.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I do not know what determines which recipients, of any given reply, are shown with their full names or without.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However this is not random as exactly the same happens when I reply to the same incoming email multiple times.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">My best guess is that this has something to do with the computer system of the sender of the original email to which I am responding, specifically whether or not it attaches its public key to the email sent to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However it seems to me that Outlook should always check my address book for public keys.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 1 is a big nuisance, but I am able to work around it. The bigger issue is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem 2.</strong></p>
<p>After I finally send my reply and it is moved to my sent items folder often, though not always, I am unable to open it and&nbsp;<span>I get the following error message:</span></p>
<p><em>"Sorry, we're having trouble opening this item. This could be temporary, but if you see it again you might want to restart Outlook. Your Digital ID name cannot be found by the underlying security system."</em></p>
<p>Obviously there is nothing wrong with my Digital ID since I was able to open the original incoming
<span>encrypted </span>email.</p>
<span>encrypted </span>email.</p>
<p>Also the recipients of my reply have no problem opening it.</p>
<p>The only explanation I can think of is that somehow Outlook encrypts my outgoing reply with the wrong certificate, which subsequently cannot be found when I wish to open the sent item.</p>
<p>I have no idea what determines when this problem occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I note that problem 1 has been a part of my life since I started using Digital IDs more than 10 years ago. Problem 2 started at (or coincidentally around) the time when I got a new Digital ID on a USB token and, for some time, simultaneously I had
 two valid IDs for the same gmail account. I had a number of problems with settings in MS Outlook 2016, which now seem to be resolved as the old certificate has expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any helpful non-trivial suggestion would be most welcome as the combined impact of these two problems pose a major drag on my work flow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<br />My best guess is that this has something to do with the computer system of the sender of the original email to which I am responding, specifically whether or not it attaches its public key to the email sent to me.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />It could be - or it's related to the display name on their mail compared to how its in your contact and outlook cant find it. Do you know which names fail or does it just say there was a failure and you need to replace all recipients? 
<br />
<br />On the second problem, does the problem go away if you check the message later?  Since its a gmail account, I suspect the problem is related to IMAP (outlook sometimes has trouble opening recently changed imap messages) and possibly how sent items work in Gmail. (It saves the sent item, not Outlook.)

<p>Thanks, Diane, for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ad 1.</p>
<p>For any specific reply, the error message tells me exactly which names fail. It looks like this is either all names in the reply, or all except the name of the sender of the message to which I am replying. I can see one name that seems to fail always, but
 other names <span>(when they're the sender) </span>either fail or not, no idea why.</p>
<p>I don't understand your suggestion about the display name. If I press reply to an incoming email, I would expect the reply to be populated with the email addresses of its addressees, including their display names as stated in the original incoming email.
 Why should that be compared to my contacts, since clearly Outlook is not reaching to my address book for public keys (because if it did that, there would not be any problem in the first place)?</p>
<p>Anyway, in some case there are discrepancies, in other cases not, and I see no correlation with the problem.</p>
<p>BTW - there are plenty of people who for some reason use different display names. E.g. I may use a more formal name for a specific person, who himself uses a less formal name. Or a name may contain diacritical marks, which are not used by people in other
 parts of the world. I believe this would be impossible to control; only the email address is constant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ad 2.</p>
<p>No, it doesn't go away. I use&nbsp;<span>POP/SMTP instead of IMAP for security reasons.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Reviewing display names I did notice that in the case of colleagues using Comodo certificates, the "issued to" field of these certificates shows their email addresses and not their display names. However, there is no correlation with problem 1, and no relevance
 to problem 2 as my non-Comodo certificate does show my correct and only display name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update on problem 2: I am starting to suspect that the problem is related to one specific addressee of my emails. When I reply to an incoming email with him included, I cannot open the sent item. When I delete him from the addressees of the reply, I can
 open the sent item. No idea why. To be confirmed in future tests as I cannot verify past emails sent (because I cannot open them).</p>

<h2>            Why did microsoft cancel my email&#63; why are they not contactable&#63; to big to fail, again</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I changed my blackberry number. </p>
<p>A few days later an email from microsoft asked me to validate my ID for security reasons. I was asked to give them personal details of recent past emails sent as in "Subject" and other recent email "senders addresses".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft refused my ID, several times. Then they cancelled my email address.</p>
<p>Why is this happening? I've lost 8 years of emails. Microsoft is also not contactable.</p>

<p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get started, we'd suggest restarting your computer and trying the steps in the troubleshooting article:</p>
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/troubleshoot-installing-office-35ff2def-e0b2-4dac-9784-4cf212c1f6c2#O365Plans=signinorgid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot installing Office</a>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest you download the your Office installer from the <a href="https://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Portal</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are already downloading the installer from your portal, we found some threads with a similar code: 30015-25 (-1610612703) that might be related to an issue with Office downloading the required files for install. In this case, to rule out a networking
 issue, please:</p>
<p>1. Try to disable any firewall, proxy, or antivirus momentarily when you are installing Office.</p>
<p>2. Switch to a different network such as your phone's Wi-Fi hotspot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please provide a screenshot of the error so that we can check out the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

<h2>            What happens with emails, if exchange plan licence is removed from O365 user account</h2>
                    Hi! I was wondering, what happens with emails, if user licence is changed to licence without exchange plan included or licence is removed from user. Is exchange mailbox is deleted or it is possible after some time assign licence back and continue using
 old mailbox?

            Hi Imants,<br />
<br />
Yes, if you remove the Exchange license for an Office 365 for business account, its mailbox will be deleted. Also, if the In-Place Hold and Litigation Hold features are available for your Office 365 for Business subscription(<strong>Note</strong>: You can refer
 to this <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/exchange-online-service-description.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> to check it) and the deleted mailbox has been set under hold before, the deleted mailbox will be inactive which means Office 365 will preserve its contents and you can restore it in the future. For more information about inactive mailboxes, please
 check the article: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn144876(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Manage inactive mailboxes in Exchange Online</a>.<br />
<br />
If the deleted mailbox hasn‚Äôt been set under hold before, based on the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn186233(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>, the contents of the deleted mailbox will be stored in Office 365 and you can restore it in 30 days. However, it's not suggest you perform the deletion without any backup. Please back up your data before the deletion to avoid any data losing if
 you're in this scenario.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back if anything is unclear.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Aaron

            Hi Firstcapitalfirearms,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you would like to collapse text to keep the text in cell size in Excel. I would like to suggest you use the Wrap Text feature in Excel. In this case, it appears on multiple lines in a cell. You can format the cell so the text wraps
 automatically, or enter a manual line break. You can find more details in this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Wrap-text-in-a-cell-2a18cff5-ccc1-4bce-95e4-f0d4f3ff4e84?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Wrap text in a cell</a><br />

<p><br />
Thank you for posting your issue in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p><br />
We apologize for the delay in response. We will assist you with your concern about sending picture message. Just to verify where do you access your account in your phone? Is it from an application or web based Outlook.com? What size of the picture message are
 you trying to send?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest to try send emails using a desktop computer and in a web interface of Outlook.com to isolate the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will wait for your response. Your cooperation and understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 forgets mapped network RAID 1 array - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> u123935  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 forgets mapped network RAID 1 array</h2>
                    <p>I am currently on Windows 10 Home version 1703, and very recently added a Startech dual bay NAS drive set up as RAID 1. Setup went well, but a couple of days ago, the drive set up originally as G: disappeared! All lights were ok on the drive (power, drive
 lights, and USB 3.0 connection cable ok).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I took the drive to bits, swapped the two drives over, reassembled, connected up to the PC and switched on. Hey presto, the NAS drive appeared on the network on File Explorer. Being a sceptic, I rebooted, and guess what, the drive had disappeared again.
 It seems I'm not the only person to have this type of problem. I have tried adding the registry entry that worked for some, but it don't work for me.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>In hope</p>

            There is no <span style="font-weight: bold">clear all</span> to delete all in cache file.<br />
<br />
The X at the end of the name will delete but if you have a lot to delete this is not an acceptable option.<br />
<br />
You can try this unofficial fix.<br />
<br />
Quit Outlook <br />
Find Recent Addresses and delete. They are located in this location: <br />
<br />
Your User's folder/Documents/Microsoft User Data folder/Office 2011 Identities/Data Records/Recent Addresses/<br />
<br />
Drill down to find file. When you open Outlook, hold down Option key to rebuild the database.

            <p>Not seeing the device and just what is happening my first thoughts is to verify that the device is NOT set on Flight Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is NOT set on Flight Mode, I would change it to ON then check to see if it works (probably not) then power off the device. Now restart and turn off Flight mode and see if it now works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, perform a hard reset on your device then try it. That should work Elizabeth.</p>
<p>If you can turn on your device you can reset your phone under <strong>Settings:&nbsp; Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone.</strong></p>
<p>To perform a hard reset look here:</p>

<p>In PowerPoint 2016 for Mac, it's already the default. 2011 was created before Microsoft made the switch to widescreen (13.333" x 7.5") format as the normal aspect ratio. So upgrading would solve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a presentation with your preferred slide size and set it as the default. Here are Steve Rindsberg's step to do that:
<a href="http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ01010_Create_your_own_default_presentation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create your own default presentation</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>One small wrinkle is that in PowerPoint 2011, only hundredths of an inch are respected by the program interface. So you can't create a slide that's 13.333" wide, though you can get very close. To really do it right, you should access a Windows copy of PowerPoint
 2013 or 2016, save a blank presentation and open it in PowerPoint 2011. Save it, then set it as the default. The result will be a slide that exactly matches what newer versions of PowerPoint will create by default.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm currently using a Hybrid integration.</p>
<p>I've successfully migrated mailboxes into the cloud it's just this particular one won't move.</p>
<p>So I've tried migrating a mailbox. Using EMC but it didn't look like it was moving at all (No green Arrow and Get-MoveRequests wasn't returning anything. So I've tried it again using powershell with verbose<br />
and it's saying:<br />
"Target user 'TestUser' already has a primary mailbox.</p>

<p>I've ran Get-Recipient -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** | fl On both On-Premise Exchange and MSOnline module<br />
They're both coming back with two different fields populated which looks like that's why it's failed.<br />
It looks like maybe another Sys Admin tried migrating that particular mailbox now it thinks there's two mailboxes one in the cloud and one On-Premise</p>
<p>but when I run on MSOnline Module<br />
remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName TestUser -RemoveFromRecycleBin</p>
<p>I'm getting another error<br />

<p>Hi Will,<br />
<br />
According to the error message, your judgement should be correct. The root cause of the issue should be related to a mailbox duplication.<br />
<br />
When you ran the Get-Recipient command, you could find the duplicated mailbox, but you just couldn‚Äôt remove the duplicated user account. If this is true, I presume the duplicated ‚Äúmailbox‚Äù might not be associated with an actual Office 365 online user account.
 Instead, it may be a deleted mailbox or a mail contact in Office 365 Exchange Online. Please check the PowerShell output of the
<strong>Get-Recipient -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong> (do not need to add
<strong>FL</strong>). Which type can you see under the <strong>RecipientType</strong> column? Is it
<strong>UserMailbox</strong>?<br />
<br />
Also, can you please provide those PowerShell screenshots by clicking <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> -&gt;<strong> Insert/Edit Media</strong>? Please mask any privacy information in it such as domain names.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>correct, when i ran get-recipient on both on-premise an osmodule they both had two different databases, exchangeguid. so i've tried removing the user in the cloud. i'm not sure if i mentioned it's a hybrid integration so i'm also using dirsync for our active
 directory so i don't know if that's another factor why i can't remove the user from the cloud.</p>

<p>Hi Will,</p>
<p>To hard delete the synced user, we need to perform the following cmdlets using Azure PowerShell.<br />
remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName TestUser<br />
remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName TestUser ‚ÄìRemoveFromRecycleBin</p>
<p>Please make sure the related cloud mailbox is removed. After that, please force Dirsync to sync the user as mail user in cloud. Please let me know if you can move the mailbox again using remote move request.</p>

<p>Remove-MsolUser : User Not Found in the Microsoft Online directory Deleted Users container. User: TestUser</p>
<p>At line:1 char:1</p>
<p>+ Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName TestUser -RemoveFromRecycleBin</p>
<p>+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>+ CategoryInfo : OperationStopped: (:) [Remove-MsolUser], MicrosoftOnlineException</p>
<p>+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.Online.Administration.Automation.UserNotFoundException,Microsoft.Online.Administration.Automation.RemoveUser</p>
<p>There's no point doing a Remove-msoluser because when I run Get-Msoluser TestUser it can't find the user</p>
<p>But if I run Get-Recipient TestUser it tells me it's a mailuser</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Will</p>

<p>Hi Will,<br />
<br />
Did you firstly run <strong>Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName TestUser</strong> and then
<strong>Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName TestUser ‚ÄìRemoveFromRecycleBin</strong>? Or you just ran the second command directly?<br />
<br />
I noticed that you mentioned ‚Äú<strong>There's no point doing a Remove-msoluser because when I run Get-Msoluser TestUser it can't find the user</strong>‚Äù, so I suppose you have tried running the two commands in turn, which is the correct action. Is this so?<br />
<br />
If yes, then there mgiht be something wrong about this mail user. Please check if you can find it in the
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Exchange admin center</a> -&gt;
<strong>recipients</strong> -&gt; <strong>contacts</strong>. If you can, please then try if it can be removed directly in the admin center. (if you can remove it directly in the admin center, you also need to run
<strong>Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName TestUser ‚ÄìRemoveFromRecycleBin</strong> then)<br />
<br />
Moreover, I have checked the mail users in my Office 365 tenant. I could run both
<strong>Get-Recipient</strong> and <strong>Get-MsolUser</strong> to find a mail user. Please make sure it is the following ENTIRE command you use:<br />
<strong>Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong><br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Allen<br />

<p>Hi Allen,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay!</p>
<p>Correct I ran both Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName TestUser and then Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName TestUser -RemoveFromRecycleBin. I saw the powershell and though logically I should try and delete the user first then clean up recycle bin but with
 no avail</p>
<p>Yes under Office 365 Exchange portal I can see TestUser un Recipients - Contacts. Tried that and I got this error message</p>
<p>The following error occurred during validation in agent 'Windows LiveId Agent': 'Unable to perform the save operation. 'Bartercard Property' is not within a valid server write scope.'</p>
<p>I've ran the Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName *** Email address is removed for privacy *** in powershell on my machine which is connected to MS Online module looks like it removed it!<br />
It's also gone from Exchange-Recipients-Contacts &lt; that took about 5mins for that to disappear.</p>
<p>TestUser is now sitting in Offce365 Users-Deleted Users which I've now run Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** -RemoveFromRecycleBin - Which I now can confirm it's been deleted.</p>
<p>I've tried without doing a DirSync.<br />
Used EMC on on-premise exchange to move the mailbox up but it doesn't move (No Green Arrows) and it's not in Move-Requests</p>
<p>I tried moving using powershell and getting this error message</p>
<p>The operation couldn't be performed because object 
'*** Email address is removed for privacy ***' couldn't be found on 'Datacentername.prod.outlook.com'<br />
So I'm assuming that I need to run a DirSync first then try again</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Will</p>

<p>Hi Will,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the detailed updates. And I'm glad to hear that the duplicated user account has been removed successfully.<br />
<br />
Also, I would like to know how the current situation is like. Have you tried to force a Directory Synchronization? How does it go?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>Losing space on MS Word with different version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ju2tm3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Losing space on MS Word with different version</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 2 versions of MS Word: Word 2010 and Word 2007 in 2 different place: a PC and a laptop.</p>
<p>Here is the example of what I often got:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Word 2010, I wrote this: "This is just for an example to show what's wrong with this Word."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I saved it in a flash disk, and I opened it in Word 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and when I opened that file in Word 2007, this is what I saw:&nbsp;"This isjustfor anexample to showwhat's wrong with this Word."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>as you can see, there are some "space" that went missing. This thing drove me crazy because then I have to re-read and re-edit my whole document. If it just a page, then it's okay. But when the document reach 20 pages or so? nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestion on what I should do to prevent this from happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks before.</p>
<p>daisy</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What phone model are you using? Though you may try to reset the settings to their original values. Note that your files won't be deleted. So, it is safe to do this. On your phone, go to Settings &gt; Restore factore settings &gt; Settings only &gt; Enter the security
 code. The default code is 12345 unless you changed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option is to uninstall and re-install the application and then check if it works for you. If it's still the same, try to update the phone's software using the Nokia Suite (if it's supported) or your phone itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have recently re-installed my Office for Mac 2011 from a backup disc in exactly the same way as I did last year.</p>
<p>But this time it is asking me to key my product key and it isn't recognised.</p>
<p>We tried to access it via my email address but it won't recognise my email address with this piece of software.</p>

<h2>            EditScript 11 installer not recognizing Word 2007 w&#47; SP3</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2007.&nbsp; In Word it says I have Microsoft Office Word 2007 (12.0.6514.5001) SP3 MSO (12.6607.1000).&nbsp; When I try to install EditScript 11, it tells me the system does not meet the requirements of:&nbsp; Microsoft Word 2007
 Service Pack, after listing&nbsp; Word 2007 with Service Pack 3 or later as the requirement. What is the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            My specific issue ended being that there was a Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack installed which gave me Microsoft Office Word 2007 (12.0.6514.5001) SP3 MSO (12.6607.1000) when I needed it to be Microsoft Office Word 2007 (12.0.6607.1000) SP3 MSO (12.6607.1000)
 for EditScript 11 to accept it.&nbsp;

<h2>            Accidentally unlicensed user</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a user who was accidentally unlicensed, and her mailbox was converted to a shared mailbox (they thought she was leaving the company). I have unblocked and re-licensed her, but I don't seem to know how to reassign her Skype and her Mailbox to her.
 Her mailbox is still intact, and I can give anyone permissions on it, but I want to make sure her Skype and Mailbox become reassigned to her as the only user, and make her Outlook Desktop App recognize her mailbox again. Currently, her username in the Company
 Skype shows up as 1jubg3699u0-n39m320 etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>This ended being a matter-of-time issue. I reinstated her by unblocking her, reassigning a license to her, and converting the
user</span> mailbox with the PowerShell command&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>set-mailbox "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" -Type:Regular&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>After about an hour, everything started appearing normally. The user did show up strange in other users' Skype's until those users logged out and logged back in.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 15.20 - Unable to disable autocorrect and substitutions for ordinals and fractions</h2>
                    <p>I have this disabled in 15.18 and it worked. I am pretty sure that it worked being disabled in 15.19.1, now in 15.20 I cannot get the thing to stop reformatting my typing. I have everything that I can find disabled. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I type 2nd and hit space, I see a blue line under the 2nd and then it changes to super-script. I have managed to disable the ellipse replacement. I have auto replaced un-checked. &nbsp;Everything under AutoCorrect and AutoFormat is unchecked.</p>
<p>Is there another box hidden somewhere that I am missing?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            As far as I know, there is no way for you as a user to calibrate the Accelerometer.&nbsp; If it is way off and clearly not working, return the device for service (or replacement if under warranty).
