<h2>            How long on average does Nokia&#39;s warranty repair take&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My phone got taken for repair last Friday by UPS, and my case id hasn't had an update since, I was just wondering how long I am going to be waiting *on average* to get my phone back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My phone is an N97 Mini, if that helps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is not correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only time a new phone is provided by nokia is when the original cannot be repaired, and is still covered by warranty. &nbsp;A new phone is never provided just because it's taken over 14 days!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Repair times differ all over the world with some countries being far more efficient than others so it's impossible to say exactly how long it will take. &nbsp;The average in one country may be less than two weeks whilst in another it may be over a month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above info applies if you have sent it back to nokia or a nokia care point. If you have sent the phone back to a retailer or your network (if purchased from them) then you will need to contact them about their policy.</p>

<p>I started a thread today about my mini exchange. Normally this would be much faster than a repair but I sent my phone out four weeks ago and still have not been contacted by the warehouse it went to. This is Nokia's distributor, where Nokia's fedex label
 took my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fedex ground shipping took 7 days. If they returned my phone tomorrow it would be just over five weeks I've been without a phone. This exchange was insisted on by Nokia's tech rep. I had just called to find out what was wrong with the OVI suite and when
 I mentioned something the phone did he said it was defective and I needed to get a new one while I was still able to exchange it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had no idea it would take up to six weeks to exchange an initial defect.&nbsp; I'm in the US, west coast.</p>

<p>When my N97 was in repairs and the place of the repair center where it was is less than 2 kilometers from Nokia factory where that phone was made it still took 2 weeks to get fixed.</p>
<p>Reasons for that was that there was 3 day lineup in repairs and rest of the time they have to</p>
<p>wait spare parts.</p>

<p>Can you provide an official nokia link to that information? &nbsp;It certainly doesn't normally work like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes phones do get replaced instead of repaired (happened to me with an E65) but it's certainly not standard procedure to replace phones just because they've been away for longer than 14 days!</p>

<p>No need to scan it, the middle east &amp; Africa warranty terms are listed here:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see it does not state that you are entitled to a&nbsp;replacement&nbsp;if the repair takes longer than 14 days. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you look at the warranties for other regions you will see that nokia does not replace phones just because they've been away for over 14 days, that is why you are misleading people in your initial post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this clears up your confusion so that you don't mislead people in future.</p>

            That is not official nokia paperwork. To me that looks like a service provider/retailer/network agreement so the terms are theirs not nokia's.<br />
<br />
Therefore you are misleading people by saying that nokia will replace a phone after 14 days.<br />
<br />
In future please think very carefully about what you post. This board exists for people to help others, not to mislead them.

<h2>            Windows 10 10049 reverts to 10041 - why&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I'm having problems with an upgrade to build 10049. After installation, it reverts back to 10041, and then shows an error with code 0x8007002c - 0x4001c.</p>
<p>I've done some research, and as I understand, there are 2 possible reasons: anti-virus software conflicts, and hardware conflicts.</p>
<p>I don't have anti-virus software, other than Windows Defender. So, naturally, I suspect hardware problems.</p>
<p>But the last update (to 10041 from earlier builds) went absolutely fine, and there hasn't been any changes with my hardware since then. I've might installed drivers for already connected, but not used devices (i.e., Logitech Momo Racing), but I just don't
 remember.</p>
<p>So, is there any way to determine, which device conflicts with this update? Every attempt to update takes up to 3 hours, so cut-and-try method is very painful.</p>

            <p>Hi Alexandr,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding to the suggestion by <strong>Lawrence , </strong>unplugging everything except keyboard/mouse will definitely help us isolating the issue. In addition to it, put the computer in<strong> clean boot
</strong>state and then run the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot process will help you determine if any third party program/app is causing this issue. It could be some other application or programs, which runs on the computer at the background, leading to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the link below to perform clean boot:<br />
</p>

<strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></strong>
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The troubleshooting steps in the above links are meant for windows 8/8.1, however, you can use the same for windows 10 tech preview as well.</p>

            <p>Tried updating with clean boot today, twice. Both times installation starts, goes up to 4%, then suddenly reboots, and reverts back to 10041. After first attempt, Windows Update mentioned error code 0x80240016, but nothing after second.</p>
<p>I've found the article about this error: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-update-error-0x80240016, and for now I haven't tried solutions from this article. But somehow I doubt that it's relevant, since installation process actually begins.
 On the other hand, Windows Update also downloads update for Windows Defender, and Realtek HD driver (which fails to download), so it may be relevant.</p>

<h2>            How do you link tasks between two projects that are in separate files in Project 2010 without using the Master&#47;Subproject approach&#63;</h2>
                    I need to understand the exact protocol for linking tasks/ dependencies &nbsp;between two or more separate MS Project 2010 files both as stand alone and within Sharepoint 2010. I am not using the master / subproject approach. Thank you for your time. KK

            Hello Kevin57-218,<br />
<br />
Create a temporary consolidated master:<br />
<ol>
<li>Open both Project files in Microsoft Project.<br />
</li><li>On the View tab, select Arrange All.</li><li>Select both file names in the window to create a new project with both projects inserted.</li><li>Select the Predecessor task in one project, CTRL + Click to select the successor task and link as usual.</li></ol>
<p>Close the master, don't save, but do save the changes to the other project files.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Julie<br />

    <title>Outlook.com account hacked - Now unable to remove unknown recovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tyroneseeley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com account hacked - Now unable to remove unknown recovery e-mail address for 30 days.</h2>
                    <p>Hi have a rather worrying situation with my girlfriends outlook.com account which has recently been hacked. &nbsp;Someone has gained access to her account, she first realised when Facebook notified her of unusual activity. &nbsp;We were able to recover the account
 fairly quickly and change both the Outlook and Facebook passwords using my gmail account to verify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However. &nbsp;There is now an unknown e-mail address set up as the recovery e-mail and no other account verification methods added. &nbsp;We are not able to change this for 30 days. &nbsp;I called Microsoft support and asked them to remove this unknown e-mail and they
 were quite adamant that they were not able to override the 30 day lock and remove this unknown account. &nbsp;Aside from being polite, the call centre offered no solution to this issue other than to "monitor the account".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This to me (I am actually a Microsoft consultant) is a totally unacceptable situation and a glaring hole in the security model. &nbsp;Someone else can now re-set the password to her account at any time, the security code / reset link will go to their e-mail.
 &nbsp;We know this, we have notified Microsoft and apparently there is nothing that can be done about it. &nbsp;This hacker gets gifted access to her account for the next 30 days even though we have reported the problem. &nbsp;With that access they can continue to reset
 passwords for any other on-line services within a matter of minutes - as has already happened with Facebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have no way of being notified when the password is reset - because those notifications will go to the unknown e-mail address. &nbsp;The only way we will know is when we cannot sign on all of a sudden. &nbsp;When I asked about closing the account they support desk
 could not confirm that the account would 1) not be able to be reactivated by this other person, and 2) that the e-mail address would remain unavailable for anyone to create a new account with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our only option now is to go through every on-line service she can think of and change the primary e-mail address. &nbsp;Hoping we don't forget any important ones, and hoping that her outlook account is not hacked again in the mean-time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions or of someone with some technical knowledge of the outlook security model can chime in that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tyrone</p>

            <p>Quick update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have worked out that the "unknown" e-mail address is actually a very old Hotmail account of hers.&nbsp; It is likely that this is the account that was originally compromised and used to get into her main account, from there Facebook and Apple (so far).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I am trying to reset the password for this account, or at least somehow disable it.&nbsp; because as of now it can still be used to go up the pipeline and re-set other accounts which we haven't been able to unlink yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again tho, Microsoft is not able to manually disable the account or reset the password and we can't remember much information about the original account.&nbsp; So we are still stuck.</p>

            <p>Hi Bhavya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou for your response.&nbsp; I was eventually bounced around (via numerous phone calls and 2 chat sessions) to a link to lodge a level 2 support request with a team who I was told could fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They simply sent me exactly the same script which was read out to me over and over again by the call centre and then marked the issue as closed.&nbsp; I was told to just try account recovery again.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; I understand that the issue arose because the accounts
 were not properly maintained with up-to-date contact details, although I hardly doubt this is unusual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will however try your link and see if the chat support can help this time and I appreciate your input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should note that both Apple and Google were extremely helpful and we were able to recover and isolate those accounts very quickly, these Microsoft accounts however have remained vulnerable now for well over&nbsp;two days since we first raised the issue that
 someone else had access to them and still we are no closer to securing them.&nbsp; Given the number of other subscriptions and services which can be stolen&nbsp;via access to this account this is&nbsp;not in my opinion acceptable (I&nbsp;am a technical consultant for other&nbsp;Microsoft
 products).&nbsp; At the moment we are working through moving all of her online subscriptions etc over to a Gmail account with no associations to these Microsoft accounts.</p>

            <p>Hi Tyrone,</p>
<p>I had exactly the same problem around February last year. It took over a month to resolve completely. Microsoft kept asking me to verify email addresses and passwords and answers to security questions that were nothing to do with me and everything to do
 with the hacker. Even experts couldn't do anything about it. I had to go into hospital and leave all of the phone calls and arguments to my daughter whilst I was in their. Everyone was tearing their hair out and banging their heads against the wall and still
 we got nowhere. Fortunately I don't do online banking and I pay for everything using Paypal. I rang them and closed everything down so that nothing could be accessed. As I said it took over a month before it was all sorted and a further 3 weeks before everything
 was cleared. I wish you luck with this but doubt very much that you'll get it cleared in less than the 30 days. PoorlY PCs, who are my nights in shining armour if I get a virus or something, as I'm a raging technophobe, actually wrote a lengthy stiff letter
 to Microsoft. They didn't even have the decency to send him a reply. You will probably also get no end of bods from all over the world phoning you and claiming to be Microsoft or directed by Microsoft to put your computer problems right.</p>
<p>Good luck my friend</p>

            Yup that's pretty much it. &nbsp;Nothing they can/will do to fix the issue, let alone in a timely manner. &nbsp;Just had to de-link everything we could think of from the compromised account. &nbsp;Still monitoring the account waiting for the 30 days to pass. &nbsp;Will then
 re-set the recovery options and mothball the account.

<h2>            Delete a blank row</h2>
                    
<p>I have a spreadsheet I downloaded from my accounting software.&nbsp; There are several blank rows through my sheet that I want to delete.&nbsp; I am unable to sort to remove them.&nbsp; I retrieved this macro from another thread, but I don't fully understand it.</p>
<p>In the ActiveSheet Module run the following Macro:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LR = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For R = LR To 2 Step -1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Application.Count(Range(Cells(R, 3), Cells(R, 6))) = 0 Then<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Onenote Web Cliper on Firefox</h2>
                    <p>Dear all</p>
<p>Since before, I have been using Chrome as my default web browser but due to some reasons, I changed my choice to Mozilla Firefox.After that, I Started to install the extensions I used to, but the Microsoft Onenote Web clipper was disappointing. Did Microsoft
 provide any official extension for MS Onenote on Firefox?<br />

            <p>Hey there, Chad here from the OneNote team. &nbsp;In the last Firefox update I missed a step, and as a result you're hitting that error. &nbsp;The fix has been made but it still needs to get deployed (ETA later today, early tomorrow). &nbsp;So sorry!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, there is a workaround. &nbsp;If you right-click the link and download the .xpi file, you can double-click it and install the extension that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I'm sorry for the hassle with this. &nbsp;The proper steps for updating have been burned into my head and I will not miss it again. :-)</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Meneely,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, if the folder was deleted by the owner, the related item will be automatically removed from our Shared with Me folder.</p>
<p>To investigate the problem, could you please help us confirm some information below?</p>
<ol>
<li>Which account you are using, Office 365 for personal account or Business account?</li><li>Have you tried sharing other files and folders with this group and then deleting them &nbsp;to check whether they are still in the group’s shared folder?
</li><li>Please try sharing files and folders with other groups and to check whether the problem is related to the specific group.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Ericaas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're unable to playback&nbsp;some of your music content via the Windows 10 Groove App</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;As noticed by you, Groove App is compatible with a certain types of files, for a list, please refer to the web site below:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3078112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3078112</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If some of your files are in unsupported file format and are unrestricted by the DRM, converting those to the compatible format with the use of a third party program, should allow you to playback via Groove App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more help in relation to Groove App please check the link:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3079301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3079301
<br />
</span></span></a></p>
<p>For additional information about Windows 10 Programs &nbsp;that would allow you to convert the file formats, I would recommend posting a new Discussion on the Windows 10 Files, Folders &amp; Storage Section of the Forum :</p>

<p>Yes even Music I own, CD's I I uploaded, those guys drop the ball on this one</p>
<p>first they were Windows Media, then they Switch to Zune, DRM wouldn't transfer, then from Zune to XBOX, there
</p>
<p>again the DRM wouldn't transfer, Now from XBOX to Grove, not even DRM but now Files WMA dead, MP3 ,Dead</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft, find a Music Program and stick with it Going back to ITunes, let me know when they get it right</p>

<h2>            OWA App for Android</h2>
                    
<p>I use OWA for Android and it has issues. (Also, why is there an "Outlook" app and an "OWA" app - this is unnecessarily confusing and MS should so something about that)</p>
<ul>
<li>The app takes too long to load. </li><li>Sometimes I don't get notifications for new emails. Or when I do, it will just say "One new message" and not give me a preview of the sender or subject.
</li><li>If I am on my computer and get a new email, I'll open it on the computer, then I'll still get a delayed (by several minutes) notification on my phone.
</li><li>The calendar view is unusable. It needs an overhaul badly. </li></ul>
<p>I'm submitting this feedback here because the "Feedback" link on the app does not work (Seriously?!?)</p>

<h2>            PDF WopiFrame URL is resolved as a ROOT FOLDER containing that PDF</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Recently we observed that any PDF WopiFrame&nbsp;URL on our SharePoint Online Site Collection is redirecting to the folder containing it. Whereas the default behavior should be opening it in the browser (WopiFrame)&nbsp;which was there before few days. Again to make
 it clear, these URLs are linked to our custom UI and we are not talking about clicking the document in a Document Library. Has there been any recent updates in the SharePoint Online that has withdrawn the WopiFrame support for PDF files? Also suggest a workaround
 to open these PDF WopiFrame URL till we get a permanent solution.</p>
<p>Appreciate your help!</p>
<p>Thank You</p>
<p>Jitendra </p>

<p>Hi Jitendra,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To better understand the situation, I’d like to confirm the following things:<br />
1. Some URLs of the PDF files which are linked to your custom UI and the URL of that SharePoint site collection.<br />
2. For other Office applications, if we create the same WopiFrame URL, will they open properly with Office web app?<br />
3. How do you add the link to the custom UI?<br />
4. Which browser do you use? If you change to another browser, can the pdf file be opened online? Do you install Adobe Reader on your computer?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For privacy protection, I have sent you a private message for collect the URLs mentioned above. You may find the message via the URL
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Moreover, I found that we can use the URL <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<a href="https://domain.sharepoint.com/sites/abc/libraryname/xxx.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://domain.sharepoint.com/sites/abc/libraryname/xxx.pdf</a>&nbsp;</span>to open a PDF file online with Firefox, you may try adding this URL to your custom UI and then check the outcome.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>Thanks for looking into this. Please refer the answers to your queries in same order below -</p>
<p>1. Since our site is a MBI site, I cannot share Site Collection/ Document URL. However the typical URL structure for PDF is as below</p>
<p>https://domain.sharepoint.com/teams/sitecollection/subsite/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc={266F2B7E-3246-4FA6-934E-4E72085AB941}&amp;file=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.pdf&amp;action=default</p>
<p>2. Yes, the WopiFrame URLs are working for Word / Excel / PowerPoint / OneNote&nbsp;&nbsp;documents but not for PDF</p>
<p>3. We are using HTML anchor &lt;a&gt; tag and assigning URL to its HREF for adding it to UI</p>
<p>4. I tried IE11 and Chrome but the issue is same on both. Yes I have Adobe Reader 11 installed on my machine.</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Jitendra </p>

<p>Hi Jitendra,</p>
<p>You can try use the URL below in Chrome to check the Outcome. Use the path of the file.<br />
<a href="https://xyz.sharepoint.com/sites/abc/Deliverables/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=/sites/abc/Deliverables/def/CRS_document_rev1.docx&amp;action=default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://xyz.sharepoint.com/sites/abc/Deliverables/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=/sites/abc/Deliverables/def/CRS_document_rev1.docx&amp;action=default</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, Does the Wopiframe URL work well in both IE and Chrome? At that time, does the PDF file opened in PDF Reader or Word Online?</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />

<p>Hi Jitendra,</p>
<p>Based on my test, we cannot use Office Online to directly open PDF file, so the Wopiframe redirect the URL to the root folder. If we use PDF reader to open the URL, it is related to the browser. Chrome or Firefox can directly open the PDF in browser. You
 may use the URL <a href="https://xyz.sharepoint.com/sites/sitename/libraryname/xxx.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://xyz.sharepoint.com/sites/sitename/libraryname/xxx.pdf</a>&nbsp; to open the pdf file in PDF reader add-in with Chrome and Firefox.</p>
<p>Moreover, I'd like to confirm something via private message. You can find the message via the URL
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Tim</p>

<p>Thanks for the information. However it was used to open PDF earlier in WopiFrame and that is my question if some recent cloud updates in WopiFrame engine stopped supporting PDFs. Can you please help to confirm this?</p>

<h2>            How to open an outlook message in another Programme&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys</p>
<p>I have Outlook 2013 on my laptop but on my other machine I just run Windows Live Mail just really to monitor my mailboxes and send the occasional message when I have to from that PC. Normally not a problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just copied over some folders from my laptop that have a bunch of serial numbers in mails that were downloaded in Outlook, which I need to open to run some software and of course they don't open on my PC. Can anyone tell me if there's a compatibility programme
 out there I can install to read these mails on my PC or a simple work around?</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5800&#58; Cannot Safely Remove USB &#47; phone in Win 7</h2>
                    
<p>I connect my 5800 XpressMusic via cable to PC Suite 7.1.60 on my laptop with Windows 7 Home Premium w/ SP 1. My settings show notifications for "Safely Remove USB" but can never find it if all I'm connecting to is my 5800.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I close all phone-related windows including PC Suite and Win Explorer, I still cannot figure out a way to safely remove USB. My last resort is to always go to Control Panel / Device Manager and turn off manually under Portable Devices and Ports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<p>If 5800XM connected in <strong>PC Suite mode</strong> there is <strong>no</strong> need to look for "safely remove USB" as this would only apply if connected in "mass storage" mode as a Windows USB mass storage device.</p>

<h2>            Referencing Excel Tables in Formulas</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to build a loan amortization model that takes its inputs from separate tables. I have a small table for inputs and I am using VLOOKUP to bring up the loan information based on the Loan ID. The problem comes into place when choosing the table
 to pull from. I have a few tables (Based on the company that the loan is from) and am looking for an easy way to change which table is referenced in the VLOOKUPs. Here is a snapshot of the input table:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2e4d66e-6b01-4b97-986f-0c9e9d4d44ac?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2e4d66e-6b01-4b97-986f-0c9e9d4d44ac?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way for me to reference a table in B2 so that I can make the formula more interchangeable? Making the table more like this:</p>

<p>Hans's reply probably answers your specific question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is some info about Excel features you are not aware of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a format feature in excel called "tables".&nbsp; What you have screen captured are not excel tables. Tables are a wonderful feature that enable lots of automation to make formula creation easier. One part of that automation is use of "Structured References".&nbsp;
 Tables are named, and in the process of defining / inserting the table the columns become named (ranges).&nbsp; In formulas, rather than using Row Column references you column names and optionally table names.<br />

Excel table is a series of rows and columns with related data that is managed independently. Excel tables, (known as lists in excel 2003) is a very powerful and supercool feature that you must learn if your work involves handling tables of data.<br />

Ever seen a formula like =SUMIFS(Sheet1!B2:B3923, Sheet1!C2:C3923, A1, Sheet1!D2:D3923, A2) and wondered what it is really doing?!?<br />
Formulas written with cell references tend to look complicated and clunky. What if we could write formulas in plain English? That is what Structural References do. When using structural references in formulas, your focus will be on your data, not on which cell
 ranges the data takes up. For example, you can write formulas like these:<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SUM(mySales[no. of customers]) to find how many customers we had.<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SUMIFS(mySales[no. of customers], mySales[product], “FastCar”) to find how many customers bought “FastCar”</span></p>

<p>I tried the 'Clean Boot' - it didn't help.</p>
<p>Please suggest the next solution.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 completely freezes when replying to emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryano22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 completely freezes when replying to emails</h2>
                    <p><i>Outlook 2010</i></p>
<p>Hopefully you can help me?<br />
</p>
<p>Setup:</p>
<p>- Outlook 2010 (Office Pro Plus 32-bit)</p>
<p>- Windows 7 Enterprise</p>
<p>When a particular user in my organisation replies to some HTML emails Outlook completely freezes and needs to be ended via Task Manager and restarted. I think i've narrowed down the problem to HTML emails with embedded images (which is a lot given people
 have them in their signatures etc). If I delete the images before sending then it sends straight away.</p>
<p>I've been able to replicate the problem for the same user on a different machine, so it's not a machine/profile issue as far as I can see.</p>
<p>I've also tried running in Safe Mode, removing add-ins and deleting Heltvecia Font (apparently often a cause of problems).</p>

<br />
Are the images hyperlinked? What is the extension of the image file? Is it Jpeg, bmp or something else?<br />

<p>
</p><p>I welcome you to the Microsoft Community Support. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How are you? We hope that you are doing well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I totally feel your frustration as you already have contacted a number of people. Let's work together in resolving your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon reviewing your post, I see that you are having 2 different issues at the same time. Right now, I deem that we still need a couple of information to be able to determine the&nbsp;root problem&nbsp;with your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-What do you exactly mean by "MSN code"?</p>
<p>-With your receiving issue, have you tried sending a test email to yourself?</p>
<p>-With the freezing computer issue, does this only occurs when using <a href="https://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook.com</a>?</p>
<p>-If so, what are you trying to do when the screen freezes? Are you sending, composing, clicking on functions, etc.?</p>
<p>-Have you tried using different computers and browsers? Does the issue persists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, you may want to clear your browser's cache. If you need a guide to do that please
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also create a private message area for us so you can provide some sensitive information for us here in Microsoft to be able to investigate on this issue further. P<span>lease make sure you are signed in to be able to view my response.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>Note: You can open the private message by clicking the red link above your post that says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><em>"You have a private reply to this message. Click here to read it on our secure private messages section."</em></span></p>

            <p>I have obviously been scammed!&nbsp; Every time I tried to get into Outlook, the screen gave a message that "in order to protect my security" I needed to have a MSN Code.&nbsp; At first, I ignored it, thinking it might be a scam&nbsp;- but I could not get into my emails
 at all because I couldn't get past the code message.&nbsp; I finally gave in and said okay.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spent hours on the phone&nbsp;with Gary, Steve and Sunny, because in the process of getting my MSN "Code," I lost all my emails and my computer started freezing constantly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also paid $299 for all this "help."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't believe I was so stupid!!!&nbsp; I'm angry with myself for falling for it,&nbsp;and with MSN for not protecting me from these scammers using their name and logo.</p>

<p>
</p><p>These suckers here - what the heck are they!? &nbsp; I copied and pasted from online swagger docs and get these special symbols that I cannot find in find/replace. &nbsp; (not a paragraph and not a line break...?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a paragraph symbol. &nbsp;That was the reason for my question. &nbsp;In my document, I see paragraph symbols and line break symbols which I can replace. &nbsp;Then there are THESE symbols above. &nbsp;I have no clue what they are. &nbsp;They cause an extra line and came
 from a json html paste. &nbsp;( "Unix End Of Line" maybe? ) &nbsp;See the image below, you will see paragraph symbols and line break symbols and I can replace these but the other ones can't be 'found &amp; replace'd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** ALSO - I cleared all formatting when I pasted. **</p>

            The exact display of the ¶ mark depends on the font being used. Some of the symbols you have highlighted certainly look like paragraph marks to me (created as you press Enter). The "bent" arrows, on the other hand, are line breaks (Shift+Enter). See

            <p>Sad to say that this kind of file may not be saved. It's not a valid file that the phone may recognize. Does it play at all on your device? You may be able to just save it to your Xbox Video hub if you load and play the video and select the ... in the bottom
 right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, 3gp won't work on the phone. Have them send it in an email and download it to your PC.</p>
