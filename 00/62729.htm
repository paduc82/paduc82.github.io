    <title>Audio File Renaming Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roy whitethread  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio File Renaming Problem</h2>
                    My operating system is Windows 7 Professional, and I have a problem with the names of audio files.I have over 27,000 ,mainly mp3 files,which I sorted into folders by artist's name, in alphabetical order,and the audio files in the folders are sorted alphabetically
 by the artist's name.From time to time when I open a folder I find that for some unknown reason some of the files have been renamed in (to my eyes) a meaningless way.For example a file named 5th Dimension-Go Where You Wanna Go.mp3 is now shown as 5THDIM~3--0.
 I only knew the correct name by playing the file in Winamp, which I use for most of my audio files. What concerns me is that whatever gremlin is causing this odd behaviour might eventually rename all my audio files, and it would be a mammoth task to rename
 them correctly. (All the files are backed up to a network attached storage drive, but the same odd name changes occur in that too).The extra annoyance with this is that I have to trawl through all the individual folders

            Hello Waynstar, I use Winamp or Windows Media Player to play my audio files. I unchecked all the library options in both programs and have had no problems with renaming audio files since.I hope this helps.<br />

            Hi, Chris32Ui 
<br />
<br />You should try to repair the Operating System completely for this you must follow these steps and recover the files. To follow these steps you have to ask for a borrowed computer and have a USB. Check this link, I hope you can solve the problem.

    <title>A few quick questions&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jared pelletier  say:</h3>
<h2>            A few quick questions&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I have a few quick questions about the game, now that it is released, that some of you may be able to help me with.&nbsp; I played DotP to death, and I am looking forward to giving this installment a try, but I am curious about the following,</p>
<p>1. Can I choose how I want to spend my mana when I cast a spell? I got caught a few times in DotP where the system chose the wrong combination of mana for me, and thus forced me out of a set play I was trying to run (i.e. I wanted the first spell to use
 all green mana, and the second to use all black, but the computer felt otherwise).</p>
<p>2. Two-Headed Giant on 4 different consoles? My brother and I enjoy playing this together, but we don't live in the same city.&nbsp; Can a team now be on two different Xbox's?</p>
<p>3. Anything done to prevent players online from running the timer and making the games drag out?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your time. Like I said, I tried to find some of this information, but I was unsuccessful.&nbsp; See you guys online!</p>
<p><em>I had a bunch more questions, but I realized they are rule based, not product based.&nbsp; Any good websites out there that could help me resolve some of my MTG questions?</em></p>

<p>Hi <em>Realplay9945</em>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We've noticed that the post you've created went idle, while the issue has not been attended yet. We'd like to know if you're still needing further assistance on this. It would also be lovely if you can share to us the solution you found to work with the
 problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you still need assistance, please tell the exact error message that you're getting. We've tried checking the dongle you have online. It even shows on its package that it is completely compatible with Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Please consider to uninstall the driver from the Device Manager. Check on its maker's site if there's a tool that can help you do this.</p>
<p>- Reinstall the Bluetooth dongle. If it has a UI, it can help you check for the latest version of the driver.</p>
<p>- Last option is to install the driver in <strong>Compatibility Mode:</strong>

<h2>            Epson R1900. Since windows 10 upgrade, I can not configure printer.</h2>
                    <p>Since I upgraded to Windows 10 when it first was available, I have not been able to customize my R1900. I do not have the ability to configure the better to print in Best mode; draft mode, etc. I not have the ability to print onto more then 4-5 different
 sizes of paper, or even check print levels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check with Epson and they tell me I need to use print driver #15167. I down loaded it and tried to let it install the driver, but it will not. I also checked and the printer says it IS using that print driver!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Dell Inspiron 15 7000 series.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea how to get back the functionality I need. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Timothy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with Printer on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, please reply to the following questions:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Do you get any error message while installing the Printer drivers?</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong><span>Have you installed the Printer software on the system?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the printer settings are incorrect or if the drivers corrupted. Try the following troubleshooting procedures and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Run the Printer troubleshooter</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with Printer. Follow below steps:<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Right click on <strong>Start</strong> button, select <strong>
Control Panel</strong>.<br />
<strong>2. </strong>Change the view by option on the top right to <strong>Large</strong> icons.<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and select <strong>
Hardware and Sound</strong>.<br />
<strong>4. </strong>Run the <strong>Printer</strong> troubleshooter and follow on screen instructions.
</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Enable the Print Spooler service</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>The Print Spooler enhances the print jobs and handles the interaction with the printer.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Right click </strong>on <strong>Start </strong>menu and select
<strong>Run</strong>, type the command <strong>services.msc </strong>and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Search for the <strong>Print Spooler </strong>service and right click on the service, select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Under General tab, make sure <strong>Automatic</strong> is selected under the drop down menu of
<strong>Startup type</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: Update the Drivers</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Driver updates </strong>for Windows 10 and many devices (such as monitors, printers, and video cards) are automatically downloaded and installed through Windows Update. While it's likely you already have the most recent driver, if you're having trouble
 with a device, you can try fixing it by updating the driver or reinstalling it. Here's how:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Select the <strong>Start</strong> button, type <strong>Device Manager,</strong> and select it from the list of results.
</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Update Driver Software.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If these steps don't work, try reinstalling the driver: Open <strong>Device Manager,</strong> right-click (or tap and hold) the name of the device, and select
<strong>Uninstall.</strong> Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of Printer issue and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

    <title>Miracast&#58; Device No Longer Connects - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Miracast&#58; Device No Longer Connects</h2>
                    <p>For the better part of a year the Miracast has functioned flawlessly, projecting on screen streaming media to my Roku device. In late March, all that changed.
<br />
<br />
The "entertainment" device is found when I attempt to add; followed with "connecting;" it then displays (showing a loading bar beneath the device); and, suddenly disappears unable to connect.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The device shows faintly in the "Device and Printers" folder:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a243f9b8-08a6-4d8f-850c-f81a1732d19f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a243f9b8-08a6-4d8f-850c-f81a1732d19f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in the "Device Manager" it does not show any errors or conflicts:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bb7fe56-2f4b-4fc1-b807-2e75ea3ed212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bb7fe56-2f4b-4fc1-b807-2e75ea3ed212" /></a><br />

Lenovo G50-45<br />
Windows 8.1 64-bit<br />
AMD A8-6410 APU<br />
AMD Radeon R5&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how this can be corrected?<br />

            Do a cold boot (power down the system manually), which means hold down the power button until the machine turns on. Start the machine again.
<br />
<br />
The Advance Boot Options menu might be displayed when you start the machine, if it does, select:<br />
"Last Known Good Configuration'<br />
<br />
Press enter and proceed to boot up. <br />
<br />
If all goes well and you have sucessfully logged in and reached the desktop, try the following:<br />
My recommendation would be to install the updates in batches, such as 5 at a time, exclude hardware/driver updates. Avoid installing a combination of Microsoft Windows and Office updates at the same time. Also, try installing the small updates first. Avoid
 installing things like .NET Framework and SQL Express Updates.<br />
<br />
Restart each time you install the updates (its a chore, but it guarantees a more reliable experience). Try starting out with Microsoft Office Updates for programs such as (Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint).<br />
<br />
Another thing, try downloading the updates then install them. When prompted to restart, disconnect from the Internet and restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Proceed with installing the additional updates.<br />
<br />
If the computer continues to become non-responsive, try the following:<br />
<br />
You can&nbsp; reset&nbsp; Windows Update components by running the Fixit on this page.&nbsp; But, if there's malware present, it will continue to reset the connection to the update servers:<br />
<br />
How do I&nbsp; reset&nbsp; Windows Update components<br />
&nbsp;&lt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058&gt;<br />
Suggest you download and save the Fixit.&nbsp; Then configure the system to Clean boot prior to running it:<br />
<br />
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista/Windows 7<br />
&lt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135&gt;<br />
<br />
Once the Fixit has been downloaded and the system booted to the Clean state, check to see that the native Windows firewall is now On if a 3rd party firewall was being used previously.&nbsp; Now run the Fixit and choose the Default mode.&nbsp; Restart once it's done and
 see if the system can connect to the update servers.&nbsp; If it can not, then run the Fixit again and choose the Aggressive mode.&nbsp; Restart when it's finished running and check for updates.<br />

<p>Hello Belligund,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's determine the cause of the issue. To get started, I'd like to get the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this your first time to encounter this issue? If so, did you make any changes to your computer's configuration prior to the issue?</li><li>Are you trying to launch Task Manager though shortcut key or though run command?</li><li>Are you able to launch any other utilities?</li><li>Can you please confirm the current build of your Windows 10?<br />
&nbsp;(Type <strong>winver </strong>into the Cortana search box, then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I recommend to boot your PC in safe mode. <strong>Safe mode </strong>
starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services to help troubleshoot issues. To do so, please follow these steps:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Update &amp; security.</strong></li><li>Open <strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Advanced startup</strong>, select <strong>Restart now.</strong></li><li>&nbsp;After the PC restarts to the <strong>Choose an option screen</strong>, select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced options.</strong></li><li>Under <strong>Startup Settings</strong>, hit <strong>Restart</strong>.</li><li>After the PC restarts, select <strong>5 </strong>or <strong>F5 </strong>for <strong>
Safe Mode with Networking.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If a problem doesn't reappear when you start your PC in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings, basic device drivers and services as possible causes.<br />
<br />
We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail closes unexpectedly repeatedly without error message and one account disappeared&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Windows Live Mail closes unexpectedly repeatedly without error message and one account disappeared?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have multiple accounts being used for years on Windows Live Mail - &nbsp;Version 2009 - Build 14.0.8117.0416 on XP Pro SP3</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently,&nbsp;Windows Live Mail closes unexpectedly repeatedly without error message</div>
<div>Then as I kept trying to figure out I noticed one account disappeared? I think that happened later.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have the ENTIRE WL MAIL Log file.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To track why this was happening I went offline mode and it would not crash. So, I figured it was something to do with the Sync.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I disabled the Auto Sync for every account I had and did manual syncs for one account at a time. Found the account that was causing this.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Its a hotmail account. I signed into Hotmail and all seems ok. I am posting the follow lines from the LOG, when I manually synched that account from WL Mail a few times.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I could try to trace back into the LOGS as to when this drama actually started originally, and post that and / or most of it. Let me know if someone can help dissect Windows Live Mail issues. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>found due to Sync of one account, Error Log info posted.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Intel&#40;R&#41; HD Graphics 4600 keeps crashing with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have an ASUS Gaming Laptop and ever since I downloaded W10 I keep getting this error pop up saying my display driver has crashed and recovered. But it didnt recover because the online game program I use freezes and I have to log out and relog every time
 it does this. How do I fix this? I like W10 but if I have to uninstall W10 to fix this issue I will. I tried updating my drivers. Checking for Windows Updates and everything says its up to date. Can you please provide a link to a download of the Intel(R) HD
 Graphics 4600 driver that will keep this from happening?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>

<h2>            windows 10, right click in explorer, strange issue</h2>
                    <p>basically, upgraded to windows 10, everything ran fine for a few weeks then suddenly when i right click the left panel on any of my drives it auto closes explorer, gives me red screen, same color as my desktop color choice, comes back, most of my task bar
 icons are gone, takes a little while for them to return, then i notice the start button won't open when i click it, search doesn't work and notifications are set to (off) even though i never changed said setting for notifications. a reboot fixes this, but
 the second I right click in that left panel it freaks out again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help? can't seem to find anything with my specific issue.</p>

            done all this, the problem didn't occur until after a windows 10 update, i prefer not to mess with uninstalling updates if possible, but i have scanned, done everything you have listed and the problem still happens, literally nothing has changed on my
 system since updating to windows 10, only windows updates, normally i don't bother with updates as they tend to break more than they fix, and it seems in this case i was right...

 restarted my xbox and bo3 still says moderate all the while my xbox nat is open. Ive tried portforward.com which was useless that only tells you the xbox ones ports. Everyone else seems to have open nat on bo3.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I have a BT Homehub v5.0A with the latest update and all the ports are saved.<br />

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>On a side not portforward's program preconfig is a con.. they say you can free trial the program but you actually cant, to use that feature you have to buy it for $39.99.. its port
 checker feature tell you your ports are closed, if that was true then i wouldn't be connected to the internet.</span></strong></p>

            <p>Dear Syed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife uses a Lenovo z500 PC connected by a wireless link to our home network. She is currently running Win 8. For the avoidance of doubt we are trying to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have now tried to upgrade this PC 4 times. (For the record 2 other PCs in the house also failed to load Win 10.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1. No devices are connected to the PC other than a mouse, loudspeaker and a 1GB USB memory chip. The PC connects to the Internet vai a 10GB/s Wifi link to the house network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2. The clean boot was successful, but it also disconnected the wireless network and prevented the download!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3.</p>
<p>SFC /scannow and DISM both ran successfully and the latter reported all faults had been fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade subsequently failed with error 8007005 as before. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            folder disappeared after dragging it with mouse</h2>
                    So I was dragging a folder off the USB drive to the desktop. I was dragging the folder up over the "Share Burn.... " menu bar and I must have let off the mouse button. Now the folder is completely gone and I cant find it anywhere? What the H$#@. Any ideas
 where the folder went?<br />

<p>move to, copy to, or cancel.</p>
<p>If you know the name of the folder,</p>
<p>Click the start button and type the name of the folder into the explorer box you might get lucky and it will list it.</p>

<p>Todo mundo que usa JTAG/RGH sabe disso. É por isso que eles não entram na live, por que assim que eles entrarem eles vão ser banidos. Mas eles podem baixar o jogo que eles quiserem e instalar atualizações através do USB, então eles nem precisam da live,
 a não ser que queiram jogar online (por isso eu já vi muita gente que tem um Xbox normal para jogar online e outro com JTAG).</p>

    <title>GAMERTAG PRE-APPROVAL REVIEW - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            GAMERTAG PRE-APPROVAL REVIEW</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Does Xbox Live provide a means by which their clients may submit a Gamertag (GT) for review for conformance with current interpretations of all of Xbox
 Live’s policies (e.g. TOU, COC et.al.) and have the GT “pre-approved” by the Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement Team (XBLPET) prior to actually spending money for a GT change?
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In a recent enforcement action the Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement Team (XBLPET) determined that my Gamertag,
<strong>[Mod removed]</strong> (a word-play on the sound-alike profession of engineering), was “inappropriate”, forced a GT change and assigned me the automatically generated GT “ScaryPup9881961”. I have no desire to keep the GT assigned by the XBLPET team
 and would like to change it. But, I have some apprehension. I’ve been told by XBPET that must pay Xbox Live $10 for the privilege of changing my name from the one that they’ve assigned. Their rationale is that my choice of GT violated the Code of Conduct (lack
 of intent notwithstanding) and thus was forfeit from the time of its creation. My concern is that XBLPET will now or some distant time in the future (my last GT was okay for 7 years -- before it wasn’t) determine that the new GT is in violation and I’ll be
 asked to again pay Xbox Live for the privilege (aggravation?) of creating yet another GT.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">My goal is adhere to all of Xbox Live’s policies. But, the determination what violates those policies is incredibly subjective. I’m of the sincere opinion
 that my former GT was not in violation. Nevertheless, XBLPET is the sole arbiter of compliance in this arena. Consequently, I feel it is reasonable to request Xbox Live to validate a GT prior to issuance.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Does Xbox Live offer such a service? One that is respectful of the finances of Xbox Live’s clients by ensuring compliance in advance?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Your consideration and response is appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kind Regards,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ScaryPup9881961</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">* Note: I left the "U" out of my old GT in the message above in order not to offend.<br />

<p>In writing my post above, I did not properly consider the effect the moderator’s redaction would have on the clarity of my assertions in my June 7, 2015 post. Consequently, I’d like to expand on a few items in my above post. I will respect of the moderator’s
 editing and keep the moderator-redacted format of the GTs. I know this makes no difference to my resolution of my former GT, but I think it important for those reading this and having similar experiences to understand the level of inconsistency XBLPET demonstrates.</p>
<p>In summary, my old GT was an 11-character string beginning with an 8 letter word that sounded like the profession of “engineer”. XBLPET determined that the first five letters (which sounds like “engine”) of that word is a derogatory term for Native Americans.
 The last three letters of the first word matched the spelling of the part of the body one hears with. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Okay, so &lt;sounds like “engine”&gt; is derogatory to Native Americans. Fair enough. Xbox can make that determination for its service and I respect their right to do so (despite examples their support for the use of the term in other areas of their service e.g.
 Call of Juarez and other western genre games). But I take issue with, having made that determination, XBLPET not being uniform in its application. There are at least two other GTs out there with identical spelling as my old GT:</p>
<p>The GT [Mod Removed] (an 8-letter GT which matches the first 8 letters of my former GT exactly) is OKAY and continues to exist.</p>
<p>The GT [Mod Removed] (a 12- character GT with “The_“ preceding the first 8 letters of my former GT) is OKAY</p>
<p>My old GT [Mod Removed] (an 11-character GT with “_SE” appended to the same 8-letter sequence of the above two GTs) is NOT OKAY, despite the same spelling of the key 8 letter sequence common to all three.
