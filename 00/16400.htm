<h2>            IE 10 Stops working with Shockwave Flash Object add-on enabled</h2>
                    When I enable the add-on the browser stops working. I have tried to download the latest version of Flash Player, but it says it's already installed. What can I do now to fix this problem so I can enable the add-on?

            <p>Your Flash Player is probably not current, or is corrupted somehow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Need to<em> completely</em> remove and reinstall it.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 Manual Send&#47;Receive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevengarland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Manual Send&#47;Receive</h2>
                    <p>In previous versions of Outlook you&nbsp;had the option to&nbsp;set&nbsp;the program&nbsp;to only send/receive when you manually pushed send/receive, CTRL-M or F9. I am told that is not possible in Outlook 2016 (365&nbsp;and standard)&nbsp;and the only way to stop an automatic send and
 receive is the Work Offline feature.&nbsp;When I set it&nbsp;to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> connect automatically when I open Outlook it connects anyway.&nbsp;In fact, according to Microsoft Support there is no way in Outlook 2016 to stop automatic send and receive unless you work off line. If you check or uncheck "Schedule an automatic send/receive
 every 30 minutes", it still automatically send/receives&nbsp;in roughly 45 seconds&nbsp;regardless of which way it's set. If Outlook by default schedules a send/receive roughly every 45 seconds, what is the purpose of&nbsp;the option to schedule a check&nbsp;at various intervals?&nbsp;If
 I work offline certain content in emails&nbsp;does not&nbsp;appear and I have to go back on line to see the content and then back offline once again. Several Microsoft&nbsp;support help desk technicians tried to figure it out and couldn't, the last one said it was how the
 program has been built for&nbsp;at least the last three versions&nbsp;and&nbsp;nothing could be done.&nbsp;Does anyone know of a work around?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>It all depends on the mail account type that you are using. The Send/Receive interval settings mainly applies to POP3 and IMAP accounts as they don't have a direct sync mechanism of the own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exchange accounts in Outlook&nbsp;get their receive events triggered by the Exchange server whenever there is a new email&nbsp;and the Send/Receive interval settings indeed don't apply. In fact, Exchange accounts are excluded from the Send/Receive group by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just curious; Is there any particular reason why you don't want to receive emails even though you are connected and want to download other content?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have always had it setup this way.&nbsp;For one it was just a little more added control and privacy when clients were sending me emails. But mainly, I use MailWasher Pro which allows me to clean my email prior to it reaching my inbox, however I can't stop Outlook

<p>
</p><p>Can save you some time - <a href="http://www.contactgenie.info/mailwasher-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mailwasher</a> has absolutely no impact on Outlook S/R functionality and would be a completely pointless exercise. As you should be well aware, MW works completely autonomously from any email client in terms of previewing your email and doesn't require any
 email client to be running - have been using MW for some 10 yrs or so with some 20+ different email accounts dealing with hundreds of emails on a daily basis. Or to put this in another more succinct way - there is no MW Outlook addin nor does it invoke Outlook
 unless you explicitly ask it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, to have Outlook running with a scheduled S/R is counter-productive. Defeats the purpose of previewing what's sitting on the server before it hits the &lt;inbox&gt; with the caveat regarding IMAP accounts noted below &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of IMAP accounts - my own experience is that these accounts do not sync according to any Outlook S/R settings. I work completely in a manual S/R mode for every account but my IMAP accounts get updated almost immediately both locally and at the server
 level when Outlook is running and the account is connected.</p>

<p>In that case, it sounds you are using an IMAP account which supports the IDLE command which also allows for a push-based (server-initiated) sync similar to that of Exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from working in Offline Mode, switching back to POP3&nbsp;or asking the email provider to disable the command, you can't bypass this.</p>

<h2>            Contents of moved folder disappeared</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 Home with several email addresses.&nbsp; I store emails from multiple email addresses into one folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved a sub-folder (and all contents) to another sub-folder.&nbsp; Opened it in the new location; looked fine.&nbsp; Went back a few minutes later and the folder itself was back in the original location and all contents are gone.&nbsp; I waited a bit to see if maybe
 it needed to sync or something but the problem still exists.&nbsp; No emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No filters are on; the folder was not moved into another sub-folder accidentally.&nbsp; I've tried searching all folders to see if I can find any of the files anyplace; no luck.&nbsp; This is the 2nd time this has happened.&nbsp; The first time, the contents will be missed
 but I can work around it.&nbsp; This time the contents have legal implications and I need to find them.</p>

<p>None of the above helped. But I solved the problem.&nbsp; I right clicked on the folder which had been moved mysteriously back to it's original location but didn't have any files in&nbsp; it.&nbsp; Selected MOVE and moved it to the new location.&nbsp; Once it was moved (using
 right click), all of the emails started to magically appear!&nbsp; Since I had moved two folders by sliding them to a new location and, both times, all the emails disappeared, I tried the RIGHT CLICK/MOVE on the 1st folder as well and all of those emails magically
 appeared as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the morale of the story is "don't slide folders to a new location!&nbsp; Right click &amp; Move them!</p>

<h2>            Starting with Build 17661 noticed that System Configuration is set to Selective Startup and not Normal Startup</h2>
                    <p>Thought my laptop was operating a little sluggishly in Build 17661 and found that system configuration changed from normal startup to selective startup. Now after updating to Build 17666, my laptop is still configured&nbsp;to selective startup but laptop responses
 are quicker in this new build. I seem to remember that a lot of insider build updates in 2016 had selective startup set too.</p>

            Nope. I am in touch with @MicrosoftAU via twitter. Have not gotten much help. I am trying to get them to suggest a WP7 app that is supposed to download, so I can test it and verify for them whether it is an end-user issue or a store-wide issue.&nbsp; They have
 not yet suggested one.<br />

<h2>            MS Project 2013 Error after saving&#47;closing project file&#47;macro. &#34;You cannot delete the last unlocked column of in a table.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I receive this message box whenever I close any MS Project file or save my macro.
</p>
<p>I found the following threads: </p>

<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting the global file and re-saving my project file as XML as instructed above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens to any MS project file I open. I am using MS project 2013 on Windows 7. I noticed that the message box pops up after I started working on a Macro that uses the inputs of a Project file to generate schedule calculations in excel.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not really sure what the issue is nor how to address it. Does anyone else have any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Nokia 206 battery problem</h2>
                    <p>I am using nokia 206 since 2 year ago, few days ago i am facing of battery problem. i have reset my phone 3 to 4 times but problem still persist. even i have replaced the battery 2 times with new one but the problem is still here faced by me. Even such battery
 I have inserted in another it work very good but in my cell maximum maximum 1 day rather than 3 days. My battery usage is not enough, i am not using f.b whats app or etc and my maximum call duration on this cell phone 1 hour but my cell consume too much battery,

            Nokia 206 » Menu » Settings » Connectivity » Mobile data » Mobile data: Please, turn that on. Although this might contradict common sense, some apps try to go online at least once after a reset. If they are not able to go online, they try again, and again,
 which boggles the processor, which drains the battery. Did that help already?

                    <p>I'm trying to find mail that contain flag status, but not completed. I tried the following, but they don't seem to be AND'd - rather they seem to be OR'd (it returns pretty much everything).</p>

            If you enable the Query Builder you will be able to use AND/OR operators.

            BTW, if you don't want to enable query builder, you can do it using the basic filter. 
<br />Use Flag Completed Date does not exist and Flag Status Exists - flags that are not marked completed will not have a completed date. Note that setting a flag then clearing it will create the flag status field, so you might get some unflagged messages too.

    <title>MsgBox text wrapping - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ctdak  say:</h3>
<h2>            MsgBox text wrapping</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I've been doing ongoing development in Access/VBA since 2000 and now in Access 2013.&nbsp; I have noticed that MsgBox messages seem to have a limit to the box size (width).&nbsp; Message box widths used to be determined by the longest string of text before a "vbCr".&nbsp;
 Now the message text is wrapping and where it wraps seems to be determined by a maximum box width.&nbsp; This messes up the display of hundreds of my application messages.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Can anyone confirm this change with Access 2013?&nbsp; Is there a character string limit to avoid this automatic text wrapping?</div>
                </div>

<p>As far as I recall, the message box has always had a maximum width.&nbsp; Certainly it has a maximum width in A2010 and in A2003 (just tried it), and I think it did in A97.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no maximum character limit per se; rather, the limit is on the actual width of the message dialog window, because a proportional font is used.&nbsp; When I execute
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox String(255, "W")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get 6-1/2 lines in the message box.&nbsp; When I execute</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox String(255, "|")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get something like 1-3/4 lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if you are seeing a change, it could be caused differences in screen resolution, whether you've selected "small fonts" or "large fonts" in your display settings, or maybe even a difference in the font used by the MsgBox function.&nbsp; I couldn't say.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a copy of Office 2013 Home and Business, it came with this HP ProBook. OS is Windows 7 Pro 64bit, the system is joined to a domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word takes several minutes to open, even if you just launch the application itself from the start menu (rather than a document). Outlook and Excel open and behave fine, it's just Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running the repair from Add/Remove Programs; have tried removing the default (network) printer, and making Adobe PDF Writer the default printer; have tried unchecking add-ins; and have even tried launching word in safe mode. Not a single one
 of those have made any difference - even safe mode takes just as long to load (with the default printer still being Adobe PDF Writer). I also tried the "fix it for me" option in the support like (kb/921541), and it said it could not locate Office 2003 or newer
 on this machine, which is very strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need to get this fixed, and no other information is coming up in searches. Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>Windows 10 for the phone is not an update. </p>
<p>It is software that is still under development and not complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part of the information from the insiders program.</p>
Download and install the preview only if you
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aren't installing it on your primary phone. If you have a backup phone, that's a perfect candidate for Insider Preview.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Want to try out software that’s still in development and like sharing your opinion about it.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Don’t mind lots of updates or a UI design that might change significantly over time.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Really know your way around Windows&nbsp;Phone and feel comfortable troubleshooting problems, backing up data, or restoring your original operating system if something goes wrong.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>We're not kidding about the expert thing. So if you think APN is a cable news network, Insider Preview may not be right for you.
</p>
Things to keep in mind
<p>Unexpected phone crashes could damage or even delete your files, so you should back up everything. Some hardware—like Bluetooth speakers—might not work, and some apps might not install or work correctly.

            For me the latest Tech preview work like a gem . No crashes. Good video quality phone sound &nbsp;quality and UI experience . My concern is not able to see Great Legacy &nbsp;apps on Windows Store .Is it a purpose full attempt from Microsoft to stop these Lumia
 apps. But not able to see any proper alternatives.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Which part of "Windows 10 for the phone is not an update. It is software that is still under development and not complete." did you not understand ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly a beta OS cannot support all existing apps. Wait for the final release of the finished product and then start complaining. Until then report your comments in the Windows Insider forum, not in the support forum for official released software.</p>

<p>Hello, Adicool06.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We're glad to help you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd suggest you use the <strong>Windows Recovery Tool</strong>. Please see the following steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start by downloading and installing&nbsp;Windows Device Recovery Tool (for Windows 10, 8.x and 7) from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525569</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the installation has finished, start the application and the main screen will appear:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40fadfd7-3596-468b-bbb0-10d3ac33dacb" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The procedure to restore your phone using&nbsp;Windows Device Recovery Tool is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect&nbsp;the phone to your PC (using the USB cable that came with the phone).</li><li>After a few seconds the PC should find the phone and you'll see the Phone Selection screen. Click your phone in this screen to select it.</li><li>After a few seconds more the latest available firmware version for your device will be shown. Click the '<strong>Install software</strong>'/'<strong>Reinstall software</strong>'&nbsp;button to flash your phone</li></ol>
Windows Device Recovery Tool will then download and install the latest firmware + OS available for your phone
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Note!</span> Your phone will be reset to factory status when using this tool.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if this helps. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Robin,</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue, I’d like to confirm the following information.<br />
1. What’s your Office 365 subscription?<br />
2. Regarding “<em>Somehow over time this has now become</em>”, does it change every time after you reboot your PC or just once?<br />
3. From your screenshot, I just see a “<strong>Current Account</strong>” option, is there an “<strong>Other Accounts</strong>” option?<br />
4. Could you provide us some more detailed information about “This is my personal email and my work email” and “both a personal Microsoft account and an Organisational account with my personal email”? Is this live.com account your personal Microsoft account?</p>
<p>Please post back at your convenience and we will continue to discuss the situation based on the update.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Allan</p>

<p>Hi Allan,</p>
<p>I resolved this by going to the "Account" section of Word, where it showed only a single user account under "User Information" but with "connected services" from both work and personal accounts.
</p>
<p>Under my personal account, I removed connected services that linked to my work account. I clicked "switch account" to my work account, and then removed the connected service that were connected to my personal account. This seems to have separated the two
 again and I can switch between them properly (rather than them showing together under one account).</p>
<p>I edited the original post to remove any identifiable personal information. This post can be deleted if you that power! (it'd be good if users could delete their own posts!).</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

All I can think is Nokia had a problem with it and removed it from the firmware.<br />

            It's not just you mate. My phone doesn't have this feature since the v12 update no matter how long you hold the # key. I'm on O2 so maybe it's just an O2 thing.<br />
<br />
I'm not too bothered as v12 runs so much better than previous updates.

<h2>            Will old Beta drivers still work&#63; And where&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I first joined the Windows 10 Beta test, my <strong>Trendnet AC1200 USB WiFi adapter</strong> worked perfectly. But with the release of the first Official Build, my device stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Device Manager says it is fine. Trendnet's driver for this device (<a href="http://www.trendnet.com/support/supportdetail.asp?prod=100_TEW-805UB#tabs-solution01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TEW-805UB</a>) only goes up to Win 8.1 (yes, I tried the
 8.1 driver).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to try the driver from the original Win10 Beta to see if it might work, but I don't know where to find it (either online or on the DVD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? TIA</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Are you referring to the version Windows 10, 10240?</span></p>
<p><span>Which Build you're on currently?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Usually,&nbsp;applicable drivers for&nbsp;Windows 10 are deployed through Windows Updates. When the device is plugged in,
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">go to <strong>Start Button/&gt;Settings/&gt;Update &amp; Security/&gt; Windows Update</strong> and click
<strong>Check Updates</strong>. If it lists any driver update, then try to install the same to see if it works fine. Also try to remove and reconfigure the&nbsp;</span><span>Wireless USB Adapter to see if it makes any difference. I guess it will automatically install
 the compatible driver during application setup. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
If incase problem still persist, then try installing the latest drivers in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows. F</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ollow these steps to install the drivers
 in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Download the latest&nbsp;and available driver from the
<a href="http://www.trendnet.com/support/supportdetail.asp?prod=100_TEW-805UB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
manufacturer’s website</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Uninstall the existing driver from your PC through Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on

</span></strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">and click <strong><span>Next</span></strong>&nbsp;again
<strong><span>Next</span></strong>. Now it will ask you to <strong><span>Test the program,
</span></strong>click on it and continue with installation. Once&nbsp;this is done, check if everything works fine. If it does, go back to

            <p>Thanks for the reply, but two problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Windows THINKS the existing driver is fine so Update never looks for a newer version (there is none.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) This is a WiFi adapter. It is difficult to connect to the Internet using a WiFi adapter that doesn't work to search for Updates. ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Presently, I must connect a working WiFi adapter AND the non-working adapter at the same time to get online to look for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried running the Driver Install utility in Compatibility Mode, but all it does is install the non-working driver. :( The "Installer" runs in Compat Mode, but not the driver itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have the original Win10-Tech_Preview DVD. If I knew where to find the drivers on it, that might do the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>PS: I'm running the latest Insider build.</em></p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 520</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I woke up to find my phone with a message and black screen that said "Unable to find a bootable option. Press any key to shut down." So I followed the instructions for recovery software on the Nokia website and followed the instructions and when I got to
 the last part it finished unsuccessful because the software was not properly signed in. I can't use the phone to do it coz I can't get into it and on the website there is nothing to indicate that we have to sign in so what do I do now?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, To recover the OS of Lumia phone, you have to use the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-device-recovery-tool-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Device Recovery Tool</a>. Note that using this tool to upgraded devices will revert it to WP8.1 OS. However, you can upgrade it back to Windows 10 using the Upgrade Advisor app. Note that all data will be deleted.
