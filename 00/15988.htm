<h2>            MSI packages  not installing</h2>
                    <p>I have been having trouble installing programs with MSI packages the last few days. I have found an incredible amount of forum posts in various places with solutions to the problem. I have yet to find anything that works yet, though. The one solution that
 I feel might actually work, I can't actually use. MS Fix It has an MSI repair tool, but it's not recognizing windows 10 as a supported OS. I have re-registered msiexec in both 32 and 64 folders multiple times, stopped, started, restarted msiserver, and checked
 all registry parameters.<br />
<br />
As far as the symptom is concerned, I don't get an error. The package will open, and I get through the steps to pick a directory, etc. Then the install starts, and the installer freezes with the bar at 0%</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this issue? Has anybody been able to find a solution for it? I really don't feel like re-installing the TP right now, as I'm working on several other tests at the moment, but I may end up having to either way to get MSI files to work
 again.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any assistance</p>

Did you do an upgrade from an active 7&nbsp;sp1 system? make sure the Windows 10 is active by checking under setting/activation.

<p>Hi All and anybody who is reading this post.</p>
<p>Eventually we figured it out. Just check you admin portal and your security and protection center: https://protection.office.com/#/homepage</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here you will find out why there is a threshold triggered. In my case I did not have DKIM in place and a faulty SPF record. There where 24k of mails from a non existing account, so spoofed mails. Support helped me out and now I am waiting for 24hrs to pass,
 because Exchange online will release me within 24hrs after I fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in my case the fix was enable DKIM, set the SPF to -all and not ~all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps you all!</p>

</p><p>We understand that you're having an issue with your Office 365 student account. For us to isolate the main issue, we would like to know the exact error message you received. Also, have you tried contacting your school admin about this since they are the
 ones who can have this check right away.</p>

            I'm having the same problem. I set up my Office 365 student account today, then installed the Word and Excel apps on my Asus tablet. When I log into the app, everything seems to come up fine. Then I try to open a new document and I get this error "Sign
 in to Office 365: This account does not allow editing on your device. For an account with full access, contact your organization about your Office 365 plan." I was under the impression that the student plan would give me access to this, so tell me if that
 assumption was incorrect. In any case, when I look at my account settings, it says I have an Office 365 1A for students license. I am signing into the app with my school email and the password I created through setting up the account. Anything I can do?

            Hello, I am attaching pictures of the error. I haven't tried my school administrator, because normally they say it is you rproduct, I have downloaded it from your server and they are not responsible for ist. Sadly that is the situation at your university

<p>Thank you for that information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You're actually using a school account, so it should be your School Administration who needs to check on this. They have the capability to check every Office 365 that they issued on their students. However, since you already contacted them and nothing happens,
 we would suggest that you contact our Answer Desk Global Support for them to be able to have this check on their end and sort this out for you. Here's the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> where you can reach them.

<h2>            How do I turn off clutter on my email account&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>How do I turn off clutter on my email account?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A while back the clutter "Feature" was turned on my email account at the server.&nbsp; I have tried repeatedly to turn off this "Feature" with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email address - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I believe that it was turned on automatically when my inbox became over full.&nbsp; So I emptied out both my inbox and clutter folder.&nbsp; The "Feature" was still running.</li><li>I tried to look up a solution online.&nbsp; I followed the instructions to shut off this "Feature" BUT the controls nessessary to controlling this were not present.</li><li>I tried to contact tech support.&nbsp; Unfortunately they only supported Office 2016 and they could not help me</li><li>I tried to contact tech support via online chat option found in the office 365 support.&nbsp; they could not help me because they only supported Office 2016.</li><li>I tried to contact techsupport via the phone number provided to me by the previous tech.&nbsp; They determined that the controls do not exist in office 365 and the optional method of going through Office 2016 doesn't work either (no clutter folder present)</li><li>Phone tech sent me to this page to get email support.</li></ol>
<p>As of right now, I have spent a lot of time and effort to getting this "Feature" turned off.&nbsp; It bugs me to no end that a "Feature" I never wanted, was turned on without my knowledge/permission.&nbsp; And that I can not turn off.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT </strong>- I believe this to be an issue on the email server.&nbsp; due to the fact that none of the client side control are present</p>
<p>

            <span>Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
From your screenshot, you don’t have the permission to turn off clutter in your own mailbox. The admin of your Office 365 tenant could restrict your permission to control clutter in your own mailbox. So what you need to do is to move the emails in the clutter
 folder to other folders in your mailbox and then contact one admin of your Office 365 tenant to see if he can turn off clutter for you. You may contact the person who provided the Office 365 account credentials to you to see who has the admin access in your
 organization.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</span>

    <title>Document in Word looks fine in preview but printing wrong - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Document in Word looks fine in preview but printing wrong</h2>
                    <p>I have Microsoft Office 2016 on an HP laptop running Windows 10.</p>
<p>My Word has worked properly until today, and I have changed nothing. I removed printer from my laptop and re-added it.</p>
<p>I set my page orientation to landscape, type up a document. Hit print. It looks right in print preview. When it prints it prints closest to the bottom margin, as if it's aligned to print starting at the bottom instead of the top as normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried making up a single line of text and it still prints from the bottom.</p>
<p>Portrait orientation prints as normal.</p>
<p>I think it might be a setting, but I don't see a place to change that.</p>
<p>Reading in forums for similar (but not quite the same) problems, I've seen it suggested to remove the printer from my laptop and re-add it so I did that and retested with the same weird results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one uses this laptop but me, but I DO use it for work and need this fixed ASAP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Brandy, <br />
<br />
You need to change the vertical alignment. <br />

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp;<br />
I took a look at your suggestion, but when I brought up the page setup box, it was already set to top. I thought maybe it just needed a little kick so I set it to bottom, and back to top and retested but its still doing it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until last night my phone was&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;all my emails as it has for months. &nbsp;It has not been possible to receive new emails today. &nbsp;When I go to email and then quit it goes to the Nokia&nbsp;messaging&nbsp;email and asks for a&nbsp;password. &nbsp;I have no idea what it is
 although I have tried 1234 0000 and my own password. &nbsp;I login &nbsp;and it&nbsp;tries&nbsp;to verify password. &nbsp;I then get the message</p>
<p>Server not found please. Please check the name of the server and try again.</p>
<p>I have backed up&nbsp;reinstalled, left the battery out etc. &nbsp;But I keep getting the same thing. &nbsp;I have switched user and that makes no difference. &nbsp;The email was not set up on the other user. so tried to see if it would work there. &nbsp; It will not allow me to
 set it up. &nbsp;When I put my email address in it says unable to connect to the server please try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas how I sort this out please?</p>

<p>I have a E66 Nokia &amp; I'm using Nokia messaging since few monthes. My last sync was done yesterday the 3rd at 7:30 PM (GMT +1).<br />
Since yesterday I cannot make any sync. I made a reboot, I reinstall the Nokia messaging soft. Nothing changes, still no sync.</p>
<p>By the way&nbsp;<a href="https://email.nokia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://email.nokia.com</a> website is no more available.<br />
I think the issue is with Nikia servers. The question is : when Nokia will repair this ?</p>

<p>Until last night my phone was&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;all my emails as it has for months. &nbsp;It has not been possible to receive new emails today. &nbsp;When I go to email and then quit it goes to the Nokia&nbsp;messaging&nbsp;email and asks for a&nbsp;password. &nbsp;I have no idea what it is
 although I have tried 1234 0000 and my own password. &nbsp;I login &nbsp;and it&nbsp;tries&nbsp;to verify password. &nbsp;I then get the message</p>
<p>Server not found please. Please check the name of the server and try again.</p>
<p>I have backed up&nbsp;reinstalled, left the battery out etc. &nbsp;But I keep getting the same thing. &nbsp;I have switched user and that makes no difference. &nbsp;The email was not set up on the other user. so tried to see if it would work there. &nbsp; It will not allow me to
 set it up. &nbsp;When I put my email address in it says unable to connect to the server please try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas how I sort this out please?</p>

            Hello Rednax35,
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, Windows Media Player does not have the option to create/rip ISO images from a CD/DVD. There is however many different applications available for free download that can do so. One application that comes to mind is ImgBurn, which can create ISO files from CD/DVD and comes with many other features.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

            Rednax35,
<br />
<br />My sincere apologies, after reading your note and testing the latest available download of ImgBurn with a updated copy of Malwarebytes, it did in fact return a possible malware alert (Generic.Malware/Suspicious).
<br />
<br />I will certainly refrain from linking their website and their products in the future. Again, my apologies for any inconvenience that this caused.

<h2>            Office 365 Business Premium for personal use only</h2>
                    <p>Hi community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since Microsoft decided that personal users do not own any domain, I'm forced to use&nbsp;Office 365 Business Premium if I wish to use my own domain.</p>
<p>Now the problem is: Is that allowed based on the ToU if I do not own a business? If so, what do I enter for business phone and business name?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
                </div>

            Hello, A pleasure to help you.
<br />
<br />I understand your incident well, but if you do not have a business or an active company, it does not prevent you from getting a subset of Office 365 business.
<br />You can place the name you want, an Office 365 Tenant will be automatically created with the new_name.onmicrosoft.com which will be the domain of your business Tenant, which can never be deleted or modified, but you can add your custom domain and place it as the main one once you access the Office 365 Administration Center.
<br />
<br />Add a domain to Office 365

</p><p>Tina,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am also having the same issue. Tried embedding a .mp4 file (a video recording of a Skype for Business call) into PowerPoint 365. Well, the next time I open I get a message that there was an error and Powerpoint can try and repair. It converts the video
 into a screengrab of first frame of the video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, the embed video from Youtube works without an issue. Problems of being a cloud 1st company ;)</p>

<p>HI shikari,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering you are using the previous Office version, we would suggest you update your current PowerPoint to the latest version 1811&nbsp;(Build 11029.20079) to see if it makes different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I would like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1.Could you help confirm if you follow the steps below to embed the video recording: PowerPoint &gt;Insert &gt;Video &gt;Online Video &gt;Paste your embed code into From a Video Embed Code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.If so, where is your video recording hosting? How did you get the embed code?</p>
<p>If not, could you share your steps with us to better understand the situation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Eli</p>

<a href="http://lr.ovi.mobi/store/new-symbian-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://lr.ovi.mobi/store/new-symbian-3</a><br />
Now in my installed applications I've entries of both Nokia store and Ovi store. I've the following entries.<br />
Nokia store client 2mb<br />
Nokia store installer 19mb<br />
Ovi 1mb<br />
Ovi store 3mb<br />
Ope service 2mb<br />
all are installed in phone memory. Now all I want to know is now that I've upgraded to Nokia store, can I uninstall the old entries related to Ovi store as they're occupying precious space in my C drive? And can I uninstall the Nokia store installer as I've
 installed the package?

<h2>            How do I change the slide layout already applied to an existing slide&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I do not know how to change the slide master being applied to a slide in a given presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, my presentation has a Slide Master and 10 layout slides underneath the Master.&nbsp; One slide in the deck (either an original slide or a slide copied from another presentation) has layout #3 applied to it while all other slides are using layout
 #7.&nbsp; How do I make a change so that one slide uses #7 instead of #3?&nbsp; I keep looking for a magic button that says, "Click here to change the layout number being applied to a specific slide" but I have not found the magic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Transfer email from Entourage 2008 for Mac &#40;on MacBook Pro&#41; to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Transfer email from Entourage 2008 for Mac &#40;on MacBook Pro&#41; to Outlook 2011&#47;2016 on iMac i3</h2>
                    <p>Hello to dear reader (yes I am begging for help)<br />
</p>
<p>I have now spent hours seeking advice from Microsoft on how to do transfer email from Entourage 2008 for Mac (on MacBook Pro) to Outlook 2011/2016 on iMac i3. Only one tech support person had done it before (out of 8 calls) and she explained that I had to
 do it in multiple steps 2008-&gt;2011-&gt;2016 (the latter two on the new computer). Lyn the tech support person downloaded &amp; installed remotely the Office 2011 version in addition to the Office 365 already installed on the ‘new’ computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to successfully install the 601 contacts from the MacBookPro into Office 2011.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email transfer has not been successful mainly as nowhere and no one seems to have any ‘corporate memory’ (tech papers et al) or any willingness to remember any step-by-steps to actually do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email on the MacBookPro goes back to 2002 and is mainly in Folders &amp; subfolders. There are 3000 or so email in the actual email window (not in folders). When I have exported the email I received:</p>
<p>
</p><p>“Address book groups cannot be exported.</p>
<p>To export the contents of a group, select the group, drag it into the body of a new note, and then export the note.”</p>
<p>
</p><p>When email from folders are dragged&amp;dropped into a note, all the email in that folder are in the note but in one document not as distinct individual email. I have no idea what to do with this and if these will ‘magically’ be transferred into individual email
 again in 2011/2016. Yes, I live in hope about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[The last tech support person Ryan suggested I buy a third party software to do the the email transfer.] Yes, really he did. Then he suggested I post onto this Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have exported what I thought should be the 3000 email not in folders I see that there are only 700kb in a file that is ultimately not imported as ‘no identities can be found’.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I am at a loss of what steps will result in getting out of Entourage 2008 as I really do want to say goodbye to this legacy unsupported software that unfortunately holds 15 years of my husband’s personal and professional life in email.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note from searching the Forum posts of others that it is important to first import the Identities from Entourage 2008 first which I will do next. &nbsp;But how will I get all those folders and subfolder content into Outlook 2011/2016 into a ‘usable set of emails
 (still within their folders/subfolders?)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are my options… please advise and note that while I understand that there are many various file format types involved in Office files over the years I am not necessarily familiar with the importance of any in particular. I see that when exporting from
 Entourage all is put into the archive format ‘.rge’. But this does not give me any help as this does not appear to contain much at only 700kb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is one way to describe the transfer process as as ‘x’ file type must become ‘y’ file type and then imported to become ‘z’ file type?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think any reader who has gotten this far can appreciate how important both getting out of Entourage 2008 and the associated 15 years of someone’s life reflected in their email will be. You will have very very grateful posters with a response that
 results in a successful email transfer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even wondered… would it be easier to transfer the Entourage 2008 email into Apple Mail then export it all across to the new computer Outlook. The 'husband' is unwilling to give up using Microsoft mail. That stuborness is why he has been using an outdated
 software for so long! Or put the email (somehow) in the Office 365 cloud storage that we have access to and then import from there, though Lyn did not recommend this but instead recommended use of an external HD which I have been doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help in your responses are being sought and looked forward to!</p>
<p>
</p><p>... even posting this there was nowhere to put that this post refers to Microsoft Entourage 2008 as if it never existed!</p>

<p>You have several things you can try.</p>
<p>In theory, Outlook 2011 should be able to import the identity from 2008 without problem, but it’s possible your 2008 identity is corrupted.</p>
<p>The first thing I’d do would be to launch Outlook pressing the Option key down to rebuild the identity, and then I’d try to import again in Outlook 2011.</p>
<p>From 2016, you should be able to import the identity from 2011 pretty much the same way (and yes, I know… In a perfect world, Outlook 2016 should be able to import from 2008, but it can’t).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option if any of the steps fails is to export from 2008 to an archive. I can’t remember whether 2008 uses the same .olm archive format used but 2011 and 2016, but if not, you can use whatever format they offer and reimport in 2011 (.olm can be imported
 straight in 2016).</p>
<p>That won’t get you your rules and account settings, signatures etc, but it should rescue your emails contacts and calendar events.</p>

<h2>            Virus disabled Win Defender and altered Proxy settings</h2>
                    <p>I am dealing with the after effects of a nasty virus and I'm hoping there's something I can try short of a system refresh to resolve this issue. The virus disabled Windows defender, set up its own proxy configurations, and the locked me out of being able
 to change eithers' settings (screenshots below)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6e77aa8-3f3c-4599-9326-640dcd0cdb53" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6e77aa8-3f3c-4599-9326-640dcd0cdb53" /></a><br />

<p>The proxy settings seem to have been meant to keep someone from downloading a different antivirus program from the internet (I kept getting internal errors whenever I tried to access an antivirus website. Any other website was accessible without issue).
 I was able to bypass this using a VPN app but most antivirus software I tried to install kept closing before the install could complete (AVG and Malwarebytes being two I can remember trying off the top of my head) One antivirus app finally did install (Bitdefender)
 and, after running a scan, I was able to install Malwarebytes. With that said, I am still locked out of my proxy settings. Less of a concern to me, I'm also still locked out of Windows Defender. Thank you for any help you can provide.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply. Malwarebytes is already on my computer. I was able to install it after I found an antivirus that I could download despite the virus's countermeasures. I have also installed AVG so three different scanners have analysed my PC at this
 point so I'm confident that the virus has been sufficiently pulverized. The issue I'm having is that, while the virus was on my computer, it deactivated Windows Defender, pointed my web traffic to a proxy, and then locked me out of both settings. It seems
 to have linked my computer to a workgroup and I have not been successful at finding a way to gain back control of my computer settings. &nbsp;At this point, I think I'm going to have to reformat it. That being said, I haven't had time to do so and, as such, figured
 it wouldn't hurt to see if someone knew of a better alternative.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> I haven't reformatted my computer because the proxy settings the virus inputted seem to have just vanished after doing a computer reboot. I still haven't figured out how to ungrey my proxy settings and, after looking a little deeper,
 I am definitely not connected to any group or organization but I am still getting the "some setting are managed by your organization." message at the top of my proxy settings. I found an
<a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/how-fix-some-settings-are-managed-by-your-organization-message-windows-10-1521281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> that didn't work for me but it might help someone else in the same boat. I'll keep looking for how to ungrey proxy settings and would appreciate anyone's feedback who has an idea on how to do it. At this point, I've abandoned trying to enable Windows
 Defender and I'm just going to use AVG and Malwarebytes instead. Both have free versions and work well together.</p>

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Click on the email and on the top right just at the right of the reply button is an arrow pointing down, click on the arrow then you're going to see an option that says see message origin, click on it.
<br />
<br />Then look for something that says "Sender IP is" and copy that ip address and paste it in this website.

<p>Warping is an effect that can be applied to Word Art.&nbsp; Of course, that art could consist of a series of dashes to which you could apply a warking effect by expanding the Text Effects dropdown in the WordArt Styles section of the Format tab of the ribbon
 that will appear when a WordArt object is selected and then selecting the Transform item on the Text Effects list.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How can I get a series of footnotes to appear in a continuous line, the text wrapping round line breaks as necessary, rather than being stacked one on top of the other, as they are by default?</p>

            You can format the paragraph break characters that terminate each footnote as hidden. You may want to ensure there is a space character before them, though, so the following footnote # doesn't get pushed up against the end of the preceding footnote.

<p>Thanks very much for this, Paul, but how do I "format the paragraph break characters that terminate each footnote as hidden".&nbsp;&nbsp; If you reply, as I hope you will, please assume that my computer expertise rates about one out of ten.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill</p>

            Press the ¶ button on the Home tab to display nonprinting marks, among them paragraph marks (¶). Select each mark and apply hidden text formatting (for example by pressing Ctrl+Shift+H).<br />
<br />
Note, however, that this trick doesn't really conserve any space (if that's part of your objective), because even if the notes appear to be in one paragraph, Word still reserves vertical space for all the footnotes at the bottom of the page.

<p>Thanks for this, Steve.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I am trying to conserve space because my footnotes (which run into hundreds for each document) are very short and look ridiculous in a long list in the second half of each page.&nbsp;&nbsp; So is there a way of zapping the vertical space
 that MS Word leaves for them?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Bill</p>

Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do to reduce the footnote area in cases such as this one. :-(<br />

By the way, who is Steve?

<p>Sorry about the "Steve", Stefan!&nbsp;&nbsp; We can't see anything other than this Reply box when we reply, and I thought, in my haste, that it was "Steve".&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the answer, which has filled me with despondency after a short period of elation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you think
 of any other way of compressing the amount of space taken up by a multiplicity of extremely short footnotes?&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a book called "Continuity and Change in Roman Religion", published by the Oxford University Press, which contains many pages in which a dozen
 or more short footnotes are arranged side-by-side rather than vertically.&nbsp;&nbsp; On close inspection, they actually seem to be arranged in columns (without any lines), although the (invisible) column widths vary from page to page.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have one page here that has,
 for instance, four footnotes on the same line.</p>

            FWIW, if you use endnotes (rather than footnotes) with this technique, Word does reduce the allocated space.

<p>Thanks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, but presumably the endnotes will still appear at the end of the document, which is not what I want (I want the notes on the same page as the text).&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you think about the way it is done in that book I mentioned?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there no other possibility
 in another Office package such as Excel or PowerPoint?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there no possibility of formatting the footnotes into a set of columns?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or a table?</p>

Endnotes do not have to be located at the end of the document - they can instead be located at the end of every Section (eg you might put a Section break at the end of a chapter).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Stefan has already observed, compressing the space between footnotes the way I described doesn't reduce the white space at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that the footnotes of concern are so short, perhaps you should consider having their content in-line (bracketed) in the body of the document instead. Alternatively, you could fake it in Word, with the judicious use of (custom-numbered) footnotes every
 so often (with the numbers formatted as hidden text) and the faking of the desired footnote numbers via superscripted numbers in both in the body and the actual footnotes, plus the corresponding 'footnote' text. A lot of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applications like Excel &amp; Powerpoint are quite unsuitable for this. You could probably achieve the result you're after with a page layout program like Publisher.</p>

            There is no "official" admin defined for 365 Home.&nbsp; The person, email account, who activates the license becomes the defacto "admin. I don't know of any way change that.<br />
