<h2>            ABUSE - HACKED HOTMAIL ADDRESS</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I would like to inform you that my microsoft account : " *** Email address is removed for privacy *** " has been abused yesterday morning about 10. 00 am. An e-mail was send to all my contacts,at 10.00 am, telling&nbsp; that I was in Ukraine, I has been stolen (money,
 passeports etc) and I need money (1.850) euros. About 11.27am, after I change the password and after I manage&nbsp;&nbsp;to reset&nbsp;&nbsp;my contacts ( witch have been deleted !!!!!),&nbsp; I manage to send them an e- mail to inform , that my e-mail address was hacked, and to ignore
 the mail asking for money. Some time later when I asked one my colleagues to find and send me the "path" of the hacked mail he had received, I notice that I could not receive. either send mails from and&nbsp; to my contacts. I think that at that time now, I can
 not receive and send mails in general, except maybe some advertises. Although I can not see the&nbsp; received mails in my inbox, I can found the mails send to me from my contacts (at list until yesterday),&nbsp; by enter to " my contacts"&nbsp; and "cilck" to&nbsp; "

</p><p>1.&nbsp;Telling your contacts that this was a scam attempt was a great idea.</p>
<p>2. If these messages aren't in your Sent folder, they weren't really sent from your account, but changing&nbsp;your password was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>3. Now that you have changed the password, there is no need to abandon this account, but that is an option.</p>

            In addition to changing your password, you should seriously consider enabling 2-factor authentication. 
<br />
<br />Also, make sure you check for Rules or Forwarding in Settings (gear icon) &gt; View all Outlook Settings &gt; Rules and also in Forwarding.  Hackers often set up forwarding rules to monitor your mail.

    <title>Win10 preview activation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frankadu-yeboah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 preview activation</h2>
                    <p>I just downloaded the latest build for the insider preview and has got my windows activated to Win 10 Pro. I did a fresh installation by resetting my pc using the win10 reset tool. I did this so I could merge all my partition into one disc. After the installation
 the reset could not recognise my drive and give an error message. I forgot to create a recovery disc when I activated my windows. I have used the old win10 insider preview to do a fresh installation. Will I be able to update the preview to latest build and
 at the same time use my previous activation to activate this pc?</p>
<p>need help urgently</p>

<p>Hi GroveAdmin6770,</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>
<p>Just heard from the engineers from our relevant team. They told me that if you are trying to add additional E3 licenses and Power BI Pro to your Office 365 Enterprise E3 trial, it’s not feasible to do that. That’s why you receive the error message. So, could
 you please confirm if you are trying to add additional E3 licenses and Power BI Pro to your E3 trial? If so, I’d like to tell you we are not able to add additional E3 licenses to trial subscription. We can only add additional licenses to paid subscription.
 Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mouran</p>

<p>Hi Mouran,</p>
<p>Your response does not make any sense at all, are u saying that the customer cannot add paid for E3 subscription licences &nbsp;to an E3 trial account?</p>
<p>Do you understand what you are saying??!!</p>
<p>I have sent you the order confirmation information to show that the licences have been paid for and purchased from a reputable distributor Rectron.</p>
<p>Again i ask why am I getting the error message below???</p>
<p>''Sorry, we can't process your request.</p>
<p>The verification checks on your payment method have failed. Please select another payment method and try again.</p>
<p>OrderFailedRiskManagementCheck ''</p>
<p>This has been done before! Please provide me with a proper explanation for the above error.</p>
<p>AND FIX THE PROBLEM!</p>
<p>If you are not sure how to resolve this please get one of your experts to give me a call directly!</p>
<p>THIS IS REDICULOUS!!!! AND YOU ARE WASTING OUR TIME!</p>

<p>Hi GroveAdmin6770,</p>
<p>Sorry for the previous misunderstanding.</p>
<p>What my meaning is that if you are trying to add additional trial licenses to your current E3 trial license, it’s not feasible to do that.
</p>
<p>However, if you are trying to add paid for E3 subscription license to an E3 trial account, it’s feasible. Sorry for not describing it clearly.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the error message, I’ve contacted our relevant team. They will help you check it, please keep in touch with them.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>You should be be able to use your live mail account on any browsers.<br />
Try opera mini and login to live.com.<br />
<br />
This will open the mobile version for you.<br />

Hope this helps.</p>

            Actually i want to store some files in Onedrive. So whenever i open onedrive it asks for the Ms account.<br />
<br />
Well i use to be directed to the Sign up page as i don't have any microsoft account. Where i use to fill the data needed, yet the page does'nt forward but goes to previous page.<br />
<br />
I tried, with Ovi browser, then UC Browser, and now Opera but nothing. The page still comes backward.<br />
<br />
Do i need a PC to sign up then??

<h2>            styles in Word 2016 for Mac - creating</h2>
                    <p>I had set up styles in a book manuscript. Now I am creating two books from one. So am building a draft for the second book and working from an outline for Book II. I did not use styles or the outline feature in Word for this. I just listed my headings and
 tab indented my subheadings. No numbers or roman numbers. Now in my doc for Book II, I want to use the same styles as in Book I. However, when I go to use styles, what I find are styles from another project I was working on in-between (I am a new editor),
 and I can't find the styles from the original Book I. Do I have to set up all over again my styles? And if I do this, will I lose the styles from the project I was working on before I started creating two books from one—what I am now working on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't I see the styles I created for Book I stored in my list of styles to choose from as I begin to work on Book II?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Katherine</p>

            <p>Daniel would have you work <em>much</em> too hard :-) Although he <em>mentioned</em> the Organizer he really didn't explain anything about
<em>using</em> it for the purpose. Please see;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/using-the-word-organizer-in-office-2011-for-mac.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Using the Word Organizer in Office 2011 for Mac</strong></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The article is written for Word 2011 but works the same for Word 2016. You can access the Organizer
</p>
<div>
<p>from either of several directions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tools&gt; Templates &amp; Add-Ins </strong>- <strong>Organizer</strong> button</li><li><strong>Format&gt; Style</strong> - <strong>Organizer</strong> button</li><li><strong>Tools&gt; Macro&gt; Macros</strong> - <strong>Organizer</strong> button</li><li>Assign a keyboard shortcut to the <strong>Organizer</strong> command</li></ul>
<p>As for your 'missing' styles: By default, custom Styles are stored in the document in which you create them. If you want them to be available to all new documents you need to indicate that by checking the Add to template box when you create/modify the Style.
 IOW, you can use Organizer to copy Styles from your Book1 document to both your Book2 document as well as your Normal.dotm template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One consideration: If the <em>name</em> of a Style being copied already exists in the target document the incoming Style will replace it.</p>

            <p>It all depends on how you create Book II.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you make a copy of Book I (in the Finder or via Save As), then delete its entire contents, you'll still have your styles because they were part of the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you create Book II from a blank document, you'll only have the styles as defined in whatever template the document was based on (typically, Normal.dotm). However, if you paste in there parts of Book I that have styles applied, those styles will be ported
 over to the blank document, even if you later delete the associated text. IOW, the new styles become part of the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your target document already contains a like-named style as the text you're pasting into it, the style will be kept as is (i.e., as defined in the target document) and the pasted text will change the way it looks to reflect the pre-existing style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already have text in Book II, you can copy the styles from Book I. For that, open both documents, then access
<em>Tools &gt; Macros &gt; Macro &gt; Organizer</em> in the main menu and select the Styles tab at the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a way to make any style available from now on in all your new documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the style by selecting&nbsp;<em>Format &gt; Style…</em> in Word's main menu</li><li>Highlight a style</li><li>Click on the <em>Modify</em> button</li><li>Place a checkmark in "Add to template"</li></ul>

            Hello DBEGANY 
<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />Just to clarify, where would you like to add the hotmail account? to your outlook client desktop application or as an email alias to an existing outlook.com account or in a mobile application?
<br />
<br />Any screenshot will also help providing more information on where you want to add the account. 
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Parmi

            Hi Dbegany,
<br />
<br />apologies for the delay in response. Unfortunately, you cannot add 2 accounts from same domain. 
<br />
<br />"Existing Hotmail, Live, Outlook.com, and MSN addresses can't be added as aliases, and you can't add an alias that is already associated with another Microsoft account."

<h2>            Build 18317&#58; Taskbar retains icons of apps after apps are closed.</h2>
                    <p>After installing the new insider build on 16th of January, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened an executable ( Advanced System Options ) and closed it. Executable icon remained on Taskbar. I couldn't remove it until I restarted Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1947b67b-45da-43e0-bc39-e43e4178bdf9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1947b67b-45da-43e0-bc39-e43e4178bdf9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The same thing happened again today 17th of January. I opened Performance Monitor and closed it. Its icon remained on taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c50254a-1553-4ae5-8767-b4295b5beb48?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c50254a-1553-4ae5-8767-b4295b5beb48?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I opened Feedback hub app and reported the incident. After closing the Feedback hub app, the Taskbar icon, which was Performance Monitor icon, changed shape and became a horizontal line on taskbar. ( If you enlarge the below image, the horizontal line
 is seen in light blue color at the bottom of taskbar. )</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c08c8e5b-e84c-4c87-a06f-e01c115346a9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c08c8e5b-e84c-4c87-a06f-e01c115346a9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This happens with certain apps. For example, Mail app does not behave this way. Edge browser does not behave this way. Weather app does not behave this way.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else have the same issue ?</p>

<h2>            alcatel idol 4 S 64x</h2>
                    <p>I had a company representative. Tell me that I don't. Need to change my Microsoft account. That I may have acquired a virus through it.</p>
<p>What originally happened was I was using my phone as a hotspot on the web? I got called away for an emergency and left the phone and laptop connected as a hotspot I came home immediately disconnected and turned off, both. booted up my computer. Someone downloaded
 a Trojan horse on it ( My laptop ) I found it through Malwarebytes pro. Immediately, when I rebooted it.</p>
<p>My phone seems to be doing some really weird things ever sense. Dropping apps. Dropping calls. I wake up the next morning and absence disappeared. I have another Idol 4 S with a different serial number. And I would. Assume a different IP. Could I transfer
 the SIM card? It has no contacts on it? Or would I risk transferring the Trojan horse to the other phone.</p>
<p>also I assume the infected phone, has a 200 Gigabyte S ID card in it? Everything I have downloaded I downloaded onto the SID.</p>
<p>Is it possible for me to hard line connect my phone to my computer and run malwarebytes on the phone? As well as the SD card. To correct the problem. Please give me some help.</p>

    <title>How to save power during slide show&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crs kumar  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to save power during slide show&#63;</h2>
                    During a presentation, the projector used to project the slide show onto screen can consume significant power.<br />
It may be observed that sizable power ( equivalent to tonnes of carbon dioxide emission)
<br />
can be saved just by changing the background color or reducing the<br />
brightness. From the point of person who is creating the slides, which background colors can significantly save<br />
power ? What design templates, themes, color schemes, animations etc can influence the power consumption?<br />
Which ones are more suited? What features in Power point can help save the power during a presentation while<br />
not compromising on the quality of the slides?<br />
Warm regards<br />

            Thanks for your quick response.<br />
<br />
I observe from the product details of some of the commercially available <br />
projectors, the power consumption dramatically reduces when the displayed<br />
screen has dark images in Eco Modes. An example:<br />
http://www.nec-display.com/ap/en_projector/m420x/index.html<br />
This is because the projector light intensity&nbsp; automatically reduces for<br />
dark images with good contrast resulting in reduction of power consumption. <br />
Also, certain fonts are sharper even in lower brightness compared to others. <br />
<br />
So, I was thinking that these features can be exploited while creating the power point slides.<br />
A simple checklist can be added to facilitate designing slides for eco mode.<br />
<br />
Warm regards<br />

            Unless the projector has built-in intelligence like the one you cite, I don't think there'll be any difference in power consumption between dark/light slides. &nbsp;Projectors have a constant light source that's filtered to get different colors/brightness levels
 on screen. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Imagine window-blinds. &nbsp;The sun's not getting dimmer when you gradually close them; you're just letting less sunlight in. &nbsp;A projector functions analogously.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you know that you'll be using a projector with this ECO mode feature, you could presumably save power by using a darker background. &nbsp; You'd need to use your own judgement and observe the on-screen image from the specific projector under the specific
 projection conditions in order to make any reasonable judgement as to what presentation designs work best.</div>

I surveyed several LCD/DLP projectors available in the market. The commonality<br />
among all is that reducing brightness reduces power consumption.<br />
http://www.benq.com/product/projector/lw61st<br />
http://www.projectorreviews.com/advice/HomeTheaterProjector-FAQs/ProjectorsLampLifeBrightness.php<br />
http://www.mitsubishi-presentations.com/xd250u-st/<br />
<br />
However, while preparing the slides if the designer takes into account that<br />
the slides should be clearly visible even in low brightness, then the slideshow<br />
surely can be presented at reduced brightness.<br />
<br />
I propose that the following checklist may be used in this regard:<br />
( I call this Green Power Point Guidelines ):<br />
1. Thicker bold fonts are preferable.<br />
2. Images with higher contrast and dark imagery are more suited.<br />
3. For the slides, choose darker background colors.<br />
4. Slide transitions should darken the screen.<br />
5.&nbsp; Blank the screen during discussion etc.<br />
<br />
Surely, with careful design of the slides, the brightness can be reduced by<br />
20-40% resulting in significant saving in power.<br />
<br />

I found further information related to computer monitors and HD TVs.<br />
Supposing the slideshow is being made from these, there is considerable<br />
power saving by reducing the brightness.<br />
The following links give comprehensive information on the impact of<br />
reducing brightness on the power consumption:<br />
http://darrenyates.com.au/2008/09/dropping-brightness-levels-can-save-10-watts-continuously-reduce-power-consumption/227<br />
Benchmark results on power savings:<br />

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2240110/Turning-brightness-HD-television-save-100-year.html<br />
<br />
Then there is a windows utility to reduce brightness:<br />

            Another place where power point slide shows are used 24/7 is the information kiosk or booth.<br />
The self running slide show may be running on a touch screen LCD monitor or flat screen LED/LCD TV.<br />
This is an ideal place to reduce power consumption. The brightness reduction should be<br />
imperceptible to the observer if the slides have been designed carefully ( using Green<br />
power point guidelines as discussed earlier in this thread). <br />

<h2>            Annoying popup blocker notification bar keeps coming&#33; How to stop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the forums and Google and I can't seem to find an answer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I work for Allstate. We have our own outlook web browser based email system. Everytime I get an email, the lower right hand side of my desktop, near the clock, I get a notification of the email, or emails, I just got or any other unopenned email.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is causing a notification bar to pop up on the bottom of the window and it wont go away!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I make this notification bar from not popping up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please see the links I have provided to see what I'm talking about. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*** EDIT ***<br />
</p>
<p>I just realized the first two pictures have been cut off at the bottom and you cannot see the popup I was talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see link below for the popup below. It's modified a bit, but that's because I have reset IE settings to default now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://i.imgur.com/AmJ7lnV.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Where it says "Internet Explorer blocked a pop-up from WIN-0CCT6P780E4" the "WIN-0CCT6P780E4" used to say webmail.allstate.com before I reset it to default.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>By the way, the WIN-0CCT6P780E4 is the Computer name and Full computer name. </p>

<p>
</p><p>We have tried this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look at the links I provided, you can see that webmail.allstate.com is a trusted secure site and popups should be allowed on that site. The box for show a notification when popups are blocked is not checked off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALSO, when we do what you told us to do and Turn off popup blocker completely, it still gives that notification! I don't understand why! It's off!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if Windows 10 will keep the original license type?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if I upgrade from a Windows 7 install using a retail key, will Windows 10 be a retail version or will it change to OEM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the information I read about the free upgrade mentions the device the upgrade is installed too, which makes me worry that the free upgrade will be OEM and locked to that device, which is no good for me as I brought retail as I upgrade my hardware
 often.</p>

<h2>            PivotTable Styles - Compact layout with item label in tabular form</h2>
                    <p>I have a Pivot Table in compact layout with 4 row labels and I format the 3rd row label to be in tabular form. It seems like the 3rd row label is incorrectly formatted with the Row Subheading 1 table element except for the last Row Subheading which is correctly
 not shaded. Has anyone come across this issue? Is it a bug or is there a way to fix it?</p>

<h2>            Goal Seek for a RANGE of values</h2>
                    <p>Happy Monday!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a simple forecast: loan volume ($) per month. &nbsp;I created a forecast based on historical data. I have summed the monthly values (over one year) to a TOTAL loan volume of $264M. I would like the monthly loan volumes calculated based on changing the
 TOTAL loan volume (let's say $276M in this example).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would I do this?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi NY,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way to do this (and keep the ratios of the current spread across the months) is to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For each monthly value, have another cell in which the monthly value is divided by the total (aka the percent of the total that value is)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can have a cell in which you enter the goal ($276M in your case).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then adjacent to each of the above calculated percentages you can place a formula that multiplies the percentage times the goal to get the required value for that month based on the same monthly ratios as the actual or entered data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance working out this solution please let me know and I'd be happy to help. If you'd rather do a ratio based on days or just an even 1/12 portion per month that is also doable.</p>
<p>
Please let me know if this answers your question by marking as answer and if you need further assistance.<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>EBW</p>

<p><span>Hi CHAR87,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the operating system installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 version of Internet Explorer are you using?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 other websites work fine?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A 404 error occurs when a browser fails to recognize a Web page, or when an Internet page refuses to load.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also, when the
 server is unable to find anything that matches the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) you requested on the address bar of your Web browser.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check to see if the following helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check your URL. If you typed the URL
 wrong, you will get Error Code 404. Even a single letter or number in the URL can make a difference.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note that these steps are only for Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Clear cached data in Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Internet Explorer 7</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Internet Explorer 7.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<span>Tools</span>,
 and then click <span>Delete Browsing History</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In<span>Delete
 Browsing History</span>, click <span>Delete All</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 to select the<span>Also delete files and settings stored by add-ons</span> check box, and then click<span>OK</span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Internet Explorer 8</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Internet Explorer 8.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<span>Safety</span>,
 and then click <span>Delete Browsing History</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In<span>Delete
 Browsing History</span> area, click <span>Delete</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Try optimizing Internet Explorer and
 check if it helps.</span></p>

<h3> kurtjschmucker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Details on Office for Mac Accreditation 2016&#63;</h2>
                    For the last couple of years, Microsoft has had a Microsoft Office for Mac and iOS Accredited Support Professional program. The last one was co-located the day prior to MacTech Conference. (Details here: http://conference.mactech.com/microsoft-office-accreditation/)<br />
<br />
I can’t find any information about the 2016 Accreditation. &nbsp;Where can I get some information?

            <p>This is really a great question. I love these events and having been taking groups of consultants to it for the last couple years. The Microsoft Accreditation has been a huge value add to my business and the knowledge I gained invaluable.&nbsp;</p>

            I have also been looking for 2016 information on this program. &nbsp;As a federal IT pro, I have participated in the MS Office Support/Accreditation in Washington, DC for the past several years. &nbsp;As a federal employee, MS Office is the productivity product
 of choice and is used heavily in government on a daily basis. This support program was very well done and covered many pertinent support topics in a single half-day session. &nbsp;It was a great refresher, highlighted new feature sets, &nbsp;and covered many of the
 most common support topics that we see in our daily operations. &nbsp;The information was timely and immediately useful. &nbsp;I would recommend this program to any Mac IT Pro. &nbsp;It is well worth the time and I hope to see it continue on an annual basis. &nbsp;Any information
 on the status of this program and where it is being offered this year would be much appreciated.

            I was looking forward to having my staff take the 2016 Certification Course and get their certification. I think it sets us apart as an Apple Consultancy, Apple Authorized Reseller and Service Provider. I can't seem to find information on this years certification.&nbsp;They
 were once prefacing the MacTech Pro events, which was really convenient. Hopefully more information will be forthcoming shortly.

            <p>When Microsoft created this program, they made a huge statement to the Mac technical community that they actually cared about the Mac and iOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supporting that ecosystem means more upgrades, better support, and fewer calls to Support.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple users rely on their consultants and techs for advice — so it was smart of Microsoft to invest
 in the professional Apple techs. It allowed us to be the onsite experts, and be able to represent that knowledge to our clients and users. This was a meaningful program, and it should be continued and enhanced.</p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: While we appreciate you getting the word out about MacTech events, these dates are not relevant here -- as the Microsoft Office for Mac and iOS Accredited Support Professional program is a Microsoft program, not a MacTech program. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time, we (including MacTech) don't have any details from Microsoft about its 2016 accreditation program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, just so that the right link is here on the&nbsp;MacTech Conference registration -- that URL may or may not work at some point in the future. &nbsp;The best URL to use, for the best pricing, is&nbsp;http://conference.mactech.com/registration</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Onenote file hierarchy change</h2>
                    Without notice, onenote 2010 demoted all of my "notebooks" to "sections" leaving me with one GIANT notebook. called ONENOTE NOTEBOOKS.
<div>For Example, a notebook called "Manuals" suddenly became a section called "manuals" &nbsp;I attempted to create new notebooks within Onenote but it denied me stating that the location was already open in another notebook.&nbsp;I made no changes to the file structure
 or folders either inside or outside the program and I have no clue as to what occurred to cause this change.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was hoping that their was a command that would promote a section to a notebook, but I am unable to find it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Does anyone know how to reverse this process?&nbsp;</div>

            You've made the mistake to open the Onenote Notebooks folder as a notebook.<br />
Your real notebooks are folders <span style="font-weight: bold">under </span>the Onenote Notebooks folder.<br />
Close that pseudo notebook in Onenote and re-open your notebooks by using File, Open and navigating to the corresponding (equal named) folders

<h2>            Manage Sources</h2>
                    Using Manage Sources, then Edit Source, I am having a problem in listing religious authors.&nbsp; Most religious authors have a suffix. For example: Rev. Thomas Smith, O.Carm.&nbsp; When I generate a Bibliography, Word sees the comma as the last name, first name
 comma and jumbles everything&nbsp; I tried using hard spaces to no avail.<br />
<br />
The problem entry is: Smith, O.Carm., Rev. Thomas<br />

How can I get Word to recognize the comma for the suffix is different from the comma for last name/first name?<br />

            I have on my own figured out how to insert suffixes on names if you want. Suffixes are, for example, Jr., J.D., O. Carm., etc. &nbsp;First, in Manage Sources, do not manually type the name in the name line. &nbsp;If you did it would look like Smith, O.Carm., Rev.
 John. &nbsp;This method will not work.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Instead, always, always use the Edit button &nbsp; On the Last line type the Last Name, then comma, the hard space, then the suffiix. So the last line will be: &nbsp;Smith,(Ctrl-Shift [together]space bar) O.Carm. Remember to use a hard space between the comma and
 suffix</div>
<div><br />
<div>Use the same idea to keep a title with a first name. On the First line, type Rev.(hard space)John. It could also be used for Dr., Pope, etc. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then select Add, then OK. Voila! &nbsp;Your biblio is perfect.&nbsp;</div>
