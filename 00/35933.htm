<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most likely you’re signed in to a different Skype account linked to your email address. Skype contacts and Skype Credits should sync on your Skype
 account whenever you sign in to it. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I strongly advise you to check the correct Skype account that you’re using. Enter your registered
<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">email address here</span></a>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If you created your Skype account with a unique or personalized Skype Name, always sign in to Skype using the Skype Name and not the email address.
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

<h2>            Enforcement - Reason</h2>
                    <p>From what I gather, when a user gets an enforcement action on their account they aren’t told exactly what they did to violate the Code of Conduct, only the general rule that they violated. IE) Communication ban for X amount of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wouldn’t it be more helpful/insightful if the team also included more details so that people can learn from their mistakes? Especially since these enforcement actions are not immediate (which is completely understandable). But even I’m lucky to remember
 yesterday personally, so I can emphasize with the folk who are totally clueless lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ve seen some good points made reading some of these topics the last few days... such as the parent who was seeking to see what his kid did to get banned, and I think it would be awesome if they were copied on why the action was being taking so that they
 can parent…The same goes for everyone else: You did X which breaks X rule.<strong>&nbsp; W</strong><strong>hats your thought/opinion on the matter?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

            They used to when they used the forums instead of the current system. In some cases they will give some specifics with a case review, but it would be a good idea if they could give more of a specific reason beforehand.&nbsp;

            Actually if you pay attention to the enforcement acts they do have included the reason of the their enforcement and the violation that originates them. If a customer is eligible and willing to go through the case review, they have a chance to tell their
 side of the story which is taken in consideration. I think that is adequate! &nbsp;

            I think its silly for people to treat opposing teams in competitive games like they’d want to be treated. I also think good tactics and skills make the losing teams/players mad and they report and lie and say its for like cheating or unsportsmanlike conduct.
 Ive seen people get unnecessary bans just for being good at a game and ive seen losers abuse the system and get their entire friends list or guild/clan to report people. Ive seen a friend stripped if his gamertag that way.&nbsp;

<p>Very true!&nbsp; I remember I used to be part of an xbox club and someone made a post requesting for everyone in the club to report a player.&nbsp; When he or she was ask why&gt;&gt;they responded with "because they teabag me".😒</p>
<p>
</p><p>And we all know how some people get when in PVP games.</p>
<p>Some people can't just take a lost.&nbsp; Instead they wanna called that person a cheater or hacker.&nbsp; If I come across a good player, even if they beat me, I give them their props and ask if they wanna team up.&nbsp; Your be suprise at the responses to my messages
 when I message them "gg" or "your really good".&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>That is not true, you only get a suspension or gamertag enforced change, if you have violated the code of conduct. It dosen't matter if you get one report or a thousand reports, if you have done nothing wrong, you wont get enforced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a dircect quote of the XBLET site:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I get banned just because I received complaints? </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">No. A common misconception is that a certain number of reports will result in an automatic suspension. According to the myth, even if you haven’t done anything wrong someone can get you suspended by encouraging players to file many
 complaints. This is completely untrue.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">XBLPET investigates complaints and takes each report into consideration when making an enforcement decision, but a certain volume or frequency of complaints doesn’t guarantee a suspension. We take an evidence-based approach to enforcement
 and take numerous factors into account when considering issuing a suspension. The context around the content or activity is particularly essential and drives our decision-making process. Simply put, there is no magic formula that instantly results in a suspension.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Despite what some may claim, XBLPET will <strong><em>never</em></strong> ever ban anyone “for no reason”. Suspensions
<strong><em>always</em></strong> occur as a result of a specific Code of Conduct violation.</p>

            Mass reporting won't actually achieve anything, unless the person being reported has violated the code of conduct. I too have been in a clan where certain individuals thought that mass reporting would get somebody instant banned. Here is a link to the

<p>Its usually a BAD idea&nbsp;</p>
<p>One retialiation you get q general idea as it is</p>
<p>Communication ban</p>
<p>Well dont retailiate or harass people its that simple</p>
<p>Ive seen someone actually complain about a secondary ban because they retailoated against a usert who ironically told him he reported him rrsultingni a suspension and thr said user actually retailiated&nbsp; by cussing them out and received anothrr susprnsion
 for harassment even longer then the first and yes it wss a forum post</p>
<p>Trashbtalk is ok with moderation 99.9% of users dont get suspended&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I agree with you completely. The enforcement team should provide more information to anyone involved with the account that violated the code of conduct for better communication. It would help to understand what exactly the person did wrong and how to avoid
 it in the future.</p>

<p>Disconnect the computer from the Internet, try logging onto the computer using the old password and check the issue status.

</p><p>If the issue still persists, connect the computer back to Internet, try logging onto the computer using both passwords (old and new) and check the issue status.

    <title>Full House Poker - Texas Heat server is not available - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hope_123_h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Full House Poker - Texas Heat server is not available</h2>
                    
<p>It has been 2 weeks since I've been able to play "Texas Heat" on "Full House Poker". I usually play the first and last sessions on Tuesday and sometimes the first session on Saturday. So for the last 2 weeks the "Texas Heat Schedule" is saying that "Time
 server is not available at this time. Try again later." Is this a permanent thing that the interested players are not being notified of? Is it because there are less players now and more players on WSOP Full House Pro? I'd like a concrete answer from XBOX
 since my chat rep didn't have any info &amp; sent me a link to a two year old forum of a similar issue.</p>

<p>There have been quite a few comments about the Texas Heat servers having frequent disconnects. I think there may be some complications with the game's database. As of now, there have been quite a lot of users that got disconnected or have not been able to
 access the servers and according to support the developers' team is working to restore the normal service for the game.
</p>
<p>I think there were just a few complications with the database and server stability, so meanwhile you have to exercise a little patience.</p>

<p><span>Run the network troubleshooter to check if the system has internet connection first. Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with Internet connection. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is
 with your internet.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Refer these steps:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>
Key<strong>,</strong> select <strong>Control panel</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span>Change the <strong>view by</strong> option on the top right to
<strong>Large icons.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span> </span></span></span><span>Click on <strong>troubleshooting</strong> and click on the view all option on the left panel</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span> </span></span></span><span>Run the <strong>Internet Connection troubleshooter</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, try Method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to update all the drivers from Device manager manually by uninstalling and reinstalling from the manufacturer website. Drivers may show an updated status but it’s recommended to download all the drivers for Windows 10 from the manufacturer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to un-install the drivers:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span>On the search bar type “<strong>Device Manager.</strong>”</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span>On the left pane locate “<strong>Network Adapter</strong>” and expand by clicking on it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span> </span></span></span><span>Right on the “<strong>Network Adapter”</strong> option and click “<strong>Uninstall’.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span> </span></span></span><span>Download the latest Network adapter driver setup file from the
<strong>manufacturer’s website</strong> and install it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.

            <p>Sorry, but no. The gamerpics on the One are setup differently than the 360 ones. So once you change it, you cannot change it back.</p>

<h2>            HELP&#33; All the default fonts have been replaced by symbols, Google Chrome also seems to be effected.</h2>
                    So all of the default fonts are changed to symbols. Google Chrome doesn't work, but luckily, for some reason Firefox does, which is why I'm able to post screenshots. Otherwise I'd have to be posting this from a different computer. Here is a small album
 of screenshots: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/IQdV6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/IQdV6</a><br />

Can somebody help me figure out how to get this back to normal?<br />

<h2>            Windows Media Player and Music Library</h2>
                    When I opened Media Player this morning, the scroll bar was operating strangely (wouldn't stay in a fixed spot) and then the music files were systematically deleted from my player library (as if someone was pushing a delete buttion).. One by one, the files
 were gone.&nbsp; When I went to the Music Library, the picture of the folder is there, but when I open, there is no music listed and it won't play.&nbsp; Whe I go to properties, it appears the file is there, but it won't open.&nbsp; I spent about two hours on a chat line
 with HP to no avail. Help!&nbsp; I am not a super-sophisticated user.&nbsp;I have Windows Vista--HP Pavilion desktop.&nbsp; I recently backed-up my computer on an iomega.&nbsp;

            Hi rdmdc,<br />
<br />
That is indeed strange. It sounds like you may have contracted a virus or someone is remotely accessing your pc! Have you searched your pc to see if the files somehow moved or were renamed? Do you have any file sharing software on your pc or are you sharing
 your drive on a network? If you are on a home network, is it secure from outside access? You really need to check the security of your pc and network (if you are on one) or you could lose even more important info. Run a virus scan too.<br />
The good news is that you have a backup. <br />

    <title>PC restarts every time I use my PPPoE Internet connection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PC restarts every time I use my PPPoE Internet connection</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've upgraded to Win 8.1 a few days back. Whereas everything else is working fine, I have started getting a problem when I try to connect to the internet through my PPPoE connection.
</p>
<p>After being able to browse for a couple of minutes or so, suddenly the PC shows a message on a blue scree stating that an error has developed and the PC needs to restart. This happens every time I try to connect to the internet .
</p>
<p>Please help me to solve this issue as soon as possible as I find it impossible to stay without the internet beyond a few days.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IN answer to your questions, here are my replies</p>
<p>1. I used the "Set up a new connection or network" to set up my dialer</p>
<p>2. I haven't configured it to any router, in fact the dialer was installed by my ISP, and it was working perfectly well under windows 8. The problem started only after I upgraded to Win 8.1 a few days back</p>
<p>3. The exact error message I get when the PC restarts is "unexpected_kernel_mode_trap[Ndu.sys]". After that, if I try to reconnect, I get an Error 691 message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: I tried it but it could not solve the problem. I got a message "Ethernet does not have valid IP configuration" [Not Fixed]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: I tried safe mode with networking enabled, but the dialer could not connect to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope the above information will help you fix my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC model is HP 18-1206 IN [all-in-one PC], purchased on April 12 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: I have Windows Update set to install updates automatically, and I got a message that no new updates are available after the last update at 21:32 today</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2. I followed the link and the instructions. Unfortunately, my PC continues to hand and restarts with the same error message "unexpected_kernel_mode_trap[Ndu.sys]"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm starting to get really worried now. Should I restore my PC to Win 8, and if so, is there any safe way to do it without losing my files and programmes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After contacting HP and detailing my problem I was informed that the problem is with Windows 8.1, and was advised to restore my PC to the earlier Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP will be sending an engineer in a few days to do the same as my PC is covered under warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to help me. With fingers crossed,</p>

</p><ul>
<li>Please be informed that when trying to update your Skype and Microsoft accounts, you might receive a message that we found Skype contacts for your Microsoft account and you will only keep your Skype contacts. You will need to sign in to Skype with your

<ol>
<li>Select your <strong>profile picture</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Skype Credit and Subscriptions</strong>.</li><li>Select either <strong>Add Credit</strong> or <strong>Add subscription</strong> and we'll take you through the purchase process.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Please check if you're accessing the correct account. Signing in to a different account might be the cause why your Wife's account does not appear on the contact list. To check if there's more than one account associated with your email address, please
 follow the steps below:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Go to our <a href="https://go.skype.com/account.diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Problems signing in</span></a><strong>

<p>Karen,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thank you for you help.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 1) &nbsp;I will try to use phone number but the sign in is really a mess since my original email was a yahoo (which seems to be stuck in there somewhere) and my new email is a gmail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2) &nbsp;Also, I am unable to figure out which account (it appears that I have multiples) is the correct account.</p>
<p>*** &nbsp;3) &nbsp;The new version of Skype for Mac 8.12.0.14 is missing Contacts and Conversations in the Menu &nbsp; see screenshot below &nbsp;and I am unable to edit or easily deal with contacts.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cab8ce9c-2a16-44d1-a73f-77bf15ecae5c" /></p>
<p>What I ended up doing was installing Classic. &nbsp;Which is OK but certainly Microsoft might wish to look at why there are Contact and Conversations are NOT included in the latest Mac Version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, the new version of Skype does not have Contacts and Conversations, it is only available in the classic version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as for the missing contacts and conversations, try accessing the accounts you have and check which one of them has your contacts and conversations.</p>

<h2>            How do we unsubscribed from a MS Community question here&#63;</h2>
                    I have been receiving many emails to a MS Community question like this one however now there seems to be no way to UNsubscribe to it.&nbsp; There is a 'unsubscribe' link at the bottom of each email in tiny print but all that link does is take you back to the
 question.&nbsp; I realize MS is so incompetent &amp; indifferent that it requires us to answer for all their numerous mistakes but this is ridiculous!

            Hi Ankush_650 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Hi Ankush-650,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is serious issue and should not be rush to fresh install or upgrade repair may not even work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is interesting and I suggest you shut it down leave it for the night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say if you got a good back up on external drive use the dvd with windows 10 on it and boot it up press F8 until it boots into menu option for advanced recovery. and choose to recovery using backup media and that the nest way to recover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise: </p>
<p>Take your laptop to friends place who has a desktop computer if can, disconnect there hard disk and then remove your hard drive and set it up in there system and see if it boots this will replace device drivers that are corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>once into the desktop do not try and activate it just leave it and see if you can open setting screen, internet explorer etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so the next thing you might want to see if what was the last installed program as it could be the cause of all the issues and remove it then if you can just do a check for nasty virus if you can run online virus check if you can not then run chkdsk and
 restart and let it go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sound like you got nasty bug or failing piece of hardware possible ram most likely cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if after you do this place the hard drive back in your laptop and see what happens if problem continues complete clean install is need before you even do that down load your drivers for your model and make if you can to external drive so if and when you
 need them you can install without hassle.</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player 500 Internal Server Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dom92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 500 Internal Server Error</h2>
                    <p>So just recently today, I keep getting this message when I try to find album info for songs in my WMP. It says "500 - Internal Server Error. There is a problem with the resource you are looking for, and it cannot be displayed" in the display box where I'd
 normally browse to find the album information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never seen this message pop up before, and I was adding songs to my library like two days ago with no problems, so what's up with it right now? And more importantly, is there anything I can do to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also add that it seems to do this randomly, and even for songs that I already have added in my library. Clicking "find album info" on some songs will bring up the proper display, and others will give me that error message. So yeah, I haven't a clue
 what's up with this thing and I'd really appreciate a fix sometime soon.</p>

            <p>I have the same Issue! After installing the OS and using the latest drivers from Intel, my Network adapter works without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AFTER installing Windows Update (seems to be an error in on of the above) - it breaks the driver, the console says "driver could not be started" I am using a german Windows, so I dont know how the error is called in US Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After booting the PC I have to go to the Device Manager, uninstall the Network Adapter and hit Search. This is annoying I had thoughts on creating a Batch which runs at autostart.</p>

<br />Its possible build of dust could be blocking the fan and other components in the system unit.

            Hi Maddy
<br />
<br />Boot your PC into Safe Mode, is that static noise still heard in Safe Mode?
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />
<br />If that noise is not heard in Safe Mode, you should update your Audio and network drivers form the support page for your device on the manufacturer's website. Those drivers may be older than your current drivers, but the will at least be compatible . . .
