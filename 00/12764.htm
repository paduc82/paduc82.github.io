    <title>can&#39;t save appointment sent as email attachment - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            can&#39;t save appointment sent as email attachment</h2>
                    I use Outlook 2007 both at home and at work.&nbsp; I had created some appointments in my outlook calendar at work and then emailed these to myself at home.&nbsp; Using xp at work and Win7 at home.<br />
<br />
When I opened the email at home the appointment was attached to the email as a calendar object which is kind of what I expected.<br />
<br />
My problem is that I couldn't find anyway to tell outlook to add this appointment to my calendar at home.&nbsp; Trust me, I looked and tried just about everything.&nbsp; I even sent the email to my wife and had her email it back to me because there was a little note
 that saying I didn't have to respond because I was the originator of the appointment.<br />
<br />
This would seem to be a very straight forward and fundamental task and shouldn't be this hard to do.<br />
<br />
I ended up creating the appoints from scratch on my home machine.<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me how to save these appointments to my home machine in the future?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<p>If you sent the appointments to yourself as iCalendar files, they should save to your calendar just fine.&nbsp; Exactly how did you try to send them to yourself.&nbsp; Describe the exact steps.</p>

<h2>            you tube videos and pictures that are not HD are all zoomed in</h2>
                    <p>last sunday night...the you&nbsp;tube videos quit working that I had been watching to learn new embroidery software.&nbsp; they had worked</p>
<p>just fine until then (update came in that night)&nbsp; </p>
<p>if the videos are available in HD and I change the player to the HD setting...it will work just fine...but most of the videos on you tube are not HD...especially the instructional videos...I also noticed in the music videos that just show pictures of band...they
 are all zoomed in too.</p>
<p>Please understand...the page is not zoomed in...the player itself is not zoomed in...just the video part.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've all ready played with the zoom controls for zooming in &amp; out&nbsp;on a page...that is NOT it.&nbsp; I've spent hours trying to figure it out and I can't...I called the answer desk...the guy came into my computer and said "wow...that's strange"...but didn't have
 a clue as to how to fix it...</p>
<p>said I would need more help than he could give me at the cost of $139.00...I don't have the $...I took early SS and am on a very limited</p>
<p>budget.</p>
<p>I have a HP computer running windows 7 64 bit. with IE 11.&nbsp; Any help or suggestions?</p>

            <p>Ok<strong> I found it</strong>...sooooo simple...I've done virus scans..on line and my own...I've loaded adobe 30 times...it keeps going
</p>
<p>off by the way...but that isn't what it was at all...I couldn't watch most of the video's on you tube or anything that</p>
<p>showed up in the player...the pictures&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;videos&nbsp;were all zoomed in and distorted.&nbsp; I've read all kinds of stuff...</p>
<p>Active x filtering...adobe conflicts...32 bit vs 64 bit.......all kind of&nbsp;stuffola I could care less about....and hated reading</p>
<p>so....what was it?????&nbsp; all you experts...hours on the phone....what was it...."??????? so very simple...but I found it</p>
<p>by accident... I was listening to a music video on you tube...the player just had a zoomed in picture of the album</p>
<p>cover in it...and that little button kept popping up... the one on the left side at the bottom...that says "I think"
</p>
<p>"<strong>AMD</strong>" or something like that "<strong>steady video</strong>"&nbsp; I hate that thing...keeps popping up in my face...anyway...I remember that I turned it to "ON" the other night just to get it to go away....and now it was back again...so I clicked
 it to make it</p>
<p>go<strong> OFF </strong>this time.......and low and behold.....I looked up and the picture in the player was&nbsp; ......CLEAR....<strong> dud duh!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn that thing off!&nbsp; that's what caused this whole mess.&nbsp; If someone else is having a problem....hope it helps</p>
<p>them too.</p>

            OK, in that case it appears you have the ZIP file format associated with Word rather than a process that can open ZIP files. Save the Zip to the hard drive and open with Windows Explorer to extract the files it contains.<br />

<p><span>Can you successfully check for updates using Windows Update in Windows?<br />
I found the following information on how to deal with this error in Windows update:<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Error number: 0x80248014 (Originally was 0x8024001D) when applying Windows Updates<br />
</span><span>Rename temporary folder SoftwareDistribution (instructions are for XP, in Vista/7, you need to get to a command prompt by typing in the search box by the start orb - command, then highlight command.exe and right click,
 select run as administrator)<br />
<br />
1. Click Start, Run, type: cmd and press Enter. Please run the following command in the opened window.<br />
<br />
net stop WuAuServ<br />
<br />
2. Click Start, Run, type: %windir% and press Enter.<br />
3. In the opened folder, rename the folder SoftwareDistribution to SDold.<br />
4. Click Start, Run, type: cmd and press Enter. Please run the following command in the opened window.<br />
<br />
net start WuAuServ<br />
<br />
Please go to the Windows Update site to test this issue. If that works then it was a corrupted Windows Update file and we needed to remove the folder in which it resides.</span></p>

<p>If that does not resolve it, please open a support case:</p>

            <p>Thank you for posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for the Music and Video apps to recognize what's on the SD card, it does have to be formatted correctly.&nbsp; The music needs to be in the "Music" folder, and videos need to be in the "Video" folder.&nbsp; If that's how you have it set up, we'll need a bit
 more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you format the card on your phone, or just on the PC?&nbsp; If just on your PC, you'll want to go to Settings -&gt; Storage Sense -&gt; SD Card -&gt; Format SD Card.</p>
<p>What file formats are the music and videos?</p>
<p>What software did you use to sync the files from your PC onto the SD card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in touch so we can look into this with you.</p>
<p>

                    <p>I just got my laptop fixed and shipped and I am trying to reinstall my Microsoft Home and Student 2013 so I can do my things on my laptop. It says on the screen to Install and then I&nbsp;click to Run and it tells me that "We ran into&nbsp;a problem with running the
 program." &nbsp;OR&nbsp;&nbsp;"busy with another task".&nbsp;If anyone can help me ASAP on this I will appreciate it.&nbsp; I am a college student who is trying to get in a hurry and try and get word documents out for other professors for classes! :)</p>

            I was told by my tech that you can only download MS Office 2013 one time... I was going to reformat my hard drive.... and load Windows 7 (hate windows 8) and I was told I would not be able to re-use my Office 2013 purchase even though I just bought it.
 &nbsp;I hope that is not true... &nbsp;I would call the company you purchased the Office program from. &nbsp;Good luck

            The search bar (play time bar) only works so that the music/video is not playing at all, then you move the bar to certain place and press "play". The the music starts at that point.<br />
<br />
The "forward" and "back" are not exactly forward and back, but more like "next" song and "previous" song, if you have a list of songs or videos or...

<h3> zac hobson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t drag and drop text in Office 365 apps</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Office 365 (2016) on a Windows 10 Home desktop (build (10.0.10586), and I find I am unable to drag and drop text in any of the Office apps. The computer is a Dell XPS 8900 with an Intel i7-6700 CPU, 32gb of RAM, a 500gb SSD boot drive,
 and a 4tb data drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have confirmed that the check box for allowing text to be dragged and dropped is selected for all Office apps that support drag-and-drop editing. I have also confirmed that I
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">am</span> able to drag and drop text in other apps, include Microsoft Wordpad, which would seem to rule out a problem with the OS or some other global software conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both the Quick Office repair option and the Online Office repair option, and neither has changed the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried opening components in Safe Mode, and that makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried opening components with no other apps open, and that makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't seen reports of anybody else experiencing this problem, but it's driving me crazy. What can I try next?</p>

            <p>I want to be able to drag and drop as I always have in Windows apps: to highlight text by holding down the left mouse button while swiping it and then to drag the highlighted text to a different location in the same document using the left mouse button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no trouble highlighting text as I always have in Office 365 apps -- and once the text is highlighted in a Word document, a notification at the bottom of the screen actually invites me to "Use the mouse to move selected object(s) to a new location"
 -- but when I try to drag the highlighted text, nothing happens: the text doesn't move, regardless of whether I use the left or right mouse button alone or in combination with Shift or Control keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that I can get the same job done using Control-C and Control-V to cut and paste the highlighted text from one location to another, but in many situations I find it easier to drag and drop. And since I do a lot of text editing, it's a major inconvenience
 to me to have lost this capability, which I've always had in previous versions of Office.</p>

            <p>FIXED!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After so many attempts including everything above... and then some with Microsoft engineering support.&nbsp; The problem was fixed by&nbsp;installing 64bit Office 365-2016 instead of 32bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new 64bit machine and installing 64bit Office did the trick!&nbsp; When installing Office 365, go to settings, software, advanced, menu drop down to 64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the good news too, all my work was restored (except the customized access bar on the top of the applications.&nbsp; Had to redo the short cuts)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So glad it's fixed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you everyone who contributed to fixing this problem</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes, I can confirm that uninstalling the 32-bit version of Office 365 and installing the 64-bit version solved the drag-and-drop problem for me as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It begs the question of why so crucial a function is disabled in the default install version -- and how many users are frustrated by it. I was very close to writing off 10 months worth of my Office 365 license fee and going back to Office 2007 so that I
 could get some actual work done. Why does it have to be this way, and how is it that nobody from Microsoft could provide the solution two months ago?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh well, rant done. Thanks Steve88488 for providing the solution.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file comes back after it has been deleted, it looks to be a system file that OneDrive uses. However, its program/App files should not be visible. Do you see this file when you open the explorer on your Mac, where you can see all the other files?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I suspect then, the file is set to be hidden, however that view is picking the file up. When looking deeper into this, the more it makes me believe that the file is a system file which programs the app's Icons for OneDrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can not get my head round is when you say "I open the file and its blank". Generally with system files, even if you open them, they should have some sort of code. Even if the program can't display it as Plain English.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you only just noticed this with the latest version of OneDrive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you give me the version number for OneDrive and I will pass this along so hopefully the development team can review this and fix this. Or at least tell us what is happening.&nbsp;</p>

So after taking more pictures, they DO appear in the Camera Roll? If yes, are they still there when you go back to the camera roll?

                    <div>I love my Windows 10 yes it frustrates me at times, tablets seem of late to be suffering from bad builds but hey that's what we are here for.</div>
<div>As there are so many threads putting windows 10 down I thought I would try and correct the balance.</div>
<div>Never had a problem installing it or upgrading it (except on 2 tablets with minimal specs rolled back to 10240 with fresh install)</div>
<div>Every machine I have updates has seen a performance increase.</div>
<div>Old software works under it where it had stopped working in Windows 8.1.</div>

            Good idea! Those I see on here, the main instigators of the hate subjects about Windows 10 look like conspiracy theorists' to me, who are able to draw large crowds through misinformation or partial facts. Of course we'll run into problems with these builds,
 they are beta builds. This is the purpose of the insider program to weed these out. Love Windows 10 also

            <p>I also love Windows 10.&nbsp; There is a bit of pain sometimes, but I do believe that Windows 10 is getting better with time.&nbsp; And in time will be quite well excepted.&nbsp; I really do hope Microsoft's "dream" comes true and this "version" of Windows keeps getting
 better and better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My general recommendation for to my brother and others has to been to wait a bit, but I think it is getting pretty close to a point where most of the big problems have been worked out.</p>
<p>There are always going to be people with problems like driver problems on old hardware and such, but over time that will be worked out one way or another even if that means staying on the old version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this thread is going to get trashed with the nay sayers.&nbsp; They just don't seem to have anything better to do.&nbsp; For instance "LOL:-)" will most likely make an appearance telling us how we are all fools to believe that Microsoft isn't trying to spy
 on us.</p>

<h3> microsoftgeek_75  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook App iPhone - Calendar functions</h2>
                    <p>I used to have on prem Office including Exchange with my company, now I have been migrated over to O365. I can no longer use the iPhone Calendar to sync my job meetings but need to open the Outlook App to view/read emails and view and set new meetings in
 the Calendar in Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my question: is there any way you can drag meetings from one time/date to another like you do in the iPhone native Calendar app? I am going crazy having to click open, change and close each calendar meeting that needs changing in terms of time or
 date or both.</p>

<p><span>Hello MicrosoftGeek_75,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your post in Microsoft Community. Regarding your description about “Outlook App iPhone - Calendar functions”, iPhone calendar and Outlook app calendar both are different and having different functionality. We have also tested at
 our end to drag meeting from Outlook app calendar and found the new meeting is created. We cannot drag and drop the meeting from Outlook App calendar, seems drag meeting is work only in iPhone native calendar app.</span></p>

            Around here in the "Country" this is actually a common saying. At least here it is a plural of Bio Bio's for bio fuel. So, when talking about fuel, They commonly say they run bio's in their car/truck/4 wheeler etc.

<h2>            Version of Excel 2016 differents updates with differents Power Queries</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I developed an Excel file on my computer that use power queries.</p>
<p>I have a version 2016&nbsp; 16.0.4639.1000&nbsp; 64 bits</p>
<p>
</p><p>My file integrate a macro that chceck the Version of excel whten opening-</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Application.Version &lt; 160 Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; MsgBox ("This file can only be updated with Excel 2016 or an highier version")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>My colleague has an excel version 2016&nbsp; 16.0.4266.1001&nbsp; 64 bits</p>
<p>
</p><p>When he want to update the file, he gets the following message:</p>
<p>"Compatibility Warning</p>
<p>The power query queries in this workbookmight be incompatiblewith your current version of Excel. These queries were authored with a newer versionof Power Query and might not work in your current version. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if it's possible to gets the complete version of Excel in a macro so that we can show up a msgbox at the opening of the file indicating that the user have to upgrade&nbsp; his Excel version to the 16.0.xxxx.xxxx if he want to run update queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in adavance for your help.</p>

<p>Hi Anthony</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Office 365 so in the Registry my version (16.0.10228...) is there:</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Looked through all of my sent emails, deleted emails, all folders both on the web (Outlook.com) and Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>2. Searched entire computer.</p>
<p>3. Searched Recycle bin.</p>
<p>4. Searched iphone email accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my other emails from 2006 to present are there. Just this one week is missing.&nbsp; Never had anything like this happen before.</p>

</p><div>
<p><span>&nbsp;If you are using Windows Live mail (the email client) they are already stored locally on your computer. To find out if they are actually there navigate to C:\user\your user\app data (may be hidden see below \local\Microsoft\Windows live mail\your

            <p>Thanks a lot for the suggestions, but yes I had done all that (even though I didn't delete them).&nbsp; I have 10,557 emails stored on my computer.&nbsp; The only thing that's missing is those that I sent from one of my two accounts for that week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even checked my drafts and recycled bin (which has not been emptied in January). I also restored the TMP folders from the recycle bin that were deleted in January.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, one of the emails I sent had "johnsplumbing".&nbsp; When I search "johns" there are 58 results in emails.&nbsp; As soon as I add the "p" there are 0 items.&nbsp; Same result when I sort on date. there are no sent items for that time period.<br />

<p>
</p><p>It's very strange.&nbsp; I have lived and worked in high tech companies in Silicon Valley for over 20 years. So I'm not really looking for a way to recover that weeks sent emails. They are just gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can think of is they were sabotaged by a hacker.</p>

    <title>LUMIA 950 VS LUMIA 950 XL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            LUMIA 950 VS LUMIA 950 XL</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure which one is the best for me. My current phone is the LG G4 and I'm comfortable with a 5.5 inch phone. I used size compare on Phonearena&nbsp;and the 950&nbsp;XL is slightly wider and taller by a few mm's.&nbsp;I wont be using
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Continuum</span> any time so I'm not sure if ill use that extra horse power on the XL. The XL has Corning Gorilla Glass 4 over the 3 on the 950.</p>
<p>The phone gets brighter when needed and is way more compact than the likes of the Nexus 6p. The XL has extra Wi-Fi antennas which have a&nbsp;better performance over the 950. It also has an hour of extra battery life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So which is the better phone? I'm also considering the Oneplus 3 because it has a much better ecosystem than Windows Phone but it is improving with Universal Apps.</p>

            <p>Got a bunch of them in use and for testing </p>
<p>950 or 950XL perform allmost the same on daily use, I do not really notice many difference in performance.</p>
<p>In some benchmarks the 950XL is better but for daily use you could just as happy with a 950 as with a 950XL</p>
<p>I personally like the size of the 950XL but my wife likes the size of the 950. That is again up to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you really believe that Andoid is a better Ecosystem?&nbsp; I disagree. okay there are more apps in the play store, but to be honest many of those apps are crappy knock offs.
</p>
<p>I prefer the closed source Ecosystem that Windows mobile is, less chance on malware virusses and hacks. Android is&nbsp; a more open source Eco system and there are virusses/malware and hacks available that could get you in trouble somehow.</p>
<p>Still many android user complain about a unstable OS on their phones and also complain about that over time their phones are getter slower and slower.
</p>
<p>Oh and what about the update cycle many users complain about not getting the Marshmallow update on their recently new bought phones.....&nbsp; and that is the same with Nougat (7.0)</p>
<p>okay windows 10 mobile upgrade is not available to many phones so that is a similar thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would still go for Windows 10 mobile ;)&nbsp; but again I own multiple phones for daily use and testing ;)</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My Lumia 1520 phone can’t connect to a known WiFi connection unless I reboot the phone. Turn on and back off Airplane mode doesn’t

            <p>Searching on forums I found the following solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Delete all known WIFI access points on phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Set time+date to manual</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I took these actions, my phone connects automatically again to know networks without a reboot. Of course I had to reenter passwords or network keys of WIFI access points.<br />
