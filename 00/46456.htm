<h2>            Display driver failed to start</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 home and running programs on IE 11. All begins fine for several hours. About midday my system crashes to safe mode and message appears that "Display driver failed to start: Using Microsoft basic display driver instead. Check windows update
 for a newer display driver."</p>
<p>I do this under settings but it shows my system is up to date. Where can I get a newer display driver if this is the issue?</p>

            <p>Hi Dom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, may we know if you already contacted the manufacturer of your computer? Are you using an integrated, or dedicated graphics card? What is the exact make and model of your graphics card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference, you can find the latest and compatible device driver from the manufacturer's support website based on the exact model of the graphics card that you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you're getting a loud buzzing noise. One of which could be a defective graphics driver or graphics chip. If your Surface keeps producing a loud noise, we suggest that you install all the latest
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023505/surface-install-surface-and-windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Surface and Windows updates</a>. You can also check this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4023486/surface-surface-rt-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for Surface RT's update history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists after installing all the updates, you can refer to the troubleshooting steps provided by Steven_B on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfwinrt-surfusing/loud-audio-buzz-on-pause/ec281a26-8bea-4eaf-abb2-e9f935aee13d">

<h3> naomirichardson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connect Surface Pro to 2 monitors without docking station</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I am trying to connect my new Surface Pro (Surface Pro i7 Model 1796) to my 2 monitors at work, so I can use the Surface as my main PC as well as laptop.&nbsp; My 2 monitors are DVI / VGA (not displayport unfortunately)&nbsp;</p>
<p>is there some sort of adapter I can get which allows me to daisy chain the monitors?&nbsp; would a VGA to display port adapter on each monitor allow me to then connect the surface mini displayport to the display port adapter on one screen, then daisy chain both
 screens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>would really appreciate some advise!&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

            Naomi,
<br />There is no adapter that can daisy chain HDMI/VGA unfortunately. It isn't in the spec. The only thing I found was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-F2CD060-MINI-DISPLAYPORT-DVI/dp/B00P6MJLL6/ref=sr_1_8?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1515846519&amp;sr=1-8&amp;keywords=mini+displayport+to+2x+dvi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-F2CD060-MINI-DISP...</a> - it has one review (from an unhappy Mac user). Amazon has a good return policy.. 
<br />
<br />I don't know if the above will work for you, but it may be worth trying. 
<br />
<br />That said, the Surface Dock <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/d/microsoft-surface-dock/8qrh2npz0s0p/hpr1?activetab=pivot:techspecstab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/d/microso...</a> gives you two (2) minidisplay ports so 2 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gofanco-Plated-DisplayPort-Adapter-Cable/dp/B00OMEWQQQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1515846899&amp;sr=1-1-spons&amp;keywords=mini+displayport+dvi&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/gofanco-Plated-DisplayPo...</a> cables plus this dock should definitely work.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Please DO mark as Answer if it was of assistance.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even since I bought my PC, I noticed that whenever I needed to make a change in setting I received a message saying I was not the administrator. In order to run CDM to try to make a change, it tell me that the operation requires elevation (run as administrator)
 Why is that?</p>

<p>That's a great question. Since long before anyone heard of Microsoft, the computer industry has been concerned about the security and privacy of information. The industry created the 'principal of least privileges' which states that every computer user should
 have only the amount of permissions that they require for their use of the computer, and no more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Administrators have more permissions than Users. Administrators have the ability to make changes that affect the entire computer, like installing software. Users only have the ability to make changes that affect their own user accounts, like using software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone was to successfully break in to a computer, it would be much more serious if they broke in to an Administrators account than if they broke in to a Users account, because the attacker can do much more damage from an Administrators account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why we are supposed to sign in to a Users account for day to day computing. We only sign in to an Administrators account if we need to do something - like installing software - that requires an Administrators' elevated permissions.</p>

            Hello RubenRamirez
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, my name is G.Paz, I am an Independent Advisor. 
<br />First of all, revise from the control panel what kind of user account you are login. 
<br />Make sure your user appear as administrator. 
<br />Then when you open a cmd, you need to do right click above cmd and select: Run as administrator. 
<br />Make this test and let me know if that work for you.

            Hi Ruben.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you have lost Admin rights then try these steps leading up to if necessary creating a new Local Account which sometimes is the only way to escape Account Corruption in Windows 10:  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Run box, copy and paste in netplwiz, press Enter.
<br />
<br />Highlight your account, then click Properties, then Group Membership tab.  click on Administrator, then Apply, OK, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try this:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrative-rights-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrati...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try taking ownership of the affected files or folders to see if this suffices.  Use this handy tool that adds Take Ownership shortcut to your right click context menu:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing helps try creating a new Local Admin Account to sign into to see if it works:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If you can't get the rights to do this then use whichever method works here to enable the hidden Built-in Administrator to be used only in emergencies:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a> 
<br />
<br />It may be necessary to create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC to access the Command Prompt without needing a password:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Startup Options, first try System Restore to a point before this.  If that fails then choose Command Prompt to follow the step above to access Built-in Admin Account.
<br />
<br />Sign into Hidden Admin account, see if you can use netplwiz now to elevate the account.  If not try another of these methods: <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-account-type-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then set up a new Local Admin Account, sign into it, move your files over, set it up, hide the Hidden Admin Account, when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try making the change.

</p><p>Great answer.&nbsp; Agree, if you're not doing admin tasks you shouldn't be using admin priveledges.&nbsp; Here's a further thought many people aren't aware of - under Cyber Essentials admin accounts should be blocked from email and web access as well!</p>

BluetoothView is a small utility that runs in the background, and monitor the activity of Bluetooth devices around you. For each detected Bluetooth device, it displays the following information: Device Name, Bluetooth Address, Major Device Type, Minor Device
 Type, First Detection Time, Last Detection Time, and more. BluetoothView can also notify you when a new Bluetooth device is detected, by displaying a balloon in your taskbar or by playing a small beep sound. - FREE<br />

    <title>Salvaging Corrupt Harddrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dark pig ninja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Salvaging Corrupt Harddrive</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I had the original Xbox console from 2006ish, with the original 20GB HDD. A few months ago, the Xbox stopped recognizing the harddrive because of a corrupt save file. I now have a new slim Xbox 360, and would like to know how I can
 salvage the data from the old HDD to the new one. I'm thinking I can just buy and use the HDD transfer cable, which should be as simple as transferring over all the files except for the corrupt one? Although, I'm not entirely sure which file is the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

<h2>            United Kingdom Keyboard not removing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this United Kingdom Keyboard in my keyboard settings, even though I cannot see it in my keyboard settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it is still in my bottom right corner:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is not in my country setting as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this laptop around 2 weeks ago, and for a dumb reason I put UK as one of the keyboard (?) settings when I was first setting it up, but I realised my mistake and changed my system locale to United states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any fix to this problem? Thank you very much</p>
<p>

<h2>            Asus Transformer Book Stuck in Windows 10 Installation. &#39;The computer restarted unexpectedly or encounted an unexpected error&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Problem: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Asus Transformer Book had installation interrupted. Now it is stuck in a infinite loop with the following error message:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>'The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error. Windows installation cannot proceed. To install Windows, click
</p>
<p>"OK" to restart the computer, and then restart the installation'</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what is happening. </p>
<p>Step 0: Observe the error message given above. </p>
<p>Step 1: Hit Ok to restart the tablet </p>
<p>Step 2: Observe the tablet restart</p>
<p>Step 3: Observe the same error message given above </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebooted the machine at least 5 times and realize I am potentially in a huge bind. Is there anyway I can restore this forcefully to factory default or anything I can do to get this tablet out of the current loop? It comes with an SDisk? Is there any
 way this can help us (emergency recovery program on it)? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. </p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            No HDMI sound output - WIndows 8 64bit</h2>
                    <p>I am running windows 8.1 64 bit and cannot get any sound through my tv with a HDMI cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through the following on the control panel:</p>
<p>[Sound]</p>
<p>[device manager]</p>
<p>[play back tab]</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only item listed is [speakers]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I need other options listing, how do I get them back? it's worked before so I can only guess a windows update has lost them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Windows Explorer freeze&#47;crash &#40;AppHangB1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>After recently building a new desktop, I've started running across a problem that is causing Windows Explorer to stop working, eventually requiring a forced restart through Task Manager. This problem has now occurred 3 times in the last 24 hours and has
 me slightly concerned over the stability of the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to isolate what the common factor was each time, but nothing salient seemed to be happening at the time. It's probably worth mentioning that each time this happened was immediately after switching windows with Alt+Tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Provided below are the details I obtained from Reliability History and Event Viewer. Any insights would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft lifecam HD3000</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new Microsoft lifecam HD3000 and cannot get it to work on my PC. (I have tested it on a laptop so I it works). In properties- events- information I see this message Device USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_0779&amp;MI_00\6&amp;19fdf172&amp;0&amp;0000 requires further installation.
 With this message in events viewer :Driver Management concluded the process to install &nbsp;driver truecolor.inf_amd64_9ab2dfc39cfb4095\truecolor.inf for Device Instance ID USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_0779&amp;MI_00\6&amp;19FDF172&amp;0&amp;0000 with the following status: 0x0.</p>
<p>As far as I know all privacy settings for the camera are on. I have tried unistall a then reintalling it but that had no effect.</p>
<p>I don't understand what the messages in Properties realy mean but the frase "requires further installation" seems pertinent.</p>
<p>What should I do Next?</p>

<p>As far as I am aware this camera is a plug and play device so there is no driver. In device manager in the dropdown resulting from a right click I have tried all the options i.e. updating the driver, disabling the device, then enabling the device, uninstalling
 the device then reinstalling it again and the scan for hardware changes option just takes me back to the main device manager window.</p>
<p>This takes me back to my original question regarding the information I found in&nbsp;properties- events- information</p>
<p>and what "status: 0x0" means as to me this would appear to be a way of solving the problem</p>

            The <strong>Error 0x0</strong> appears when an active program window crashes. It may occur during a program installation, Windows startup or shutdown, or even during the installation of the Windows operating system. Meaning, this error is a very vague
 error that can point to a variety of reasons why it appeared.<br />
<br />
Have you tried running your antivirus to make sure that there are no malware or virus present on your PC? As the error can be caused by a virus or a malware infection that has corrupted Windows system files.<br />
<br />
You may also perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026616/windows-disk-cleanup-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Disk Cleanup</a></strong> to remove temporary files. This may clean your files from unnecessary ones.<br />

Let us know the result.

            Sorry for the delay in replying. I have tried what you suggested but to no avail. I have tried a couple of sites that test for web cam and the camera shows a picture through them. My daughter contacted us via skype and the camera worked for a second and
 froze. Sound was OK. It would seem there is something wrong with the camera app on my computer. Is there a way of reloading it or using an independent program?

            Hi Sandra,
<div>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community Forums.</div>
<div>From issue description, we understand that Windows Media Player is playing the video file as music file.</div>
<div>Let me go ahead and help you with the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you could answer a few questions it would help us to resolve this issue:</div>
<div>1. Did you make any changes in the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div>2. Do you get any error message?</div>
<div>3. Is the issue specific to torrent downloaded video files?</div>
<div>4. Which version of Windows Media Player is installed on the computer?</div>
<div>5. What is the format of the file?
<div>6.&nbsp;Are you&nbsp;able to play other video files?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to tell you that, if you want to play a torrent file that you have downloaded in Windows Media Player, you must make sure that the media file associated with that torrent is in one of the audio or video formats that Windows Media Player can
 understand. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are a few steps which you can follow to resolve the issue:</div>
<div>a. Make sure the torrent video file you've downloaded is in a file format that Windows Media Player can play. For a list of all of the various types of video files that Windows Media Player can play.</div>
<div>Refer to the link:</div>
<div><strong>Information about the Multimedia file types that Windows Media Player supports</strong></div>

            Are you trying to play the DVD movies? If you are not getting sound from the DVD movies, try installing CODEC packs.
<br />
<br />

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />I can understand that it must be difficult for you when things are not working as it should. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.
<br />
<br />Please try the printer diagnostic utility as this resolves many common printing issues.
<br />
<br />Ensure that â€œWindows Image Acquisitionâ€ service is running.
<br />
<br />Wait until the status light turns green to indicate that the scanner is ready to scan.
<br />
<br />Your system may not work properly if you use a USB cable other than the one that came with your scanner.
<br />
<br />The scanner may not work properly when connected to the computer through more than one USB hub. Connect the scanner directly to the computerâ€™s USB port or through one hub only.
<br />
<br />The scanner may not work properly when your computer is in standby mode (Windows) or sleep mode. Restart the system and try scanning again.
<br />
<br />You may boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the system. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.
<br />
<br />How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows: (Applies to Windows 10) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<br />Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow the steps under â€œHow to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean bootâ€ in the article to boot to normal startup.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards, 
<br />

            <p>Hello Irene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I suggest you to boot the Computer in clean boot state and then try to uninstall Chrome browser from the Computer which might be causing the crashes of the Computer and also try to update the drivers.</p>

</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer.<br />
2. If you see a message asking you to â€œ<strong><span>Press any key to boot from DVD</span></strong>,â€ do so.<br />
3. When you see the Install Windows page, tap or click on <strong><span>Repair your computer

            <p>Thank you, Anju, for the clear step by step guidance.&nbsp; I have tried method one and was unable to continue to the rest of the methods due to&nbsp;a prompt that blocks any attempt I make.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to receiving your email, I have created the Microsoft ISO DVD.</p>
<p>I have tried to boot.&nbsp; The first prompt I received was "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">It looks like you started an upgrade and booted from installation media.&nbsp; If you want to continue with upgrade, remove the media from PC and click "yes". If you
 want to perform a clean installation instead, click "no".</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I made a mistake; removed the media and clicked "yes" and ended up with same prompt over and over again:</span></p>
<p>I have tried again to go with clean installation and was stopped by the stubborn&nbsp;prompt below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; AUTOMATIC REPAIR. WINDOWS COULDN'T LOAD CORRECTLY.&nbsp; SYSTEM RESTORE CAN TRY TO RESTORE YOUR PC TO EARLIER POINT IN TIME WHEN IT WORKED CORRECTLY.
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I feel like a "prisoner" of the above prompt.&nbsp; I am stuck.&nbsp; I am unable to access anything, except a couple of things in safe mode.&nbsp; I ran diagnostics and it seems like PC is ok.&nbsp; At this point,&nbsp;the&nbsp;laptop is dead and&nbsp;<strong>useless.</strong></p>
<p>

<p>Thank you, *john.&nbsp; I have followed all the suggestions/ guidance I have received.&nbsp; It has been quite an effort to override the prompts I have been receiving.&nbsp; Eventually, I got the recovery date only to be kicked back to where I started.</p>
<p>Since I have manufacturer's CDs, I am running hard drive testing, etc. to figure out if I still have a chance to save my PC.</p>

            <p>Hi...you obviously upgrade from Win 7 or 8,1 yes?</p>
<p>Why are you trying to go back?...I think that option is lost...oops You are referring to 'System Restore'?.</p>
<p>1} this can only happen if you created a/or more restore points .</p>
<p>2{even though you may have lets say five different restore points it still may fail if the system is
<em>missing</em> some file or folder...I know, I tried this last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ummm What is the current situation you are in right now?...are you still able to log in and what is the problem?....upgrading can not always go well...you may need to do a '<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1950-windows-10-clean-install.html?filter[2]=Installation%20and%20Setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean

            The issue has been resolved.&nbsp; Since I did not have any access to the settings at all, my only way to achieve anything was Safe Mode with three options; CD-DVD was one of them.&nbsp; I would click and enter the only option I had, but there was a hurdle when
 I would "Press any key to boot from DVD".&nbsp; The so familiar prompt " Automatic Repair" would appear and would not let me start the boot.&nbsp; I kept trying over and over again until I finally developed my own trick. The moment I would&nbsp;click enter on the only option
 I had (CD-DVD) in the safe mode, I would&nbsp;immediately start pressing, clicking&nbsp;and almost holding a key on the keyboard. It worked.&nbsp; First time, I clicked on Repair your computer; it did not work because I was unable to restart the computer when I was asked
 to do so.&nbsp; Second time, I decided to go for clean install and it worked.&nbsp; Having home group helped to restore some files and documents that have been lost.&nbsp; My old laptop works and I h

<p>Yes, it is true; my last post is "pretty mixed up" for a good reason. It reflects my path from the land of "nowhere", where I found myself after the crash, to a positive result by using bits and pieces of the helpful advices I have received, yours including.&nbsp;
 It was not just a straightforward boot.&nbsp; I had to use different reroutes to get there.</p>
<p>So, thanks again, *john.</p>
<p>Irene S.</p>

</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; In one of my posts, I have mentioned I had used manufacturer's CD and had run some tests.&nbsp; I strongly believe it has helped me to tune up my old laptop.</p>

<p>The application in question sends the display over WiFi to a projector.&nbsp; It can support the desired resolution, but when I change other settings it defaults back to 1024x768.&nbsp; I've also had issues with hard-wired projectors changing the screen resolution
 on me.&nbsp; I want to lock this behaviour out.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try installing Intel wireless display driver from official website</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?DwnldID=19782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a> to download</p>
<p>
</p><p>regarding locking</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 2 different things going on. First, you need to set your display resolution to 125%. To do this go to Control Panel, click on Display, and when that opens a new window, click on the left-hand side menu, "Set custom text size (DPI)". That should
 lock in your custom DPI setting @ 125% (or whatever you set it at).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second setting is more problematical, and is something you need to set in each application that is a problem for you. I have a similar problem with my desktop computer, and have to set my high def monitor @ 150% to be able to see text clearly. The problem
 is that many applications aren't "DPI aware", meaning they don't automatically adjust for high definition monitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get around this problem, right-click on a program's desktop icon and select&nbsp;properties. When that window opens, select the compatibility tab from the top row.&nbsp; Scroll down the list of check boxes till the last one and mark it, "disable display scaling
 on high DPI settings", then click Apply, OK, and OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try that and let me know how you fare.</p>

            Sorry, but you are on the wrong track here.&nbsp; The DPI setting and the screen resolution are different aspects of the display.&nbsp; Windows uses the DPI setting to scale objects on the screen.&nbsp; If your DPI setting matches your monitor DPI then objects such as
 the ruler in your word processor will line up exactly with a physical ruler placed next to the screen, and a 12 pt font on the screen will be the exact same size when printed on paper.&nbsp; What I am hoping to control is screen resolution, not DPI.

</p><p>Which application it is ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try this </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to program files folder where your app is installed. <br />
<br />
2. Right click on the appr.exe icon.go to properties and select the 'compatibility' tab.<br />
<br />
3. Just uncheck the option given there which says 'run in 640x480 resolution'</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To find out if some other non-Microsoft application is causing this issue, letâ€™s place the computer in clean boot state and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link to place the laptop in clean boot state:<br />
<strong><span>Note: </span></strong>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "<strong><span>clean boot</span></strong>." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
â€œ<strong><span>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8â€</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong><br />
You can follow the section â€œ<strong><span>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</span></strong>â€ to check for the application or program that is causing this issue:</span></p>

Check if you find the screen resolution changing automatically.</span></p>
<p><span><br />

    <title>My external drive often drop out of Windows explorer and are not - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My external drive often drop out of Windows explorer and are not accessible. Reboot corrects.</h2>
                    <p>November 4, 2011</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Info:</p>
<p>Computer: </p>
<p>Dell Studio 1555</p>
<p>Drive: 500 GB (300 GB free)</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7 Home Premium - 64 bit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem:<span>&nbsp; </span>External Drives Drop-out.</p>
<p>Initially, I had a Seagate external drive, 1.5 TB, that would often disappear from the list in Windows Explorer or Computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Repeated reboots would temporarily correct this until it happened again at random time intervals. I transferred this drive to a different computer and the problem did not occur there. Going back to the original computer, the problem again surfaced multiple
 times. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased two additional Seagate 2 GB external drives and experienced the same â€œdrop-outâ€ problem with them.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Like the initial drive, I transferred the new drives to a different computer and the problem did not occur there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attempted resolution:</p>
<p>Using Norton Security Suite, with the external drives connected, I did a full virus scan:</p>
<p>Launch NSS &gt; Run Scans &gt; Computer Scan &gt; Custom &gt; Go &gt; Checkmark: LiveUpdate, Virus and Spyware,
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>All PC Tune-up items, Disk Optimization, and Registry cleanup.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I repeated the Registry Cleanup to verify zero errors.</p>
<p>This did not repair the drive drop-out problems, so I searched for a resolution on at Microsoft.com.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The very first suggestion was to run <i>their</i> suggested registry cleanup program, Uniblue Registry Booster, that allegedly found over
<b><u>1,300 errors.<span>&nbsp; </span></u></b>This program repaired 15 issues for free but required purchase and registration to fix remaining registry errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Norton Security Suite consultant believes that Uniblue may not have all of the proper registry accounts, therefore reporting valid references as errors.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comments or Suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Do you get any error message/code?
</p>
<p>b. Do you have more than one hard-disk installed?</p>
<p>c. If yes, does the drive with the operating system disappear, too?</p>
<p>d. Does the hard disk get detected in Device Manager?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By
<i>hard disk keeps disappearing in Windows 7 </i>â€“ are you referring to the drives (D, E, etc, if any) apart from the â€˜Câ€™ drive, that disappear or an external hard disk?
</p>

<p>You may check for the IDE/SATA cable connections and make sure theyâ€™re plugged in securely.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have more than one hard disk connected, you may check for the jumper settings and make sure theyâ€™re set proper.
</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
