            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you want to get your old emails on your new laptop and I'm here to assist you. Before we can give you solutions on how to get this done, we need you to answer the following questions so we can isolate the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Are you using the web mail or a&nbsp;mail client? If you're using a mail client, what is it and its version( Windows Live Mail 2009, 2011, 2012 or Outlook Express, Outlook 2010, 2013)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Do you still see the old emails on the web mail?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Could you provide us the exact steps on your statement "I deleted a large number of emails from the old laptop. They were reloaded afterwards so I assume the old emails are somewhere"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your cooperation is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Embedded returns in Excel cells... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericp101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embedded returns in Excel cells...</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to clean up a mailing list from one of our customers that was created in Excel.<br />
<br />
I'm finding that In the "address" cell, we have the potential for an address. But sporadically, the document creator would put something in the cell like this:<br />
<br />
company name<br />
<br />
address<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
address1<br />
<br />
address2<br />
<br />
I need to somehow flag the cells that have "returns" in them (in the examples above 2 returns), and then break them apart into 3 separate "fields".<br />
<br />
How might one approach this problem? If there Isn't an easy means of fixing this, is there a means of highlighting the cells in question in color to make them easier to spot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Eric<br />

            There are a couple of ways to do this. You could search for char(13) in the cells and flag them with conditional formatting. Or, and maybe easier try highlighting the columns and using text to columns in the data menu. Then copy and paste the column data
 until you get the everything sorted out.<br />

<h2>            Nokia Maps online doesn&#39;t work behind corporate firewall and proxy</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia Maps online '<strong>search</strong>' and '<strong>routes</strong>' don't work on my work computer. My PC is behind corporate firewall and proxy, but that shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my work's PC, I can save, edit and rename Favourites; I can rename Routes; I can see a route previously saved on my phone. But it's not possible at all to search for places and consequently it's not possible to calculate new routes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Nokia should pay attention to this proxy issue, if it wants Nokia Maps to become popular all over the world, since at least on my corporation, Nokia Maps is the only mapping system that cannot be used!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google Maps, NAVTEQ.com and TomTom route planner are some mapping systems that work fine on my work PC. Unfortunately, I cannot use Nokia Maps, which is my favourite system...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can a Nokia representive forward this to the Nokia Maps online team?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

</p><p>Normally, Skype call's endpoint would be the device that has the stronger distribution of bandwidth. If you want to answer the call on your PC but the Skype rings on your phone, that means the phone has the stronger bandwidth compare to your PC. As a workaround,
 we suggest you to set your status offline on your mobile phone so that you would be able to answer the call on your PC.

<h2>            OneDrive for Business Sync issue</h2>
                    I have been using OneDrive for Business for several months now. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
This morning I have added a folder with the size of about 3 GB.<br />
Since then the drive doesn't seem syncing. When mouse over the icon, it shows " Syncing files - 3,318 remaining"<br />
When I checked the view syncing problem. I got the following message (see the image captured below). &nbsp;<br />
Please help me resolve this problem. BTW, this drive is currently synced with two other computers running on Window 10.&nbsp;<br />
They sync just fine with the folder just added.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I'd like to confirm which library you are syncing now. If you only sync your OneDrive for Business library, you can consider using our Next gen OneDrive for Business sync client,
 which is more stable and better. For the detailed steps, refer to </span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Get
 started with the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client in Windows</span></a></p>
<p>Note: The feature to sync SharePoint libraries and group libraries will come soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you also sync SharePoint site libraries/group libraries or want to continue using legacy OneDrive for Business,<span>&nbsp;
</span>about the issue you experienced, please refer to the following steps first to check the outcome.</p>
<p>1.Clear OneDrive for Business cache with
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">fix it tool</a>.</p>
<p>Warning This tool can cause data loss. To reduce this risk, read this article in its entirety before you use this tool</p>
<p>2.Go to the following path, and make sure the Spw and OfficeFileCache folders are deleted.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\Spw</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\OfficeFileCache (If you are using OneDrive for Business 2016)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\OfficeFileCache (If you are using OneDrive for Business 2013)</span></p>
<p>3.Resync the library to check the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please also check
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this article</a> to see if the folder you added exceed the restriction and the limitations of the sync client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please provide the following information for further analysis:</p>
<p>1.Go to task manager-&gt;Details -&gt; Right click groove.exe -&gt;properties -&gt;Details to let us know the OneDrive for Business version.</p>
<p>2.The screenshot of the error message.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Cannot connect to Google account on Lumia 920</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to connect to my Google account (in order to sync emails, contacts and callendar) on my recently bought Lumia 920, yet I got the same error message each time I try: "Google account info is incorrect / Update your account info from..." and depending
 on what I choose (emails only or emails, contacts and callendar) it suggest updating my info from m.google.com or imap.gmail.com:993:1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else experiencing this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Howdy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's yet another problemo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After signing into OVI using a browser&nbsp;and selecting the music side of things I get the main screen of the music site but 2 graphical aspects do not finnish their download. Only circular loading sign is displayed.&nbsp;First aspect is at the left hand side of
 the screen underneath the green OVI logo and the other one is large area above the new albums, could these be flash stuff or similar? The browser window makes an annoying clicking sound almost like it is looping something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have attached a screen shot of the music screen. If i use the latest release of Nokia OVI Player i get slightly different looping screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Help welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>rufus</p>

            Definitely a problem with your browser, that circle after loading gives into flash images. So try and refresh or use a different browser.

<h2>            HELP&#33; Lost conversation on Voice Recorder Pro</h2>
                    This morning I recorded an important conversation on my Nocia windows phone using Voice Recorder Pro. I replayed the conversation later and then got a text which took me away from that VRP app. When I went back into it the conversation was gone. I guess
 if you dont save immediately then the file is not there. But is it somewhere that I could retrieve it. Desperate here.

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</p>

                    <p>While I was reading eMails using Edge today, all my eMails in Inbox disappeared. 13 years of eMails.</p>
<p>I did not delete them, I do not even know how to delete a complete folder in one swipe.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted this in German </p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/de-de/outlook_com/forum/oemail-orestoremail/inbox-inhalt-verschwunden/06cbc7d3-f170-47ff-ad12-f8016926e5e8?msgId=ec8df34f-6227-4432-a538-2dcc9a46aa86</p>
<p>got no useful reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>8 hours later the eMails (or part of them) appeared in the Deleted folder. </p>
<p>When I try to recover them a window pops up showing only the eMails I deleted on purpose in the last 14 days or so.</p>
<p>I cannot select and restore them, nor can I select/restore the 13 years of eMails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be specific: I can manually select SINGLE eMails and recover them. I cannot select and recover&nbsp;10000s of eMails manually!</p>
<p>Is there no way to bulk copy the deleted folder into the inbox folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help please?</p>
<p>Help I'm running out of time! The deleted folder will be permanently erased with 3 days.</p>

                    <p>I have seen a lot of threads about this but no proper answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just installed Office 2010, and having problems. MS Word 2010 freezes every 3-4minutes</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>It is not Autosave - firstly Autosave was set to 10minutes and the crash was far more regular (3-4mins). Also Autosave is now off and still the problem remains.</li><li>A reinstall of Office does not help. It is very unlikely that the core program is at fault, since it works fine on other machines in the business.</li><li>The document is not content rich. It is single page with one small picture (.png 300px x 175px) and text. The only formatting is a bold, centered, size 16px title.</li><li>There are no macros running</li><li>I reinstalled Office, started Word, and still the crash happens within a few minutes.</li><li>Started Word in Safe Mode</li><li>Installed latest Windows &amp; Office updates</li><li>Disconnected from the network and turned off AV</li><li>Repairing Office</li></ul>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes it is on a work domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Renaming the template did not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not try any of the reg fixes in CURRENT_USER because the problem happens with all users, right after a fresh install of Office.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So would that mean it was more likely to be an issue in LOCAL_MACHINE and not anything user related ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is it the domain issue or the # of users issue?</p>
<p>What difference would network make? Most PCs are on a network these days.</p>
<p>Would it make a difference if it was happening on a home domain, i.e. WORKGROUP?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was I right about the CURRENT_USER settings not being applicable?</p>

<h2>            Excel - Mirror columns</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am completely new to Excel and have managed to put together a pretty extensive worksheet full of data. I've now been asked to create a mini reflection of certain columns into a different worksheet (almost a live snap shot of those columns). My manager
 doesn't want to have to apply filters on the main sheet so he just wants to see the columns he's chosen from the main sheet, reflected on a different worksheet. The columns need to automatically update from what is populated&nbsp;on the main sheet and also, if
 I ad another row to each column, it needs to add in automatically to the second worksheet. Is this possible and if so,how??? Thank you</p>

<p>thanks for your reply. I did run the troubleshooter and it ended up with no error founds.</p>
<p>As indicated in original post,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;the button itself seems intact as I can feel the vibration feedback when hitting the button, I can also trigger screenshots, etc... but when I simply
 hit the button and have any app open, it is not followed by any reaction although I would expect the Windows/Start Menu to show up.</span></p>

<p>The physical "home" button on the Surface Pro 3 (Tablet PC) does not work anymore (for me at least) since installation of release 14295.</p>
<p>The soft button (bottom left of the careen) works. The button itself is not damages as I can feel the vibration feedback when hitting the button but it is not followed by any reaction.</p>
<p>Anyone with same issue?</p>
<p>(how can I test the Home button differently?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found this by doing a search:</p>
<p>Uninstalling and reinstalling the driver for the home button has resolved this issue for other Surface devices in the past. As such, we would like you to try this as well. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Go to&nbsp;</span><span>Desktop</span></li><li><span>Swipe from right and&nbsp;click on&nbsp;</span><span>Settings</span></li><li><span>Click on&nbsp;</span><span>Control&nbsp;Panel</span></li><li><span>Open&nbsp;</span><span>Device&nbsp;Manager</span></li><li><span>Choose&nbsp;<strong>System Devices</strong></span></li><li><span>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Surface Home Button</strong></span></li><li><span>Open the driver tab</span></li><li><span>Choose to uninstall (DO NOT DELETE)</span></li><li><span>Restart the Surface Pro 3</span></li></ul>

            <p>I did uninstall the Surface Home Button driver then restarted the SP3 - no change.</p>
<p>I really believe it is not hardware related (as vibration feedback is there and other functionalities such as screenshots, speech mode are working as well) - Is there any tiny app/tool that could be used to confirm this (something similar to "Multi Touch
 Test" that helps testing the touch screen?</p>

<p>I did many searches too without finding any solution -</p>
<p>However, one comment rang a bell to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the Surface App, there is one option related to the Hardware, Windows button</p>
<p>It says: "To avoid inadvertent actuation while using&nbsp;your device, keep this feature off"</p>
<p>I am unsure what all this means precisely but the bottom line is </p>
<p>DO NOT FOLLOW THIS ADVICE -set this option to ON and everything works fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. probably nothing to do with insider release 14295 - sorry for this</p>

<h2>            IE causing crash and lockup.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10. &nbsp;Several times in the last 2 weeks on opening a web page and this morning opening one of the news headlines, the computer freezes with security warnings and provides a number for support. &nbsp; The issue completely locks up the computer and nothing
 works. &nbsp; I have had it cleared 2 times.. &nbsp;The recommended solution is to use Google rather than IE or Edge. &nbsp;That does not sound like a fix, but circumventing the problem.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
This can be caused by a software conflict, or due to a malware or virus infection.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, to help resolve your concern, we suggest that you boot your computer in Safe mode with networking. Safe Mode with Networking starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers and services needed to access the Internet or other computers
 on your network. Check if you will encounter the same issue while in Safe mode. For instructions, you may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>. You can choose whether to boot your computer from Settings or from the sign-in screen.<br />
<br />
Resetting your Internet Explorer might help resolve your concern. For instructions on how to reset the Internet Explorer browser, you can refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17441/windows-internet-explorer-change-reset-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Resetting your Internet Explorer browser will delete the saved favorites.You may need to back up all the favorite websites before doing the said process.<br />
<br />
You can also run the <strong>System File Checker</strong> and <strong>DISM tool</strong>.
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> is a utility in Windows that scans for corrupted Windows system files. If it finds a problem, it will try to replace the problematic system files from a cached version that’s on your PC. If SFC can’t replace the files,
 the <strong>Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM)</strong> can check the corrupted files then download and replace the files through Windows Update.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>X </strong>on your keyboard.<br />
</li><li>Choose <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>. <br />
</li><li>Copy or type each command followed by hitting <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<em><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></em></li></ol>
<p>Running a full scan of Windows Defender can help. This is to check any malicious software or adware that might be causing the issue. You can check this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17187/windows-10-protect-your-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article </a>on how to protect your computer using Windows Defender.<br />

<p>
</p><p>That is a scam.&nbsp;&nbsp; DO NOT CALL.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can get out of it using Task Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp; Press Ctrl-Shift-Esc.&nbsp; (Or if necessary press Ctrl-Alt-Delete and enter Task Manager that way.)&nbsp; Alternatively of course you could have Task Manager already running and switch to
 it (e.g. via Alt-Tab).&nbsp; Then kill the iexplore.exe task which is showing that tab.&nbsp; (Or the whole IE app.)&nbsp; Do not allow that tab to open when you restart IE.</p>

                    I migrated my portfolio in Microsoft Money and everything moved fine except one security - DSL (Doubleline Income Solutions Fund). When I search for that symbol on Microsoft Money it cannot find it either. Can the appropriate person please look into this.

 did still have my emails in it. Signing in today (April 4) only&nbsp;2 months later, I find they have now deleted all of my previous emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like assistance getting my emails back as there was a number of emails in my account that I still use and need. The emails were only deleted between February and today and do not meet the outlook.com policy for wiping an account clean.

* Messages were manually deleted either due to accidental deletion or were moved or deleted due to your account filter settings.</p>
<p>* Messages were deleted due to account compromise issues where a hacker might have gained access to your account and deleted the emails.</p>
<p>* You are using an e-mail client or a third party spam filtering software to access your account.<br />
This often happens when using the Pop3 protocol to retrieve your mail and the option “Always leave a copy of the message on the server” is not selected.</p>

            <p>Hi JMH3143,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to reply, however, I read your canned answer on&nbsp;about&nbsp;5 other&nbsp;questions relating to this topic already along with the&nbsp;subsequent replies from Microsoft reps directing people to a secured chat where they would&nbsp;look into the problem;
 at which point I&nbsp;realized I would have to post a question to get Microsoft support to&nbsp;look into my account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this issue has been ongoing for at least&nbsp;a couple months your answer is no longer<strong>
</strong>helpful, and&nbsp;quite frankly, it's insulting. You are suggesting that despite the hundreds of questions on this topic, and the prompt from Microsoft to see if "your question may have already been answered" before posting, that I would not read about,
 or&nbsp;tried, the basic solutions you&nbsp;decided to repost. I will await an answer from a Microsoft employee who will be able to provide real assistance.</p>
<p>

            Greetings Dennis, while reviewing the icons on the phone, I noticed that Internet Explorer is there and not Edge i.e. windows 8.1, so when the phone was flashed by Windows Device Recovery Tool, it went back to Windows 8.1. I updated the phone to windows
 10, and everything went back to its original status including the sim 2 icon, and sms messages. Apologies for the trouble, and wishing you all the best. My I suggest advising the team in-charge of Windows Device Recovery Tool to have windows 10 installed and
 not windows 8.1. Thanks.

            Greetings Dennis, thanks for your reply it is much appreciated. I have another problem, so please bear with me. I am using a Lumia 540 Dual Sim (screen shot attached), my laptop is ASUS-K541U, running windows 10 version 1709 installed on 6/12/2017. Unfortunately,
 I am currently in another country so selecting the right sim to make my calls was essential, I was desperate for a solution, I read on one of the posts that the problem might be due to out-of-date Operating System &amp; Firmware, so using the Windows Recovery
 tool (Screen shot attached), when I initially ran this tool I found some discrepancies between what is available and what is on my phone, so I took the tough decision to re-install the software. Before doing that I made sure to backup my phone. Also since
 my photos are on the SD card I wasn't worried about them, my emails are all Cloud based (Outlook, Google, Yahoo) so again no worries, I also ran backup for WhatsApp messages (SD &amp; OneDrive). Contacts and calendar, are all preserved on Outlook (no worries).
 As for my messages (SMS), I downloaded Contacts+Messages Backup, I ran that for the messages to be saved on the SD. Then I reinstalled the software using Windows Recovery Tool. After the completion of this process (around 15 minutes), and the phone ran having
 the right icons. I was able to get almost everything back; contacts, all the email accounts, photos, WhatsApp. The problem I referred to was trying to restore the messages using&nbsp;Contacts+Messages Backup, I am getting the message "SMS restoration integrity
 check failed" (screen shots attached). Is there a way to retrieve those messages. Now,&nbsp;I can still see all the messages on my laptop while using the Messaging App, however I can't copy them or back them up. On another minor convenience issue (not an actual
 problem), after flashing the phone, the whole theme of the phone was changed, it isn't the same phone I used to have; note that everything is working as I would like to work, but it doesn't look the same. Is there any other theme that I can apply to my phone?&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e4f23e7-7d03-413e-9f1a-e1e7cd9d6feb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e4f23e7-7d03-413e-9f1a-e1e7cd9d6feb?upload=true" /></a>

<h2>            2 Questions about deleting&#47;deleted Yammer posts</h2>
                    
<p>I am THE Yammer Network Admin for my Office 365 E1 domain, trying to clean up content for a re-launch.</p>
<p>1) Why do Yammer posts and threads that I delete return after a page refresh?</p>
<p>2) Is there a way to bulk-delete all yammer posts before a certain date?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting! </p>
<p><span>By design, Yammer posts should not come back after you have refresh the page. Have you tried deleting the cache of the browser?
</span><span>At the moment, the only way to delete any posts or message in Yammer is to delete it manually. If in case you want to delete the posts in bulk, you can explore the option to use Yammer REST API for deleting posts. However, you have to develop you
 own API script basing of the resource provided in <a href="https://developer.yammer.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0563c1">https://developer.yammer.com/docs/</font></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know should you have any questions.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps I misunderstood your question but for question No.1, I have experienced similar case... Suppose that there is a thread with one reply. &nbsp;If I delete the top thread, it seems that all (that is to say, top thread and its reply) are gone at first. &nbsp;But
 after refreshing the page, the reply comes back!!! &nbsp;I do not know why but &nbsp;it is the case for me. &nbsp;So when I have to the thread completely with its replies, I delete thread at first, and then refreshing the page, delete all the replies.</p>
<p>I am sorry I can't answer for No.2.</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>Thank you for your response! Deleting posts is really tedious. It can be made simple by using Yammer REST API (an advance configuration for Yammer developers).</p>
<p>Deleting Yammer posts should be done one by one. You have to delete first the replies then the main post. That is how you can check that all posts are deleted. I confirm that the behavior you are experiencing right now is be design. Feel free to let me know
 should you have any questions.</p>

            Possibly it could be a counterfeit. Although some counterfeits have their own clone IMEIs - mind you, 1 batch for about 100 units shares the same IMEI?<br />
<br />
- Just got it from a source.<br />

            If entering *#06# doesn't give you the phone's IMEI number then it's almost certainly a fake.

            I had a similar problem with the last build after it tried to update my vhd to 9926 , the cause was due to one of the new processes in win 10 was closing , basically killing windows but leaving the desktop in an as is state , but with start and taskbar
 items invisible ( right click and drag would show them as still being there ) restarting windows explorer in task manager was a temp fix , i will get the process name later ,when i can log in to 9926
