<h2>            Excel cannot complete this task with available resources...</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have been<span>receiving
</span>this problem daily (3-5 times per day) since last summer 2010, originally using MS Excel 2007. It got so bad that the IT department purchased me a new laptop&nbsp;<span>(the
 original&nbsp;one I had was newly purchased earlier in 2010) </span>as well as installing MS 2010 on the new system. After a few days it started again!</span></p>
<p><span>It has no rhyme or reason as to why it does it. I can have just Outlook and Excel open with one workbook open. It also happens when trying to open an attachment in Outlook.&nbsp; It
 happens with 1 or 10 spreadsheets open. It doesn't matter the size or number of applications currently running; the error message is always the same:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Excel cannot complete this task with available resources. Choose less data or close other applications.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I have a powerful ThinkPad with 4.00 GB of RAM with a processor speed of 2.40 GHz. The only way to solve the problem is save my current work, close Excel and reopen again, and all
 is fine until the error randomly pops up again.</span></p>
<p><span>This is becoming very frustrating (and costly, with my company buying a new system) as I lose productivity and man hours each time I have to shut down and reopen the Excel program
 again.</span></p>
<p><span>I haven’t experienced this error with any other program except Excel. I have worked on a PowerPoint Presentation that was over 100 MB and never received this error message, so I’m
 convinced this is some kind of Excel bug that MS has yet to figure out.</span></p>
<p><span>I've checked other forums as well as this one and there still seems to be no solution to the problem. Has anyone discovered a solution yet?</span></p>

<p><span>I have had this same problem with Excel 2010 and seen it occur with other users and unfortunately, the answer supplied by e4417 is not usually the correct fix.
<br />
<br />
In fact, Microsoft issued an update some time back that creates this problem when trying to sort on a range of rows and fields and subsequently issued a hotfix for the problem. Here is a link to the Microsoft solution -

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-your-office-365-home-subscription-with-up-to-four-people-b389b9ce-3ae3-4a82-9017-39d79972fcba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">One subscription of Office 365 can be shared with up to four people</a></strong>.
 Just to clarify, is the Office 365 subscription originally under your account, or was it shared to you by someone else? If it was shared to you, it may be that the subscription is about to or have already expired. If this is the case, the best course of action
 would be to reach out to the person whose account the subscription is under. This will allow you to know if the subscription is already expired or if it is still active</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have created a Staff team, it isn’t feasible to switch it. It is suggested to create a new PLC team.

<p>I tried all of your suggestions for re-activating my Windows 10&nbsp;to no avail.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;I noticed a comment "DNS address not available".&nbsp; I had recently disabled the DNS Client and emptied the DNS Cache as I was using the MVPS Hosts file as an ad blocker.&nbsp; That
 was apparently when my Windows 10 digital activation was lost.&nbsp; When I re-enabled the DNS Client,&nbsp; then re-booted, my Windows 10 digital activation returned.&nbsp; I can't explain this but it worked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this will be useful to someone else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You asked why did I disable the DNS Client?&nbsp; When using a large Hosts file, the DNS Client can slow one's computer according to many&nbsp; people.&nbsp; Same folks say the DNS Client is not needed and can be safely disabled.&nbsp; This is apparently not true in certain
 cases.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You are right, disabling your DNS server can be helpful depending on your ISP.</p>
<p>But because many programs and services use a reoccurring validation trough DNS services like Adobe, Office&nbsp;and Windows. It is important to create a System&nbsp;Host file for these addresses. Also you should re enable your DNS server and contact your ISP, normally
 it is even possible to implement your own DNS server on your home network if you get forwarding access.</p>

    <title>To count non-empty cells in Column B in VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> htidexxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            To count non-empty cells in Column B in VBA</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a VBA task. When I click on a command button, the aim is to display in cell M5 the number of cells in a column B that are not empty. I wrote the following code:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">Private</span> <span style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">
Sub</span> CommandButton3_Click()</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">Dim</span> prices_no
<span style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">As</span> <span style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">Integer</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; prices_no = Application.CountA(Range("B:B"))</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Cells(5, 13).Value = prices_no</p>
<p style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">End<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span>Sub</p>
<p style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">
</p><p>But Excel kept popping up error windows and said "<span>Run-time error '1004': Method 'Range' of object '_Global' failed</span>".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I thought it should because I didn't refer to a specific worksheet... So I added the name of the worksheet like the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">Private</span> <span style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">
Sub</span> CommandButton3_Click()</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">Dim</span> prices_no
<span style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">As</span> <span style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">Integer</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; prices_no = Application.CountA(Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("B:B"))</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Cells(5, 13).Value = prices_no &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">End<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span>Sub</p>
<p style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">
</p><p>But it still didn't work and the error became "<span>Run-time error '1004': Application-defined or object-defined error</span>" this time...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone have any ideas of what had happened to the code please? I am really confused about the results...</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!!!</p>

<p>I deleted the unwanted contacts use a separate version of outlook 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that some of the were carry overs from previous computers dating back to the early 90's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They were valid entries using the same contact name but different email addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I had to guess the data base was corrupted making these entries "different".</p>
<p>
</p><p>These old versions would load but the delete icon would not be displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway for trying</p>

<p>I have tried vlookup and if function but&nbsp;is not giving the correct value. </p>
<p>In the case above it should be returning the value 10,000 from column ME2/S2 not 14,583. It is returning&nbsp;the value greater than the lookup value instead.</p>
<p>Please&nbsp;help me in this. Thanks.</p>
<p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am USB tethering my desktop from my mobile phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7 Home Premium and outlook 2010, yes that sounds like I'm a dinosaur.</p>
<p>I have a G-mail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have internet connection on my desktop using USB tethering and have previously been able to use my Outlook 2010 from Desktop whilst USB tethering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ditched my wifi service provider on a pocket wifi when I learned I could USB tether from my mobile phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A recurring message window kept appearing whilst trying to open Outlook 2010:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Please note, this same message was appearing whilst I had wifi internet access to my desktop/Outlook 2010)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Message:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Internet E-mail ..............@gmail.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter your username and password for the following server</p>
<p>

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OK&nbsp; &nbsp; Cancel</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-enter my username and password, but won't accept as message keeps re-appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually another message window comes up saying:</p>
<p>

</p><p>I have done the following,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Deleted all email addresses from my Outlook 2010. But now I cannot even set up a new account (email address) in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) In Google account I did, Standard Configuration Settings incoming mail pop3, pop.gmail.com, Use SSL yes, port 995,
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Port 80 nonresponse&#63; Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage for just ONE site that is online. </h2>
                    I know the site is up and online. I've been trying to reach this one site, a&nbsp;very public state site; friends can get in at the same time I cannot. I get the error msg&nbsp;<strong>Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage.</strong> After running diagnostics,
 it says <span><span><span>
<p><span>"<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Website is online</span> but isn’t responding to connection attempts. The remote computer isn’t responding to connections on
 port 80 <span>possibly due to firewall or security policy settings, or because it might be temporarily unavailable. Windows couldn’t find any problems with the firewall on your computer."</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>What is port 80? I disabled all add-ons and even disabled MY firewall for a minute to try to access even though diagnostics says it's not&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem

<h2>            Right Button Drag and Drop attachment in Windows 10 and Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Prior to upgrading to Windows 10, I was able to use the right mouse button to drag and drop a file as an attachment in an Outlook email (shown here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/45" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msoutlook.info/question/45</a>).
 After upgrading to Windows 10, this feature does not appear to be working. Can this functionality be restored? If so, how?</p>

            <p>It should still work. What happens when you try? Does drag &amp; drop still work in general for you in other applications?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main reason for it not to work is when you are running Outlook with elevated (administrator) permissions. Right click on your Outlook shortcut or outlook.exe itself, choose Properties and select the Compatibility tab. Make sure that all options are disabled.
 If you don't see the Compatibility tab, select click on the Advanced... button on the Shortcut tab and make sure that Run as Administrator is disabled.</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I attempt to right mouse button drag and drop, the cursor moves to the top of the email (after release of right mouse button), but does not display the helper menu with the option "Create Hyperlink Here." This issue appears to happen with Word, also.</p>

<h3> gunglewack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia N97 software update 2.0</h2>
                    
<p>Dear updaters</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nokia N97 software update 2.0 </strong></p>
<p>Nokia N97 software update 2.0 will be released in the coming weeks. The software update will make your N97 perform even better, through numerous fixes, improvements, new features and new functions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What's new</strong></p>
<p>The software contains many fixes and improvements including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved touch screen scrolling</li><li>Ovi Maps 3.1 with 3–D maps</li><li>Nokia e-mail, Ovi Contacts, Ovi Store</li><li>Improved memory and battery performance</li><li>Improved image and video stability</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Software availability</strong></p>
<p>As usual, we will publish standard non-customised versions of the software, with country (SIM-free) and operator versions following in the following weeks. The Nokia N97 (and several other devices) can check automatically for new software. Go to
<strong>Menu</strong> &gt; <strong>Applications</strong> &gt; <strong>SW Update</strong> and enable automatic checking. MyNokia members will also receive an SMS stating "new software is available" as the deployment progresses. To register, go to
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/mynokia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokia.com/mynokia</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>

            <p>Hello KhulaniMtshali,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers forums!&nbsp; So that I am not overlooking anything, are all these updates for apps installed on your phone?&nbsp; Are you also getting any error when syncing the primary Microsoft Account on your phone (<strong>Settings
</strong>&gt; <strong>Email &amp; Account</strong>, tap and hold for the <strong>Sync </strong>
option - there will be no Delete)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; If you have not had a chance to, clearing the browsing history on your phone (<strong>Settings
</strong>&gt; <strong>Applications </strong>&gt; <strong>Internet Explorer </strong>&gt; <strong>
Delete History</strong>) and trying both your mobile data then Wi-Fi network can help.&nbsp; The
<strong>Update All</strong> button to apply these updates in a batch, one alternative is to update the apps individually.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Please also ensure that there is sufficient free space available on your phone to install the updates.&nbsp; Although the size of the update data might not be known, a general rule of thumb is to have three times the space available (to illustrate the idea
 that 'cutting it close' might cause an error).&nbsp; The following support page on the Windows Phone&nbsp;website will provide detailed steps for&nbsp;making more room:</p>

</p><p>&nbsp; One other option might be suitable to try, but it's&nbsp;important to make sure the apps are currently available in the marketplace, and that there is no saved data in the app which would need to be recovered.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please uninstall the app, then visit it again
 in the marketplace to install the most recent copy available for download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I hope this helps to get things resolved, please keep us updated with any further questions or concerns!</p>

<p>There are three easy steps:</p>
<p>1. Goto View/ Page Break Preview</p>
<p>2. Select the area you what to print and goto File / Print Area / Set print Area</p>
<p>3. Now if your page is more than one page you will see a blue dotted line. Select this line and drag to where you want the page to break. This setting will travel with the document, will work on other peoples machines</p>

<p>Sorry, should have been clearer:</p>
<p>There isn't an automatic way to change the behavior. At least, there isn't one I have found.</p>
<p>I keep hoping some brilliant programer writes a powertoy/add-in to do it :)</p>

 as "FIGURE 1-1", where "FIGURE" would be size 8 and "1-1" would be size 18 and bold.&nbsp; Is this possible??&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't do charts, so you will have to translate what I am posting over to your actual situation; however, here is my code modified to put the value in H2 into the TextBox...</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ActiveSheet.Shapes(ActiveSheet.Shapes.Count).TextFrame<br />

End Sub</p>
<p>Note that this line...</p>
<p>With ActiveSheet.Shapes(ActiveSheet.Shapes.Count).TextFrame</p>
<p>picks up the last shape that was placed on the sheet (which, because of the way I guided you in using it, it was guaranteed to be the TextBox), but you should use the actual name of the TextBox inside the parentheses instead. For example, if your TextBox
 is named "Text Box 1" (those spaces will actually be in the name because it is a Shape TextBox and not an ActiveX one), you would change that line to this...</p>
<p>With ActiveSheet.Shapes("Text Box 1").TextFrame</p>
<p>If you are not sure of the name given to the TextBox, simply select it and then look at the Name Box&nbsp;(just to the left of the Formula Bar)... it will tell you the name of the control you selected which, in this case, is the TextBox.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t use authenticator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caroliennl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t use authenticator</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week, I used the authenticator app to approve an account for microsoft teams (I've been invited as a guest from a company). After some troubleshooting, it finally went well and I got the approval. I was under the assumption that it would be one-time
 activity, so I deleted the app from iPhone afterwards. Unfortunately, I just found out that you have to reputed to step verification every time to log on. After I downloaded the app again, it requested to register the account again, unfortunately I've already
 done that before, so I am not getting a QR code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please help me reset my account or to to make it possible to verify the account again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello CarolienNL,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the prompt reply. In this forum, we focus on the problems related to Office 365 for Business subscriptions. I have checked your information and the affected account is not Office 365 for Business and the problem is caused by
 the Authenticator application. Given the situation, please create a new thread in the
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home?forum=MicrosoftAuthenticatorApp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TechNet forum</a>. We have experts there for this kind of problems and they can provide more professional suggestions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your understanding is highly appreciated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

Generally there are three types of scans offered by most anti-virus and anti-malware programs:
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick Scan</strong> only looks at those folders/files most likely to contain malware...the most prevalent places where malware hides. Quick scans will vary depending on the security engine but they generally take about 15-30 minutes...so they can
 be performed daily.</li><li><strong>Full Scan</strong> is much more comprehensive because it scans the entire hard drive (all folders/files) so it can take several hours. Most Full Scans can be scheduled to run late at night when not using the computer so you can perform a scan a
 weekly scan without having to monitor it. </li><li><strong>Custom scan</strong> allows the user to select any files and folders on the hard drive to be scanned.</li></ul>

            Scan time depends on some facts..<br />
<br />
(1)If you have small small files with a lot of capacity it could take so much of time<br />
<br />
(2) and this could be due to resource limitation.. if your ram capacity and processing capacity is low this could take time<br />
<br />
(3)if ram /processing capacity is held by other programs/malware as the priority is set to be high<br />

                    <p>Hi, thanks for your time. I would like to know if it is possible to disable or, preferably, remove the Private Browsing mode in IE on Windows Phone 8.1 or above? If anyone can help me with this I will really appreciate it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Not that I am aware of Brian. Because it is built into the 8.1 (or above) update to IE, it would be near impossible to remove it.
