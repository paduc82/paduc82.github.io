                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noted that this option has been removed in Outlook 2013 and I can only view the to-do bar on the right hand side of the view vertically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May ask any workaround for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

    <title>Windows Phone 8.1 broke Straight Talk MMS&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jared krinke 1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone 8.1 broke Straight Talk MMS&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My wife has a Nokia Lumia 520 that came with Windows Phone 8 and has been using a Straight Talk SIM. This had been working great for calls, texts, group texts (which I believe are MMS), and the Web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier this week, the update to Windows Phone 8.1 got pushed down and we installed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were a lot of little (my assessment--not hers :) ) issues and annoyances in the upgrade, but the last remaining unresolved issue is that it appears that group texts/MMS are no longer working on the phone (and this is, unfortunately, kind of a deal
 breaker for us).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The group texts show up in the messaging app with the usual "Get media content now (1KB)" message. When we tap the link, it says "Getting media content... (1KB)", but after that nothing ever happens (other than the link eventually switching back to "Get
 media content now (1KB)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I double-checked the internet APN and MMS APN settings against both the straighttalkbyop.com specified settings and what the settings were prior to the upgrade and everything looks correct--i.e. nothing has changed with the settings (or the recommendations
 from Straight Talk).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line is that MMS was working before the update to Windows Phone 8.1 and after the update it is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if there are any known issues or work-arounds. Otherwise I'll look into reverting the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I think this is a real issue, but I believe I found a work-around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later in the day, I tried downloading the messages again (in case it was a Straight Talk outage) and it still failed as noted in the original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I did the following (not sure which "fixed" the issue, but I'm guessing it was the first):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Edit Internet/MMS APN to change the name, save, then change the name back and save</p>
<p>- Toggled roaming on/off</p>
<p>- Toggled data on/off</p>
<p>- Changed the name of the SIM (probably not relevant, but listing for completeness)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if you run into a similar issue, try the first bullet above and see if that resolves the problem. If not, try the other ones. If anything works, please reply so that others will know whether or not this is likely to help. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Lumia 640 will not connect to the T-Mobile network for Internet access</h2>
                    Since installing the Windows 10 update, I am not able to access the Internet or send MMS photos via the cellular network. I have been able to use the Internet and send pictures via wi-fi. I had a new SIM card put in today, and the problem is still there.
 How can I fix this?

<p>Also, can you call somebody using your phone? If not, check your SIM card and replace it. A faulty SIM causes problems.</p>
<p>If nothing helps do a soft reset(vol.down+power) and check and if that doesn't help use WDRT to reset phone.</p>

            I have just realised I have an identical problem on my 830 which updated to W10 last week. I don't use it much away from WiFi so it's only just become a problem. Anyhoo, tried a reset which has not made it any better so am hopeful an update will appear
 soon that helps. Fingers crossed.

            <p>Hi Abi99, The problem is all the time. Whenever I'm not on Wifi I have no internet access despite the status bar at the top of the screen saying T-Mobile 3G+ or similar. I've tried switching off/battery out/SD out/ back on again - all no change. Tried to
 take screenshots but it seems they aren't being stored anywhere despite saying "saving in screenshots".
</p>
<p>In Settings/network and wireless/data usage it confirms zero mobile data is being used. In Mobile and sim the data connection is switched on and roaming options is set to "roam".</p>
<p>Starting to think rolling back to the original operating system might be the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update....</p>
<p>decided to try and get help from t_mobile and ended up on their forum where I found lots if similar problems. Why my internet searches hadn't thrown these up is anyone's guess. The&nbsp;solution it seems was that my Internet APN settings had been somehow corrupted
 during the update. Some helpful person published the correct settings which I used to create a new profile and hey presto!</p>
<p>Screenshots still disappear without a trace but I can live with that.</p>

            I resolved it by clearing the T-Mobile APN settings.

<h2>            Office 2013 automatic updates not working &#40;win 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have attempted to correct this problem with the steps provided by MSFT. In Settings/Update I have gone to advanced settings and clicked on the box to include other products with the Windows Automatic Update. &nbsp;I have also tried a manual update. &nbsp;Didn't
 work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the Office list of updates, the current one should be 15.0.4893.1002 from 1/10/2017. &nbsp;My version on my desktop is 15.0.4420.1017. &nbsp;On my laptop, it is 15.0.4893.1002.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just reloaded the desktop Office software due to other problems that required me to do a clean Win 10 install, which may account for the different level from my laptop. &nbsp;Same license as the laptop; two user version.</p>

</p><p>15.0.4893.1002 is the correct version.&nbsp; I have Office 2013 on my laptop. Just checked and also did a repair which checks to see if the Office is up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if a repair assists&gt;Control panel&gt;Programs and features/settings&gt;Right click on Office 2013&gt;Choose&gt;Change&gt;Choose&gt;Quick Repair.&nbsp; If that does not work choose&gt;Online Repair. You will need to sign in with the email address and password for the Microsoft
 Account used when you first installed your Office 2013.&nbsp; This will reinstall a fresh version of Office 2013.</p>

<h2>            Is E7 Unstable for everyone or  have I got a dud&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had my Nokia E7 for approx 6 months. Does anyone else find that it is a particularly unstable phone? Mine frequently locks up, and its not unusual for me to restart it twice a day to get it to start responding again. Issues I have with it include
 not connecting to Bluetooth, touch screen stops responding, whole phone stops responding, unable to answer phone calls, some times when a call comes in it causes phone to shut down yet keeps ringing for 30 sec to minute after it turns itself off. I have installed
 all possible software upgrades etc and find it very disappointing that a phone of this calibre has these issues. I do actually like the phone, just wish it would run smoothly.</p>

<p>Most E7 owners I know are happy with theirs. You could have a Monday morning phone. Another possibility is a network branded handset which may have had their firmware tinkered with by the network operator, usually resulting in problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, you best bet is to contact your local Nokia Care Point since your phone is still under warranty and see what they can do for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have also faced many of these issues. The most annoying one was my display would darken whenever an oincoming call would come and the phone is located in the pocket. Hence, I had to give the phone to the NCC and finally after lot of escalations got the
 phone back with a new motherboard.</p>

            My E7 was verry buggy after the Anna update, but after I performed a Hard reset, I couldn't be happier.

<p>My E7 was originally a bit slow and jerky.</p>
<p>After Anna update, then factory restore,&nbsp;then Ovi suite software re-install, then Qt library fix (to get Ovi store working, very annoying), it is now working great, super smooth, never crashed once.</p>
<p>I use BT to sync PIM data to laptop and for headphone connection, it downloads POP email, plays games (not often),&nbsp;plays movies, and plenty of maps loaded for sat navigation. I don't have many 'apps' loaded as I don't need them.</p>
<p>Only bad things about this phone for me are poor camera (no macro), and poor battery, although&nbsp;it's OK if you don't use wi-fi to web surf or watch movies!</p>

<p>I have an E7 and it is fine, although I noticed some third-party apps were making things run slow, things like a notification pull up menu, Fring, F_Secure and some others which I downloaded from Ovi, but never really used anyway. Once I got rid of these
 and did a hard reset, things are a lot smoother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, we all wish Nokia had stuck in one of those Belle phone 1GHz processors rather than the not-so-quick 680MHz ones, because we would all be benefiting from that extra power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh well. Typical of them to put 2009 hardware in 2010 phones. &nbsp;:smileyindifferent:</p>

<h2>            How can I reinstall the Feedback app without a full refresh&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was getting an error message when attempting to load the Feedback app, something along the lines of:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>To access the Feedback app, make sure that you’re connected to the Internet and signed in with a Microsoft account that’s registered in the Windows Insider Programme.</em><br />
</p>
<p>I have just installed 10074 and this was working fine before. I tried disconnecting my account and signing back in but no luck. So, then I decided to try reinstalling it but am unable to find anywhere to download the app from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

 and re-register. Did this and instead of clicking ‘sign in’, I clicked on ‘Get Started’. I was automatically signed in (memorized password) and my feedback app started working. I also found that if I open the Insider hub an open Feedback from there it would
 also work. Apparently a problem because this is not a permanent fix as it happens frequently. Good luck. Fun huh.</span>

            Unfortunately there's nothing you can do besides a reset.&nbsp; You can also wait for the next flight.&nbsp; We've made changes recently to disallow uninstallation of the Feedback app so people don't get into this situation.

    <title>Office Lens PDF Upload Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wkchen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Lens PDF Upload Error</h2>
                    <p>I've been attempting to scan multiple documents into PDF from Office Lens from an iPhone 6 Plus on iOS 9. &nbsp;The process was working initially, but midway thru my pile of documents I began to notice that some of the files were not uploading to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, I get a "Couldn't upload (tap to retry)" error message. &nbsp;And of course tapping the file just results in "Transferring..." and then another "Couldn't upload (tap to retry)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is even stranger is that half an hour into a search online for help or solutions, tapping on a few of the error messages worked and the files actually uploaded. &nbsp;But just when I started to get excited that whatever wires were uncrossed, tapping to retry
 stopped working after a few of the files were uploaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried talking to one of the online Microsoft Support Answer Desk reps who told me to uninstall the app (which would have lost an hour's worth of work/scanning in those pending uploads). &nbsp;The rep then asked one or two other questions and when nothing
 worked, she just exited the chat without a 'bye' or 'sorry couldn't help you' and seemed to basically imply I'm out of luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen previous postings in August 2015 with similar problems in uploading PDF's that Microsoft seemed to be aware of and were able to fix. &nbsp;Has the problem resurfaced with the new iOS9 update? &nbsp;Or is there something else I need to do to retrieve this
 work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p><span>From the description it looks like there the upload speed of your internet could be quite slow.</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007&#58; Custome Forms error message.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Outlook 2007 on a Win10 o/s laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until recently I had been using a Custom Form (located in the Personal Forms section) to create a Calendar item, with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago, I went to open a Calendar entry created using this Form, only to get an error message "The custom form cannot be opened. Outlook will use an Outlook form instead. The form required to view this message cannot be displayed. Contact your administrator."
 After clicking the 'OK' button the item then opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to create new a Calendar entry using this Custom Form I also now get the error message "The form you selected cannot be displayed. The form required to view this message cannot be displayed. Contact your administrator."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the various suggestions on this Forum to clear the Cache, rename/delete the appropriate files, and also run the 'Repair Office 2007' routine followed by a reboot, but the problem still remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to create a totally new Form and Publish in the Personal Forms Library (and also the Personal Folders/Calendar), but although it Saves and appears in the list, I get the same message as above when attempting to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only possible change to the laptop between the Custom Form working and now failing may have been one of the periodic o/s updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone any thoughts on sorting out this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in anticipation...</p>

            <p>Hi, Hal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately no luck with these suggestions; had managed to track down this Web Page earlier whilst trying to sort out the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's almost as though Outlook cannot 'read in' the Form templates (whether existing or newly-created), which appear to be Saved with a ".fdm" extension, these being listed as a Microsoft Exchange Form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shall have a look on my old desktop PC (still running on XP) on which I have Outlook 2007 running, and see whether .fdm files have an associated program, not that that is likely to get me anywhere though.</p>

    <title>Headphone query - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saul issus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headphone query</h2>
                    I have just received a decent pair of Philips 'over the ear' headphones though I can't remember the model, they cost about £35 four or five years ago plugged into a wave radio they sound great at a fairly high volume. This made me think if they were capable
 of somehow damaging the amplifier of my phone a lumia 550, they are fitted with the relevant 3.5mm jack and do not have a volume control. not so many years ago I would have described the problem as the amp not being powerful enough to drive the speakers, but
 now in the &nbsp;digital age that sounds weird. &nbsp;Can anyone enlighten me about this. &nbsp;Leaving a presumptive thankyou.

<p>Thanks for your help and sorry for taking long to reply. I wanted to try several times before giving feedback. Also, it is due to my tight schedule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have forgotten my one-time yahoo password and there is no option to retrieve it or create a new one. Yet, once I click on "Add Account" in Outlook, I get the following windows which are quite different from the ones you presented.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selecting the manual option does not take me to the Yahoo! POP 3 &nbsp;Settings page.</p>
<p>I have taken all the screen shots and thought I could paste them here but pasting images here is not possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have pasted them in a Microsoft Word file and would have liked to attach it but no option for attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more help Please?</p>
<p>

<p>Apparently Microsoft has changed their method since this article has come out.&nbsp; They have made it easier supposedly.&nbsp; I'll try and get their new page link.&nbsp; I went back and tried it again.&nbsp; The settings are the same, port numbers and the like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll have to go through Yahoo home security and change you're password.&nbsp; You then need to set up two way authentication on your account and get the , I'll call it, link password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that Outlook account has a pop up that just asks for your email, mine was done automatically probably due to my previous builds setting.&nbsp; Again I'll post more at a latter time.&nbsp; My point was that you'll need your account, account name, profile
 name, password and created link password.&nbsp; At least I did.&nbsp; Let me get back with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>Try to copy by high lighting areas in word document</p>
<p>Then pasting it here.&nbsp; #1.) get new password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try in settings or Yahoo help from you're account.</p>

<p>Ways to get Yahoo account Password:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.). Go to Security - account settings from your Yahoo account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.). This is a real easy way; go to Web browser address box and enter Yahoo account log or sign in. Not using favorites or bookmarks. Enter what you know and select do not know password.&nbsp; It may ask for phone number or back up account address and eventually
 they will send you a link or a code to change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.). What browser are you using?&nbsp; You can get passwords in Google settings if you run different Browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.). Go to settings in Edge, ... right hand corner, and check passwords.&nbsp; They will probably be locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.). This is not widely known!&nbsp; But you can go to control panel, write it in Cortana's box, and choose in the upper right corner, medium icons, poof full controls.&nbsp; Don't mess with things above you're pay grade, ha, ha.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to one of the two right hand columns and there will be a book like icon I think named contacts.</p>
<p>You will have access to Edges saved passwords. You will need to know your password.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have Microsoft Office 2010 installed in my computer, and sometimes I connect to internet by mean a celular phone, with a limited traffic download (about 1GB per month). The service
<em>ClickToRunSvc&nbsp;</em>is absolutelly needed to run any office component, but at the same time, that service connects to microsoft site in order to attempt to upgrade itself (about several hundreds of Mb). Is there any way to disable such behaviour? IMHO it
 is not acceptable to do such huge download without a user confirmation.</p>

<p><br />
Why don't you set the 4th argument, range_lookup,&nbsp;to FALSE or 0?</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP(I2,Rates!$A$2:$C$18,3,0)</p>
<p>Using this syntax, if the lookup_value I2 is not found in Rates!A2:A18 then the formula will return the #N/A error.</p>
<p>If you would rather not get the #N/A error and would like some other message instead, then try something like this:</p>
<p>=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(I2,Rates!$A$2:$C$18,3,0),"Not Found")</p>
<p>Replace Not Found with a message of your choice.</p>

    <title>OneNote 2016 - can&#39;t scroll list of notes with mouse wheel in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> canyoubelieveihavetocomeupwithauniquenamein2016  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2016 - can&#39;t scroll list of notes with mouse wheel in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>In almost every Windows app and on the internet, for years, I've been taught that if you place a cursor within a list and a scrollbar appears, mouse wheel will scroll it. In OneNote 2016, the right side of the app has the list of notes which the current
 section of the notebook contains. When it's filled with notes enough that the scrollbar appears, scrolling the mouse wheel there does something unexpected: it scrolls the note page itself. That goes against what I've been taught by Windows UX throughout the
 years, and it certainly isn't convenient when organizing and browsing notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After testing fresh installations of Windows 10 and 7 in a virtual machine, it turned out that only 7 has this issue. Because my host computer is using Windows 7 (the same as used for the test in virtual machine), the fault seems to be not within my mouse
 or whatever pointer device drivers it could be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an animated gif to illustrate what's happening in Windows 7 vs Windows 10:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I use OneNote extensively for my projects, and I would like this aspect of it to work like almost every other desktop app in the world. Please, OneNote team, I know this is super easy to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now I have created an AutoIt script to do essentially that, but that's a dirty workaround. The app is supposed to behave like that from by default.</p>

            <p>I am sorry, but this seems not to be by design. With my OneNote it's working like expected (and as far as I remember it has always been). I just point to the page list and move the scroll wheel of the mouse. I assure you, i have done nothing else when recording
 this (no click, did not touch the keyboard, no AutoIT script...):&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I have no idea why this isn't working for you, maybe got something to do with the mouse driver? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Huh. I don't have any special drivers installed, just what Windows finds automatically when I plug in the mouse. I don't think that's the issue anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What version of Windows and OneNote do you have? (you can see OneNote version in File &gt; Account in the Product Information section)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Windows 7 64 bit and my OneNote 2016 64 bit desktop app is 1702 build 7870.2038</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your OneNote header looks pretty different from mine (aside from language). Yours has collapsed options and you also seem to have some addons installed like OneCalendar and perhaps OneTastic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to see if it's OneTastic fixing this issue, I just installed it and it doesn't seem to be the case. My window started to look like more yours but without the extra macros you've got installed.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for pointing me to where to find the information about the OneNote version. I will consider to include that in my 4th book about OneNote :) &nbsp;Oh wait; it's already in the "OneNote Secrets" which I also published in English :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on Windows 10 1703 Creators (but it did work before also, I never paid attention to it, that is because it always was behaving like you and I do expect; i use the mouse wheel a lot)</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneNote is almost the same (I seem to be one digit behind, which could be because I am using the German version and am not on fast ring): 1702 Build 7820.2031.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I have no idea how to address your problem, I can only confirm that this is not a OneNote design flaw in general.</p>

            <p>Can you confirm that your OneNote is behaving like I'm describing, and not like SWischner shows in his gif? Your phrasing is a bit ambiguous.</p>
<p>
I'd like to get to the bottom of this. I don't expect it to be the case, but it may be my specific combination of software and hardware is at fault. Could be anything.<br /></p>

            After having tested the same OneNote 2016 installations on the fresh Windows 7 and 10, it seems like the fault is within OneNote. So maybe you could say that in 10 the OS determines that if the cursor is over an inactive window, the control under it should
 be scrolled. Alright, but how do you explain the note list in 7 having focus, and scrolling over it scrolls the note page instead? I'd say OneNote in 7 doesn't interpret correctly which control the cursor is over.

    <title>Browser Notifications for O365 Webmail&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Browser Notifications for O365 Webmail&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was wondering if there was plans to support browser notifications. It's an upcoming thing in Microsoft Edge in Windows 10 preview so I would think there's a need for this to be available, considering Chrome does it natively. I'm not talking about Office
 2016 or Outlook, but OWA:&nbsp;https://outlook.office.com/owa/. If you get a new e-mail, you may not necessarily know about it if not paying attention, especially if you're in a situation where you can't use an app to access the e-mail (3rd party computer where
 you don't want to put your work e-mail on).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this does exist, please let me know.</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We only have this notification feature in OWA, based on Alan’s previous post, you can check if this is already set in OWA by clicking the gear icon (OWA settings).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding on the browser notification, i saw on the links you have provided, this notification feature is still in development.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<h2>            Unreliable IncludeText result during mail merge</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hello all,</strong></p>
<p>I am using Microsoft Word 2007 to do a complex mail merge where by a paragraph of text from a different file is inserted into the document depending on a code that is merged into the document from an excel file.</p>
<p>So for example if the first record had a code of C, then paragraph C would included in the document. I am using the include text function, bookmarks and nested if statements to achieve this.</p>
<p>I have found the results to be most frustrating. Often it will work, but after scrolling through a few records and back, the paragraph will be gone! Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had any similar reliability issues with this function?</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time.</p>
<p>Kind regards, Mike</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>Without seeing your field coding, it's difficult so say where any error might lie. However, you shouldn't need any nested IF statements. Assuming all the variable text is in the same document, all you should need is:<br />
{INCLUDETEXT "Drive\\Filepath\\Filename.Extension" {MERGEFIELD BkMkNm}}<br />
where 'BkMkNm' is the name of the field pointing to the relevant bookmarks. This should leave the INCLUDETEXT fields active in the document. However, IIRC, you can unlink them quite simply, by embedding the INCLUDETEXT in a QUOTE field, thus:<br />
{QUOTE{INCLUDETEXT "Drive\\Filepath\\Filename.Extension" {MERGEFIELD BkMkNm}}}</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The field brace pairs (ie '{ }') for the above example are created via Ctrl-F9 - you can't simply type them or copy &amp; paste them from this message.</p>
<p>FWIW, there's a macro you can use to extract you field coding for posting into forums here:<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/export_field.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/export_field.htm</a></p>
