<h2>            Windows 10 restart button not working properly and causing issues with video driver after recnt update</h2>
                    <p>original title: Windows 10 and the restart button</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got Security Update for Internet Explorer Flash Player for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3132372) and installed it. I was thinking that I would lose the start button and notifications area but I didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had another problem. When the computer restarted, I had a flashing screen at times. This made it difficult to type in my password at the lock screen and then it was very difficult to install the video drivers which fixed the problem. I have gotten it down
 that the problem is the video drivers. I think I can say again that it is the restart button but this time, when I tried a custom install for my video driver, it actually restarted like it has done previously. I know there was a problem with my video driver
 because one of my games that I play said it was. This game is Battlefield 2 and if I don't have the correct video driver on it tells me to install the correct video driver from the installation disk but I know that NVIDIA driver is incompatible with my video
 card so I just installed the one I saved on my computer (easier than trying to download it every time from http://www.nvidia.com/content/DriverDownload-March2009/confirmation.php?url=/Windows/361.43/361.43-desktop-win10-64bit-international-whql.exe&amp;lang=us&amp;type=GeForce
 - and this is the new one that showed up just prior to me typing this in and I will install it). I did notice that windows update is saying that they has&nbsp; NVIDIA Corporation - Graphics Adapter WDDM2.0 - NVIDIA High Definition Audio but according to the site,
 you just use the graphics update and it will automatically update this so I never update this from windows update. I have checked with Battlefield 2 and I now have the updated driver so it seems that something with the restart is messing with this driver and
 it shouldn't but I have no idea what it could be since the previously entered IE Flash Player update fixed the restart problem with the start button and the notifications area.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t find Client Services for Netware</h2>
                    
<p>I used to be able to use the welcome screen but now I can't.&nbsp; I followed the steps at&nbsp; http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=315347</p>
<p>here are the steps that were posted:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are using Classic view in Control Panel, double-click <strong>Network Connections</strong> . If you are using Category view, click<strong>Network and Internet Connections</strong> , and then click
<strong>Network Connections</strong> .</li><li>Right-click each connection that you have, and then click <strong>Properties</strong> each time.</li><li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab of each Local Area connection, highlight <strong>
Client Service for Netware</strong> , and then click <strong>Uninstall</strong> .</li><li>In the <strong>Dial-up Connection Properties</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>
Networking</strong> tab, highlight <strong>Client Service for Netware</strong> , and then click<strong>Uninstall</strong> .
</li><li>Restart the computer. </li></ol>
I followed these steps until 4. There was no Client Service for Netware to select.&nbsp; I went to other sites and blogs and they all lead me to this same spot.&nbsp; What can I do?&nbsp; Is there an alternate way of fixing this?

<div>&gt; here are the steps that were posted:</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; 1. If you are using Classic view in Control Panel, double-click</div>
<div>&gt; *Network Connections* . If you are using Category view,</div>
<div>&gt; click*Network and Internet Connections* , and then click *Network</div>
<div>&gt; Connections* .</div>
<div>&gt; 2. Right-click each connection that you have, and then click</div>
<div>&gt; *Properties* each time.</div>
<div>&gt; 3. On the *General* tab of each Local Area connection, highlight</div>
<div>&gt; *Client Service for Netware* , and then click *Uninstall* .</div>
<div>&gt; 4. In the *Dial-up Connection Properties* dialog box, click the</div>
<div>&gt; *Networking* tab, highlight *Client Service for Netware* , and</div>
<div>&gt; then click*Uninstall* .</div>
<div>&gt; 5. Restart the computer.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; I followed these steps until 4. There was no Client Service for Netware</div>
<div>&gt; to select. I went to other sites and blogs and they all lead me to this</div>
<div>&gt; same spot. What can I do? Is there an alternate way of fixing this?</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>"Client Service for Netware" is used in connection with Novell networks.</div>
<div>It is not normally installed on most Windows computers, so the fact that </div>
<div>you didn't find it is not at all surprising.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The steps that you posted are slightly different in numbering than those </div>
<div>in the KB article. Are you saying that you DID find (and uninstall) </div>
<div>"Client Service for Netware" in the properties for one or more Local</div>
<div>Area Connection but not in the properties of DialUp Networking?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Was this computer ever connected to a Novell network (almost always at a </div>
<div>business location)? If so, did you follow step 1 of the KB article </div>
<div>(i.e., go to the Novell site for instructions on removing the Novell </div>
<div>service)?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Did you restart the computer after step 5 (4 in your list)?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Did you complete steps 7, 8, and 9 of the KB article?</div>

            just to let you know - followed advice on another site and re-installed CSN on all three connections, re-booted then uninstalled again - it worked after the second attempt - all is now well. Do you know of any way of preventing it being reinstalled? -
 I have always stopped automatic updates!

    <title>Surface Devices Slow Shutdown &#38; Hanging Office Programs After - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Devices Slow Shutdown &#38; Hanging Office Programs After Updating to 1903.</h2>
                    <p>I've updated four different Surface devices to 1903 (Surface 3, Surface Pro 3, Surface Go &amp; Surface Laptop 1. Two issues that I've noticed with all four devices is that the shut down process often (but not always) takes longer than what I'm used to experiencing.
 I click the shutdown icon in the Start Menu &amp; confirm the action. At that point, the spinning circle icon appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens next is that the spinning circle will remain on the screen for what seems like a protracted amount of time. Eventually, an error message will faintly flash on the screen just as the computer powers off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue seems to affect the logoff process. This is determined by splitting the shutdown action into the two individual steps (log off &amp; shut down) The log off process is where the slowdown is happening. The power off is always very quick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add to the mystery, it seems that this problem, somehow, involves Microsoft Office programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Say for example, I'm using Excel or Word. I save my work, close Office and proceed to shut down. If the devices are slow to shut down, almost every time they are powered back up, the last used Office program will start up without being called for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC /SCANNOW fails to detect any problems.</p>
<p>Executing "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth" doesn't seem to make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even gone so far as to boot <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">each</span> of the four devices from their respective recovery drive multiple times as well as reload Office multiple times. All that doesn't seem to make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if I power back up after a protracted shutdown and then power right back down, the devices will shut down without any undue slowness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because this is happening across multiple devices (4 of them) as opposed to a single unit, I can't really fault any one in particular. It looks to me like a problem with 1903.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The final Surface device I have access to (Surface Book 2) remains on 1809 and it doesn't experience this particular issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else seeing this? Is this a known issue with 1903?</p>

<p>All 4 Surface devices are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand going through the above steps for a single device, but, as I stated in the OP...<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>4 SURFACE DEVICES</strong></span> are experiencing the same problem. I find it hard to believe that all four
 units would require the same corrective action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reply is written in the singular as if it is addressing a single computer problem. What I have...is a problem with 4 devices....not 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recap, the problem is affecting 4 devices. All four have been booted off of their respective recovery drives multiple times. Office has been deleted &amp; added multiple times to all devices. SFC /SCANNOW and&nbsp;<span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image
 /Restorehealth have been run with no improvement. The problem seems to be linked to Office 365...possably the programs are not fully shutting down when exited, thus the slowdown in the log-off process.</span></p>

<p>Hola no se si a muchos les pase el mismo problema que a mi pero a la hora que quiero editar mi cuenta, ta saben agregar una forma de pago, editarla, o quitarla me sale error con un mensaje todo tonto diciendo oh oh, has encontrado un error en el sistema
 esto no deberia de haber pasado, y si el mensaje esta tonto lo esta mas el avatar que sale con su cara de .... tupido, pero eso no es todo cuando te quieres poner en contacto con ellos mandandoles un tiken resulta que no esta disponible el servicio, osea si
 no les gusta a los encargados su trabajo de darle mantenimiento a la paguina pues que renuncien, tomen de ejemplo las paguinas de blizard, en el battlenet.com cuando has visto un error como esos pues nunca, a mi me encanta jugar la xbox pero el pesimo servicio
 que tienen a la hora de que uno quiere editar su cuenta es pesimo, espero me puedan ayudar por que me urge editar mi cuenta y espero que ya no vuelva a pasar nunca mas.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can copy all the files in Windows.old to restore the Windows system files,installed programs, and each user account’s settings and files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Windows will automatically delete the Windows.old folder to free up space after a month.</p>

                    <p>Alright.&nbsp;</p><p>So, before about 2-3 weeks ago, I had my Xbox account linked to my Mixer account just fine. I could stream, and everything could work perfectly. I went on holiday and came back after a week, and I could broadcast alright, but it wouldn't show up on the website. I could change the title of the stream from my Xbox just fine.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> I just need some one to fix it. So far it seems that other than 2 months ago, it's only me who has this issue.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And yes, before anyone asks, I have checked that my account is adult or whatever, and I have turned everything on. Broadcasting = on and everything.</p><p>Another interesting thing is I went on another account that I had and tried broadcasting on that, and it worked just fine.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> It must be something to do with my linked accounts. I'm not sure what though. Send help :D</strong></p><p>Thanks.<br /></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have a Surface Pro 4 that got stuck in Selective Startup after installing the Anniversary update two days ago. When you try to select Normal
 Startup in MSConfig it will not take the change. My wife's Dell Laptop started doing the same prior to installing the Anniversary Update as well. I have read in number places that this is normal, but I beg to differ.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have been going crazy trying to fix it to Normal Startup. I really do not want to do clean re-install of Win 10. My wife's laptop was originally
 a Win 7 machine and I took advantage of the free upgrade to Win 10 in July. I sometimes had issues when Windows Update would run updates would fail to install. I had fixed this issue in the past doing a clean boot which is a selective startup. I even experienced
 updates failing on my Win 7 Desktop and have to do a clean boot to get them to install also.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am using a 3rd party AV BitDefender for AV and Internet Security. So could it be that BitDefender is causing my issue with my Surface Pro
 4? &nbsp;I wasn't having this issue with BitDefender in the past. &nbsp;As for the difference between Selective Startup and Normal I experience very slow startup on my wife's laptop ever since it got stuck in Selective Startup. BitDefender takes a very long time to
 load on the task bar, but this occurred after I uninstalled it to see if that would correct this issue. &nbsp;So after reinstalling BitDefender it loads last and slowly.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I hate doing a Reset or Clean Install because that is more work on my part because I will have to re-install software and apps that did not
 originally come with the machine. Just additional pain. I am hoping there is way to fix this by doing a simple in Command Prompt or Registry Editor.</span></p>

<h2>            Gadget Clock won&#39;t display second hand.</h2>
                    <p>When I see clock in the gadget choices, it HAS a 2ndhand. However, when I move the clock to my sidebar, the second hand disappears. I right click options but there is nothing.</p>
<p>Why does the clock show a secondhand at first, but not when I choose to use it? How do I get second hand to work?</p>
<p>Since my display tray has a perfectly functioning clock except NO secondhand, why would I want a sidebar clock except for secondhand? What a waste of time.</p>

<p>By default, Windows Vista does not display in the clock gadget the seconds hand, which can be a bit distracting. If you want to see it, click<strong>Show the second hand</strong> checkbox. Vista will then display and move the seconds hand in red, and in

Hello,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I guess the best way is to Export your Outlook contacts to a CSV file then import into Outlook 2007.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>In Microsoft Outlook 2000, choose the Import and Export command from the File pull-down menu.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Highlight Export to a File and click Next.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now choose the type of file to create "Comma Delimited" then take that CSV file to new Computer and Import into Outloot 2007&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>File -&gt; Import and Export -&gt; Import from another program or file</div>
<div><br />
<div>The list of available file types will then be displayed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

For others instead of CSV select Outlook Data File (PST) export it then from new Computer just File &gt; Open &gt; Outlook Data File&nbsp;

            Don't believe all you read. <br />
Including some details is always helpful - what is, or is not, happening and system specs -<br />
<br />
The Witcher runs fine on Win7 64bit. No compatibility setting required, but you have to&nbsp; install the 1.5 patch,&nbsp; and download and install the TAGES (copy protection) update. The 1.5 patch also allows you to play the game&nbsp; without the DVD.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.tagesprotection.com/main.htm?page=minimum.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TAGES, the AAA Copy Protection System</a>
<br />
<br />
The game always runs at 32bit. There are very few game that have a 64bit mode, and they can also run in 32bit mode. The games that are 64bit capable need a machine with an AMD64 processor,&nbsp; or the most recent Intel processor (Intel has only just started producing
 64bit cpus') to use the 64bit option.<br />
<br />
If you have problems it may be your system is not up to the game (integrated graphics).<br />

                    <p>Original Title: Windows GUI locks up WIN 10 EDU</p>
<p>
</p><p>sys specs:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel i5-6500 3.2GHz</li><li>MSI Tomahawk AC z170A</li><li>8GB x2 PNY 2133MHz DDR4</li><li>Asus Nvidia GTX 950 2GB gDDR5</li><li>Sandisk SSD 120GB</li><li>1TB HD</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I got this version of WIN 10 Edu from my school. This is a new build (3-weeks old) and after installation, I noticed some issues with the GUI. When I click the "start" button, sometimes it will not pop up. It will lockup my taskbar and I can't open any applications
 on it. </p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Win-X&gt;Open Task Manager&gt;System Services&gt;Restart explorer.exe</p>
<p>This works off and on. When it doesn't work, I just get a black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue I've been having is applications lockup on me too. I either can't close them or in rare cases, min or maximize them.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi </span>Jeremy<span>,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for getting back with an update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you to try executing below troubleshooting steps. These steps will repair any missing or corrupted system files,, if they causing any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Use System File Checker to repair damaged Windows files </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the System File Checker tool to repair damaged Windows files. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows logo key + X</strong>, select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Run the "<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>" command by copy/pasting it into the Command prompt(Admin) and hit
<strong>Enter </strong>key.</li><li>Once it complete, try to install updates again to see if they work correctly</li></ol>
<p>For more information about the System File Checker tool, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Run the DISM tool </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem continues, use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to fix Windows Update corruption errors. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows logo key + X</strong>, select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Run the "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth" command by copy/pasting it into the Command prompt(Admin) and hit
<strong>Enter </strong>key</li><li>Once it complete, try to install updates again to see if they work correctly.</li></ol>
<p><span><strong>Important:</strong> </span>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair
 source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\RepairSource\Windows /LimitAccess</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note: </strong></span>Replace the C:\RepairSource\Windows placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824869.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>To learn more about this tool, see <strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Fix Windows corruption errors by using the DISM or System Update Readiness tool</span></a></strong>.</p>

    <title>A look at running older versions of Microsoft Office on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A look at running older versions of Microsoft Office on Windows 10</h2>
                    <strong>Technical Level</strong> : Basic <br />
<br />
<strong>Summary</strong><br />
<span>
<span>
<p>Bill Gates once said you could purchase a license for a version of any software from Microsoft and never have to purchase another version. It is the responsibility of the company to make newer releases more enticing by adding further value through improved
 features and functionality. Microsoft Office has been one of the company's biggest successes. For more than 20 years, the company has released new revisions with unique features that make it an enticing upgrade. At the same time, there are users who fall in
 love with a revision and never decide to upgrade again, simply because that version is good enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Microsoft announced the launch of Windows 10, a lot of persons are asking, if the license for the version of Microsoft Office they own will work on the new version of Windows. In this article, we'll find out.
</p>
</span><br />
<strong>Details</strong><br />
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Update: </span>
</span></strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Microsoft recently updated the requirements for running Microsoft Office on the Windows 10. Starting with Windows 10, version 10 1607 or later, Office 2007 is no longer certified compatible. This does not mean
 you can't run Office 2007 on Windows 10; as evidenced by the fact that versions as old as Office 95 still work on Windows 10, you should still be able to install and use it. It is possible future updates and revisions to Windows 10 might break the suite or
 functionality might no longer work. </span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">Which versions of Microsoft Office are officially&nbsp;supported Windows 10?</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The following versions of Microsoft Office with the latest Service Packs have been confirmed to be compatible with Windows 10:</p>
<ul>
<li>Office 2019 or Office 365 subscriptions<br />
</li><li><a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/office-2016-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">Office 2016</span></a></li><li>Office 2013</li><li>Office 2010 (exception Office Starter 2010)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Older versions of Office such as Office 2007, Office 2003 and Office XP are not certified compatible with Windows 10 but might work with or without&nbsp;compatibility mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>Please be aware that Office Starter 2010 is not supported. You will be prompted to remove it before the upgrade starts.</span></em></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Is Office included for free with Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>No, desktop Office 2016/Office 365&nbsp;or any prior version&nbsp;will not be free. Microsoft Office Team has developed a special touch optimized version of Microsoft Office for Tablets running Windows 10. This will be a free limited functionality version gear towards
 basic editing in Tablet mode. It lacks many of the capabilities of desktop Office. You can download it from the store.

<p>
</p><p><strong>What about older versions of the suite though, such as Office 2000, Office XP (2002) and Office 2003?</strong></p>
<p>Recently I came across an article by noted Windows extraordinaire Paul Thurrott discussing a recent Twitter tease from
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/dd2d7da4-ab0c-457a-b6c2-57561a303b66">
Gabe Aul</a> <em>(Engineering General Manager for Data and Fundamentals team in Microsoft's Operating Systems Group)</em> showing a vintage version of the suite; Office for Windows 95 running on Windows 10. I thought this was interesting to know that 20 year
 old software runs just fine on the latest version of Windows. Talk about bringing your investments forward!</p>

</p><p>With a volume of questions on the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10_1-win_upgrade?tab=threads">
Windows 10 Reservation forum </a>asking whether their Office 2000, 2003 or XP version is compatible; I decided to do so some test for users who would like to know. So, I went in the garage and looked for those exact copies to try them out on Windows 10. Based
 on Gabe Aul's screenshot, we can pretty much confirm Office 95 and Office 97 will likely run. If I have the time, I will update this article and give those versions a try at a later date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Setup</strong></p>
<p>All three versions started setup nicely with exception for Office 2000 setup which presented an error message during the install:</p>
<p>Error 1904. Module C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files(System\OLE DB\MSOLAP.DLL failed to register. HRESULT -2148024714 Contact yoru support support personnel.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Running Office setup for 2000, XP and 2003 on Windows 10</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I promptly clicked <em>Ignore </em>a couple times and setup completed successfully. Later versions such as Office XP and Office 2003 never gave any problems. Please note, I did not make any modifications to setup such as compatibility mode, they all ran
 and installed without any problem.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>All three versions installed successfully</em></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Testing Office programs</strong></p>
<p>All apps with the exception of Outlook ran great on Windows 10. I was able to open, create and save documents in all versions of apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access and Publisher.

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Outlook was the only problematic app in the suite.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2000 required using compatibility mode to run properly, it kept crashing each time I launched it. So thats something to keep in mind. Oulook 2002 never gave any problems at all and ran successfully without any modifications. Outlook 2003 was another
 story, I tried compatibility mode and it seem to make it worse. So, if you depend on Outlook, you should consider upgrading to a later version such as Outlook 2007 or 2013.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Conclusion</p>
</strong>
<p>This was not a thorough test, apps like FrontPage or OneNote were not evaluated. Core apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access and Publisher work just fine on Windows 10. By the way, I used Windows 10 64 bit, so users won't have to worry about compatibility
 issues with this architecture. It remains to be seen if future updates to Windows might break the suite. I will say, I used the RTM versions of each suite. So, I would recommend users of these versions make sure the latest Service Packs, updates and security
 updates are applied. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind, Microsoft no longer supports these older versions of the suite, so you weigh the risk of running such versions. Apart from the Office Assistant displaying a rose pink box; there should be no problems running older versions of Office on Windows
 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy computing!</p>

            The most enduring feature of Ms Office 2000 is the short cut bar. To me it was and is simply the fastest way to find and load my most commonly used applications whether within the office umbrella or not - much better than any other method lnvolving File
 Explorer, a start menu or &nbsp;even a desktop icon. It worked fine on Windows 8.1 but something has happened with it's ability to show icons and open the corresponding &nbsp;link files in Windows 10. I think is is something related to file and folder ownership? I am
 working on rectifying it and I can just about get by with a right click and &nbsp;click on "open". However, the speed and ease of use advantage is lost - a real shame! &nbsp;

            My Office 2003 works after the Windows 10 download, but each of my documents come in as read-only.&nbsp; When I go to properties, there is no check in the read-only box and the box is gray.&nbsp; I had backed up all of my documents onto an external hard drive.&nbsp;
 These backups can be pulled up by my Office 2003 and I can edit them and save them back to the external hard-drive.&nbsp; If I try to save the edited copy to my c drive document folder, I get a message that I cannot save it because it is a read-only file.&nbsp; I even
 tried changing the name, so that I would be saving it as a new document.&nbsp; It still gives me the same message.&nbsp; This is incredibly inconventient.&nbsp; Can something be done about it?

</p><blockquote>The most enduring feature of Ms Office 2000 is the short cut bar. To me it was and is simply the fastest way to find and load my most commonly used applications whether within the office umbrella or not - much better than any
 other method lnvolving File Explorer, a start menu or &nbsp;even a desktop icon. It worked fine on Windows 8.1 but something has happened with it's ability to show icons and open the corresponding &nbsp;link files in Windows 10. I think is is something related to file
 and folder ownership? I am working on rectifying it and I can just about get by with a right click and &nbsp;click on "open". However, the speed and ease of use advantage is lost - a real shame! &nbsp;

I also have this problem. Did you find a solution?

            I loaded the Windows 10 and now I have lost use of my MSOffice97 suite.(word, excel, access, power point, etc.). &nbsp;I am bummed as I can no longer open any of my saved data. &nbsp;I wish I had known that would happen before agreeing to down load Windows 10.

            No not yet to the MS short cut bar issue directly. However, I can get&nbsp;FreeBar_0.9.2.7 to run on Win 10 that &nbsp;does the same task in almost the same way. (So far Freebar is only working in a horizontal way rather than as the MS shortcut bar worked before
 win 10 as a vertical display and hide column on the right edge. Maybe I can tweak FreeBar a bit further yet?

<h2>            My outlook account has disappeared&#63;</h2>
                    I've had trouble with getting photos from my smartphone to my laptop, so today I decided to upload one directly from my cell to a 'OnedRIVE' account as that option came up on my phone (it is a Samsung Rugby LTE).&nbsp; In&nbsp; order to retrieve the photo, I had
 to activate the One drive on my laptop.&nbsp; In the process, it somehow created a new Outlook account as well.&nbsp; Now when I try to sign on to my ages old (I've had it for 8 years) Outlook account, I cannot find the account anywhere and my laptop keeps using the
 new Outlook account which has nothing in it.&nbsp; I use the old outlook for online shopping and flyers and signing up for newsletters, etc to keep my personal gmail account fairly clean.&nbsp; How can I get into my old Outlook account?&nbsp; I normal get in by typing 'Hotmail.com'
 into my search address bar. &nbsp; I am on Windows 10 on the laptop.&nbsp; Is there another way to get into my old account?&nbsp; (I do remember at one point Microsoft upgrading stuff so I could no longer type.ca live (or whatever it was - into the search bar.... then someone
 tipped me off to the Hotmail way to get in.<br />

            Hi Howard.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See repairs for Action Center here:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/can-i-reset-or-re-install-the-action-center-in/955d4d0b-dfe2-4034-8579-dd608dd541e4">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
