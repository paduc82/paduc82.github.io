<h2>            Editing table and cell borders in Sharepoint Designer 2010</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a hard time with editing table and cell borders in Sharepoint Designer 2010.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please send me instructions regarding how to do this effectively. I need the workflow to add table and cell borders to the default view of a SharePoint list</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying different steps but when Save I don't see my changes in the view (after refreshing). I do see the changes in cell shading and align. But changing cell border style, color, etc is proving to be very difficult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hello harsh.kr:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding error code 80070490.&nbsp; This error indicates there is an issue with syncing your Microsoft account.&nbsp; There are several reasons this may occur, a bad password, bad calendar entries, corrupted or oversized emails,
 account locks, etc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing I would do is to verify that the password being entered is correct.&nbsp; We suggest you start this process by changing the current password associated with the Microsoft account that is not syncing.&nbsp; You can do this by going to
<a href="http://accounts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://accounts.live.com</a> and signing into your account.&nbsp; When you go to the security info. section you will have the option to change the password.&nbsp; Be sure that the password you create is no longer then 13 characters.&nbsp;
 Once you have set up a new password, go to the phone and tap settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; tap the account that is giving you trouble &gt; tap the password field, enter the new password.&nbsp; Remember that passwords are case sensitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you continue to have trouble with this account syncing, check the Xbox account associated with the account on your phone.&nbsp; Go to
<a href="http://xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com</a> and sign into the primary email on your phone.&nbsp; Once you are signed in, click on MY ACCOUNT &gt; billing and contact information.&nbsp; Make sure that the details are complete and up to date.&nbsp; If you are prompted to accept
 the terms of use at any point, do so.&nbsp; After you have updated this, go back to the phone and tap settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; tap and hold the primary account &gt; select sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the error continues to appear on the phone, the next thing to check is your calendar and your inbox.&nbsp; Go to your PC and sign into
<a href="http://calendars.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://calendars.live.com</a>.&nbsp; Once you are signed in, create a new calendar and make this your primary calendar.&nbsp; Once you have done this, go back to the phone and sync your account.&nbsp; If you receive the same error code,
 go back to the PC and sign into your email.&nbsp; Go to your inbox and look for the largest emails over the past month.&nbsp; Move these to other folders or delete them altogether.&nbsp; Once this has been, go back to the phone and sync your account again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have issues doing any of the above, detail for us exactly what you experienced when you tried.&nbsp; Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

<h2>            powerpoint missing first character in a bullet point</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our whole&nbsp;team has the same problem. we are using powerpoint 2016 and when we write a new bullet point, powerpoint ignores the first&nbsp;character&nbsp;of the first word.&nbsp; It does the same&nbsp;thing on every bullet point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so if I type <strong>Mic</strong><strong>rosoft,</strong> it will ignore the&nbsp;M (even though it appears on the slide) and highligh
<strong>icrosoft&nbsp;</strong>as a spelling&nbsp;error</p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas what's wrong or is it just a bug in the&nbsp;software?</p>

    <title>Syncing deleted items with Yahoo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jspector  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syncing deleted items with Yahoo</h2>
                    I port in messages from Yahoo POP3 over to outlook.com. Aside from having syncing issues, I am wondering--if I delete messages on Outlook.com, will that sync with Yahoo? When I linked the accounts, I checked a box marked "Leave a copy on the server" which
 I want to do, but I do want it to purge deleted items out. Is there any way to do this? Thanks!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Can you provide additional details on what issues do you experience in yahoo account? Are you receiving any error message? If so, what is the exact error message? Have you tried reconfiguring the account? Please make sure you are using the correct
 settings to ensure smooth flow of account configuration. You may refer to the article below for the step by step instructions.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>"if I delete messages on Outlook.com, will that sync with Yahoo?"-- No. The message on the Yahoo account will not be deleted.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>"I checked a box marked "Leave a copy on the server" which I want to do, but I do want it to purge deleted items out. Is there any way to do this?"-- The fact that you opted to leave a copy of the message on the server nullifies the issue&nbsp;of the message
 to get purged after the message is deleted. If you wish for the message to get purged, you need to uncheck the leave a copy of the message on the server.</span></p>

<h3> rgphilpott  say:</h3>
<h2>            v20 still not appearing in NSU for N97 0585162</h2>
                    
<p>I have a black sim-free UK N97 (code 0585162) current firmware version v12.0.026 (upgraded from v11, and before that v10, using FOTA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Nokia UK website and various messgaes posted in this forum the v20 firmware has been available for this product code for some time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, NSU is still telling me that I have the latest firmware. xbungle mentioned in an earlier post that IP addresses might be an issue (though I have no idea why) -- but I have also tried with three different connections with completely dfferent IP addresses
 with the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is no prospect of this working by the NSU route, does anyone have any idea when this update might be available via FOTA, since its looking as if that might be the only way I'm going to be able to get this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks, but that would mean taking time off work and/or being without the phone for several days (or possibly weeks if they decide they need to send it off to Nokia for repair or exchange).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like some confirmation that this really is due to a fault with the phone rather than a bug in NSU before I go to those lengths -- especially since xbungle's comment about it being IP-address related suggests the latter.</p>

<p>Phew!</p>

<p>This finally appeared in NSU yesterday evening. Nothing changed at my end, so Nokia have altered something at the server end (something to do with them previously blacklisting some ISPs for some strange reason?).</p>

    <title>Zune Play Count Not Working At All&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pvtcaboose  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zune Play Count Not Working At All&#33;</h2>
                    I know that it is not a big deal to some but it is just really started annoying me after a year of not working. I would like to compare songs and artist with my friends and see which songs I listen to the most (Recent, Top Artist, Badges, etc). That is
 one of the main reasons I got a Zune but can't because of this problem.<br />
<br />
I have had my Zune for about a year now and the play count has <strong>never</strong> worked properly. I have done extensive research on this problem and I've tried fixing it by uninstalling and reinstalling the software (even reformatted my computer), leaving
 my Zune plugged in over night, changing the wireless settings (on both the Zune and the Software) and multiple others, but the play count just doesn't update. One of my friends, who has owned a Zune for many years (uses it religiously) has come over and tried
 to find the problem but couldn't.<br />
<br />
There was a time in the past where I stopped using my Zune for about three to four months because of this problem until one of my friends contacted me and said that my Zune profile showed I had about 450 plays. I knew that I had well over a couple thousand
 plays the last time I plugged it in (which was about 3 months before this) but I was just exited that it might have started working that I didn't care. So I started using my Zune once again and after a few weeks I plugged my Zune in to update my play count
 and song lists but to my surprise it didn't work. I gave it a couple weeks and tweaked with it but still nothing. Till this day I do not know how those plays came to be on my Zune profile, since it obviously doesn't work for me.<br />
<br />
Also, when I first got my Zune even when I played the songs in the Zune software it counted them but when I logged out or closed the software and reopened it my counts disappeared. Suddenly one day the plays started counting but<strong> only</strong> when I
 played them in the Zune software.<br />
<br />
I would be glad to answer any questions, if there is any. <br />
Thanks.

<p>In the ZUNE SOFTWARE, go to SETTINGS, ACCOUNT, PERSONAL INFO, PRIVACY SETTINGS, and make sure the check mark is selected in the box under PERSONALIZE YOUR ZUNE EXPERIENCE.

Mine didn't work for 6 months because of this...works great now!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a known issue with an uninstalled app remaining on the new Start Menu after it has been uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way you can verifiy that the app has been uninstalled is in the Store app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open the Store and select Account / My Apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Scroll through that window and locate the app you uninstalled. It should show as being 'Not Installed'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are a Insider, you can add your Vote for this issue using the Feedback App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the <strong>Feedback app</strong> and navigate to <strong>Start</strong>/<strong>All Apps</strong>. In the
<strong>Search </strong>box, type <strong>Uninstall </strong>and you will see the feedback for this issue.</p>

</p><p>That did not answer the question. The question is how to upgrade the existing internet explorer that has already been downloaded. You just told him how to download it if he hadn't already done so. If you do know how to UPGRADE the internet explorer that
 would be great to know. <br />

<h2>            Bash - what kinds of things can you do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've installed Bash and it's running well. apt-get seems to work and I can install a lot of CLI tools. I was wondering what kinds of unique commands there might be to interact with the rest of Windows?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there an equivalent to the "open XXX" where XXX is the name of a folder or application (like in OS X)?
</p>
<p>2. Can you create standard user accounts, not just the root account, and if so, do they match with my Windows 10 account?
</p>
<p>3. Can you install a different Window Manager? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, Pete</p>

How do I increase the size (width) of the viewing area.<br />

I have a folders area on the left which is OK.<br />
<br />
On the right I have maybe 20% blank space which I would like to use to expand my view of the email.<br />

Any help would be greatly appreciated<br />

    <title>is there a way to turn off outlook indexing and just perform a full - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dweaver12345678901234567890  say:</h3>
<h2>            is there a way to turn off outlook indexing and just perform a full search every time&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've tried searching for specific&nbsp;emails from past years where the only criterea I knew was a student ID that would have been in the message body and have had no results.
</p>
<p>Using&nbsp;&nbsp;the advance find, </p>
<p>1) I&nbsp;type the ID in the Search for the word(s) field, </p>
<p>2) change the In to subject field and Message body</p>
<p>3) In the Look For Message In field, I click on Browse and select the top level mailbox
</p>
<p>4) and also check Search subfolders (I've tried actually checking each mailbox item as well)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Click Find Now. </p>
<p>Outlook returns zero results in less than a second. Guess what, there really are messages that contain that ID.&nbsp; The first time I ran into this problem, I did what many suggest, I reindexed. What a pain. That runs for hours.&nbsp; Once that finished I was able
 to find a single message that contains that ID. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I'm required to find information for another ID. I spent a good hour or so trying to search for the ID. Then the name. Then part of the name. All with no results. One would assume that therefore there aren't really any results. As a last resort, I did
 some research on the person and came up with an email address. I search Outlook for messages sent to this email address and found three. Upon review of these three messages, they all contained the ID and the persons name I searched on previously. I'm currently
 in the process of re-indexing again which has ran form 5 hours already. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rarely have to search for items but when I do, I need accurate&nbsp;results. The indexing feature obviously doesn't work very well. I would prefer to turn off indexing and just do a full search when I need. I'd rather have it search for 4 hours with results
 than search for 2 seconds with no results but have to re-index for 4 or more hours every time I need to do a search.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I turn off the indexing feature and just run a full search when needed?&nbsp; BTW, I've been informed there should be more results for the messages sent to this person than three. This leads me to believe that the current search process using indexing&nbsp;is
 inaccurate and unreliable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Stop&nbsp;Windows Search from services and try running search in Outlook. <br />
Start&gt;Run&gt;services.msc&gt;windows search. If you see expected result in Outlook after stopping the service, issue could be due to window search. May be you can uninstall and re-install the search feature from Windows and check.<br />
<br />
If you still face similar problem , try new profile, with few test entries, run a search and check the result.
<br />
<br />
If even that fails, check in new windows user account.<br />
<br />
P.S. what that email account type?</p>

            Ok.&nbsp; Now that does helps considerable. Thank you. I'm getting mixed results when searching from my main profile but I think I've figured out one way that works consistently. I get 8 results when searching for ID in the message body using my main profile
 and 13 results when searching messages sent to the particular email address again using my main profile. All messages include the ID in the message body. When I switch to the secondary profile, I get 13 results but they do not exactly match the 13 results
 from the previous search.&nbsp; The reason appears to be that the search using the main profile includes duplicates that reside in the All Mail folder and are also missing other messages.&nbsp; Using the main profile to search is therefore unreliable.
<br />
<br />
Here's I have it setup. <br />
I have two profiles setup in outlook. A main profile setup for my work email and to monitor the other account. The other profile is setup for the email account I monitor, respond to and sometime lookup messages to verify responses.&nbsp; It's setup this way so I
 can switch profiles if I need to send email from the account I monitor. Both accounts are gmail accounts setup as Imap. When I start outlook, I prompted with a profile selection window.
<br />
<br />
It appears I now get full unique results when I search for ID in the message body using the secondary profile that only has this account listed. It appears my problem is solved or at least I now have a work around that I feel comfortable with getting accurate
 results. I'll using my secondary profile when I need to find emails that are contained in that account and I'll search on ID and cross-check the results by searching on messages sent to the particular email address.&nbsp; These should match and do with my current
 search,<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

<h2>            Exchange Online From Hybrid to cutover</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">Hi,</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">we currently run an Exchange 2013 in hybrid mode with Office 365 E3 Plans. Since the whole setup adds more complexity to our environment then probably necessary (hybrid exchange, ADFS, ad connect, etc.) we
 would like to reduce to Office 365 only with directory sync. </p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">We have about 30 Mailboxes. If we were not in hybrid mode already i would go for a cutover migration, but since we already run all our mailboxes in office 365 i guess that's not an option. I read that Microsoft
 recommends to keep at least one Exchange on premise for Management. Is there a way to move from our current situation to something comparable to the result of a cutover migration?</p>

            <p>Hi Timo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you use a cutover migration you cannot use AADConnect.</p>
<p>You can't get rid of your on-premises Exchange server unless you have no dependencies on your local Active Directory or domain controllers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Brook said, you cannot change any Exchange related attributes without Exchange on-premises. And it is not supported to "remove" Exchange hybrid. That is not Exchange but DirSync / AADConnect related. Microsoft is working on a solution to remove all on-premises
 Exchange server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So: you can use a cutover migration if you have don't use directory synchronization and manage your users twice (on-prem and Office 365 with maybe different logon names and passwords).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or: go hybrid, migrate your users, change DNS records to Office 365 / Exchange Online and use your on-premises Exchange only for user management.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Trying to create &#34;Undisclosed Recipients&#34; email but contacts not functioning. Instead shows my normal details.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm trying to send an email to multiple BCC recipients with the TO line reading "undisclosed recipients". I have dutifully created the contact "Undisclosed Recipients" in my contacts (with my own email address), and have tried to sent some test emails to
 the "Undisclosed Recipients" contact with some of my other email addresses bcc'd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where my problem is. The TO line does not display "Undisclosed Recipients" (even though that is the contact I've put in), but instead displays my normal contact. Try as I might, I can't seem to get the TO line to read "Undisclosed Recipients" in
 my receiver's inboxes. I'm using Outlook 2007, and I've tested the received emaisl on hotmail/outlook.com, gmail and outlook 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshot of the contact:</p>

The problem never existed, surfaced,&nbsp; exposed itself, or came to light until MS Windows 10 started a update on my computer from an offsite MS location, and only then did the error poke its head out and say hello.&nbsp;

                    I mean, I appreciate the minimalist concept of the new interface. But, come on! The caption buttons are ridiculously bigger than the previous versions of windows.

            the minimize/maximize, restore and close button is what i mean about caption buttons. I can resize it on previous versions of windows but not on windows 10

<h2>            Can&#39;t send an email to a &#39;list&#39; from my contacts.</h2>
                    It's September 2017 and I am still having trouble sending an email to a 'list' from my contacts. In 'People' I can type in the search bar for my list name and it comes up correctly and allows me to edit. But when I try to send an email to this contact
 list, the 'to' or 'bcc' space does not pull up my list when I type in the name. It shows me an option to 'search people' but then tells me 'no match was found'. I even created a new list with a new name to see if it was a matter of old Outlook vs new Outlook
 but it has not helped. My contact list only has 27 email addresses in it. Please help.&nbsp;

            I use Chrome as my regular browser but I have tried to do the same thing on Edge. When I create an email, click on either 'to' or 'Bcc' and I type in the name of my list, it shows the list title but when I click to add it, all it adds is the empty title,
 no email addresses that are on the list. No recent changes to my computer however I remember a while ago Microsoft Outlook changed to some new format. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

<p>For some reason mine is now working!&nbsp; Firstly I deleted loads of emails from folders (to create some space), then I followed your advice, and rather than type in the name of the group next to the 'To' or 'BCC', I actually clicked on these buttons, scrolled
 down and then clicked on the name of the group to add it in to the address line.&nbsp; By doing this my emails now send! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Wishing you lots of luck Carole!&nbsp; Liza</p>

            Still unable to send a group email from my contacts 'list' category. In addition to this, sometimes when starting an email to a single recipient, when I type the name in the address bar it does not pull up the email address. When I check in my 'people'
 and type the name in, it does pull up the whole contact info including the email but not when entering it in the new email address bar.&nbsp;

<p>Hello Charianne Per,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I followed up with Remon Ont's suggestions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not get any error messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It tells me it can't find the name of the contact list I am entering, so it does not populate the address bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not make any changes to the computer prior to this issue.</p>
<p>I work with Chrome but I tried this in my Edge browser and had the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have substantially cleaned out my email, although I have many I wish to keep. How many emails is the max I can have without causing problems? Does this max number include read and unread messages as well as saved in folders emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help and any advice you may give.</p>

<h3> johnburkhart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Digital Certificates - Case Sensitive</h2>
                    I am using Outlook 2011 on a MacBook Pro running version 10.9.1.<br />
<br />
Whenever I receive digitally signed emails from anyone I get an error message that reads, "The e-mail address "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" in the signing certificate does not match the sender's address."<br />
<br />
I've determined that this happens probably because of a case mismatch with the email that is listed in the certificate and the actual email address that appears in the header of the mail message.&nbsp; For example, I will see an email address like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 in the certificate.&nbsp; But, his Exchange server translates the email address to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.<br />
<br />
Based on the RFC description for handling email, the Outlook 2011 client should accept mixed case.&nbsp; But it doesn't seem to.<br />
<br />
Is there a legitimate workaround to this?&nbsp; I've looked for a setting to see if I can switch this behavior to match the RFC but I don't see one.<br />
<br />
&lt;grasping at straws&gt; Can Microsoft put an item into the backlog to fix this please. &lt;/grasping at straws&gt;
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />
John<br />

                    I would like to <span style="font-weight: bold">specify the default level</span> (e.g. Heading 3) to display
<span style="font-weight: bold">for the document map</span> (DM) when a given document is first opened.&nbsp; Currently, because the DM defaults to all levels, I'm forced to change this manually.&nbsp; It would save me a lot of time and effort if there was some way to
 default this setting.<br />
TIA for any help!<br />

            <p>"Intercept" in this case simply means that the code will replace what Word otherwise does when executing these commands (no matter if you click the Outline button on the View tab, or if you click the Outline button on the status bar, or if you make use of
 a keyboard shortcut).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, reading you original message again I realize that I haven't actually answered your question. You are referring to the Document Map, and the workaround I offered is for Outline view. As far as I know, you can't work with the Document Map in VBA.</p>

    <title>How can I stop Outlook Calendar from putting today first in my week - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I stop Outlook Calendar from putting today first in my week view</h2>
                    <p>My Outlook Calendar is set to show the full week (not just the work week). &nbsp; Ever since we got our latest update (to Outlook Plus Professional 13), Outlook has been "helpfully" adjusting the default view of my calendar every day so that the current day is
 the first day of the week. &nbsp; On Mondays I see the full week, starting with Sunday. &nbsp;On Tuesday the week starts with Tuesday and goes through next Monday. &nbsp;On Wednesday, it starts with Wednesday and goes through next Tuesday. &nbsp;Etcetera. &nbsp;Every day I change
 it back, by clicking View | Week. &nbsp;Every day it defaults to the aggravating view when I open Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been looking at a certain place on the calendar to see Wednesday since I was 5 years old, and I'm not interested in changing that behavior. &nbsp;How can I make Outlook stop doing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I cannot duplicate your results. When I change the default language to Portuguese, clicking on any character in the text does not change it to another language. Have you used the Tools&gt;Language command to verify the language settings of the text you believe
 turns to English?</p>
<p>Eu não posso duplicar os seus resultados. Quando eu alterar o idioma padrão para o Português , clicar em qualquer caractere no texto não alterá-lo para outro idioma. Você usou o comando Ferramentas&gt; Idioma para verificar as configurações de idioma do texto
 você acredita que se transforma em Inglês ?</p>

            <p>It's is incredible... Yesterday Version 15.20 was released and still the bug has not been fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with PowerPoint for Mac is that, every time that you try to use and accented character, the spelling languages changes automatically to the active keyboard language that has been set in OS X El Capitan -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Input Sources</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reported this bug using the "face" at the Ribbon but the result is that, five months later, the problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is incredible... Are all the Microsoft programmers using the English version of PowerPoint with English keyboard, and this is the reason they are not able to reproduce the problem???</p>
<p>
</p><p>One solution for you would be to use a Portuguese keyboard and change the setting in OS X Preferences. But even in the case of Spanish (from Spain) users this is not the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us, the automatic language for spelling is Spanish (Spain - Traditional Sort). When we write the first word with accent, the language changes automatically to Spanish (Spain), and PowerPoint considers that both are different languages, setting the accented
 word as incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope anybody from Microsoft can read this post and try to find a solution (six months later)!!!!!</p>
