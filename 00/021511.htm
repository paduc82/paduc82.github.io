<h2>            Windows account contacts disappeared from phone</h2>
                    I've had a Lumia 650 for about eight months and I've had no problems so far. However, last night I noticed that it was no longer showing my Windows account contacts. I checked to see if it had somehow gotten configured to only show my Facebook contacts,
 but it was not the case. The contacts are still in my account, I can look at them on my computer, but they don't show on the Contacts app on my phone, it only shows my Facebook contacts. I really want my contacts back, not just the Facebook ones. Can anyone
 help me?

</p><p>When I check the Outlook People on the web, I found out that there are <strong>
2 default Contact Folders</strong>, one with the name "Contacts" (supposed to be the real original folder) and one with the name "Danh bạ" (meaning contact in Vietnamese, my phone language is Vietnamese and I don't create this folder myself.) I can see all
 of my contacts in the original folder, but the 'fake' folder does not contain any contacts. I tried to delete that empty folder by using Outlook 2016 but impossible, it seems Outlook treats it as a default folder and does not let me delete it. Then I tried
 the opposite way, that is copying all contacts from the original folder to that fake folder and synced the Microsoft account. Now all contacts return in my People Hub again.</p>

<p>It work for me too, but my fake folder is in English and my original is in Spanish. I don't know why it was in English, because my Lumia 650 is in Spanish.&nbsp;</p>

            Haha I'm confusing now. But I noticed that my PC has just received the Fall Creator Update with so many changes including new features related to People Hub. I think maybe that's the cause. The Fall Creator Update rolled out from mid of Oct, and some days
 later users in non-English speaking regions (or maybe just their phone's region setting) started to complain about this issue.

<p>I am wondering to use MS Access defaul Contacts database file in Templates can be used to dial phone call using cantact details and otherway arround to received incomming call.</p>
<p>Similarly the same source can be used to send messages (SMS) by using mobile service provider.</p>
<p>If MS Outlook can do this than I am sure this can work through some macro.</p>
<p>Can any one help on this.</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>in a single forest with multiple domain i have setup in the root domain the adfs and the dirsync.</p>
<p>I am planning the rest domain of the forest and final the hybrid.</p>
<p>My question is if i have to run hybrid in every domain or just the root and if i have to buy a certificate with every accepted smtp domain or just the smtp of the root domain.</p>
<p>I have to mention that every domain has its own exchange 2013 organization and servers accross different countries</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Panosapo,</p>
<p>In a single forest, if you want all domains can be used in the hybrid, you need to add them to the HCW. You only need to have one certificate with the root domain to finish the process of the HCW.</p>
<p>When you mentioned that every domain has own exchange servers in different countries, given the situation, it should not in one forest. May I know what is your final purpose and detailed information about your current situations?</p>

<p>Hi Panosapo,</p>
<p>If your domains with Exchange server across the countries, it should be different forests. One Azure Directory is one forest. Based on your final purpose, you need to create different forests for domains in different countries. After that, create the hybrid
 and migrate users to Office 365.</p>

<p>Hi Panosapo,</p>
<p>About “Can i run multiple hybrid to the same tenant from a single exchange organization?”, generally, we will say multiple forests to set up Hybrids. For your special question and situation, there are no official documents about it. We only have multiple
 forests with hybrid as I mentioned above.</p>
<p>Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

<h2>            E71 - Battery Life</h2>
                    Hi! I seem to have hit a wall. My E71 is marely giving a 18 - 20 hrs backup with avg talk time of 50 min a day. BTW I am not using the WiFi, the music player or even the GPS or even the Net surfing. Inspite of all these tips for enhancing the battery life,
 no respite. My dealer has replaced the bettery But the result is the same.<br />
<br />
Is it a unusual issue with this model or others are in the same boat too?

            I get 48hrs with moderate use :-(<br />
No GPS, no WiFi, no BT, no games, 4hrs Exchange Email sync.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the time between the "battery low" warning and self shutdown was a mere 10minutes (no usage during that time).<br />
<br />
Very disapointing.<br />

            guys, I am told by the Nokia care that there is an update for the battery program. I do not know if it is logical or true. I am asked to give the handset for a day to them. However, on the Nokia site, there is no info on any update for E71.

            There is a NOKIA application out there for SW developers to optimize Battery usage. And according to the product sheet, the E71's standby/usage times can differ up to 30% by using either GMS or UMTS networks.<br />
<br />
I switched from "Dualmode" to "GSM" (Settings - Network). Let's see if that helps.<br />

            Two days in and I can not see a significant change in battery perfomance. Am not willing to do a test series.<br />
<br />
Is anyone achieving 48hrs with the phone turned on?<br />

            E71-1, early July. Software version 100.07.76<br />
<br />
Most of the time I run in dual mode but recently given up as 3G is poor around here so I just switch to Dual when travelling. There is certainly much better battery life on GSM only but the figures I quoted were from when I have been running in Dual mode.<br />
<br />
Not particularly scientific but I last charged the phone 36 hours ago and Nokia's Device status software is currently showing the battery with an 85% charge. Not many phone calls in that time but quite a lot of use of other features.

            If it helps in answering my question I also received no e-mails from Microsoft themselves telling of the suspicious activity or that someone logged onto my e-mail. Which makes me inclined to believe it is in fact a glitch.&nbsp;

<p>I also had the same suspicious activity yesterday. Automatic sync synced my e-mails to foreign servers despite having two-step-auth activated. Made also a thread about it here:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/osecurity-oother/my-outlook-account-got-hacked-e-mails-leaked-by/c1a4baaf-1014-4590-a507-4eaff0dcce75</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also want to keep an eye on on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's hope it was just a false positive. Otherwise it's quite sad how vulnerable Microsoft's security systems are.</p>

            Just change the <b>Zoom</b> to a preferable percentage, such as <b>100%</b>,
<b>Page Width</b>, <b>Whole Page</b>, or whatever you're comfortable with. Zoom [magnification for viewing on screen] has nothing to do with font size or how the document prints.<br />

<h2>            Win 10 TP alt tab issues ingame</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>I got issues from all build versions sofar,and even reloaded completely to troubleshoot and still experience this</p>
<p>When im in game and trying to alt tab to desktop it jumps back to the game screen..Need to keep in alt tab and than select the start button while alt tab in still pressed only then it takes me to the desktop.The biggest issue here is that sometimes when
 i try doing this,the screen doesn't swop between desktop but instead giving me black screen(like its not responding),and i then need to force shutdown pc,as not even the ctrl alt delete works.There is big issue with the basic alt &nbsp;tab issue when playing games.if
 someone can please confirm this,or is it something like graphics drivers?</p>
<p>Im using Nvidia 770 gtx card,with latest drivers installed</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this should be addressed in next build at-least,it will make a big difference for testing out OS for gamers</p>
<p />

    <title>error with internet explorer 10 windows 8 64 bit - class not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yetius  say:</h3>
<h2>            error with internet explorer 10 windows 8 64 bit - class not registered - kb2879017</h2>
                    <p>I've spent a few days attempting to get IE10 working after update kb2879017.&nbsp; If the update is applied IE10 refuses to open, and pops up a 'class not registered' error box.&nbsp; It doesn't contain any more detail than that.&nbsp; I'd started with&nbsp;a couple of system
 restores, then did some digging and have narrowed it down to kb2879017.&nbsp; If I uninstall it, IE10 works.&nbsp; If it's installed, IE10 doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried so many things from the questions/answers I've found concerning 'class not registered', here's the ones that I've tried today, and made a note of progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started with the regsvr32 ExplorerFrame.dll fix, it gave me an error that I've seen repeated on several other questions ("The module "ExplorerFrame.dll" was loaded but the entry-point DllRegisterServer was not found.&nbsp; Make sure that "ExplorerFrame.dll"
 is a valid DLL or OCX file and try again).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've reregistered all my DLL files after finding a youtube video dealing with the problem, using a batch file to invoke regsvr32 for each DLL file.&nbsp; No difference at all, IE10 remains broken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've removed IE10 from the programs and features list, restarted and added it back to programs and features.&nbsp; No difference made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried the 'no add ons' method, that also made no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried installing IE10 again, though the installer I downloaded will not install IE10 (download from
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie-10-worldwide-languages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie-10-worldwide-languages</a>), it tells me that I already have a later version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've run sfc /scannow, which did report corrupt files but the log file is so big as to render it not much use at all for someone like me to read, I'm not a sys admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried restoring internet settings, it made no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also tried the clean boot method shown in another answer, IE10 remained broken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally I've tried the regedit fix at <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ie/en-US/e0de0317-a5d5-44b9-a3c6-a2d7a2adf8ca/class-not-registered?forum=ieitprocurrentver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've probably also tried other things before today&nbsp;that I simply can't remember.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have much in the way of stuff installed, I detest plug ins/addons/toolbars so have little more than a PDF reader, classic shell, Logitech mouse/keyboard, flash and java.&nbsp; I've made sure to update flash and java.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm now completely foxed!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using the 64 bit Windows 8 on i7 with a GeForce GTX 675M graphics card, if that has any bearing on the issue.&nbsp; As far as I'm aware, all drivers are up to date as I'm all for auto updates being applied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment, I've stopped the update from being applied again by hiding it.&nbsp; I appreciate that this will likely cause problems in the medium term, if not before, which is why I'm asking about the issue here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help in solving this would be muchly appreciated!</p>

<p>Or maybe you can try uninstalling it and downloading a new version (in case it got corrupted somehow during the first install)</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technet didn't seem to have any answers for me, from the searches I tried&nbsp;:(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded the 64 bit patch, and tried it.&nbsp; It killed IE10 again, while uninstalling it makes IE10 work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then ventured in to trying it in safe mode, as suggested in a couple of places.&nbsp; I used msconfig to set the boot mode to safe with networking, I don't have a link for where that was suggested, it's been lost in what followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's taken me 2 hours to get the PC working again, safe mode turned out to be anything but safe for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I managed to get to the safe mode desktop twice in those two hours, the rest of it was filled up with a light blue screen with a sad face :( telling me my computer has gone wrong, we'll gather some info and get right back to you!&nbsp; Only the next boot would
 do the same, then the 3rd gave me the automatic repair menus.&nbsp; This was a common pattern, boot, error, grab info, restart, boot, error, grab info, restart, boot, automatic repair pops up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automatic repair said it couldn't do anything, sadly.&nbsp; But yet the machine failed to boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did manage to do another system restore during this cycle of failed boots, but it didn't change anything, it seems to have been a complete lottery getting the machine back on its feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the second safe mode desktop appeared, I used msconfig to remove the safe mode option and thankfully the PC seems to have started working again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I'm back where I was before trying the downloaded patch, I've uninstalled it and hidden the update.&nbsp; I really can't afford any more time or frustration at getting this patch installed.</p>

            <p>Have you tried uninstalling the update, doing a clean boot, and then downloading/reinstalling the update from that mode?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;"clean boot."&nbsp;is when Windows loads with only the minimum necessary services and drivers.&nbsp;This frees up system memory and can result in a quicker system configuration when downloading updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the Run box ........enter <strong>msconfig</strong></p>
<p>Services (tab)</p>
<p>CHECK "Hide All Microsoft Services"</p>
<p>Click "Disable All" (button)</p>
<p>Click APPLY</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When prompted, restart <u>without exiting.</u></p>
<p>Then try to download the update again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9de4467-707e-4601-a48d-5f7c2fcc882c" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no need to go back and CHECK the boxes when you are done.&nbsp; They will automatically default to "Enable All" when you turn off your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing to try is a scan for corrupted files.&nbsp; Know you used System File Checker /scannow but Windows has a more user-friendly version built in that provides a legible report after the scan&nbsp; (designed for non techies).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open File Explorer</p>
<p>right-click on Local Disc (C:)</p>
<p>Properties</p>
<p>Tools (tab)</p>
<p>under Error Checking, select "Check" (button)</p>
<p>You will get a message "Are You sure, etc........YES</p>
<p>You may get a message that "You don't need to scan the Drive"</p>
<p>Select "Scan Drive:..anyway</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>As for the clean boot, yes, I've tried that. I was a little too concise in my original post, didn't want to post a blow-by-blow account of what I'd tried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I will try it again, as you've qualified it's use with "without exiting".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did also find a way to get a semi-sensible report from sfc, can't for the life of me remember it now and didn't take a screenshot. It did detect problems but couldn't fix them and didn't seem to list what they were. So I'll certainly try your second suggestion
 too, thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I get the time I'll schedule a full virus check. I use NOD32 on all of my machines, I don't use that peer-to-peer/torrent stuff, don't download pirated software/music/films, I don't even use google cos I don't trust them with my cookies XD My PC isn't
 exposed to risk, but I'll check with NOD32 anyway *just in case* something has snuck through.

            <p>You probably have already tried this, but NOD32 takes up a ton of computer memory and can actually&nbsp;interfere with Windows cumulative security updates, because it detects them as&nbsp;threats if set too high.&nbsp; Try disabling NOD32 during&nbsp;your next stab at this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, oddly enough, there are virus remnants that attach themselves to the Internet Explorer<u> shortcut</u>, and aren't removed by AV programs.; you have to take them out manually.&nbsp; Each time you start IE, you re-launch the malware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right-click on the Internet Explorer icon on the Desktop Taskbar.</p>
<p>Right-click (again) on the words "Internet Explorer"</p>
<p>Properties</p>
<p>In the "Target" box, remove anything after iexplore.exe&nbsp; (such as <a href="http://Qvo6.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://Qvo6.com</a>)</p>

            <p>Ok, an update.&nbsp; No progress towards a solution, but more things tried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also did a full virus scan, it picked up 9 things that it cleaned, all Java related.&nbsp; Not sure what they are, couldn't find out anything much about them other than they're labelled Trojans.&nbsp; After NOD32 cleaned them, minecraft would no longer launch so
 that seemed to break the java installation.&nbsp; I uninstalled Java completely, grabbed the latest installer and installed it, then virus checked the folder initially identified as containing the Trojans.&nbsp; All clear now on that front.&nbsp; I kept the relevant part
 of the log that details the 9 java problems but as it doesn't seem to have had any bearing in getting IE10 to work I shan't post the files here unless requested.&nbsp; And I must give serious consideration to whether I keep java, it's only there for minecraft XD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then repeated the clean boot, and the "without exiting" caveat confused me.&nbsp; After clicking OK I get given two choices, restart or exit without restart.&nbsp; I plumped for exit without restart, grabbed kb2879017 again and installed it manually after doing
 restarting to invoke the clean boot.&nbsp; IE10 remained broken.&nbsp; I've uninstalled kb2879017 again, and hidden it from update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drive scanning reported no problems at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and there were no suffixes or strange shortcut type things going on, just "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" in the Target box when clicking on IE's shortcut and looking at properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good game, good game!&nbsp; Getting quite resigned to having this update hidden for eternity!</p>

            <p>Yeah, one of the things I tried certainly did involve stopping all (non Microsoft) services and disabling everything in task manager's startup.&nbsp; That was one of the steps for the clean boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll try it again having disable java, might even try it with java uninstalled too, should it not yield any success!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10 out of 10 for persistence by the way :)&nbsp; much appreciated!</p>

            <p>I know you have tried to register and re-register the .dll file but it is possible that the file has been damaged by one of the Java Trojans and is no longer recognized.&nbsp; Run System File Checker again, specifically for this file and, should it be damaged,&nbsp;sfc
 may be able to repair it.&nbsp;(scannow indicated something wrong but no real details.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you can get closer to the problem this way. If the .dll is bad, the only thing you can do is go back to a restore point before the update (assuming you have one somewhere
 close up).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the Command (Administrator) prompt and paste in.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Win10 TP build 10130 x64 - minimize window malfunctions</h2>
                    Minimizing windows of open applications does not work properly ether closes app or just doesn't do anything, also some times I can not switch between windows of open applications it will only show current app can't switch to another window until the current
 application is closed in this case Open Office&nbsp;and Google Chrome open at the same time&nbsp;switching windows does nothing while working on Open Office minimizing ether one closes the application all work is lost without saving. Very troublesome I had a web form
 to fill out for work and the details that needed to be filled out in that web app using Chrome was on Open Office and it was impossible to do because viewing one or the other closed them both with nothing saved... please fix this malfunction!!

<h3> jennifer waldo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using pointer in Mac version of powerpoint office 365</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to record a slideshow in powerpoint as downloaded through my campus office 365 subscription on my macbook. &nbsp;The problem is that i can't seem to have the ability to use/control a pointer during the recording of the slide show.</p>
<p>I opened powerpoint on a PC and see that the controls there match the descriptions for how to do this that i found through google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there just no way to do this with the mac version of powerpoint?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as I need to get these slideshows posted this week!</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

</p><p>When you record a presentation in PowerPoint on Mac, you can use pointer via Ctrl+click. In this case, you are able to access the recording commands that let you navigate through the slides, change cursors, or trigger screen blackouts or whiteouts. For more

<h2>            Access to Azure Active Directory subscriptions</h2>
                    <p>I have no idea when I added "Access to Azure Active Directory" subscription.&nbsp; Status shows "Active", but My role is "Unknown" and I can't assign any role and "No resource providers found" on this subscription.</p>
<p>I like to either fix this subscription or gave me options to assign roles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2134c652-3c16-4a3c-91e2-cf70ccc3f39e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2134c652-3c16-4a3c-91e2-cf70ccc3f39e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this subscription is something to do with "Role assignments" since when I check Azure resources, it said "you don't have permission to read" with same subscription ID as "Access to Azure Active Directory".</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47bd4811-ba76-48b4-8ea9-d5a373ec4de1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47bd4811-ba76-48b4-8ea9-d5a373ec4de1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I tried to assign "Directory role", it gives me "User, Global administrator, Limited administrator" option, but doesn't give me any other role options.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a60a1be-7f18-40e0-aa27-3437f733a09a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a60a1be-7f18-40e0-aa27-3437f733a09a?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi Akikos,<br />
<br />
Usually an Office 365 subscription includes a free subscription to Azure AD so that you can integrate Office 365 with Azure AD if you want to sync passwords or set up single sign-on with your on-premises environment. You could refer this:

Azure integration with Office 365</a>. Before you can manage your Office 365 Apps in Azure AD, you need to
<strong>Register your free Azure Active Directory subscription</strong> and <strong>

            <p><span><span>Hi Dilip,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>We regret the inconvenience caused to you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue could be caused due to some software conflicts or due to some security threats like virus and malwares.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us try the following steps, and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>: Initially, You may perform a complete security scan to make sure that your computer is free from security threats.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for using an antivirus software program that provides ongoing protection.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>: </span><strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.
</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program
 in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality
 when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network,
 network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>NOTE</strong>: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>” to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></span></p>

                    <p>Ok - I have tried to be a Windows Phone supporter. &nbsp;I have had 2 - the Lumia 920 and the Lumia 830. &nbsp; I like the phones and I appreciate the connectivity to my laptop. &nbsp;The love affair stops there.</p>
<p>Here are my issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tried to buy a Windows phone for my use when in the US (I live in Canada) but AT&amp;T couldn't provide me with one (they said there was no inventory). I bought an iphone6</li><li>I have been waiting patiently for apps - what is up with this? &nbsp;Why don't apps get developed for the Windows phones?</li><li>I would like a cover for my device. &nbsp;I have been to at least 5 Microsoft stores to no avail - they dont carry them...seriously? this phone is less than a year old!</li></ul>
<p>Sorry Microsoft. &nbsp;I am moving to the dark side....regretfully.</p>

<p>You mean Outlook on the Web (in your Internet browser)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can select a time zone there as well and switch between time zones too. So set the Start Time when selecting one time zone, then select another time zone and set the End Time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, note that this is just a time calculation helper for you. The time for the recipient will be automatically converted to their local time, and will be adjusted again even when they switch time zones later on when traveling.</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com - Sweep Rules Do Not Work - Known Bug&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Outlook.com (browser UI) implementation of rules, it is clear the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
sweep </span>rules are not functioning correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. create a sweep rule on any received email. See the attached screenshot from the browser UI found at:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Settings - Options - Mail - Inbox and sweep rules</p>
<p>2. expected behavior is that only the most current message is retained in the inbox and all other messages from that address are automatically moved to a folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3. this is not working - multiple messages are retained for several days in the inbox and are not moved as expected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known bug or is anyone else experiencing this?</p>

            Can you ping your router? Go to the Admin command prompt and type ping 192.168.1.1 and see if you get a response. At least that way you will know if your router is responding. If it works that way you might have your firewall configured incorrectly. This
 does not appear to be a Windows problem.
