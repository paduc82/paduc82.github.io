<h2>            How do I set shapes for horizontal text in the shape&#39;s text block&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I type text into a shape's text block, Visio rotates the text at the shape's angle, so that every time I have to use the text block's rotation box to make it horizontal.</p>
<p>How do I fix my shapes so that their text blocks will always arrange the text horizonally from the start (i.e., without having to use the rotation knobs)?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            E5-00 &#124; C&#58;&#92; Memory full, but no files</h2>
                    
<p>Lately Ive been getting notifications on my Nokia E5-00 saying the phone's memory is full.</p>
<p>When browsing through my phone memory, there are almost no files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I have some apps installed, there not that much of being capable of consuming all that memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to clean up my phone memory (besides uninstalling apps), to get more memory? Or seeing what's consuming all that space?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I e.g. delete some MfE emails (without deleting those emails from the servers)?</p>

<h2>            Help on handling new &#34;text boxes&#34; in OneNote page</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
When clicking in any place of OneNote page a text box is open (I don't know whether the correct name of that boxes are this...).<br />
<br />
a) But once one fill a text box and want to insert another bellow, OneNote still maintain (expand) the current text box. You can click everywhere below that the current text box will expand bottom. But I would like to create a new text box and the way I found
 is to click with a great distance bellow of the current text box. I tried to click bellow pressing shif, ctrl etc. So, is it the behavior of OneNote or it is possible to handle it better?<br />
<br />
b) Other situation happens when I want to insert a text box above the current one. I only way I found was drag and drop the current text box to bellow to open space and then insert other text box above. If I don't do this, and paste a internet copy content
 a little bit above the current box, they will overlap. Is there any way of handle it better as well? Something like paste and the other box automatically avoid overlap...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Cadu&nbsp; <br />

            Halo Carlos.Cadux.<br />
<br />
It is called Note Container.<br />
<br />
a)<br />
I think the developers mean good by making it that way so that we do not have to click precisely at the end of the note container if we want to continue writing.<br />
<br />
I handle it by making the rule lines appear and when I want to make a new note container, I click at least 2 lines below the previous note container text. I use Narrow Ruled or Small Grid.<br />
(Ribbon Menu &gt; View &gt; Rule Lines)<br />
<br />
<br />
[edit: Oops, I forgot a part of my stupid trick.&nbsp; If you see the above does not work, move your pointer to the right-border of previous note container until the pointer becomes two-point arrow then drag a little bit right/left and back to the original position.
 aka: shake it :)&nbsp; ]<br />
<br />
<br />
b)<br />
I see some pages in which the writer takes advantage from two or more overlapped note containers.<br />
I do not know if there is an option to never allow overlapped note containers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
.<br />

Experiment with <span style="font-weight: bold">Draw, Edit, Insert Space</span> (it's even useful for the opposite).<br />

<h2>            MS Office Outlook 2007 receiving e-mail messages but are not showing up in the Inbox</h2>
                    <p>MS Office Outlook 2007 with Windows 10:</p>
<p>I still see the list in the inbox and reading panels from a few days ago when it worked fine, but now the new received&nbsp;e-mails are not showing up&nbsp;in the Inbox even thought&nbsp;every time Outlook is opened it says (immediately after opening)&nbsp;in the lower right
 hand&nbsp;corner of the window that it is receiving the new messages (more and more received messages are added each time Outlook is opened, but they cannot be seen, they are not showing up.&nbsp; Since it is receiving, I assume it might be a setting somewhere that
 I have to correct, or...?).</p>
<p>Any advise about this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. I am not very computer savvy with MS Office Outlook.&nbsp; How could I see the filters and if &nbsp;there is one that I could retrieve?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In the "E-mail Accounts" dialog, it says Type "POP/SMTP (send form this account by default)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Account Type under "Internet E-mail Settings" is POP 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. It is MS Office Outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I mentioned before, I see all the e-mails up to a certain day in the Mail column and&nbsp;in the Inbox column, but then no more after that date, even thought the program is indicating on the lower right hand corner that it I receiving new messages every
 time it is opened.&nbsp; (It seems that something stopped just short of showing them).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>After some doing back and forth, I was able to have another receiving set under the Inbox (which is receiving and showing e-mails).&nbsp; Two exist right now under the Inbox pane, the one that was not working before and the new that is receiving and showing up
 new e-mails now.&nbsp; When I open Outlook, the one that is not receiving any more is the one that&nbsp;appears on the right reading pane by default.&nbsp; I have to click the other one, the one that is receiving now, for it to appear on the right reading pane.</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>How do I make the new one that is working now to appear on the right reading pane by default when Outlook is opens?</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<h3> bobhovorka  say:</h3>
<h2>            HTC 8X Will Not Connect</h2>
                    <p>I have been unable to get any Windows Phone 8 to sync to my desktop computer.&nbsp;I originally had a Nokia 920 but after I crashed two in a row (by following Nokia's suggestion of resetting the phone), I changed to the HTC 8x. It, too, refuses to connect to
 my desktop PC. As a result, I cannot sync at all. If I try the Windows 8 client, it reports that my phone isn't playing nice and suggests I shut down and restart my phone. That made no difference; I also rebooted my computer. Several times. I tried the Windows
 8 desktop app (beta, "app preview 2"). It appeared to work, asking me to name my phone, but when I click "continue," nothing happens. In explorer, my phone shows as connected, but "empty."&nbsp;All in all, for syncing music from the desktop, my 8x is useless.&nbsp;I'm
 running Windows 8 on my desktop and everything else connects without issue, including my Zune 80 via the Zune desktop software. Prior to "upgrading" to the 8x, my Nokia 710 also successfully sync'd to this computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I've uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers. Yes, I've shut down and restarted all of the software. No, none of the devices show an error on installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, this is all very, very frustrating.</p>

            <p>Yes, I've downloaded and install the app, both the Win8 version and the Win8 desktop app.&nbsp; The Win8 version simply reports that my phone isn't playing nice and wants me to shutdown and restart it. The desktop app recognizes that a phone is connected, but
 stops at the screen asking me to name my phone. When I enter a name and click Continue, nothing happens. In Windows Explorer, I see that the phone is connected, but it's blank, nothing there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had this same issue with my first Windows Phone 8 device, a Nokia 920. Nokia's suggestion was, when all else failed, to reset the phone. The phone locked up and back to AT&amp;T it went. My second 920 suffered a similar fate. And now I'm attempting to connect
 my 8x and if the recommendation is to reset it, I'll be doing so at an AT&amp;T store so I can replace it if (when?) it, too, locks up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I'm trying to sync is photos and music. Yes, I can upload to the cloud, and download music from the cloud, but I can't get to any of my music that Microsoft can't match, or any of my playlists.</p>

            <p>And now, an update...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the realm of wishful thinking, I thought that perhaps the "Portico" update (build 10211) would take care of my syncing problem. It stood to reason that since I had this problem on multiple Windows Phone 8 devices (two Nokia 920's, one HTC 8X) and multiple
 computers running multiple operating systems, it might have something to do with the initial build and release of the phone OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And sometimes wishes are granted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My phone updated the other night and since then I can successfully sync to my PC.&nbsp;Works like a charm, actually. I much prefer the beta desktop client since it gives me access to iTunes playlists (though I'm mystified why I can't access either Xbox Music
 playlists or my old Zune playlists).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the point is, it now works.&nbsp;If anyone else is having this problem, check again after its updates. For me, problem solved.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Team&#34; created Shared Calendar - Custom Forms, Permissions</h2>
                    <p>Our business is moving away from creating traditional shared calendars with lots of permissions management.&nbsp; We have moved to a fuller Office suite, including Teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a Team created that generated a shared calendar<br />
</p>
<p>- For the Shared calendar (most of our users will be accessing via PC based Outlook) I am trying to solve for the following two items:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; For&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;'turning off invitations for all group members', I want this will stay permanently off for all invites, even from Outlook on Web.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; In our old way using a non-team/group shared Calendar, I want to be able to use a custom form when creating invites&nbsp;in Outlook...and based on what we have done historically, would like to be able to "Right-Click"
 on my Shared Calendar, and change what is under "When posting to this folder, use:" to a custom Form.&nbsp; What I try to do that, I get an error that says I do not have permission.&nbsp; Even though I own the Team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi TheWaterGuy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my research, if you have chosen a group calendar and want to schedule new meeting from it, it will automatically add the whole group address to the recipient by default. This is a normal behavior.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as to change custom forms, based on my test, we cannot change the whole group (team)’s calendar forms, it doesn’t matter whether you own the group or not, but we can change the form of a personal shared calendar. I think you can write your feedback

                    <p>Windows 10 Insider Preview build 10074 has worked well on my HP Envy X2 convertible except that the keyboard doesn't work immediately after starting up Windows 10. &nbsp;I have to detach the tablet (screen) from the keyboard and the reattach it to be able to
 type my welcome screen password for Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also my mouse pad doesn't respond after typing until I move my finger around a bit on the touchpad to sort of, "wake it up". &nbsp;Would love to see a resolution to these two problems. It would be almost a perfect world!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the help Sudheendra. &nbsp;I was able to accomplish all the instructions above and it appeared that something was resoved by the Troubleshooting step, but I don't know what it was. &nbsp;I also determined that I have the latest drivers for the keyboard
 and mouse (no change needed). &nbsp;I upgraded to build 10130 as well but I am still having the same problem as originally stated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any further help you can render.</p>

    <title>Array Formula referencing multiple worksheets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#39;jason_k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Array Formula referencing multiple worksheets</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to look up values on multiple worksheets and return their sum. I am using the following array formula but it is not working as intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>{=SUM((INDIRECT(SheetNames&amp;"!R4"&amp;"C"&amp;MATCH($B6,INDIRECT(SheetNames&amp;"!$A$2:$AZ$2"),0),FALSE)))}</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the MATCH function to locate the correct column associated with a value in column B ($B6 for this formula, I'll expand it once it is working). &nbsp;The order of the values in column B may change as well as those in $A$2:$AZ$2. This part is working
 well getting individual data (not an array function).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user defined range "SheetNames" refers to a range ($N$3:$Z$3) Each cell in this range contains the name (text) of the various worksheets I want to get the data from. &nbsp;On an individual basis (one worksheet at a time) this works as intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When including the range SheetNames and making it an array function to sum the values things don't seam to work as I intend. If interned into one cell only the first value is returned. &nbsp;I would expect the sum of all the values to be returned.&nbsp;If the array
 formula is interned across 13 cells&nbsp;(same size as the array of worksheets) they each display the individual values associated with each worksheet. &nbsp;What am I missing? &nbsp;Any help is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>You cannot pass an array of range references to MATCH.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the search value occurs a maximum of once within each of the sheet ranges, you can use simply:<br />
<br />
<strong>=SUMPRODUCT(SUMIF(INDIRECT(SheetNames&amp;"!2:2"),$B6,INDIRECT(SheetNames&amp;"!4:4")))</strong><br />

<h2>            OSPP.VBS &#47;ACT consumes multiple licenses &#47; how to automatically activate Office 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello all. I learned the hard way that if you run ospp.vbs /act to activate Microsoft Office 2016 it will consume a MAK license every time it is run. Regardless if the product is already activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why this happened is that I was having trouble getting Office 2016 ProPlus to activate itself automatically like 2010 and 2013 would. After much tinkering, I decided to just add the ospp.vbs /act command to the end of a startup script.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, every time a computer restarted it consumed another license and ate up all our MAK keys. I did send a request to get that reset and am hoping that goes OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, has anyone had any luck getting a bulk deployment of Office 2016 (using simple startup scripts with an&nbsp;OCT file) to activate automatically after deployment?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried setting the following command to run after installation: %systemroot%\system32\cscript.exe "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\Office16\ospp.vbs" /ACT</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried the same procedures I used on previous versions and I set custom setup properties to: AUTO_ACTIVATE = 1 and USEROPERATIONS = 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MAK key is specified inside the OCT file and properly applied during deployment. Just every user (limited) sees an activation prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<h2>            Download entire Onedrive folder, without sync</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I work on my home computer for my job once a week, i need access to my onedrive 365 files (web interface).
</p>
<p>I was looking to download some specific folders to my pc, the same way you can download individual files (right click - download). This way my system doesn't get clogged up with all my work's onedrive data, nor by the extremely resource hungry groove-process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alas, however users ask for this feature since 2015, it hasn't been provided yet.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/onedrive/comments/42j955/is_there_a_way_to_download_multiple_folders_or/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please MS, fix this. I need a lean system, i don't want to sync, just download/upload. And I don't see myself manually downloading say ten indesign packages full of fonts and pics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>Steven</p>

<h2>            Solution found&#58; Syncing subfolders in email on e72</h2>
                    
<p>I have seen a few people asking on here how to sync sub folders in their hotmail/ gmail/ yahoo email accounts. I never saw any answer, but just worked out how to do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Log in to nokia messaging on your computer (you need to use the email address and password of the first email account you set up with nokia messaging on your phone). Select 'edit settings' next to the account you are interested in. Then select up to 10 folders
 that you want also synchronised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is useful if for example you have set new messages from certain email addresses to automatically go to a subfolder rather than your inbox. But note that the subfolders will only be visible (under 'more folders' in the email account on your handset)
 on the handset if it contains messages received in the last 2 weeks. I still can't see a way to have old messages in either your inbox or subfolders being visible as it seems locked at 2 weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that helps anyone who was also stuck on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only real bug bears remaining about the email interface on the e72 is the inability to have more than 2 accounts on the home standby screen. I get no pings or message icons if there is email in my other 2 accounts, so see no way to find out if new email
 is there without manually checking each account. Makes the idea of having push mail set to on for anymore than 2 accounts a bit redundant. Also not having access to emails more than 2 weeks old could be an irritant. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried in the way exactly what you have described. But no luck. Took the phone (E-72)&nbsp;to Nokia Support Center, they told me to upgrade the firmware, which I did. Now, my firmware is 31.023, but still do not see any sub-folders of Yahoo mail in E-72,
 although I have selected the sub-folders&nbsp;in email.nokia.com. Infact, I have edited the account settings to include the sub-folders multiple times, but no luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Feedback Hub you can report all of the issues that you have. You can make them a suggestion or a problem. You can select the categories for your issue and even add screen shots, support files like logs and such and even reproduce the issue and have
 it recorded and sent to MS.</p>
<p>I believe that right before you submit there is a button or checkbox that asks if it needs to be a bug.</p>
<p>These then&nbsp; become searchable and up-vote-able by any Feedback hub user.</p>
<p>This feedback helps us all in reporting issues and being able to say "me too". Any one can add comments and their own files and repros to support the issues!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I want to know if it's possible to have my reply to an email sent with ONLY the selected mail attached.</p>
<p>When I have multiple responses, i.e. a 'conversation', the WHOLE string of mails gets attached to the reply, instead of just the mail I'm responding to.</p>
<p>This has caused some frustration on multiple occasions as the need to send responses to different people on the same mail seperately becomes a challenge.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Hi Jasper,</p>
<p>It is not feasible to do so.</p>
<p>However, when replying an email (conversation), all the content (conversation history) can be edited. That is to say we can delete the content we don’t want to send out and leave the desired content when reply an email. I do know it might be a little inconvenient.
 So, if you don’t regard it as a workaround, we suggest you <a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
submit feedback </a>to our related team. Your valuable comments will help our products and services better.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

            <p>No difference has been made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I brought up the webpage <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/14434/scan-a-windows-pc-for-viruses-from-a-ubuntu-live-cd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/14434/scan-a-windows-pc-for-viruses-from-a-ubuntu-live-cd/</a> on Internet Explorer 9.&nbsp; Everything was there including all images.&nbsp; I turned off the Internet connection.&nbsp; I did a webpage complete save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Internet still offline I opened the saved webpage with the Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Where the images were supposed to be&nbsp;I could see the downloading icons spinning.&nbsp; Except one small image, all other images were missing.&nbsp; The download icons just kept spinning
 with no end in sight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Internet still offline I opened the saved webpage with Firefox 18.0.1.&nbsp; It worked fine, every image was there.&nbsp; It seems to prove the IE saving process has no problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I opened the folder.&nbsp; I couldn't find all the major images in it.&nbsp; Now I don't understand where the Firefox picked up the images.&nbsp; Did it pick up from the memory or the hard disk somewhere?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turned the Internet connection back on.&nbsp; I opened the saved web page again.&nbsp; It then worked fine.&nbsp; All images were there.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to say the save process does not save all the images and has to rely on the Internet connection to pick up the images then
 and there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One strange thing on the side, I saved the page <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283807</a> using Firefox.&nbsp; When I opened the saved page using Internet Explorer 9, it came up blank.&nbsp; It worked okay with Firefox, though.&nbsp; I had supposed the languages used with web pages are universal languages.</p>

<h2>            How to see text messages from a Windows 10 mobile phone on a Windows 10 computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 Anniversary edition cell phone (Lumia 735).&nbsp; I also have a Windows 10 Anniversary edition PC (Lenovo Yoga 460).&nbsp; I would like to be able to see my text messages from my phone on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an app on the PC called 'Messaging' that has my text messages until 9/26/16 (today is 10/28/16) but they stop after that.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this app continued to have the messages, it would be just what I am looking for.&nbsp; But for some reason, it started on 8/30/16
 capturing SMS texts and it stops on 9/26/16.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get it to work again?&nbsp; Is there a configuration/setup that got changed somehow?</p>

<h3> schroob  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2013&#58; Insert Meeting Details cannot be inserted multiple times on the same page</h2>
                    <p>Hello! In the prior version of OneNote, I was able to insert meeting details multiple times. So if I had a page called "Wednesday Weekly Meeting", each Wednesday I could insert that week's meeting details from my Outlook calendar. In OneNote 2013, it won't
 allow me to do this; I can only insert the meeting details once (at the top of the page). I don't want multiple pages because it takes too much space and makes the workbook inefficient to use with too many pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to reset this function back to the original set up, or an Add-in that would allow me to do this? I'm almost ready to downgrade to the previous version, because this is a critical item for me (i need to have access to the teleconferencing
 info available in the downloaded details).</p>

<h2>            cross reference text in documents</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you cross reference text from excel to word, &amp; accross word docs,&nbsp;ACAD drawings &amp; .pdf documents?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I write specifications as a Civil Engineer in New Zealand, &amp; to date, if we change a line in an excel spreadsheet, we have to manually update the drawings &amp; word document so the specification is consistent.&nbsp; This is time consuming &amp; prone to errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the cross referencing could be more automated, robust &amp; easier to use than doing it manually, even if the add on had to be paid for additionally, I think it would be in high demand at least from our industry, if not more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even an add on for MS Office programmes would be great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Derek</p>

            <p>Hi Derek,</p>
<p>Suppose your 'list' is mainatined in an Excel workbook and you want the project name, $ value of project and&nbsp;critical dates to appear in a Word document. Simply click on one of these items, copy it, then go to the destination in the Word document and choose
 Paste &gt; Paste Special, check the 'Paste link' option and choose a paste format. Repeat for each of the other items. From now on, if you update any of these items in Excel, the updates will be reflected in Word.</p>
<p>To link content between Word documents, you'd first bookmark the desired content in the source document. Then, in the target document, you'd use an INCLUDETEXT field pointing to the bookmark in the source document. See Word's help file for details. Alternatively,
 you can use the same basic copy &amp; paste link process described above.&nbsp;FWIW, there's also an INCLUDEPICTURE field for linking to graphics stored on disk - change the source graphic's contents and the picture in the Word document will update.</p>
<p>Linking between Excel workbooks is even easier: In the target workbook, simply press' =', then select the source cell in the source workbook and press Enter.</p>

            <p>Hi Derek,</p>
<p>With MS Word and Excel, you can certainly link (cross-reference) content&nbsp;between two Word documents or Excel workbooks and between Word and Excel files in either direction, so that if you update the content in the source file, each of the target files will
 also be updated. no macros or addons are required - the applications can do it already. The real issue is knowing what content needs to be linked and deciding which file should be used as the source.</p>
<p>Linking to PDFs is problematic, as they're typically not amenable to having their content edited via links to other files. Rather, the linking should be done in whatever application produces the PDFs.</p>
<p>Insofar as your ACAD drawings are concerned, the answer depends on&nbsp;the application's&nbsp;specifications. Autodesk, for example, appears to support such linking. See, for example:<br />

                    The color key scheme Key is either missing or corrupt, Run "Setup" again to reinstal the color scheme registry. I have done do at least 5 times. I ran a repair and install both with same errors.

<p>Look in the Program Files for</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\1033, find Pubcolor.scm. Change it to Pubcolor.old, drag a new Pubcolor.scm from your setup disk. Sometimes when reinstalling, some files are not over written.</p>
<p>Have you created a custom scheme? It might behoove you to rename it as well. Custom schemes are in a hidden folder similar to this:</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;&lt;user&gt;&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Publisher</p>
<p>They are named custcols.scm, you can always undo the rename.</p>

<h2>            eliminate duplicate contact records in Outlook</h2>
                    My Outlook contact list is a mess. There are a whole bunch of duplicate entries. Short of wasting hours manually reconciling different entries, is there a way to find, reconcile and consolidate duplicate records for Outlook contacts?

            Use this script:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.office.mvps.org/downloads/outlook/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Remove Duplicate Contacts</a><br />
<br />
You can also sync to Apple Address Book and use "Look for Duplicates" under Card in the Menu bar. Results will sync back to Outlook.<br />
<br />
If you do turn on Sync Services, I suggest you <span style="font-weight: bold">export your contacts first as backup</span> in case there are problems. File &gt; Export as .olm file. Select only contacts.<br />
<br />
Tip: Sync Services can cause duplicates or delete all your data. For any data that is synced, you need to make frequent backup of your data in case you need to restore. Under File &gt; Export select export as .olm file and uncheck all but contacts. Do the same
 for events. You might have a problem with contacts and not events so you need individual backups so you don't have to deal with duplicates.
