                    <p>This has been posted elsewhere, but I'm reposting with more keywords for the error in the title.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When purchasing videos within the Windows 8.x XBOX Video app, you might get the error message "Can't download.&nbsp; The item is missing or we can't get to it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within the Video app go to:</li><li>Settings-&gt;Preferences-&gt;'Choose where we look for videos on this machine'</li><li>Remove any folders in the listing&nbsp;that don't exist on the local Windows system.</li><li>Add your 'This PC/Videos' folder.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Try to download/stream again.&nbsp; It should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was that the app was trying to download to a non-existent folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Junk mail &#34;No Automatic Filtering&#34; option disappeared&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flubber2015  say:</h3>
<h2>            Junk mail &#34;No Automatic Filtering&#34; option disappeared&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook.com as a passive pass-through to my pc-based Outlook and Live Mail clients using
<strong>POP3 </strong>protocol.&nbsp; Normally, I never access Outlook.com via a web browser.&nbsp; Naturally, I don't want Outlook.com to move any inbound messages to its Junk folder; I'll deal with any junk&nbsp;mail within my pc-based clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an inbox rule set up on Outlook.com as follows:</p>
<p><strong>After the message arrives and...</strong></p>
<p>[Apply to all messages] </p>
<p><strong>Do the following...</strong></p>
<p>move the message to folder 'Inbox'</p>
<p>and stop processing more rules on this message</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, Outlook.com apparently made a processing logic&nbsp;change, and now&nbsp;some messages inbound to Outlook.com are being moved to the Junk Mail folder, on an apparently arbitrary and intermittent basis, which means that I never receive those messages on my
 pc-based clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that I had selected the "No Automatic Filtering" option under "Junk email &gt; Filters and reporting" in Outlook.com.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;I now&nbsp;find that this option is no longer displayed, and that "Standard" is selected under "Choose a junk email filter."</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I completely disable junk mail filtering now within Outlook.com?&nbsp; Is this option no longer available?&nbsp; If so, is Microsoft just throwing POP3 users under the bus?</p>

</p><blockquote>It does appear that&nbsp; no automatic filtering has been removed and I believe the rule processing order has been changed as smart screen is run first (even&nbsp;before forwarding)
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I did some reading about SmartScreen.&nbsp; Microsoft is apparently phasing is out to sell more EOP licences (Exchange Online Protection):</p>
<p><a href="https://redmondmag.com/articles/2016/09/06/microsoft-ending-smartscreen-spam-filters.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://redmondmag.com/articles/2016/09/06/microsoft-ending-smartscreen-spam-filters.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, the decision to implement an upstream,&nbsp;preemptive spam filter on inbound messages - a mechanism that Outlook.com users cannot access or configure -&nbsp;is essentially a bankrupt architectural decision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As previously suspected, apparently the&nbsp;Outlook.com team has decided to throw POP3 users under the bus.&nbsp; They won't support the model that I want, so I guess I need to shop around for another email service provider that&nbsp;will.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes me mad as ****, because it's probably going to take me at least&nbsp;15 hours to settle on a new service provider and migrate a couple of hundred contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might say that I'm overstating the case, that continuously checking Outlook.com's Junk folder is a minor inconvenience, but I have three Outlook.com email addresses for different purposes, and&nbsp;can apparently only access one at a time via IE, so it's
 not a minor inconvenience, it's a major hassle for an aspect of my life (email delivery)&nbsp;that should be a no-brainer that I shouldn't have to actively manage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm overlooking a fix, please advise.</p>

            <p>If there is no option to remove spam filter on server, I tried used IMAP instead of POP3. I access my account from three different email client. Problem is that these email client cannot map server folders to local client folders (including mail in windows
 10). Each email client create ist own set of server folders. For example, this resulting in several outbox folders: "Odoslan√©", "Odoslan√° po≈°ta" (klient in slovak language). As a result of these troubles, I am using account from another provider now, where
 I can disable junk filter. And I am waiting if Microsoft returns to previous state.</p>

            I checked the specification of this Laptop. This laptop's factory OS was DOS. Hence, it didn't have any factory installed MS Office.
<br />
<br />When you installed MS Office for the first time, did you activate that? Following are the steps which you can take (Provided you had activated it earlier)
<br />
<br />1. First try to repair your installation - First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. You may have 2 MS Offices installed on your system
<br />A. Run Easy Fix tool to remove previous version - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />B. Perform Online Repair of new Office. Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Try Activation Troubleshooter and other troubleshooting steps
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Unlicensed-Product-and-activation-errors-in-Office-0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Unlice...</a>
<br />
<br />4. Try to activate through telephone
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/-Telephone-activation-is-no-longer-supported-for-your-product-error-when-activating-Office-9b016cd2-0811-4cb3-b896-5a6a13177713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/-Telep...</a>
<br />
<br />5. Talk to support
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/...</a> (Click on the starting alphabet of country name. Hence for US, click U)
<br />
<br />6. You may try chatting with MS Support to resolve this issue

            MS pays builders like Lenvo to install "free trials" of Office 365 on new computers.  You have to BUY a product key to activate it.

<br />Check out the wiki I go into more detail outlining these options:
<br />‚Ä¢	Stand alone Office Programs
<br />‚Ä¢	Office 2016 Home and Student
<br />‚Ä¢	Office 365 Home / Personal / University
<br />‚Ä¢	Office 2016 Home and Business
<br />‚Ä¢	Business Office 365, several possible bundles
<br />‚Ä¢	‚ÄúOffice in the Windows Store‚Äù aka Office Hub
<br />‚Ä¢	MS Office Online
<br />‚Ä¢	Non Profit license
<br />‚Ä¢	WordPad
<br />‚Ä¢	Works 9.0 
<br />‚Ä¢	Free/low cost Office Alternatives
<br />‚Ä¢	Where can I buy Office product keys
<br />
<br />You will have to decide for yourself. You can to trade off long term cost and features If your needs are very simple, you won‚Äôt need to spend much or work with one of the free options. But if you are a more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù user, using multiple Office applications and sharing documents/files with others you will have to pay for one of the Office 365/2016 bundles.   
<br />
<br />**********************************************
<br />
<br />Some builders, include the price of an Office 365 Personal Subscription in the price of their new computers.  If you have that kind of a deal, you have to activate it in a specific way.

<h2>            Controlling Word2007 from Excel2007 </h2>
                    
<p>I been struggling with this for several days now , read all I can find searching the web. MrExcel had good info, MS Help and Object browser did not help much. I tend to think it has to be a syntax problem.</p>
<p>I&nbsp; am exporting an excel list into word , doing a mail merge and printing daily reports for field use.</p>
<p>1. the excel macro runs without word</p>
<p>2. the word macro runs without excel</p>
<p>3. when I add in the va code to start word from excel (word has a macro that auto starts when the doc opens and does the mail&nbsp; merge.) I can not get control back to excel without the debugger starting.</p>
<p>in excel after word runs the code stops at</p>
<p>.Documents.Open ("c:\docs\Inspection_Report_browser_Merge2008_Fields.doc")</p>
<p>with the note it cant open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; document, but it has and printed my mail merge</p>
<p>in Word I get a comiple error "cant find resource library" (I have checked the office 12 library, the excel lib, etc.) @&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why don't you include&nbsp;the Microsoft word 12.0 object library (MSWORD.OLB) and you use word by excel? It's more easy and you can control when you want to open word, when you close it (so you can get control back to excel), you can write in word or read it,
 etc.</p>

<h2>            Using the pen tool to write a signature</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my work I have to make a report then get the customer I am working at on the day to sign it off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is the signature field on the report is very small so using a pen and the pen tool makes the signature to big to fit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to make a box pop up that they draw into, click OK then that automatically sizes the signature they have drawn so that it fits into the little signature field on my report?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>            Insert caption display box appears very small</h2>
                    When inserting a caption to a figure in Word 2016 using "insert caption", the display field in the pop-up box is almost illegibly small. How do I correct this? (I am using a Surface Pro 4, and it was the same with my Surface Pro 3, but not with other laptops
 in our office).

            <p>If you start Word in Safe mode, for the purpose of troubleshooting, then what do you see?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how to start in that mode: Exit Word if it is currently running. Hold the Windows logo key as you restart Word, and click yes when asked about Safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Safe mode works, that points to three causes of trouble, which you can investigate in order: (1) a faulty add-in interfering with Word's normal operation, (2) a damaged Normal template, or (3) corrupt registry entries for Word. For more on troubleshooting
 add-ins, renaming the Normal template and deleting registry entries, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/921541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Since the Caption dialog box displays a preview (or tries to display a preview) of the caption as it will appear in the document, the "problems" depicted in those screen shots could be fixed by modifying the Caption style.

<p>Here is a screenshot of the problem. The field stays very narrow even when I set caption style at 16.</p>
<p>I had the same problem with my Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>I haven't replaced the registry yet. Perhaps this will be my next step.</p>

    <title>Outlook automatically attach file, but file is hidden - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook automatically attach file, but file is hidden</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Outlook display emails with the 'clip' symbol. This means there is a file attached to the email. However, when I open it, there is no file attached. There should be a hidden file attached, probably the email signature logo.<br />
<br />
However, Outlook registry is set to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Options\Mail SendPicturesWithDocument=0 (=do not send). This would block sending emails with the signature logo attached to it.<br />
<br />
I need help to avoid Outlook to automatically attach those hidden files. The Outlook rules redirect all emails with attachments to our accountancy, and they are receiving those emails with hidden attachments.This is disrupting their service.<br />
<br />
Any advice is welcome,<br />
<br />

<p>Hi ITM,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your details. I don't think the paperclip is related to email signature. It might be a client issue. For further assistance, please go to Outlook Web App and check whether you can still find the paperclip icon. Besides, please contact the mail
 recipients and check whether they can find the paperclip or attachment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, please provide the followings for further assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Please let us know your detailed version and build of Outlook.&nbsp;</li><li>If you think the issue is related to your signature, you can create an email without signature and check it.&nbsp;</li><li>May I know if the issue occurs on every emails?&nbsp;</li><li>Please choose the email and click Forward, check whether you can find the attachment.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>

<h3> nick robbins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activating Office 365 on Acer Aspire Switch 10 with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased an Acer Aspire Switch 10 (from Acer) with Office. The sticker on the hardware indicates it includes Office, and there is a link to Office in the start menu. When I click that link, a splash screen appears with the message: "This device
 includes Office 365. Click Activate to get started. This limited-time offer must be redeemed by Thursday, August 20, 2015."</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this I conclude that I am supposed to have Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I click "Activate" and log-in with my Microsoft account as instructed, the Office website states that Office isn't associated with my account. Fair enough. It says "If you have Office but haven‚Äôt activated it, you can use your product key to
 activate. <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=396364&amp;clcid=0x409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Activate Office now</span></a>"&nbsp;So I click the link to "Activate Office now" and am redirected to a page that says "Thank you for purchasing Office. Please click the ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù button below and sign into, or create your Microsoft
 account to begin installing Office and accessing your new services."</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this I conclude that I should be able to Activate the copy of Office included with my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on clicking "Get Started" I'm simply re-directed back to the original page that says it's not associated with my account. I know it's not associated with my Microsoft account, that's *why* I bought a computer with Office included!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is how do I activate the copy of Office 365 included with my computer?</p>

<p>If your summary information is correct there is nothing you can do to deactivate your 2007 license from the MS activation system.&nbsp;&nbsp; All you can do is uninstall from the old computer to free up the "install count".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then ou can install and activate on the new computer. If you get an error about too many installs you have to switch to a Phone activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If phone activation does not work you are in trouble. MS no longer provides support for 2007 so you will have no other recourse.&nbsp; You could try another phone activation, but then wait until they offer you the option of talking to a live service rep.&nbsp; They
 may help you. They are more likely to say they no longer support 2007 ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry. MS is doing everything it can to "encourage" you to buy a new license.&nbsp; If you still prefer one-time payment licenses to pay forever subscriptions you may want to hold off for a short while</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<strong><span>Office 2019 Free Upgrade Offer Option</span></strong>
<p>MS wants us to switch to 365 away from the 1-time payment licenses.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They made a number of changes to the license terms to make 365 a better deal for some people. But for others, one-time payment licenses are still better.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS has announced that 2019 will be released "some time second half this year". Well we are there, now! The specific date is still unknown. In the past, when they finally got around to announcing the general availability release date they
 also had a ‚Äúfree upgrade offer‚Äù to keep money coming in during the last couple of months. In the past the offer was buy the current Office during the ‚Äúqualifying period‚Äù and you will get a ‚Äúfree upgrade‚Äù to equivalent bundle of the new release of Office. Long
 ago there was an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù license that depended on and replaced the older version, but MS discontinued that "upgrade" type license in 2010. So if we are lucky the "free upgrade" will give you a standalone license for 2019.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That would give you both the 2016 and 2019 licenses continuing to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you make due with the Online version of Outlook till that offer is made? If not you could get the monthly subscription to 365 until the offer is made.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also get a free 30 day evaluation of 2016 Pro from technet:

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>that may be just enough time to get to the offer.</p>

<h2>            Word 2010 - &#39;not responding&#39;errors and freezing</h2>
                    <p>I have successfully installed Office 2010 (Home and Student).&nbsp; However, I keep getting 'not responding'errors when trying to use Word 2010 ie edit a word document.&nbsp; Excel and Powerpoint 2010 work fine but each time I use Word 2010 it keeps freezing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling as well as the repair option via the control plan. Makes no difference.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Have installed this product (licenced for 3 computer) on other computers and word 2010 works fine.</p>
<p>Reading previous posts I believe this is a problem with Word 2010.&nbsp; However before&nbsp;I go back to installing Office 2007 and using Word 2007 (which was working fine on this computer before installing 2010) if I cannot fix, I wanted to see whether you can help.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<h2>            How to install maps on Nokia 6303 classic</h2>
                    
<p>I recently formatted my memory card and now want to re-install the maps application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've downloaded and installed Nokia Ovi Suite 2.0.2.42 but when I click into maps I get the message...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Cannot find maps or voice guidance files in your device. This is due to either of the following reasons: - Your device does not support the Nokia Maps application. - The maps and voice guidance files in your device are corrupted."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've followed the instructions in the help file (below) but still no joy in getting the maps app installed...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you see a notification in Nokia Ovi Suite Maps that your device's maps or voice guidance files may have been corrupted, switch the device's USB mode to the mass storage USB mode. Then, from your device's &nbsp;memory card, look for a folder named
<span><strong>Cities</strong></span> and a file named <span><strong>qf</strong></span>, and delete them. After that, switch back to the PC Suite USB mode. Refer to the user guide of your device for more detailed information on selecting or changing the USB

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone offer any advice on how to get maps installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>Hi lucasreece</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have formatted memory card you need to run the Nokia Maps application at least once again to define folder structure on it required by Nokia Maploader application on your PC prior to download of regional maps again. You don't say but presumably this
 is the 1Gb supplied card which contains regional maps and voice guidance files. If you want to copy contents of 1Gb card to a larger one remember to enable "Show hidden &amp; System files" on your PC first.</p>

<p>..and installed on you PC...</p>
<p>Click on the small Phone Icon in the bottom - left window of the OVI Suite.. after some time it should show you the list of maps installed on your phone, if there is any.. Else click in the top window and wait for server connection.. then select to download
 / install required maps data..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW for getting your position you will need to connect External Bluetooth&nbsp;GPS receiver..as your phone is NOT equipped with one..</p>

<p>Good question as early versions of Nokia Maps required you to use "Mass storage" mode to recognise memory card whereas later used "PC Suite " mode. Pretty sure that OVI Suite will throw up connected in incompatible mode if you connect as "Mass storage"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all else fails have a look at post by ovikovi for direct download of maps here:</p>
<p>/t5/Maps-Navigation-and-GPS/New-Ovi-Maps-version-0-1-24-114-are-out/m-p/686235/highlight/true#M23097</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might also be worth trying OVI Suite 3.0 Beta from Nokia Beta Labs (sign in wth Nokia ID &amp; password) here:</p>

<h2>            Sound alert with incoming mail - not working correctly</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Outlook email account on Microsoft Exchange Server that I have synchronised with my Outlook 2007 desktop application. I have set up the Windows default sound alert that notifies me of incoming mail and it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7b563b4-02c5-4441-bfa7-c77977703767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7b563b4-02c5-4441-bfa7-c77977703767" /></a></p>
<p>Windows comes with various other sound files in&nbsp;C | Windows | Media, but I am not able to get Outlook 2007 to use any of them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Windows | Media and check the different .wav files that Windows/Outlook uses they all work audibly, so why won't<br />
Outlook 2007 work with any of them other than the default?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another account, too, an IMAP account and, despite using exactly the same Outlook 2007 configured application, no<br />
sound is played at all when mail arrives. Why is that, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Further to my recent email above, this is what I have done so far: in Outlook 2007, I click on Tools | Rules and Alerts, and select New Rule. Then I go to the Stay Up to Date section and select Play a sound when I get messages from someone, and then I click
 on the sound link. I browse to my desired .wav sound file, select the file and click the Open button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am in the 'Rules Wizard' dialogue-box and click Next or Finish, I am told I must set a value:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e838c68e-feb0-45ad-8cf3-fb054ed0252d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e838c68e-feb0-45ad-8cf3-fb054ed0252d" /></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I click on the get the 'people or distribution list link' in Step 2 of the Rules Wizard and get this 'Rule Address':</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8543bdda-425a-4be3-9cf6-778db6573066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8543bdda-425a-4be3-9cf6-778db6573066" /></a></p>

</p><p>What do I do now please?</p>

</p><p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the advice given in the link: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-the-sound-played-when-an-email-message-arrives-aab2eed4-1005-4587-947d-813b6a2f6735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for providing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 with Outlook 2007 doesn't follow precisely the same structure as the examples given in the link, but I manage to get to the Sounds tab and see this.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I select New Mail Notification and then my preferred sound (mail2.wav). I test it and it's fine. I then open Outlook 2007, but when I send an email from a different email account to the one I aim hoping to play my own sound file in (my mail2.wav file), I
 only get the standard sound and not mail2.wav when the incoming mail arrives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again!</p>

            I've found that 95%+ of&nbsp;Outlook freeze-ups are caused by either a minor corruption in the Outlook.pst files or an anti-virus add-in conflict.
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test-run&nbsp;Outlook in Safe Mode</strong></p>
<p>Close Outlook then click<em> Start</em> (or tap the<em> Windows key</em>) and <em>
type outlook /safe</em> into the<em> Search programs and files</em> text box and hit<em> &lt;enter&gt;</em>. This mode of operation disables add-ins. Is Outlook responding normally?</p>
<p><strong>Disabling or Removing Add-ins from Outlook</strong></p>
<p>Close Outlook then click<em> Start</em> (or tap the<em> Windows key</em>) and paste this into the<em> Search programs and files</em> text box,</p>

<p>... then hit<em> &lt;enter&gt;</em>. Locate<em> Outlook.exe</em> in this folder and right click it then select<em> Run as administrator</em>. You should now have no problem disabling add-ins from the<em> Tools, Trust Center, Add-ins, Manage: COM Add=ins</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Running SCANPST on Outlook.pst</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;Between that test and those two procedures, your Outlook should start running reliably.</p>

<h2>            Changes Reappear after Accepting All Changes and Saving a Document in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>I have several documents on which I have collaborated with a colleague external to my company. When we make changes to the document we have Track Changes turned on.&nbsp; When I attempt to finalize the documents by&nbsp;selecting Accept All Changes in the Document,&nbsp;saving
 the document, and turning the Track Changes feature off, when I close and reopen the documents,&nbsp;Track Changes is&nbsp;turned back on and the accepted changes reappear/resurrect as though I never accepted them.&nbsp;
<strong>HELP</strong>.&nbsp; What would cause this to occur and what can I do to prevent this from happening anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked a few places on the net&nbsp;that said that some documents created&nbsp;in 97-2003&nbsp;Word format may have this problem.&nbsp; However, the documents of&nbsp;which I write are .docx documents&nbsp;created in either&nbsp;Word 2010 or Word 2007.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>After you have accepted all changes and turned off the tracking, try making a minor edit, such as adding a character and deleting it. Does Word then let you save properly? (You shouldn't have to do this, but it is worth a try.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next step, if you find that you can't save any edits at all, is troubleshooting for poorly designed add-ins. See the sections that refer to Startup and COM add-ins in the article at

    <title>Fractions changing size&#47;cannot get large fractions consistently - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gdw13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fractions changing size&#47;cannot get large fractions consistently</h2>
                    I just started using OneNote and am using it to do my math homework. &nbsp;I somehow was able to get large fractions (i.e. with text the same size as the non-fraction part of the equation). &nbsp;I was using Alt = to start an equation and then selected the fraction
 dropdown and chose stacked fraction (not small fraction). &nbsp;I repeated this for a number of equations (all with the desired fraction size) but suddenly on a new equation when I performed the same steps I got a small fraction and am now unable to create any
 of the large fractions that I was getting before. &nbsp;I tried deleting back to the previous equation and starting over but still got the same results. &nbsp;I even tried copying and pasting on of the large fractions into an empty space at the end of the document and
 it still converts it to a small fraction. &nbsp;I also thought that I was going to be able to create a large fraction on one of my attempts (I don't remember what I did differently) as the characters were normal size as I was typing them. &nbsp;Unfortunately, once I
 finished the equation and continued typing past it it automatically converted it to small characters.

Create a new page or a notebook, add the equation and check if the small equation is inserted.<br />

            Symbols are included in fonts.&nbsp; The one with the most symbols is Arial Unicode, but it is an older font and does not include symbols from the later versions of Unicode.&nbsp; Cambria Math has some of the newer symbols, particularly those that are math related.&nbsp;
 If you know the name of the symbol want, you can do a web search for it and together with the word "Unicode" to find its character code.&nbsp; Once that's known you can check to see whether any of the fonts you have installed in Word has the symbol.<br />
<br />
If the symbol is a newer one, you may need to buy or anyway obtain a font that has it or them.

<p>Is there a way to remove the 28000 BCM contacts whilst leaving his original contact list.</p>
<p>I had tried looking at previous version for the ost file would have worked if only it was there! All other files except that! (tested on mine resolved the issue in 5 mins)</p>

            <p>Just going to throw this out as an option in the event it's of any interest - not a free option but may be faster then the available alternatives.</p>
<p>ContactGenie QuickPort has a "Delete Matched" import option that essentially will delete contact items from a contact folder that can be matched to an input data source which in essence is an extension to Daniel's reply.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;short, export the BCM contacts to a CSV file as suggested and then import it via QuickPort using the "delete matched" import mode. The caveat is that you will need to identify one or more "key fields" that can be used to macth items in the CSV file against
 the Outlook file (i.e. email address, first/last name, coname etc - whatever combination of fields work) but that would also require that none of the regular (non BCM)&nbsp;contacts would match those found in the CSV file.</p>

<a href="http://www.contactgenie.com/quickport_4_outlook.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.contactgenie.com/quickport_4_outlook.htm</a></p>
<p>However you clean out the contacts folder, to state what may be obvious, you'll need to make sure that the contacts on the&nbsp;phone don't get sync'd back to the contact folder.</p>

<h2>            Howto stop wm6.1 from killing processes</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, so it's a well-known fact that windows mobile tries to be helpful and kill processes when memory is getting low.&nbsp; I need to know how to make this stop.&nbsp; It's great for regular processes or whatever but when it's killing the UI installed on the phone
 it's a nuisance.&nbsp; On a windows mobile phone with 64mb total we have very little to work with after the OS is loaded but it's still killing apps with 15+mb free...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you stop windows mobile from killing apps and/or how do you set a priority on certain processes so they won't get killed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            How to fix crash when right-clicking the Favorites Bar foler&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have run into a nasty bug in IE9: </p>
<p>I want to reorganize and clean up my Favorites Bar, specifically I want to create a few subfolders and move certain bookmarks into these folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when I go into&nbsp;Favorites =&gt; "Organize favorites..." and then right click on the "Favorites Bar" folder then IE9 immediately and reproducibly crashes on me.</p>
<p>So, in short, I&nbsp;can not open the context menu on Favorites Bar any more from within IE9 :-(&nbsp; How do I overcome or fix this?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to go into my home directory =&gt; Favorites =&gt; Favorites Bar and create a subfolder there, so at least there is a work around, but I would prefer to be able to do this right from the browser&nbsp;as its supposed to be...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you make any software changes on your computer recently?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When did the issue start?</p>
<p>Let us give the steps mentioned a try and check.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the Internet Explorer performance ‚Äúfixit‚Äù and check.</p>

<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p><b><span>To run in No Add-on mode follow the steps below ‚Äì</span></b></p>
<p><span>a. Click ‚ÄúStart‚Äù, and then type ‚Äú<b>Internet Explorer</b>‚Äù in the Start ‚Äú<b>Search box</b>‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click
<b>Internet Explorer (No Add-On).</b> Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Test Internet Explorer to verify if you are able to add folder to favorites.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<span>Reset

<b><span>Note:

    <title>Word dictionary overriding custom dictionary - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word dictionary overriding custom dictionary</h2>
                    Microsoft Word's dictionary insists that "internet" must be capitalized. I disagree, and added "internet" to my custom dictionary. Microsoft thinks it knows best and continues to call "internet" a misspelling. I write novels set in the modern world. The
 word "internet" appears often. I get scores of "internet" spelling errors per book. How can I fix this problem?<br />

            <p>Green line or red? &nbsp;If it's green, the hit is coming from the grammar checker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, right-click the word and choose "ignore all". &nbsp;That will fix that document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no way to fix the standard dictionary, sorry. &nbsp;The Exclusion Dictionary mechanism is supposed to work, but I don't think it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it did, you would make an exclusion dictionary entry to disable "internet" from the Word dictionary so your custom dictionary would take precedence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, it "might" work now. &nbsp;The instructions for creating a custom dictionary (of which the Exclude Dictionary is one kind) are here:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-a-custom-dictionary-in-Office-for-Mac-22ce4a39-c63b-41a3-903c-a6881c891ba7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-a-custom-dictionary-in-Office-for-Mac-22ce4a39-c63b-41a3-903c-a6881c891ba7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The principle is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an Exclude dictionary (save it as the type Exclude Dictionary).</li><li>Ad to it the words in the main dictionary that you do NOT want Word to look at. &nbsp;You cannot specify capitalisation (or rather, if you do, Word would exclude only the capitalised word, which will not be in the main dictionary because they are all lower-case,
 so it won't work).</li></ol>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            I am locked out of my email and I&#39;ve tried everything&#33; What do I do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am sick and tired of waiting! It has been 7 days now that I've tried to get my account recovered. I have filled out all the necessary forms with the stupid questions. I am not a damn hacker! I just want to be able to play this game that I used to play
 forever ago and my old email is attached to that game. I have spend years playing that game, so many hours put into my character and now it's all lost because I can't gain access to what is mine?! I needed to verify myself through email to play again but then
 I needed to get my email verified too! I filled out the forms, I filled out tickets, I called microsoft, I've spoken to &nbsp;10 agents on chat support, I've tried everything! Unfortunately my alternate email is an even older email that I haven't used in 8 years
 or so. The questions on the form that I filled out didn't help me any. I don't email anyone, I don't have a credit card attached, I don't have an Xbox. I just used the email to get onto my games. That's all. I have the correct password, correct first pet.
 Honestly this security thing is going too far. Yeah I've been hacked alright, by microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do at this point. I feel like it is a lost cause. Anything worth suggesting that I haven't already tried?</p>
