You probably should first check your backups - are they current?

    <title>Folders Properties show wrong numbers of files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stlsailor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folders Properties show wrong numbers of files</h2>
                    <p>I sync FOLDER1 on my desktop to FOLDER1 on my notebook using Windows Live Mesh. To ensure that everything works well, I check the numbers of files to be sure they match. They were off by several hundred files. Investigating this led me to the discovery that
 two machines report different numbers of files in the property of the folder, even when the number of files ia in fact identical. (In both cases I've set the folder options to show hidden files.) Both machines are running Windows 7 (Both show Version 6.1 Build
 7601 Service Pack 1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subfolder A on desktop has</p>
<ul>
<li>PROPERTIES shows 186 files, 7 folders.</li><li>Root directory actually has 102 files, 5 folders.</li><li>Subfolder A1 has 14 files.</li><li>Subfolder A2 has 20 files in one subfolder and 46 files in another.</li><li>Subfolder A3 has 3 files.</li><li>Subfolder A4 has 0 files.</li><li>Subfolder A5 has 0 files.</li><li>TOTAL ACTUAL = 102 + 14 + 20 + 46 + 3 = 185 files (in 7 folders). Where is the additional file?</li></ul>
<p>Subfolder A on the notebook is exactly identical, except that the properties show</p>
<ul>
<li>PROPERTIES shows 185 files, 7 folders.</li></ul>
<p>I checked the 7 subfolders, and the number of files showing on each system matches the other system, and matches what is actually present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, why is one machine reporting an extra file? <u>This is not an isolated incident. The cumulative effect is that on the desktop FOLDER1 shows 15,454 files and on the notebook it shows 15,177 files.</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would not be important except it makes it impossible to verify that Mesh synced properly, though in every specific instance I've checked so far the sync appears to be correct; only the desktop numbers are wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts as to why this might be occurring?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dale</p>

            <p>I initially began to post it there. Then I realized it wasn't a mesh question. The Windows properties shows different file numbers for two different folders with identical contents. As I thought about it, that appeared to be a Windows question; how the two
 folders got identical contents did not seem to be relevant. I decided if I posted there first, they'd simply send me to this forum, so why not start here?</p>

            I believe the problem is with hidden and/or system files, most often the Thumbs.db system files screw up a file size comparison (I believe they change size every time a folder is viewed/changed). &nbsp;This has been driving me crazy too!
<div><br />
<div>1. Go to (ALT to reveal pull down menus) Tools&gt;Folder options...</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Then select the View tab.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Check "Show hidden files, folders, and drives"</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. Uncheck "Hide extentions for known file types"</div>
<div><br />
<div>AND</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. Uncheck "Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)"</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. Now click Apply, or OK.</div>
<div><br />
<div>7. Next perform a search on the two folders for "*db". &nbsp;You will probably see a bunch of Thumbs.db files. &nbsp;You can delete them all, then&nbsp;perform&nbsp;your Properties&nbsp;comparison&nbsp;on the folders again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>File "Size" (not Size on disk) and number of files/folders should now match ensuring your folders are indeed in sync!</div>
<div><br />
<div>P.S. Also, be sure you are viewing file by "Details" to avoid the thumbnail files being regenerated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If anyone knows a better way to manage file/folder syncing between two drives, please let me know!</div>

            Although I must sync over the internet, I would be curioius why you'd recommend synctoy over Mesh for local syncing. I've not used synctoy.

            <p>I had already done steps 1-6 thinking that might be the problem. There were no thumbs files in the subfolders I used for comparison in the initial post, even after doing that. However I did run the search for *db to see if there were any thumbs files elsewhere.
 None. It was an appropriate suggestion, though.</p>

The crash took place in a standard Microsoft module. Your system configuration may be incorrect. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver on your system which cannot be identified at this time.

<p>Btw my OS is XP.</p>

<p><span>Hi BhavTrup,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Steps to Connect Laptop Computer to TV using S-Video Cable</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong><span>&nbsp;
</span>First, familiarize yourself with different S-Video cables that you can use to connect your laptop computer to TV. It also depends on what type of TV you will use… old CRT TV or Digital TV (HDTV).</span></span></p>
<p><span>A) S-Video cable – is a connector with 4-pin DIN (male) on both ends. Use this if your TV is digital. Take note that this cable is for
 video transmission only.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
B) S-Video to RCA cable – is a connector with 4-pin DIN (male) on one end and RCA on the other end. Use this cable if your TV is CRT type. Take note that this cable is also for video transmission only.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
C) S-Video to 3 RCA cable – has two connector on one end for 4-pin DIN (male) and Stereo Audio as the input and three RCA connector on the other end for Video and Audio output. This is the complete set that you would want to have if you want both Video and
 Audio to output from the TV. You can use this on both CRT type and HDTV.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
D) Mini-to-RCA cable – has mini jack on one end and two RCA connectors on the other end for audio transmission. Use this if you only have S-Video or S-Video to RCA cables.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cable connection</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now let’s start the connection. If your TV is CRT, you have to use either S-Video cable or S-Video to RCA cable because it does not have
 S-Video port. If you use S-Video cable, plug one end of the cable to S-Video port of your laptop and the RCA connector end to the RCA Video input of the TV. For the audio, use the mini-to-RCA cable to transmit the audio to your TV. You can also choose to use
 PC speakers if you have one. If you use S-Video to 3 RCA cable, then you have both Audio and Video outputted to your TV. Connect the S-Video connector to the port on your laptop as well as the mini jack for the Audio. The other end, which is the 3 RCA connectors,
 should be connected to your TV Audio and Video input.</span></p>
<p><span>If your TV is Digital or HDTV, you can use any of the three S-Video cables. Connect the cables in the same manner as the CRT TV. Only
 difference is you have the option to use S-Video cable because HDTV has S-Video port like your laptop computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 3: Switch your TV to AV or INPUT mode.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 4: Laptop video output</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>PC: Press Function (Fn) + Video Output (usually F4) key and your laptop LCD should now turn black and the output will display on TV.
 Now, some laptops have option to display the screen on both the laptop LCD and the TV (dual screen) so you need to press Video Output key twice while holding the Function (Fn) key to toggle. That’s it… now you can enjoy a widescreen experience watching movies
 on your laptop computers. When you are done, just press again Function (Fn) + Video Output to toggle the screen back to your laptop computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Trying these options as well:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Connecting it to another TV</span></p>
<p><span>2. Update the display drivers</span></p>
<p><span>3. Setting your display mode to a 16-bit color and check with different display resolutions. Then re-start display settings, and click
 Advanced. Set your TV as Primary and LCD as Secondary.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If the persists, I would also suggest contacting S-VIDEO for support and verify if they have any updates on this issue and
 if they can help to fix the same. <strong>S-Video Contact link: <a href="http://www.svideo.com/contact1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>Let me know if that does or does not work. Good luck!</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks and Regards,
</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 hangs while startup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 hangs while startup</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Inspiron 660s (desktop) that came with windows 8. It worked fine for a couple of years and then I decided to upgrade to windows 10 (partly as a result of all the reminders on IE - which yes I do use).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seemed to upgrade fine and I was able to work on it for a few hours with no major issues. Then I decided to shutdown the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when I start it, it just hangs with a blue screen and the dots going in circles in front. I've left it all night, but no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping to be able to get into the safe mode to try to troubleshoot but looks like F8 has been disabled and other options rely on me being able to get to the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once by some accident I did get into the safe mode (not sure the sequence of events that triggered it). I disabled all non-microsoft services/startup applications but didn't realize at the time there's not an easy way to invoke the safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Dell didn't come with any disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on what I can do? Really appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS: Here's what I've tried so far</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) F8, shift F8. Don't do anything</p>
<p>2) F2, F12: take me into the BIOS settings but doesn't seem to have any options that would help here (no safe mode). I tried the diagnostics, which ran a detailed test on hardware and came back with no issues.</p>
<p>3) Restarted my computer 4 times in a row to see if it would trigger the safe mode. It didn't.</p>
<p>4) Even with the blue screen and circling dots, I am able to press control alt delete and get this screen with windows icon, wifi icon, accessibility and a power icon. On the power icon, I tried the "shift" restart but that doesn't pull up the option to
 bootup in safe mode either.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi. I ended up making an installation USB using Windows 10 media creation tool (option - create installation media for another PC).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that the same as ISO method listed in your response?&nbsp;<span>I am assuming it is.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, when I try to boot from the installation USB, I get a message "It looks like you started an upgrade and booted from installation media. If you want to continue with the upgrade, remove the media from your PC and click Yes. If you want to perform
 a clean installation instead, click No".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not keen on a fresh installation, primarily because I believe that will remove my ability to go back to previous windows version if I needed to (say my wife doesn't like windows 10).</p>
<p><br />

            <p>It turns out my installation USB was fine. I did choose clean installation and after a click or two arrived at the "repair your computer". Finally "startup repair" (not automatic repair). It ran for a few minutes and gave me the message "startup repair couldn't
 repair your PC".</p>

            <p>In the spirit of desperation, I tried to do a fresh install. That gives me 2 options.</p>
<p>1) Upgrade</p>
<p>2) Custom</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade option ends with a message saying "The computer started using the windows installation media. Remove the installation media and restart your computer so that windows starts normally. Then, insert the installation media and restart the upgrade.
 [Do not select "custom (advanced)" to perform an upgrade. "custom (advanced)" installs a new copy of windows and deletes your programs and settings.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course the problem is that windows does not start normally. Which means I have no option but to do the "custom (advanced)" installation. Which in turn means</p>
<p>1) I lose all my files (I have years of family pictures)</p>
<p>2) I have to pay for a fresh copy of windows 10 which I didn't even really need in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions from anyone?</p>

            <p>In case anyone else ran into a similar issue, here's what I ended up doing</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Replaced my hard drive (I had a similar one sitting in another PC, but I would've bought one to retrieve my data if needed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Installed Windows 10 fresh on the new hard drive (after formatting). The license info is stored within the BIOS, so you don't have to worry about a product key etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Bought a hard drive docking station (I bought Sabrent USB 3.0 to SATA External Hard Drive Lay-Flat Docking Station at Amazon, but of course you can choose whatever you like)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Connected my old drive through USB to my computer and copied my data from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately turned out to be a very long winded upgrade to the operating system. If you happen to read this before you do the upgrade, please back-up your data before you try the upgrade and do a fresh install (I've read enough complaints online of issues
 similar to mine). Once you do have a functioning Windows 10, it's actually not bad.</p>

            Hi BengtSjöberg1 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1903 is the latest Windows. You should upgrade to 1903 through Media creation tool. Execute the below steps to go to 1903 
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)
<br />
<br />(Source - <a href="https://partnersupport.microsoft.com/en-us/par_clientsol/forum/par_win/failed-to-install-windows-10-1709/43d49f22-cb29-4eec-9079-ea68039acb8f?auth=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partnersupport.microsoft.com/en-us/par_...</a>)
<br />
<br />3. A. Take a backup of your computer before you proceed.
<br />B. Disable any third party Antivirus (After update is successful, you can enable it again)
<br />C. You can go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You can download the latest Windows 10 package from this link (media creation tool) and follow the instructions there to upgrade. Use the very simple instructions given under Using this tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Bengt, version 1903 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<h2>            Essentio M51AC &#38; Windows 7</h2>
                    I have removed Windows 8 x64 and installed Windows 7 x32 bit on my Essentio M51AC but can not seem to make the USB ports work.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am still missing the PCI controller, and usb device drivers. &nbsp;Has anyone had any experience downgrading on this machine?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have searched for the Windows 7 x32 drivers at the ASUS site with no luck. The generic Windows 7 drivers did not work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have succesfully installed the chipset and LAN drivers.</div>
                </div>

<div>As usual (as with many companies), Asus' automated or manual 'selection tool' did not show any drivers for windows 7 on this model. No one else out there seemed to have them until many jeopardy-ish word search changes in google. I ran across this site

<h2>            State of Decay 2 - Install button Greyed out</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I bought SOD2 through the store and originally I could download and install it. But since the new windows update I am unable to. I have had to revert back to the previous windows as the new windows update just leaves me with a black screen and I can't
 do anything at all, I've tried to fix that problem but I think the update just needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if theres a way I can download and install it without having to update. When I view my library it says that SOD2 can not run on this device as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>
<p>(also are you able to copy games from the Microsoft store from one computer to another?)</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

            Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />

<br />You can block upgrading to Windows 10 1803 if that is whats producing the black screen.

            I'm currently using 1607, only reason I haven't updated is because I physically can't as all I get is the black screen. I did make some progress and got a black screen with a cursor, and when I hit&nbsp; win+P to check the projection I could see a blue project

            I am going to recommend you upgrade to Windows 10 1703.

<p>You don't want an "86-bit processor" (even if such a thing existed).&nbsp; Typically, "x86" means the Intel-type 32-bit processors that have been around for years (although the original Intel 8086 was a 16-bit processor).&nbsp; The designation is used to distinguish
 the newer 64-bit processors (sometimes designated "x64").</p>
<p>The printer/scanner you have (care to identify it?) will almost certainly work on your version of Windows (care to identify that, too?).</p>

<p>my 32GB / 2GB RAM windows 10 TABLET WILL NOT GIVE ME THE OPTION to attach an external drive to complete the 'Creators update'..I have deleted all unnecessary files and used disk cleanup...There's approx. 5GB available on the internal drive...the tablet runs
 very smoothly on the current Win 10 installation...I have an extra16 GB SD drive installed in the tablet AND a 32GB external USB connected with an OTB cable. Neither drive is shown as an option for the update. Why?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Viewing from your description, the lack of storage disk space would definitely stop the Windows Update from installing the update properly. Note that the update should be installed internally where the Windows 10 operating system is installed. So, in this
 case, instead of updating your computer, we suggest that you perform a clean installation of Windows 10 version 1709. This will include all the latest Windows 10 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reference to this, please click this article: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-install-windows-10-on-devices-with-limited/d933c129-c54b-4e40-aa4e-9813c59814af?auth=1">

<p>
</p><p>The issue most people have referenced in comments to this post is that Win 10 devices with limited hard drive capacity are not able to install the forced Win 10 updates due to lack of space and inability to select an external storage drive...</p>

<p>Thank you for the quick response. Another method that you can try is to use an external storage device. This procedure is applicable to devices that have less than 50 GB of total capacity on its hard drive. You can find the steps on how to implement this
 on your system from this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4013876/windows-10-freeing-up-space-to-install-latest-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Free up space to install the latest Windows 10 update">support article</a></strong>.
 Select the option: <em>I want to use external storage instead</em>.</p>

Can you please fix this, so me and my fellow players can finally play online again.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            microsoft windows search protocol host pop ups and interfering with my email attachments</h2>
                    I have been receiving bank statements as password protected .pdf files by email for several years. &nbsp;At the beginning of January 2012 something happened within my computer which allowed me to open the statements, save the .pdf to my documents, but when
 the original .pdf was closed and then re-opened from the attachment, the statement had been deleted and replaced by the previous statement sent in December 2011. &nbsp;This has now continued with every statement received since. &nbsp;I have monthly emails attaching
 the statement, but when the statement is opened, closed and subsequently re-opened it is dated 30.12.2011.

<div>I have Kaspersky Pure Anti virus protection on my computer and have scanned all drives several times, even in safe mode and no virus has been found. &nbsp;I also run Speedy Pro PC to check for malware, etc. &nbsp;Since the problem started with my .pdf statements
 I have been receiving intermittent pop-ups saying that it was checking password protected statement from "my Bank". &nbsp;It pops up and down so quickly I have difficulty in catching it to read, but yesterday managed to click on it which opened the dialogue box
 for Microsoft Windows Search Protocol Host. &nbsp;What is this and do I need it? &nbsp;Have checked the response to other questions relating to this program and looked to uninstal it as suggested. &nbsp;I cannot find it in my Programs in Control Panel.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also checked Kaspersky for any notifications and found a repeatedly reported event as follows:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Time: .... &nbsp;<span> </span>Result: &nbsp;Processing error<span>
</span>Object: &nbsp;C:\SEXTEND\SReparse:SRSINDEX_ALLOCATION<span>
</span>Reason: &nbsp;Read Error<span>
</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Application: &nbsp;InfoWatch CryptoStorage Protected Objects controller service.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can you advise:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1.<span> </span>Are these things related?</div>
<div>2.<span> </span>Is the pop-up containing the Microsoft Windows Search Protocol Host related to the problem with the email attachments?</div>
<div>3.<span> </span>Is the error message in Kaspersky re InfoWatch CryptoStorage Protected Objects controller service related to the email attachment problem?</div>
<div>4.<span> </span>Can I remove the Microsoft Windows Search Protocol Host? &nbsp;If so, how? or what does it do that I should keep it?</div>
<div>5.&nbsp;<span> </span>Will its removal stop the pop up appearing?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated as this is becoming very frustrating, particularly if I forget to save the .pdf attachment to the email before closing it and then lose the statement.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />

            <p>I can't help with your problem, but I can make a few comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kaspersky&nbsp;produce a reputable anti-virus program. Like all anti-virus software, it has to be invasive to ensure that malicious code doesn't insinuate itself into the deeper reaches of Windows. However, I'm not sure what other functions your Kaspersky software
 is carrying out, but they might well be interfering with the proper functioning of Windows Live Mail.</li><li>Programs like SpeedyPC Pro are in the opinion of many Windows security experts to be avoided at all cost.&nbsp;They are just as likely to cause harm as do good.</li><li>You didn't say what the SearchProtocolHost dialogue said. This program is an essential part of Windows Search, passing files to be indexed to the right protocol handler for the particular file type. This makes it possible, for example, to use the search
 box to find mail messages from a particular sender. Because it's part of Windows, you can't remove it.</li><li>An attachment to a mail message is simply a bunch of code at the end of the message itself. It doesn't become a file until you save it. No program&nbsp;will&nbsp;alter mail messages in the way you describe, so it's not at all clear what behaviour you're seeing. When
 you save an attachment, you&nbsp;have the opportunity to give it a file name. For bank statements, this could be something like Statement-2012-12.pdf for the December one.
<br />
If the sender has included a filename with the attachment (it's not required, so there might not be one), this will be shown in the message header bar in Windows Live Mail. Is it always the same?
</li><li>It sounds as if Kaspersky is&nbsp;worried about these password-protected PDFs and is salting them away somewhere rather than allowing them to be stored in Temporary Internet Files, as they would be normally when you open them direct from within Windows Live
 Mail. It is then delivering the wrong one when Windows calls up your PDF reader to open the file.</li></ol>

            Thanks for your reply, which I have read with interest as I am now beginning to think that the problem may be more connected with Kaspersky than Microsoft.
<div><br />
<div>I ran a repair on Microsoft Essentials 2012 as suggested but nothing seems to have changed. However, the Kaspersky "pop up" appeared again and when I clicked it, this time it opened Windows Explorer and there was a tab showing the listed events, detailing
 every time a process started and then the process stopped.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The emails with the statements have a different subject line each time but the attachment is always named estatement "date".pdf, thus possibly your point 5 might be the right answer. &nbsp;I will try to contact Kaspersky for their input.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again.</div>

            Hi Red, 
<br />
<br />What kind of scanner software do you use?  Is it an Epson's software or are you using a third party app to scan documents? Please follow this guideline: 
<br />
<br />Install your printer’s software and the latest drivers from your printer manufacturer’s website because the options offered in Page Setup are provided by the driver software for the printer installed.
<br />Epson WorkForce WF-7510: <a href="https://epson.com/Support/Printers/All-In-Ones/WorkForce-Series/Epson-WorkForce-WF-7510/s/SPT_C11CA96201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://epson.com/Support/Printers/All-In-Ones/...</a>
<br />Follow the steps to uninstall Product Software:
<br />1 Turn off the product and disconnect any interface cables.
<br />2 Click on ‘Windows + R’ keys together to open the Run box.
<br />3 Type in the following command into the Run box:
<br /> appwiz.cpl
<br />4 Uninstall the EPSON Printer Software, EPSON Event manager and EPSON Scan.
<br />5 Restart your laptop and reinstall the printer software from the manufacturer’s website.
<br />
<br />Write me back if it works or not. 
<br />
<br />Thanks, 
<br />Andrew N.

    <title>How to set Username to something other than email account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to set Username to something other than email account</h2>
                    When querying the Task Manager, my user name seems to be my email account, is there a way to have a user name that is an alias for this, such as the name listed on the lock screen, so that when I reset TrustedInstaller protocals on folders I don't have
 to enter my email address but can use the name that appears at the sign-in screen. &nbsp;Having an email address as a user-name just doesn't seem right.

            yes, you are going want to create a new user, A local user with admin privileges. you can go to computer management under user create a new user and then go in the setting of windows and change it to admin rights then you will have a local admin with no
 email associated, &nbsp;

<h2>            2&#47;16&#47;2012 Update bricked my 360-S</h2>
                    
<p>Setup: XBOX 360-Slim 4gig, Ethernet, Kinect</p>
<p>Last night, I received the mandatory update message and accepted the update.</p>
<p>After it downloaded (and maybe installed) the 360 performed the typical restart.</p>
<p><strong>My 360 is now freezing at the 360 splash screen and if I have the Kinect plugged in, it gives me some message indicating that the Kinect hardware requires an update and that I need to go to xbox.com/update for more information.</strong></p>
<p>I have since unplugged the kinect hardware to see if this improves things but it doesn't, it simply doesn't pop up the above message but remains frozen on the splash screen.</p>
<p>So now... after downloading the update... my xbox 360 is bricked and has the following symptoms.</p>
<p>1. When I power the 360 on, it hangs at the 360 splash screen.<br />
2. With the Kinect plugged in, I receive a message indicating that an update is required for my Kinect hardware.<br />
3. While the 360 is hung up, I can hit the XBOX button on the remote but all commands other than 'shut down' freeze the blades.<br />
4. I have tried the 'power off and wait 5 minutes for reset' method but no luck.<br />
5. I have restarted the XBOX in every possible combination of ethernet and Kinect operations I can think of.</p>
<p>XBOX chat support indicated that this will be fixed by Saturday. Not optimistic.</p>

<p>Well.. i'm still out of luck. Even went with runnig the update via a USB stick. I will say this, as a developer, I smell a big fat freaking bug here. If I ever told one of my end users, who just updated software and had their system go down, IT WASN'T THE
 UPDATE, they would look at me as if I had 2 heads. MSFT... I'm looking at you as if you had 2 big fat freaking heads!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>The only feedback I've gotten from support has been "give us money and we'll fix it." Absolutely no mention of the fact that my system was working perfectly up to the moment I updated. No accountability whatsoever. Just form email after form email inviting
 me to give them $110 to get it working again. </p>

<p>I was given the same support, give us money and we'll fix it. They swear up and down that the update could not have caused any of my problems.

<p>It has to be the update, the developers are [mod removed]&nbsp;if they don't think it is a problem in the update.</p>
<p>A day after the update is recieved my console seems to have the power of a calculator. The splash screen is hanging for 10mins before I even get on the dashboard, then I cannot play a single game, DVD's do not work. The moment you go in to edit your avatar
 the fan speed goes crazy.</p>
<p>Before this, my system was completely stable. Nothing wrong, nothing what so ever. I like how they claim it was just a "fix." When your changing code, the slightest bug can have HUGE affects on systems. This is clearly a good example of one. Maybe I should
 bring it up with the Computing Lecturer at Uni? Make interesting conversation :)</p>
