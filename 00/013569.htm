            I'm afraid I'm not much help past that point. It sounds like you need to get into EUFI bios settings but that's out of my wheelhouse.&nbsp; Unless someone else chimes in, I think this is the point where I'd go to the MS Store and/or chat with them online from
 the <a href="http://surface.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://surface.com</a> support site.

    <title>Lost Office 2016 Product Key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raleighmartin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Office 2016 Product Key</h2>
                    <p>I have had Office 2016 Professional Plus installed on my laptop since late 2016 and I'm now going to change the HDD to SSD. I would like to do a clean install of Windows and Office but I have lost my Office Product Key. I was able to find the last five digits
 using Belarc but there seems to be no way to find the entire key. My issue is that I had an installation problem using the key that I got with my Office purchase and a MS support rep reinstalled Office remotely and used a different product key that I cannot
 find. I'm not sure the rep actually gave me the new key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue is that the installation that the MS rep did is not associated to my MS Account so I cannot reinstall by logging into my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get the full key?</p>

            Thanks. I just got off a chat session where the rep remoted in and tried everything I had told him I already tried, wasting almost an hour of my time, only to say he wouldn't be able to help me because he couldn't find the product key. He is apparently
 unaware that MS encrypts the Office 2016 key so that it's not able to be found using Belarc, ProduKey, etc.&nbsp;

<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and we are happy to assist you with this. We understand that your login credentials aren't saved from your phone. Could you verify if you configured your account through the phone's default mail app, or through our official
 Outlook.com app?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for our initial troubleshooting, we advise that you restart your device and try another Microsoft account to see if the issue will persist. We will also need the exact steps on how you configure your account from the phone.</p>

            I have had this problem on my iPhone for 6 months. &nbsp;It is very frustrating to find that work emails that I have sent from my phone have been sitting in my outbox because I didn't realize that the server had logged me out. &nbsp;My other two hotmail accounts
 never ever have this problem.&nbsp;

            You can't print the Navigation pane directly. As Stefan suggests, you could take screen shots. But if you just want the headings and page numbers, you could create a Table of Contents. See

    <title>Nokia Internet Radio - list of stations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kurtkaufman---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Internet Radio - list of stations</h2>
                    
<p>The Internet Radio app for s60.3.2 has a list, provided by a Nokia server, that can display stations by genre, country, etc. and can also be searched. It is<em><strong> VERY</strong></em> outdated (much more so than the corresponding database for podcast
 search) and I'm wondering if there might be an alternate service. If so, how does one access the URL for the radio search server?</p>

<p>I did some snooping around, and in a file called&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>irsettings.rsc</strong>, I found a reference to the address
<strong>idirectory.xgns.net</strong>, which is where the phone gets the list of stations. The resource (rsc) file doesn't seem to be modifiable in any way (that I would attempt). So the answer appears to be "you get what you get".</p>

<h2>            Someone is using my email for their facebook account</h2>
                    So the last two weeks I have been getting updates from a facebook account that is connected by my email. This account is not mine&nbsp;but I keep getting updates whenever somebody posts on her timeline etc. I don't want this because obviously it is not my account.
 How can I make sure she stops using my email for her account? The account has been there since 2009 as I checked her profile, but she has only started using my email for the last two weeks.

            <p>The best way to debug these problems is to simply comment out your error handler temporarily and when the error occurs choose to debug it and see what line of code Access returns as being problematic.&nbsp; Then go from there.

    <title>Lumia 920 camera issue - front-facing camera no longer works - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flauterfiddle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 920 camera issue - front-facing camera no longer works</h2>
                    
<p>I have the above issue. The front-facing camera was working on Friday but now no longer works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Precise description of the problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I press the Camera key on the phone.</p>
<p>2. I then tap the icon to switch the camera to the front-facing camera</p>
<p>3. The screen remains black (or goes black, if the rear camera was showing something)</p>
<p>4. In this state, none of the bottom icons work (all are frozen-out), although the top left arrow to go to the Gallery does work (i.e. I can tap it to go view my photos)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone experienced anything similar? I &nbsp;can't think of anything that might have affected it. The phone has not been dropped and has not been exposed to excessive moisture or anything.&nbsp;<span>The rear camera continues to work fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also haven't updated any apps AFAIK or installed any new ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firmware is 1232.5951.1249.1001 and I'm on Vodafone in Germany.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers for any suggestions. I guess I could try a hard reset once backing up my data, otherwise I'm mystified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ed</p>

<p>Update from me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Did a hard reset, restore phone settings, tested cam. Worked!</p>
<p>2. Then, after all apps had been restored and I was just finishing setting everything up, I tested the cam and it doesn't work again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it's clearly a software issue. No idea what, though. I have gone through all the settings again, carefully testing them and found nothing. I also deintalled every app I could (esp. e.g. Skype, WhatsApp, etc.) and tested the cam - FFC still doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I guess I will just have to wait for a firmware update to see if it fixes it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously annoying!</p>

                    I was unable to install windows 10 from win7 update cause disk was locked. I managed fix it and I performed a clean installation from an iso file&nbsp;burned&nbsp;in a dvd which was downloaded from another pc. After the setup of win10 finished I pointed that it
 has stored the product key of win10 of the pc that I used to burn the iso file. what can I do to activate my win10 as I deserve??!!

            Only way it will activate is by installing it from an active win7/8 that is running, if you did a clean install you will need to buy a key, you will need to reinstall your win7 and make sure it is activated then run the ISO by way of setup from the DVD
 to key the "free" upgrade

<h2>            15031 broke Internet and shutdown. 15042 too</h2>
                    <p>The PC in question is a Dell c521. Maybe this is another nForce problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, build 15031 installed fine, but my wifi stick (Netgear WNA1100, current driver) &nbsp;failed, reporting a possible driver error. I could see the router and enter a password, but could not establish a connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connecting via Ethernet failed too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could access properties for both kinds of connection, but could not change them; the cursor would simply spin forever. The usual remedies like ipconfig had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speaking of spinning forever, shutting down or restarting invariably hung up on the green screen. Power switch still worked, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reverted for now, but I can update again if anyone has suggestions.<br />

            Hi Russ,<br />
<br />
Correlation ID is not an error number or code. Simply, it's a GUID (globally unique identifier) that's automatically generated for every request that a website/server receives. We recommend resetting the Internet Options and see if it helps. Click this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17441/windows-internet-explorer-change-reset-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article

<br />
Keep us in the loop with the result.

                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've a 465 page document and I inserted page number in the header. I find that instead of page numbers do not appear on all the pages of the document. They stop at random after so many pages. Then I have insert them again and then it stops again. Does anyone
 know what is going on and how to fix this. I'm using Word 2010 Pro Plus.</p>

            Your description suggests your document has various Section breaks for which the headers have had the default&nbsp;'same as previous' attribute cancelled. If this was done before the page #s were inserted, they wouldn't appear from the start of those sections,
 onwards. Alternatively, if this was done after the page #s&nbsp;were inserted, it's possible the page #s were later deleted. Another possibility is that you copy/pasted content from another document and included Section breaks with the cancelled &nbsp;'same as previous'
 attribute.

            You are correct, pretty much each page of the document is a new section and 'same as previous' attribute cancelled for most of the section and I guess the page numbering stop every time it encounters 'same as previous' cancelled. As this is a 465 page
 long document, is there any way to fix this rather than going page by page.<br />

            If the document was imported from WordPerfect, it will probably have many more section breaks than needed. If there is no good reason for the breaks, you can delete them. You can search for
<strong>^b</strong> and replace with nothing to delete all of them (using <strong>
Replace All</strong>), which might be too drastic, but you could at least step through the document with Find Next to see which breaks could be removed without damage.

            <p>Another approach, which you can use in addition to Suzanne's, is to explicitly re-link all the headers and/or footers via a macro such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub LinkSections()<br />
Dim i As Long, HdFt As HeaderFooter<br />
With ActiveDocument<br />
&nbsp; For i = 2 To .Sections.Count<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With .Sections(i)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each HdFt In .Headers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HdFt.LinkToPrevious = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each HdFt In .Footers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HdFt.LinkToPrevious = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
End With<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your document has 'front matter' and you don't want to link that portion's headers and/or footers&nbsp;to the others, simply increment the '2' by however many Sections the front matter accounts for. If you only want to re-link headers, delete to footer loop,
 and vice-versa.</p>

<h2>            Word 2013 high cpu usage even when not editing or scrolling</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I am having a problem with Word 2013 on Win 7 x64, Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM. The problem is that Word uses approximately 20% cpu when it has focus but is idle (i.e. I've clicked in the Window but not typing). If Word does not have focus, it does not use
 any CPU time. This occurs for every document I've tried, including new blank documents with no text. If I start Word in safe mode (winword /safe from a Run window), Word uses approximately 2% CPU. I've tried repairing my Office 2013 installation, disabling
 all add-ins, disabling hardware acceleration, disabling sub-pixel rendering, and disabling animations through the widely available registry key hack, but none of these have solved the problem. Can anyone help with this issue?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

<p>I need to manually click on zoom and even after that it doesn't give the option to scroll on the page or move up and down. it just stays still after zooming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>atleast for our own profile, there should be option for saving pictures to mobile.</p>

Try this first in the frontend on the computer that is having issues.&nbsp; </p>

<p><br />
So, on the computer that this is an issue with, have you tried replacing the frontend with a copy from one of the computers that it does work on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it still does that, open the database on that machine having the problem, go to the VBA window and to TOOLS &gt; REFERENCES and see if any are marked as MISSING.</p>

<h2>            Small &#34;Frame&#34; Within Outlook Message Window</h2>
                    <p>This started happening a couple of days ago; when I open a message, rather than seeing the entire message, I see a "frame" with a large white area at the bottom (see image below), rather like an iframe in a Web page. Any idea how I stop this, it's very irritating?!</p>
<p>I'm also having a similar problem in Word (another image attached below).</p>

<h2>            Outlook login fails</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having issues with logging to my work mail account using Outlook. Login prompt appears , works for a moment and disappears, then appears again after a few secs. This loops until I manually close that prompt and cancel trying to log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching this forum, one suggestion was adding&nbsp;<span>DisableADALatopWAMOverride key to registry, but it didn't work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>One other suggestion was disconnecting windows, under&nbsp;<span>Work and School accounts. After applying this suggestion and starting Outlook again, login prompt appears and asks for password, I enter my password, prompt works
 for a moment, disappears, and appears again asking for my password. So no changes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated, thanks.<br />

            Hello Cskr,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your response. Could please undo the regedit settings you did earlier as it did not help. 
<br />
<br />Please, try to clear  your windows credentials and check if, it helps
<br />
<br />• Clear credentials.
<br />1. File&gt;Account&gt;under User Information, sign out all the existing account and exit all Office apps.
<br />2. Control Panel&gt;User Accounts&gt;credential manager&gt;Windows Credentials, remove all Office 365 credentials that look like: MicrosoftOfficeXXData:XXXXXXXXX
<br />3. Right click windows icon&gt;Run&gt;type "regedit" then press ENTER to open the redistry editor. Go toHKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity,&nbsp;delete the whole Identity folder
<br />4. Restart computer.
<br />
<br />
<br />Is this a new Windows 10 laptop? was it working before fine?
<br />
<br />Regards, 
<br />Parmi

<p><span>Hello, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Which build and version of Windows are you currently using?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Is the issue specific to Mail app?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern, let us try few troubleshooting methods to fix sync issues with mail app and check if that helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: <span>Click the </span></span><strong>Sync</strong><span><span>button in the Mail app, at the top of your message list, to force the app to sync.</span> Also check if you have any pending update or your PC. Navigate
 (</span><strong>Start</strong><span><span>&gt; </span></span><strong>Settings</strong><span><span>&gt;
</span></span><strong>Update &amp; security</strong><span><span>&gt;&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Check for updates</strong><span><span>) to check and update your PC<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, I suggest you to try the steps from the following article on
 and Calendar apps in Windows 10</a> </span>and check if that helps you in resolving this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, the issue might be caused due to the incoming and outgoing port numbers. I suggest you to check with the AOL support team for manual configuring the account with the POP, IMAP, along with the dedicated port settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps,</span></p>

<h3> dan ngp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cascading Comboboxes in Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm new to VBA and macros, but I was hoping that someone could point me in the right direction when using ActiveX Combo Boxes in Excel. I'm trying to link them to make them cascading combo boxes - what I choose in box one changes my available choices in
 box 2. Eventually, I'll add a third box.</p>

</p><p>I have no issues with the first combobox, it's set to a specific list of departments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each item in the specific list of departments is also a named ranged. For example, the first item in the specific list is Dept1, and I have a named range called Dept1 with some sub departments that I would like to show up in combobox 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to fill in the second combobox using VBA based on changing combo box 1:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Private Sub ComboBox1_Change()</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ComboBox2.ListFillRange = Range(Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("C9")).Address</em><br />
<em>End Sub</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I just found this VBA while searching around, but I hoped this would set the second combo box's ListFillRange&nbsp;to the address of the value in C9. Since C9 is also a named range, I was hoping that Range.address would return the location of the named range
 in C9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, I just get an error message "<em>Method 'Range' of object '_Worksheet' failed</em>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone point out what I did incorrectly? Is it a typo, or is the approach wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I can do this with data validation already, I'm just hoping I can do this with combo boxes as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I made a sample file years ago, have a look at the macros. Link below</p>
<p><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=3A2C42285A53958A!369&amp;authkey=!APeRy9rJK3mssDA&amp;ithint=file%2czip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=3A2C42285A53958A!369&amp;authkey=!APeRy9rJK3mssDA&amp;ithint=file%2czip</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Define names range for each group to shorten the length of the macro.</p>
<p />

<p>Well, there are several ways for that, have a look into this file:</p>
