    <title>Headphone audio won&#39;t transfer from laptop speaker - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Headphone audio won&#39;t transfer from laptop speaker</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>This is an issue that I have with my new ASUS ZenBook 14 ux433. Whenever I plug in my headphones into the laptop the audio notification pops up, giving me a choice of changing my audio to my headphones, and a drop-down box to select the audio type. Whenever
 I press the OKAY button, the audio still plays through my laptop speaker, rather than my headphones. But, the weird issue is that when I press the back button (on the top right of the notification box to close it), it allows my audio to successfully transfer
 to my headphones, and it works perfectly. Is this a bug with the laptop itself? Or is it a bug with the software on Windows 10? Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi, I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try for headset problems so at least something will work.  If you need help performing any steps I am standing by here to help:
<br />
<br />First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-headset-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-hea...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay to look for the device and change the default behavior in it's Dropdown Menu.
<br /> 
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sounds Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected and Connected for both Playback and Recording Default Devices.
<br />
<br />If not again right click Volume icon in System Tray to choose Troubleshoot sound problems.
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page. While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.
<br />
<br />Sometimes it helps to unpair or disconnect all other Bluetooth devices from the PC in Bluetooth settings, then try again to connect the headset.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  
<br /><a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.  
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>...
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-</a>...
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> sean67  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMP 11 Graphic Equalizer causes sound to fade in and out.</h2>
                    When I use the graphic equalizer in Windows Media Player 11, the sound fades in and out. I have purchased 4 different machines by Dell, Emachines, HP, and Compaq. They've all had the same issue. I've tried different sound cards as well. It must be an inherent
 issue with WMP 11 itself. Has anyone else had this problem and been able to resolve it?<br />
<br />
Thank you

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Are you starting the Equalizer with the slide controls centered between top and bottom.<br />
<br />
Do you have other controllers working at the same time such as SRS WOW or any 3rd<br />
party programs?<br />
<br />
Not likely to be on 4 different brand machines without something in common to cause it.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Maybe these will help :<br />

How do I stop my music from skipping or breaking up when I play it?<br />

<br />
1. Right Click Speaker Icon near clock lower right&nbsp;- Playback Devices<br />
<br />
Highlight Speakers - Properties (lower right same page) - Enhancements&nbsp; Tab - Check
<br />
Disable all Sound Effect Apply - OK<br />
<br />
2. Control Panel - Device Manager - Sound, Video and Game Controller<br />
<br />
Write down&nbsp;name and complete model of sound device there - full decription - now double
<br />
click on it - driver tab - write down driver version. Then click UPdate Driver (this may not
<br />
do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then RIGHT CLICK on device -
<br />
UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker and look for updated drivers (or get the same one if no newer)
<br />
this will be your fallback. Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - RIGHT CLICK in it -
<br />
RUN AS ADMIN. <br />
<br />
Then do same for the Device Maker (such as Realtek or whoever made the device).<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and
<br />
the reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;-
<br />
reboot until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it <br />
does.<br />
</strong><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you did not do all of them exactly as outlined I would urge you to do so.<br />
<br />
What about SRS Wow and others?<br />
<br />
Maybe a common cause such as antivirus/antispyware/security programs? Even the remnants<br />
of ones that were uninstalled can cause strange issues.<br />
<br />
There has to be a common cause and the only way to find it is to be extremely disciplined in<br />
your approach when troubleshooting.

<p>Likewise, I am having the same troubles with the graphic equalizer.&nbsp; When it is turned off, the playback is consistent, but with the EQ on, the sound fades in and out.&nbsp; This happens with only the EQ on, with no other enhancements turned on.<br />
<br />
I have followed the steps implicitly as you have described them above, but to no avail.&nbsp; Unlike Sean's scenereo, I have only experienced this on one computer, and have not tried this version of WMP on another.&nbsp; However, at least two other audio programs, WinAmp
 and iTunes, playback using their built-in equalizers with no problems.&nbsp; So, it appears that the problem is with WinAmp, and not the system.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to proceed from here?<br />
<br />
My device is a built-in Realtek High Definition Audio that had been running driver version 6.0.1.5599, which I just updated to 6.0.1.5789 (with no improvement).&nbsp; This driver is newer than what Windows thought was the newest, and came directly from Toshiba's
 support site.&nbsp; Realtek has nothing for drivers, except for audio codecs.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>What Realtek calls the HD Audio Codec Driver&nbsp;is the driver you need. Latest is R2.52<br />
which was released on Sept.&nbsp;6, 2010 and installs 6.0.1.6132.<br />
<br />
Realtek - click HD Audio Codec Driver on right side <br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Did you check all the methods in the troubleshooter above?<br />
<br />
Check with your system maker or a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other<br />
Big Box Stores).<br />
<br />
If a PC the on-board audio can be disabled or an add-in sound card removed and for either a new<br />
add-in sound card might help. Those are not expensive.<br />
<br />
On a laptop (or even a PC) the on-board audio can be disabled and a USB sound card used which is<br />
not expensive.<br />
<br />
================================================================<br />
<br />
There have been some instance where malware, particularly versions of the TDSSKiller root-kit have<br />
caused strange audio issues on some systems.<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

    <title>How do I fix &#34;The Active Directory Domain Services is currently - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pharmgirl  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I fix &#34;The Active Directory Domain Services is currently unavailable&#63;</h2>
                    I have Windows Vista, not a lot of space on the hard drive and uninstalled some programs that appeared to be useless to me.&nbsp; This may not be the cause of the message but is a starting point.&nbsp; I get the message when I go to print and click on "Find printers".&nbsp;
 The printer is otherwise listed (Kodak AiO ESP 5250+1814) and both it and my network setup check out that it's properly installed and connected.&nbsp; When I tried to print a Word document however, it wouldn't respond.&nbsp; It shows no ink in the cartridges (they are
 new) so I know it isn't communicating properly somehow.&nbsp; It was working a couple days ago so I thought it might be helpful to reset the computer to a previous date's configuration but I don't know how.

<p>Since MSN is a website and not a browser, maybe you have a home page that needs to be changed on your present browser.&nbsp; I addressed this in my first post..&nbsp; I also gave you very specific steps to take which would remove not only the home page but also any
 add-on's or Extensions it installed to insinuate itself further into your browser or Windows.&nbsp; Did you try these?&nbsp; I do not see any reported results.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Internet Explorer 11 which you said you have, you would click on the Tools gear at right end of browser bar, then choose Internet Options, on General tab copy and paste your preferred Home Page URL into the box at top.&nbsp; You can also go to that page so
 you see what will be your home page, then click on the Select Current button to choose that page.&nbsp; Apply and Exit.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now go back to the Tools gear and click on it.&nbsp; Choose Manage Add-on's, on Search Providers tab, if the one you want isn't present to highlight and choose, select the link at bottom to Choose More Search Providers, on that page choose Google or your choice
 so it appears in the list, highlight to Set as Default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, on Extensions tab highlight and disable any that you don't know for sure you want.&nbsp; You can ask back about any in question or make a &nbsp;

Screenshot using Snipping Tool</a> to save and attach back using the Attach Image button in reply box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the suggestions I gave and report back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want Edge or Internet Explorer, then install another browser.&nbsp; There are other good choices like Chrome or Firefox.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.&nbsp; I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.&nbsp;

    <title>Swap Ctrl &#38; Fn keys on Surface Pro Type Cover - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christian bailey mit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Swap Ctrl &#38; Fn keys on Surface Pro Type Cover</h2>
                    <p>Is there any way to swap the Ctrl &amp; Fn keys on the Surface Pro Type Cover? (For Surface Pro 3, Surface Pro 4, Surface Pro 2017/5th Gen, and Surface Pro 6)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have muscle memory from using Lenovo keyboards, which have the following key order: Fn, Ctrl, Win, Alt. I still have to use a Lenovo keyboard at work, and switching back and forth is very frustrating, I'm always holding Fn on the Type Cover when I meant
 to hold Ctrl.</p>

<p>Barb, thank you for the fast reply! SharpKeys is an awesome utility, and I already use it to remap an unused key to the Application Key.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Fn key on the Surface Type Cover is not recognized by SharpKeys. It's not just that I didn't find it on the list, I also tried "Type Key" (screenshot below). Nothing is registered when I press the Fn key.</p>

<p>I don't think this is solvable in software. It's a Microsoft hardware issue. It would have to be re-mapped in the keyboard itself. For example, Lenovo laptops offer this feature, but it has to be done in BIOS, not Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I believe Microsoft could have this feature too, but it but would have to be by communicating with the keyboard or the Surface hardware through either in UEFI or preferably through some utility (best would be the Surface app).

<h2>            Windows 7 Epson Stylus DX7450 cleaning nozzle heads.</h2>
                    I've just bought new cartridges and inserted them. As expected&nbsp;when I print it has a lot of lines, I've looked around in the printer settings and almost everywhere else to clean them and also googled many things and found useful information, However my
 PC doesn't&nbsp;seem to have the options that these forums suggest it should have for windows 7.
<div>I right click on the device and select &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Printer&nbsp;Preferences&nbsp;</b>and apparently I should choose utility and find it within there however all i get is a box open that has basic settings for the printer e.g. orientation and pages and an option to update
 to latest version, I choose this and it seems to do&nbsp;something&nbsp;and connect to the internet but then nothing.</div>
<div>I just want to PRINT please help.&nbsp;</div>

<div>I have an Epson SX100 printer and was able to clean the printer nozzle in my old laptop which had Windows Vista. I can not however find out how to clean the nozzles in Window 7. This indicates that microsoft has something to do with it, yes?</div>

            Hi Geethu,
<div>The issue was that windows 7 has drivers for Epson by default, but not the right ones. that's why I couldn't find some utilities like nozzle check in the printer's properties' menu.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've installed proper version of drivers and the utilities for printer appeared in the menu.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, thank you for your attention.</div>

            Hi Raj621, while there is a lot of different caused indicated by the mini-dumps, they all seem to point to your Network/WiFi device driver . . .
<br />
<br />Go to the support page for your system, or indeed your network driver(s) and download the latest/recommended drivers and install those . . .

<h2>            Windows 8 slow printing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just bought a new HP&nbsp; computer with Windows 8 (64 bit).&nbsp; Our Cannon MX892 worked fine with our old Windows XP computer, but now it takes up to 10 minutes to print a one page document.&nbsp; I loaded the Cannon driver for this printer.&nbsp; I also have a Windows
 7 laptop, which prints fine.&nbsp; What can I do to fix this?&nbsp; This is a wireless printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

            Thanks for the tips.&nbsp; This prompted me to completely reinstall the printer and software on the new computer using the CD that came with the printer.&nbsp; The test print was quick.&nbsp; Will test it thoroughly over the next couple days and report if successful.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />The user account might be corrupted. The best way to fix this is to:
<br />
<br />1. Create a new local account and make it an administrator.
<br />Add Local Account or Microsoft Account in Windows 10
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5440-add-local-account-microsoft-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5440-add-lo...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Log into it and copy everything from the old account to the new local account.
<br />
<br />3. Delete your old Microsoft account.
<br />Delete User Account in Windows 10 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5464-delete-user-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5464-delete...</a>
<br />
<br />4. Convert your Local account into Microsoft account.
<br />
<br />Switch to Microsoft Account in Windows 10

<h2>            Windows 7 CD or download link...</h2>
                    <p>Dear sirs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At our office we have a HP desktop computer which has Windows 7 Pro installed. We would like to do a complete reinstall of the system. Unfortunately there is no original CD of Windows 7 delivered with the pc. Of course we have the original product key. Is
 there any way to obtain the original CD or download this form the Microsoft site anywhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, Niels<br />
</p>

</p><p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the recovery partition is not working:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the corresponding edition of Windows 7 you have a license for from the following link. You can identify the edition on COA sticker attached to your machine, with at bottom or battery compartment (laptop) or top/side if its a desktop computer.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>These are the options available to you:</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You can contact&nbsp;HP and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>Manufacturers normally do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;Windows back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The Recovery process with a HP&nbsp;can be started by repeatedly&nbsp;pressing&nbsp;F11 at Boot. (Power On / Startup) or use the HP&nbsp;Recovery Manager from within Windows 7</strong></p>
<p>

</p><p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01867418&amp;cc=us&amp;destPage=document&amp;lc=en&amp;tmp_docname=c01867418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01867418&amp;cc=us&amp;destPage=document&amp;lc=en&amp;tmp_docname=c01867418</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>3. Or download the correct ISO file and make your own disk and use the Product Key that is on the COA Sticker.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.w7forums.com/threads/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-image-downloads.12325/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.w7forums.com/threads/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-image-downloads.12325/</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And Neosmart has instructions on how to burn&nbsp;ISO images to&nbsp;disk using imgburn:</p>
<p><a href="http://neosmart.net/wiki/burning-iso-images-with-imgburn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://neosmart.net/wiki/burning-iso-images-with-imgburn/</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You have already found the COA Sticker on your Desktop</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fgsPE6.gif" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Using the downloaded ISO file Method may require phone Activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If it does require phone Activation, do not follow the <em>Auto Prompts</em>, but hold on for a real person to explain to as to what&nbsp;has been&nbsp;done for re-installation purposes</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The above method also will require you to go to your Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; Support and Downloads Section &gt; locate your Model Number and Operating System &gt; then download and install the latest Drivers for it</p>

<h3> gokc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 OneDrive Resetting File Permissions</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10, I've noticed that OneDrive starts itself, even though I've unticked the startup box, and then resets permissions on my Pictures folder so that I can't save anything to it because I don't have "permission". I'm not even listed
 as a user on the folder.&nbsp;I have an administrator account, and have full permission. The administrator account also still has full permissions, and that's the confusing part. Others seem to be having this same permission issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows Phone that also has OneDrive, so I'm wondering if there's an issue there. Today my PC was trying to sync 4 new pictures I took with my phone camera, and OneDrive was "hung" doing so, and this is when I noticed the file permission issue again.
 I'm ready to revert back to Windows 7...</p>

    <title>Misbehaving Driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tft_jessie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Misbehaving Driver</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, got an issue here I would be really grateful if anyone could help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Toshiba Laptop Circa 7 years old - SATALLITE C660D-102.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 - problems started after free upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Started off with the DCP Watchdog Violation blue screen error - I managed to boot into safe mode and change the AMD SATA Controller Driver to the Standard SATA AHCI Controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now getting the blue screen error: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (storahci.sys).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normal boot up is no good as only responsive for 2 minutes.</p>
<p>I tried to download the latest AMD chipset driver 15.7.1 on another laptop and saved the file to USB. Loaded faulty laptop in safe mode and manually pointed the driver update to the USB file; however, it keeps telling me that the driver is up to date already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to try a fresh re-install of windows 10 now but not confident this will fix the issue.</p>
<p>Any assistance would be much appreciated.</p>

            Multiple drivers are misbehaving that might indicate a hardware fault.
<br />Assuming chipset drivers are at fault,
<br />Remove the driver completely:

<br />Then try installing the newer driver.

<br />Amdppm was named in one of the crash which might indicate a problem with the processor.

<h2>            Unable to download FX app&#59; error code 8015402B</h2>
                    <p>I have an xbox 360 that I used for youtube, amazon video, and FX app. I wanted to give it to a friend so I formatted the internal memory under storage, created a new xbox live profile, and tried to download those three apps. The youtube and amazon video downloaded and installed correctly, but when I start the FX&nbsp;app, I get an error code 8015402B.&nbsp;</p><p><br />I tried everything that I could think of to get it to download. There are no current downloads, some 3gb of free space on internal memory, I cleared the system cache, I added my credit card to the account ( just incase that was the problem), then formatted the memory under storage and redownload the profile and the apps. The two amazon and youtube downloaded and installed correctly but again the same error with FX.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Any idea what could be wrong?</p><p><br /></p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaize

 </blockquote> <p>I did have my account verified, and still the same thing. I tried to format storage and redownload my old profile and redownload FX app. I was able to download it however; if I launch it right after I install it, I get an error message that it cannot start. If I try to open it again, it tells me to redownload it. If I dont launch it right after I download it and exit out and then open it, still tells me to redownload it. <br /></p>

 </blockquote> <p>I wonder if they removed support for the 360 after all this time. Its not listed on their page anymore. It does however show the Xbox One.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/fxnow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.fxnetworks.com/fxnow</a></p>
