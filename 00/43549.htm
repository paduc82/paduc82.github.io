            <p>Hi Dimitrios,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are facing issues with Windows 10. I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.</span></p>
<p><span>The issue could occur if </span>tmw.dll is missing from the file location.</p>
<p>To assist you better, please provide the information:</p>
<p>Have you made any recent changes to the Computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>Refer to the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method&nbsp;1</strong>:&nbsp;I suggest you to check&nbsp;if DLL file is&nbsp;present in Recycle Bin. You may have simply accidentally deleted the DLL file.</p>
<p>Most DLL errors come in the "DLL Not Found" and "Missing DLL" form. The easiest possible cause of a DLL error like this is that you've deleted the DLL file without realizing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Enter Safe Mode to do this or any of the following steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to this DLL error.</p>
<p>If the issues still persist, refer to the below method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Recover the deleted DLL file with a free third party file recovery program. If you suspect that you've accidentally deleted the DLL file but you've since emptied the Recycle Bin, a file recovery program can help.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Recovering a DLL file with a file recovery program is a smart idea only if you're confident you've deleted the file yourself and that it was working properly before you did that.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">THIRD PARTY LINK DISCLAIMER</span></span></strong></p>

<p>If the issues still persist, refer to the below method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>:&nbsp;Try to run a virus/malware scan of your entire system. Some "DLL is Missing" and "DLL Not Found" DLL errors are related to hostile programs that masquerade as DLL files.</p>
<p><span>I&nbsp;suggest you to&nbsp;scan the Computer with Windows Defender or with any other antivirus for&nbsp;virus.</span></p>
<p><span>If Windows Defender is disable due to some reason, then&nbsp;try to install the Microsoft&nbsp;Safety Scanner and scan with it.</span></p>

            You need to reopen the Task Scheduler with taskschd.msc, then modify the time for the shutdown task.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updated my graphics card driver and display also. Issue is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assumed that problem may be with data migration from win 8.1 to win 10 for that particular account. I don't know how to update the Microsoft account (@live.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So finally I've signed out and deleted the local account in the laptop and created a fresh user. Blurry text and icons are gone. My on screen keyboard is also nice. Updated all the apps from Store freshly.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Mine is Latitude 3550. I got the drivers from Dell support very recently (Sep'15 I got Win 10 update from MS). May be dell is working for other models also. Hope you have installed Dell system detect app before searching for drivers update in Dell support
 page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I suggested, have you created any new local user in your laptop? Still having issues?</p>

                    <p>A few days ago, my cat walked across my keyboard. &nbsp;Now, my windows symbol in the taskbar is pink when I go to it, and it does not respond when I click on it. &nbsp;Also, the calendar no longer shows up when I click on the time/date in task bar.</p>

<p>Hi Slick,</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the Start menu and Task bar fails to work on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the Windows system files go corrupted. I suggest you to follow the below troubleshooting steps and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Press <strong>Ctrl+Alt+Del</strong>, select <strong>Task Manager</strong>.
</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> From the <strong>File</strong> menu, select <strong>Run new task</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Put a check mark next to <strong>Create this task with administrative privileges</strong> and tap or click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Type <strong>cmd</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Type the following commands in same order in the Command prompt window:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>a. </strong>Type <strong>sfc /scannow </strong>and press Enter.</p>
<p><strong>(</strong>This command scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>b.</strong> Type <strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth </strong>
and press Enter.</p>
<p><strong>c. </strong>Type <strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth </strong>
and press Enter.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Type <strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth </strong>
and press Enter.</p>
<p>(These commands fix any files that System File Checker can't repair and Windows corruption errors).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>e. </strong>Type<strong> powershell </strong>and press Enter.</p>
<p><strong>f. </strong>Copy the below Powershell script and hit Enter.</p>
<strong>
<p>Get-appxpackage -all *shellexperience* -packagetype bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml")}</p>
</strong>
<p>(This Powershell script can fix the issue by re-registering the package).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Close the <strong>command window</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, <strong>restart</strong> the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>

ms-settings:privacy-backgroundapps (press enter)<br />

Here you can turn off background apps or control those you wish to run, I have all turned off with no detrimental effects.</div>

<p>1. What antivirus are you using? With 4GB of RAM, I have seen Norton or McAfee AVs bring these systems to their knees.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I would assume you also have a standard mechanical HDD not a SSD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You can give this a try to see what file(s) are being accessed. This might give you a clue as to what might be causing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. Start Resource Monitor (Start &gt; Windows Administrative Tools)</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. Select the "Disk" tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. Click the box next to the "System" process in the "Processes with Disk Activity". This should just show disk activity by the "System" process in the "Disk Activity" section below.</p>

</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run Program install and uninstall troubleshooter and try reinstalling the program and check for the issue.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Method 2: Troubleshoot problems installing and uninstalling programs on Windows-based computers</strong></span></p>
<p><span>You may try Fixit mentioned in the article and try to uninstall and reinstall the program. If Fixit doesn’t work, try to perform the
 manual steps mentioned under the article.</span></p>

    <title>Microsoft wheel mouse optical USB dysfunction - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft wheel mouse optical USB dysfunction</h2>
                    
<p>With increasing frequency my optical mouse malfunctions.&nbsp; At first there are transient, short lived losses of power to the unit, i.e. the red light from the mouse fails and with this the ability to move the cursor on the screen.&nbsp; Spontaneously, the power
 and function of the mouse will return briefly only to be lost again.&nbsp; Eventually, however, the power loss seems to be permanent and will not return.&nbsp; The problem then can only be rectified by cutting power to the computer.&nbsp; When the system is restarted, the
 mouse functions normally for a variable, and it seems increasingly briefer, period of time at which point the process of the mouse function "dying" is frustratingly observed again.&nbsp; I have checked USB controller tabs and all seems well.&nbsp; I have looked for
 updates for my drivers and all is current.&nbsp; A solution to this problem would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<div>Worst case, if the new one and doesn't solve your problem, you can</div>
<div>reinstall the old one and look for another solution. Just keep the new</div>
<div>one to use as a replacement you will surely need not very far down the</div>
<div>line.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>By the way, personally, I prefer wired mice, since they are less</div>
<div>expensive, don't need batteries, and have no disadvantage that a</div>
<div>wireless one solves.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Start to Finish</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17145/windows-homegroup-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17145/windows-homegroup-from-start-to-finish</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Be sure you have the latest firmware for your router (even if other computers are<br />
working well) and the latest network drivers. on the Windows 10 computers.<br />
<br />
<strong>All&nbsp;computers need to have&nbsp;unique names.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>All&nbsp;computers need to have the same time and date.</strong><br />
<br />
Some antivirus/security programs can block or cause networking issues. Disabling a<br />
3rd party antivirus/security program may not be sufficient. You may need to uninstall<br />
it and then run the maker's Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants.&nbsp;Use<br />
Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1 &amp; 10&nbsp;is a full&nbsp;antivirus.<br />
<br />
Your router and all computers must be IPv6 capable (hardware, firmware, and drivers)<br />
to use HomeGroup. Check the System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems)<br />
or the actual device makers' sites for update network drivers. Also check the router<br />
maker's site for updated firmware. Check their support and ask in their forums for any
<br />
known issues.&nbsp; (Run the Home Group troubleshooter to enable IPv6.)<br />
<br />
<strong>Try both a wired and wireless connection. Of course update both drivers (see
</strong><br />
last&nbsp;section below). If using a wire now be sure to check cabling.
<p>Check the Services to be sure they are running :&nbsp; Right Click the TaskBar - Task<br />
Manager - Services tab - at bottom Open Services. Be sure these are correctly<br />
set. Normally ALL are&nbsp;set to Manual and Running.<br />

<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate&nbsp;device
<br />
drivers.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without
<br />
Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager -&nbsp;Network Driver&nbsp;- write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your&nbsp;network adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>I don't have another phone to try, but I did get it to work with my current phone just now:</p>
<p>1) Your Phone was not running on either the PC or the phone</p>
<p>2) I ran Your Phone on the phone and signed out, then signed back in</p>
<p>3) It started the 'checking your PC process'</p>
<p>4) I went to the PC and ran Your Phone&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) I got a message on the Phone about 10 seconds later to ask me to allow the connection</p>
<p>6) I did and it worked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above isn't very different to what I had already tried several times so I don't know what was different this time except that Your Phone on the PC had always been running in earlier attempts. Maybe starting the process from the phone and then starting
 Your Phone on the PC has an effect?</p>

            <p>Thank You for the answer.</p>
<p>Here is an additional comment I posted recently:</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>&gt;I forgot to mention, that on rebooting my system, the input indicator is always on "off". Switching it &gt;manually on "on" doesn't help. Since when rebooting it, it&nbsp;is again on "off".</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>&gt;Also on the Metro Panel Settings charm on the right side next to the "on/off"&nbsp; power button the &gt;button&nbsp;showing &nbsp;the&nbsp; language isn't there anymore.
</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>&gt;It seems there were 3 updates for Microsoft IME (for Japanese)&nbsp;installed after I installed my Windows 8. &gt;I&nbsp;guess one of&nbsp; these updates messed up the system.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></font></font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>The language abbreviation button in the Desktop taskbar is missing.</span></font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>I tried&nbsp;&nbsp;those in your E-Mail above mentioned steps. It does not help.</span></font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>I can switch from English to German and back. &nbsp;Not to Japanese.
</span></font></font></font></span></p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>It seems others have this problem too. See below</span></font></font></font></span></p>

            This is a bug in Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Very strange behavior.&nbsp; I could not get the language toolbar to appear (and still cannot).&nbsp; THe "metro" language input and control panel input dual functionality seems to be involved (any reason why to have the same admin
 functionality offered in Two different places)???&nbsp; This is a bug, as multiple people are saying, please fix.

            Power issue is a broad term-It can either mean a voltage fluctuation/not enough power wasn't supplied which might be a one off case. If the crashes repeat with the same code, I would believe the PSU unit of the PC is at fault.

<p>Hey , I see you like all these shmup games, such as ones by Cave. I want to know the answer to your question as well as there is virtually too little explanation for how to get high scores. I just assume the best thing is to use that power that turns all
 the bullets into collectible pieces and quickly collect them. But to use that power with most pay off you need to allow as many bullets as possible on one screen before using this power. I think in Acai Katana it is the same way as in other games like espgaluda
 2, dodonpatchi, and others. Did you ever play or know about the two Japanese releases which are region free? They are Espgaluda 2 Black Label and &nbsp;2nd one with longer Japanese name &nbsp;and Mushihime Futari. Those two games are region free and by far the most
 impressive you can play on xbox. </p>

<p>Hey, I'll be working on it for the month or so :) You are correct about the cycle of collecting. The other piece I've been missing is that it seems you need to follow the Katana, at about the hilt of it, as it crosses in combo to get the gold pieces as maximum
 size. I'll update this when I get more experience, unless someone else comes along who has got the system down.&nbsp;&nbsp; The region free games are all on my list!&nbsp; I'll be getting those as well. The number games being limited makes me want to space out when I get
 a new one...sad about the end of these in development (rumors), I wish Microsoft would buy Cave and let them continue.</p>

<h2>            Age of Empires&#58; Castle Siege</h2>
                    I have been playing age of empires castle siege for&nbsp;about 6 months. It was working fine up until the last update (version: 1.10.0.43). Now the game is opening but whenever I click on the "Find a Battle"&nbsp;option&nbsp;the game crashes after showing the loading
 screen for a few seconds. I have noticed the same problem in another game also (Six Guns)&nbsp;after this update.

<br />Any reason why you are using Windows 98 in the 10 era? Running anything older than 7 runs a risk of compromising everything-including security, malware, support etc.

<h3> phil 11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 activation and upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I was running Win 8.1 on an Asus A551LB laptop and got the free upgrade a couple of weeks ago. 2 days ago i got a blue screen error code telling me i had a corrupted boot data and I needed to do a recovery. After some research I made a copy of a friends
 Win10 using recovery creator from his laptop and installed it onto my laptop (losing all my files!!!)</p>
<p>Now i have 2 problems:</p>
<p>- I cannot activate this version, my original Win8 was a legitimate copy, I have no record of that activation code and I don't know where to find it, there is nothing on the laptop itself and I didn't receive any confirmation email from Microsoft.</p>
<p>- My friends version was 32 bit win 10 and my laptop is 64 bit, can i upgrade within the OS?</p>
<p>Can anyone help please?</p>

            <p>Hi Jessen,</p>
<p>I couldn't really find the answer in the link you provided. Maybe I missed something. I don't know how to find the activation code, my current OS is asking for activation and is showing me my previous activation code with only the final 5 numbers and letters
 showing.</p>
<p>Where can I find that code? I have no email from Microsoft when I purchased my laptop with 8.1 installed and I have no documentation with it on.</p>
<p>Would it be better to reinstall using an ISO? As this laptop is 64 bit and the W10 I reinstalled is 32 bit maybe this is the best option? Can you advise me how to do this please?</p>
        </p>
