<p>I have been impressed by the Windows 10 beta trial and the upgrade offer. It would be a shame to spoil this with unreasonable restrictions.</p>

            <p>The free upgrade offer does not apply to volume license clients. If your Windows 7/8/8.1 installations are from a volume license contract, you won't be able to obtain the free upgrade that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should upgrade to Windows 10 if you have an active volume license contract with active software assurance. The software will be available to you through the volume license service center.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">Regarding the new servicing model for Windows 10, will Enterprise customers be required to adopt the rapid release cadence too?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Enterprise customers will continue to service and manage their Windows 10 clients the same way they do today. Here is what Terry Myerson had to say:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>We understand that businesses require choice in how updates are delivered, and at what pace. So as I discussed on September 30th, with Windows 10, businesses will be able to pick the speed of innovation that is right for each
 group of their users, rather than rely on a one size fits all solution.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Business customers will be able to opt-in to the fast-moving consumer update pace, or lock-down mission critical environments to receive only security and critical updates to their systems. And businesses will have an additional
 option for systems that aren’t mission critical, but need to keep pace with the latest innovations while having the benefit to install updates after they have been tested in the broad market. And the choice isn’t one or the other for businesses; we expect
 that most corporations will require a mix of these options to accommodate their business scenarios. Take for example an investment bank, where mission critical systems on the trading floor receive only security updates, whereas mobile devices for financial
 advisors are kept up to date with the latest feature innovations – enabling the appropriate pace of updates for each device.</em></p>

<p>It seems some are struggling to understand your point - Perhaps English may not be the first language of some ?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, heres what 'I' believe will happen. You will be able to do a clean install providing you have the eufi bios OR the genuine key.
</p>
<p>On the install, your previous key will become no longer valid if you ever want to go back to the version you were using - wanting to revert to the previous OS will be highly likely and necessary in my opinion !.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe your orginal version will be history and even a clone backup will then fail activation.</p>
<p>By clicking the 'i agree' you will be signing away your first born and giving MS a blank cheque' ;-)</p>

<p>DO some research on EUFI bios key storage and OEM keys - as well as 'normal' keys.</p>
<p>On an 'update' the original key could be logged on the activation system and then only used on one version only - now win 10 - changing drives wouldnt help after the win 10 activation... (if that is what they do - I think they will for sure !)</p>
<p>As for businesses, the 'constant' update cycle and development cycle is a major negative. The recent instances of MS putting non critical updates&nbsp; into the critical catagory is a najor concern !!!!!. - one for adware, one for a driver from FTDI that bricked
 devices (Deliberately !!!!). Trust must be at a very low ebb.</p>
<p>Businesses will carry on and use a non supported OS if needed. It is not a big deal as non supported does not been non stable or non secure - updates to major software in use by businesses will be for the specific OS in use by the majority, so that will
 not be an issue either.</p>
<p>Yes, it will be extremely interesting to see what happens.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can be confusing but in the case of COUNTBLANK Excel help makes it quite clear that "" will be counted &lt;Cells with formulas that return "" (empty text) are also counted.&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could makes the same observation over LEN and COUNTA, see below, LEN is returning zero but COUNTA is counting A1 as having text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally; but not always, if you read help you'll get a better understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>FALSE</td>
<td>ISBLANK</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>COUNTA</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>COUNTBLANK</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>LEN</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

            <p>Hi, if you go to the excel help regarding countblank you will find this under remarks</p>
<p>
Remark
</p><p>Cells with formulas that return "" (empty text) are also counted. Cells with zero values are not counted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>that is why countblank is counting 1</p>

<h2>            Cleaning up proxy address export issues - Potentially using Vlookup to match 2 columns with partial text</h2>
                    <p>So let me start of by saying I am not an excel expert. I've had moderate experience with Vlookup in the past but this one is a bit beyond me how to accomplish but I know it should be possible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The export I get has all the proxy addresses in a long string, I need to clean up this data into individual cells so that I can script the import. I've managed to do this with of Text to columns (except the legacy X400 which I've opted to just drop off),
 the problem is text to columns leaves a fair amount of manual clean up which leaves a lot of room for human error with thousands of these addresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
So what I'm looking for is a way to verify I've not places any of the proxy addresses on the wrong row once I've finished or a way to automatically sort and match the addresses to the raw Column A export.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Column A (raw export):</strong> </p>
<table>

<p>Any one have any suggestions how to either export the proxy addresses in such a way I won't have to clean up the export or a better way to clean up the data?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not then is it possible to verify (after cleaning up Column B manually) was successful and no human error by matching the&nbsp;partial text in column B to Column A?&nbsp;</p>

            Umm, you really should have one table for all Departments then using a field say, DepartmentID, separate them using queries.&nbsp; That way you can easily check for duplicates.&nbsp; Yep, that does mean updating you table structure but in the long run it will save
 you time and headache.

<h2>            Font color not displaying on Word doc.</h2>
                    In the last 10-12 days, the Font colors and highlights no longer display in Word App on my iphone. I can see those colors when I print the doc. It is not an issue with the settings of my iphone as the Colors (font or highlights) display in Excel and PowerPoint.
 Re-installing Word did not solve problem. Been using Word on my iPhones for more than 2 years without any issues.&nbsp;

            I found the solution for my iPhone SE. Go to Settings, General, Accessibility, Increase contrast... then make sure "Darken Colors" is turned off. For me, it solve the problem. I can now see the colors in a Word document.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This issue could be due to the recent changes after installing the build. To properly isolate this issue, we'd like to ask some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you experiencing the same issue while installing other apps?</li><li>Have you tried rolling back to the previous build?</li><li>Have you tried sending a feedback regarding this issue?<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
We hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
Text-To-Speech may not work properly in Word due to add-ins, missing updates, app corruption or damage, or incompatible device drivers. To isolate the issue, we'll need a few more details:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there changes made before the issue started happening?</li><li>Does the problem occur on all your Word documents, or only in a specific file?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, try checking for and <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">installing Office updates</a></strong>, and see how it goes. If the issue
 persists, try repairing Office by following the instructions on <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong>.<br />

            I only have Word 2016 with no extras. The problem occurs on all Word documents.&nbsp; In trying to solve the problem,&nbsp; I tried all sorts of suggestions,&nbsp; so I may have activated something unexpected.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; on one of the Office gripe chatrooms,&nbsp; somebody
 suggested that if I got my required voice on Excel,&nbsp; it would work for all the Office apps. I changed the TTS voice for Excel successfully to Microsoft Hazel but the same old American voice stayed in Word.&nbsp; But,&nbsp; for my purposes,&nbsp; I can use Hazel.&nbsp; If I ever
 need a long read from a Word document,&nbsp; I will have to put up with the male voice.

If you have games installed on your internal memory and if you can copy or move them, yes, it does support java games. :)

    <title>Email signature images changed to embedded in OUTLOOK. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alanbell6052  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email signature images changed to embedded in OUTLOOK.</h2>
                    
<p>WE currently use an application to generate email signatures using images directly sourced from an external web server. OUTLOOK 2013 appears to be converting these images to embedded as default which I do not want.</p>
<p>I have set the registry key HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Outlook\Options\Mail\Send Pictures With Document to '0' from it's '1' default setting which disable image embedding which appears to work fine.</p>
<p>However, after a certain period of time or an OUTLOOK restart the key setting for some unknown reason resets itself back to '1' and therefore images become embedded again.</p>
<p>Is there anybody able to give advise on how to url link images to OUTLOOK email and/or stop the registry key resetting back to 1?</p>
<p>Thank You :)</p>

<p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>Based on your description, the issue may be related to the integration of Outlook clients and the signature application. To better help you fix the issue, we suggest you post a new thread in our

<p>Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I have posted to the other forum.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the signature application is not integrated in to Outlook so can't be blamed for this one. It just produces the necessary html which can be imported for use as a signature. The HTML code is correct with url linked images, it is outlook that
 is now embedding the images based on the register key settings.</p>

What do you mean by "address book on Internet Explorer"?&nbsp;&nbsp; In XP you should have your&nbsp; wab.exe&nbsp; program to manage your contacts (at least if you have Outlook Express installed).</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 &#38; Excel 2010&#58; I cannot switch from one workbook to another IF I use either of the window switch functions of Win 7</h2>
                    <p><b><span>Problem Statement</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Multiple workbooks are opened in Excel 2010 (Windows 7 machine) and I cannot switch from one workbook to another
<b>IF</b> I use either of the window switch functions of Win 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><span>Option a</span></u><span>: Click on the Excel icon in the taskbar and select one of the open Excel files.</span></p>
<p><b><span>OR</span></b></p>
<p><u><span>Option b</span></u><span>: Alt-Tab n times and select one of the open Excel files.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When using option a, Excel always return to the current workbook.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When using option b, Windows only displays one Excel icon (whereas, in normal working conditions, it displays as many icons as there are open Excel files).
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Work-Arounds:</span></b></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>I can use the following <b><i>Excel menu</i></b>:</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>View</span></i></b><span> &gt; <b><i>Switch Windows</i></b> and select the
<b><span>workbook</span></b> I want to move to.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>I can also use Ctrl-Tab (when Excel is the active application).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: this issue occurs when an Oracle ADI template is loaded in Excel. This ADI template contains macro's.</span></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;KINbx,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're sorry to be the bearer of the bad news, however, deleted Skype contacts cant be recovered unless you know the Skype user name then you can search them again on our Skype directory. As for the messages, once the contact is deleted, chat and call history
 will be deleted as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If in case you have used Skype 7 on a computer (Windows or MAC), Skype will create a file where all of your Skype history is saved. By accessing this file, you may be able to recover your chat history for this specific contact as well as the Skype user name.
 You may follow the steps on this link:&nbsp;https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34894/</p>

</p><p>Should&nbsp; you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reply!</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />I am sorry to bring bad news here.
<br />
<br />If a contact has been deleted by the user, then that information is also completely removed from Skype servers - this is because, for privacy reasons, following user deletion, Skype is no longer authorized to keep it.
<br />
<br />As such, unfortunately, it is not possible to recover a deleted contact. 
<br />However, you can invite the contact again.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />I wish you a great day/night :)! 
<br />Margarida

<p>Yes! That's exactly what I'm dealing with the last couple of days! I decided to delete my old microsoft account and create a new one! But then every time I try to find one of my old contacts - I can't! I'm typing the user name correctly and It doesn't appear
 anymore! Why is that??? What should I do??? I need to find him and I can't! It's like he disappeared?! Tell me how to proceed?!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;KikiPetrova,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are typing the correct Skype user name of your friend when searching through the Skype directory, then there are 2 possible reasons as to why you cant search him/her using your Skype accounts and these are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discoverability has been disabled by this user. D<span>isabling </span>
this feature means no one can search him on Skype. As a work around, i<span>f you have any means to contact this friend of yours by mobile/landline or email, you may ask him/her to enable this feature by logging in to Skype website &gt; account details
 &gt; Edit profile &gt; Click on Edit then, make sure to check discoverability and click save. Or;</span></li><li>The account of this user has been deleted.</li></ol>

    <title>Merging multiple cells into one cell with semicolon in Excel for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merging multiple cells into one cell with semicolon in Excel for Mac 2011</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to merge multiple cells into one cell using semicolons to separate the information being merged.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I would like to take the information from A1-A7 and merge this information into B1 to display: A1;A2;A3;A4;A5;A6;A7</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then merge A8-A20 into B8 to display: A8;A9;A10;A11;A12;A13;A14;A15;A16;A17;A18;A19;A20</p>
<p>
</p><p>And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is important to note that I am operating on Excel for Mac 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if there is a formula I can use for this or if there is an add-on that can be purchase for Mac. Everything I am finding is for Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            I believe the Hotmail Plus account which is $19.95&nbsp; per year is different from the Premium Outlook which starts at $69.90 per year. I need to know how much One Drive storage there is the $19.95 per year Hotmail Plus service?&nbsp; Thank you

<div>We appreciate your patience in standing by for this issue. Upon checking on the screenshot that you've provided that shows Windows Live Hotmail Plus is just $19.99 is possibly a grandfathered plan.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hotmail Plus subscription only affects the Inbox storage which is an expanded storage to 50GB instead of 15GB from the free Outlook.com account.</div>

    <title>Multiple read only users viewing an excel file in excel online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sami seaquist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple read only users viewing an excel file in excel online &#40;sharepoint online&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I manage a team site for a call center that is the communication hub for all employees. I have an excel document that employees can only view in read only, but multiple users view different information at the same time. My problem is that if one user is
 looking at a certain tab, I cannot have the tab/view changing because another user is viewing something different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, if a document is in read only, will each user have their own version to view without anything changing while multiple users are accessing at the same time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Sami, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The view does not change if multiple users are viewing the workbook at the same time with read only permission. For example, a workbook is shared with User A and B with view (read) only permission. If user B is looking for information in sheet 5, then it
 will not affect the user A viewing sheet 2 in the same workbook as the same time. All the users will have their own view unless any user with edit permission, updates the workbook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The moment user with edit permission edits the workbook, the newly added information will start reflecting in the workbook, but this will not change the sheet tab for the user with read only permission.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Thanks,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Neha</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Lumia 925 not working. Microsoft Logo flashes once in a while.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Lumia 925 for quite some time now. Recently, I had the phone on charge and it restarted on its own. During the restart, the phone's battery was 30% and charging. When it powered back, it showed 50%!!! and after a minute or two, the phone
 died.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried</p>
<p>1. To let the battery drain (almost 3 days). Plugged it to a charger and at that instant the Microsoft logo stayed 'ON' for about 5 seconds. No other response from the phone.</p>
<p>2. Left the phone charge for over 24 hours - No Response.</p>
<p>3. The soft reset - No Response.</p>
<p>4. The hard reset - No Response</p>
<p>5. Power button while charging - MS Logo lit up for 5 seconds, no other response what so ever.</p>
<p>6. Soft reset while charging -&nbsp;MS Logo lit up for 5 seconds, no other response what so ever.</p>
<p>7. Hard reset while charging -&nbsp;MS Logo lit up for 5 seconds, no other response what so ever.</p>
<p>8. Power button while not charging - No Response.</p>
<p>9. Windows Device Recovery Tool - Lumia 925 is not supported!!</p>
<p>10. Nokia Software Recovery Tool - Not detecting device nor able to override manually.</p>
<p>11. NSU for Retail - Not supported OS. OS is 8.1 on Lumia 925.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I try? Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

Stany Jude</a>. Do you now have the phone or is it still in the Care Point? If yes, you may try sending your phone for an assessment to another Care Point for a second opinion. Note that the process will delete all the files saved in your phone and liquid/physical
 damage will void its warranty.

 I did receive the email to my Live email. I replied from that test email and that reply did show up in my Google email. So basically, if I initiate an email from my Live account, it's not being received...&nbsp;

    <title>Are settings &#34;shared&#34; when dual-booting&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drccs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are settings &#34;shared&#34; when dual-booting&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have the Windows 10 Technical Preview installed on the same hard drive (in a separate partition) as Windows 8.1 and have the computer set to dual-boot so I can choose which one starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, it's a bit "clunky" that if I choose Windows 8 the computer must&nbsp;restart again to get to that OS; I'm assuming this is by design and there's some technical explanation why it's done this way. If it can't be changed, so be it, but it seems this would
 be confusing to less technical users. (But then again, a "less technical" user may not be dual booting two OSes anyway.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, here's my real question/complaint... It appears that some settings are shared between the two Operating Systems(?) If I change the wallpaper or lock screen picture in one, it also impacts the other. Not sure if this happens every time or just occasionally.
 Has anyone else noticed this? It's not a huge problem, but seems a little odd. And, if these things impact one another, is there anything else like this?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The settings are synced every time you change them (OneDrive sync). In order to avoid that, you should have chosen to set up the Windows 10 installation as a new one and not import your OneDrive settings (the question pops up sometime during the initial
 setup). This way you would have two OneDrive profiles and they would not sync with each other.</p>
