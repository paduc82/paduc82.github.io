<h2>            touchpad diagnostic dialogue box</h2>
                    When I am Word or Excel I constantly get a popup dialogue box asking if I want to save the touchpad diagnostic as a file.&nbsp;&nbsp; This recently started, and happens so often that it almost makes Excel and Word unusable.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can this be fixed?

            Hi ccbetty,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Look into the Answer marked in below thread
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/touchpad-driver-diagnostic-pop-up/f8ad5ca2-9559-4327-9b7e-bdaaaca4d2b1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />B. If above doesn't work - Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general) 
<br />
<br />Note for Office 2013 and below - Please repair only if you have product key with you as sometimes it asks for the product key again after the repair.
<br />

<h2>            I can&#39;t remove a printer in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have been going through all the forums on this subject. I have removed the device, the printer driver, and everything else I can think of following the instructions given. I am now down to this. It says it is removing device, but it isn't removed and I
 can't reinstall the printer.&nbsp; At this point, I don't have a printer. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I am not going to reset my PC as we have years of applications on the device.

<br />Try typing Regedit in Start Search, and open the registry editor. Then go to: 
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -&gt; SYSTEM -&gt; CurrentControlSet -&gt; Control -&gt; Print -&gt; Printers 
<br />
<br />Find the printer in the list and remove it completely from the list with any related subkeys.
<br />
<br />Do not delete Microsoft Print to PDF,  Microsoft XPS Document Writer, or Send to OneNote.
<br />
<br />After deleting the corrupted key entries, reboot the system, go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Printers and Scanners, find the printer to right click and delete it. It should be removable now.
<br />
<br />Reinstall printer with default settings and drivers and test.

<p>Hi</p>
<p><span><span><span>If these are&nbsp;red circle icons with the white exclamation point, they&nbsp;are called<span>&nbsp;</span>'Status Icons'<span>&nbsp;</span>and are found in some
 backup products. The following websites show the red exclamation point status icons with a description of how they are used.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Symantec System Center antivirus (also other Symantec products)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/ent-security.nsf/docid/2001031510414248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/ent-security.nsf/docid/2001031510414248</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Some McAfee products also use the Mozy software for online backup that will display these status icons. There may be other products that also
 use these icons.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If this is a Mozy issue, you can get rid of the "red circle with a white exclamatiom mark" icon
 extras by going into Mozy's Configure, then disabling the Icon overlay.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Please see the following links for the information.</span></span></span></p>

<p>The problem has been solved. &nbsp;It looks like McAfee updated itself to include a Mozy backup which in turn put the ! marks on the icons.</p>
<p>Going into McAfee gave an option to backup the files online. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This has now removed the ! marks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

 it should drive pretty well similar to Dirt 2 I hope so that is.<br />

<p>It's a good game but I'm just about to trade.</p>
<p>I have constant freezes too, in the first week I had the game I lost a save when it froze up whilst in multiplayer meaning I had to start over again - not too bad because I was only a short way in. Since then I have a lot of lock up's requiring a restart
 of the box but haven't lost a save again yet.</p>
<p>I have it installed to a 250gb slim btw which is only a few months old. I've swapped the disc and have no lock up's on other games.
</p>
<p>As I said it is a good game but it's just too annoying for me now.</p>

<h2>            Skype Numbers</h2>

I see confusing comments about them. I an in the USA and would like to know:<br />
<br />
1 If I take the $3.99 United States and Canada Subscription does that provide a number for both incoming and outgoing calls at no additional cost? What exactly does the subscription give?<br />
<br />
2 Are there hidden costs such as usage and taxes on top of the base subscription price?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 Does the Skype number work over a WiFi only connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 Can I use the Skype number on both my desktop and Android device? (I seem to be able to do this with Skype to Skype calls and Skype credit now but do not have a Skype number).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is all basic stuff but need to be positive of what I am getting. What AI want is to be able to call out and accept calls in to my Skype account and have a number to give for calling in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>If you attempt to purchase it, it will list the current rate and discounts. The monthly rate is $6.50 USD a month for a Skype Number. If you purchase a calling subscription you would add that to your overall monthly cost.

<p>

</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Proxy server or proxy is an application-level gateway which

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Proxy servers help improve web performance by storing a copy of frequently used webpages. When a browser requests a webpage stored in the proxy

                    <p>I've upgraded to windows 8 pro. I've been able to download apps fine. But I can't seem to update or download apps like Music, Video, Games, And Smartglass. They just end up stuck at a certain point, most common 66%. I've tried signing in and signing out,

            <p><span>Hello Derka Derk ,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Answers Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you have issues in updating apps. Let us start with couple of questions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any proxy server configured?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any third party security software installed?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run Windows 8 App troubleshooter to diagnose and fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a> to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If you are using Microsoft account, then I would suggest you to switch to Local user account and then check how Mail app works.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to switch to a ‚ÄúLocal User account‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press ‚ÄúWindows key +W‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type ‚Äúusers‚Äù without quotes in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Then select ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù from the left panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You will get an option ‚ÄúSwitch to a Local account‚Äù right below your user account name.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select ‚ÄúSwitch to a local account‚Äù option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Enter the required details.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Then login to the local account and check how it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps to fix your issue.
</span><span>If you continue to face issues updating and installing app then reply to this thread, we will be glad to assist you further.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sathish S V,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your questions, 1: no and 2: not yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When attempting method 1 it stated there were no issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When attempting method 2 the problem continues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated it is just Microsoft apps. I can install other apps just find. The problem varies though I've noticed. Sometimes it will just be stuck saying pending. other times it gets stuck at a certain point.
</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>

            <p>I have the same issue with 2 Microsoft apps, the Music&nbsp;and Video apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can download, update and&nbsp;uninstall any other Windows Store apps, except these 2 apps which always say Pending (and occasionally Downloading) when I try to update them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The apps still run ok but display a message saying there's a new version available from the Store when I launch them.&nbsp; I've tried uninstalling them and installing them again and I just get the old version back.&nbsp; I've also tried uninstalling them from the
 other account on the PC so no other versions are hanging around.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I'm not sure if Windows keeps a separate copy of the app for each user's profile (which would possibly allow different versions to exist on the PC at once) or whether it holds a single copy like it does with most desktop apps.</p>

<p>It found a database issue (possible corruption), fixed it and then the app updates installed successfully.&nbsp; Hope this works for you.</p>

            <p>After spending multiple hours troubleshooting, I found out this was an issue with my router. Once I bypassed the router,&nbsp; the apps loaded just fine. I don't know why this is the case, because only the Music and the Games apps had issues...all the rest of
 the apps loaded with no problems. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was a consistent issue that I found across two W8 PC's and my new Surface RT. In short, not a W8 problem at all, but something to do with the configuration of my router. I discovered the solution when I took my Surface RT to McDonalds and it installed
 the Music and Games apps quickly and with no problems over the free Wi-Fi there.</p>

            Great, you will be able to remove that using Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Close all other open windows when doing this:
<br />
<br />Note down the Identifier for the boot item you want to remove - please be very exact
<br />
<br />Then you need to run this command (replacing the identifier) and then hit Enter
<br />
<br />bcdedit /delete {identifier} 
<br />
<br />So for example your command will look like this:
<br />
<br />bcdedit /delete {730ab459-b062-11e0-84f1-fa307df851c2}
<br />
<br />
<br />When you have finished removing the erroneous entry, run bcdedit to make sure it is gone

<h2>            Dead Rising 3</h2>
                    
<p>Me l'avevano detto tutti che era un giocone ma un po' perch√® ne avevo altri sottomano, un po' per l'uso del kinect che non mi si addice, dopo averci giocato i primi 2 minuti e non essendone colpito, l'ho lasciato in disparte per questi 2 mesi.</p>
<p>Finito tutto il resto o quasi l'ho ripreso in mano, dopo aver eliminato alcune funzioni kinect dalle opzioni.</p>
<p>STRAGIOCONE!</p>
<p>La grafica √® ottima, specie in considerazione del fatto che su schermo si muovono miliardi di zombie senza alcun ralllentamento.</p>
<p>La storia √® come sempre molto ben ideata.</p>
<p>I nemici fuori di testa, la combinazione di armi possibili al limite dell'esilarante.</p>
<p>Per ora √® il gioco migliore uscito per ONE, probabilmente il miglior gioco di nuova generazione in assoluto</p>

<p>Scherzi a parte...i controller della One sono i peggiori (come assemblaggio e qualit√†) che io abbia mai avuto.</p>
<p>Uno l'ho gi√† cambiato, la parte inferiore destra scricchiolava e mostrava un fessura anomala.</p>
<p>Attualmente ne ho uno dove il tasto LB sembra che abbia la molla "stanca", nel senso che ha un gioco pazzesco.</p>
<p>Posso dire che per 55 Euro, costo medio di un controller della One, potevano sbattersi di pi√π?</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hello George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you facing the same issue,&nbsp;if&nbsp;you use a headphone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, third party software settings as well can cause this kind of issue, check if there is any 3rd party software related to sound enhancement, if its there then uninstall and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Try the audio troubleshooter which can diagnose and fix common sound playback and hardware problems. Follow the link below to do the same.<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=260596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=260596</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Check in Windows Update if there are any&nbsp;important as well as optional updates, they might be hardware&nbsp;driver update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Also, try to check the issue in Clean boot state because, <span>p</span>utting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned
 below to perform a Clean Boot. <span>Refer to the link to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>How to <span>pe</span></span></strong><strong><span><span>rform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><span><em>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting</em><strong><em>.</em></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. Otherwise, feel free to write us back and we will be glad to help you ahead.</span></p>

<p>Make it a thread not a petition. I could not care less. I have games where I have 1 achievement and will not go back to them. People should worry about other things not the ability to delete games off you list. And the reason why it will never happen is
 because then when people get hacked or phished their game history will be wiped by the hackers.</p>

<p>If this is the case, then I should have been asked to edit the post accordingly. Either way this is still a major issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real issue here is that I am calling out a lack of quality control on Microsoft and the Developers parts and they want to silence me for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh and the private corporation in question is currently residing within said government meaning that said private corporation has to abide by federal law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have studied the Constitution very well, all states, cities, citizens and any organization that reside within the boundaries of the United States and its territories must abide by federal law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cant just say your private and think that gives you a free pass and don't have to obey the law..</p>

<p>I would like to think that would be the way to go but I will just be silenced again. Funny how when I strike a nerve and call out quality control issues all the Xbox Live Ambassadors are quick to run to Microsofts defense.</p>

<h2>            Sri Lanka Calls on Skype</h2>
                    <p>I have a global plan, I have always had a global plan and could call Sri Lanka - why can I sometimes call Sri Lanka and other times it states not covered under subscription and top up US$5 or $10? &nbsp;Which global plan covers Sri Lanka ? &nbsp;I call both Skype
 to phone and Skype to Mobiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your systems advises using the India plan - choice of 3 but India is NOT Sri Lanka, so does the India plan cover Sri Lanka? your information is really not clear and should be made clearer and more user friendly.</p>

                    For several weeks now I have been unable to access my Money 2007 file.&nbsp; When I type in my Windows Licve ID and password, it says they are incorrect, which is not true as I use them all the time to access the internet and my e-mail.&nbsp; So I went to Microsoft
 and downloaded Microsoft Money Plus Deluxe Sunset&nbsp; thinking it was support problem related to a discontinued program, namely MS Money 2007.&nbsp; (I&nbsp; am running Windows XP as my operating system, by the way.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, that wasn't the problem.&nbsp; Yes, I can get into
 the new program, but I cannot import my existing money 2007 file into it.&nbsp; There is still that Live ID/password conflict.&nbsp; Why is this happening?&nbsp; I notice others have been having the same problem.&nbsp; I've tried changing my Live ID to no avail.&nbsp; It appears that
 the correct ID/password combination is embedded into the back-up file and the program will not accept it.&nbsp; Is there a way to un-embed them from the file so i

            Hi VP-04
<br />
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Turn off all unnecessary startup applications and processes: 
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager 
<br />Click on the Startup Tab 
<br />See any non-essential items are listed there 
<br />If so, select and click 'Disable' 
<br />Close Task Manager 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type msconfig and hit Enter 
<br />When the System Configuration dialog opens, click on the Services Tab 
<br />Check the box marked 'Hide Microsoft Services' 
<br />In the remaining list, see any non-essential items are listed there, uncheck any you find 
<br />Click Apply and OK 
<br />
<br />Turn off all unnecessary Background Apps 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Privacy - Background Apps 
<br />Turn off any App you do not need running in the background 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />If you want to remove that Sign-in process in Windows 10:
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and leave the new password box blank 
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />In the resulting dialog, uncheck the option 'Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer box' 
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />That's It!

            Thank you for the lightning fast answers!&nbsp; I'm going to try these solutions. A techie from a well known office store told me to restart the computer and if that doesn't work to reset the computer which sounds scary and I don't want to do. Many thanks!

            I'm having similar problems with my Windows 10 Dell PC running slow because of too many Microsoft programs running in the background, especially some I never use.&nbsp; I have gone into Services numerous times to DISABLE "Microsoft Office Click-to-Run Service"
 but somehow it keeps turning itself back on to Automatic.&nbsp; This has been so frustrating!&nbsp; There are several Microsoft Office products I don't use which I would like to completely disable from starting up.&nbsp; The only one I currently use on occasion is Word.&nbsp;
 Does anybody know how to completely DISABLE some of the unnecessary Microsoft programs that start automatically &amp; run in the background?&nbsp; I would appreciate any help that I can get.&nbsp; Thanks!

<h2>            Can I legally create a device that registers as a XUSB device&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before doing anything, I wanted to check with the community/Microsoft to see if I can legally do this without violating any user agreement or the like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking at creating a device that when plugged into a windows PC registers as a XUSB device. I want the device to look like an Xbox 360 controller. (I could buy a 360 controller but I want to create a custom, specialized case).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would I be able to use a USB sniffer program and reverse engineer the XUSB communication protocol for my device? And then program my device to effectively function as an Xbox 360 controller?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it turns out that others are interested in my device, would I be able to sell on the market? Or is the XUSB protocol proprietary to Microsoft and I would need to enter into some agreement with Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As another side note, I am very much aware the the XInput API does contain a provision for the HID standard and that DirectInput is another avenue that I could take. However, I would like to first explore the XUSB option first even though it might take more
 work.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what this means exactly? The file usb.inf is there and it's in this folder: C:\Windows\winsxs\amd64_usb.inf_31bf3856ad364e35_6.1.7600.16788_none_26f0611328209ab7 which seems to be where it belongs if I understand the cbs.log correctly.</p>
<p>Here's a full copy of cbs.log (about 80 mb): <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=ad21efaa9e457a33&amp;resid=AD21EFAA9E457A33!102&amp;authkey=KcjwRZZsquU%24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Any specific solution for this? All I could find on the web is general advice like restarting windows update and so on. But from the log it should be possible to determine what's really causing the trouble?</p>
<p>Where does Windows Update expect the file to be if it cannot find it? Or maybe I can tell Update to ignore that file?</p>
<p>Also am I missing something important without the SP1? I don't feel like reinstalling Windows if it's impossible to install SP1...</p>

<p>Installing Windows 7 SP1 resources:</p>
<p>Which method are you using to install the Service Pack, Windows Update or .exe download from Microsoft Downloads?</p>
<p>If possible, boot into Safe Mode, and do a System Restore before you installed the Service Pack and reference the information I have provided below with instructions about how to install Windows 7 SP1.</p>
<p>Microsoft released the first beta back in June 2010 followed by a Release Candidate late October 2010 and the final RTM availability (February 16 2011 MSDN/TechNet subscribers) and public Availability (February 22 2011). Unlike previous Service Packs, Windows
 7 SP1 does not contain any major improvements; it‚Äôs basically a rollup of updates that have been released for the operating system since it went to manufacturing July 22 2009. If you have been diligently updating your computer through Windows Update since
 then, you basically have all that SP1 has to offer.</p>
<p>Windows 7 SP1 is provided in two ways, either as a full .ISO file download weighing in at 2.4 GBs or as an update available through Windows Update. The .ISO file contains SP1 code for different processor architectures such as x86, x86-x64 and Itanium systems.
 Because I have a mixture of 32 and 64 bit systems, I went with the .ISO file. Whichever method you choose, here are some tips for ensuring a smooth installation.</p>
<p>* Getting Windows Update errors with Windows 7 SP1? MS notes "inconsistencies," provides fix:
<a href="http://is.gd/22brle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://is.gd/22brle</a></p>
<p>* 1. Click on Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories, and right-click on Command Prompt.</p>
<p>2. Choose Run As and select an Administrator account.</p>
<p>3. At the command prompt, type net stop cryptsvc and wait for the service to stop.</p>
<p>4. Type CD\ and press Enter.</p>
<p>5. Type CD windows\system32 and press Enter.</p>
<p>6. Type ren catroot2 catroot3 and press Enter.</p>
<p>Other solutions:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don‚Äôt want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.</p>
<p>2. Backup ‚Äì you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy tobackup your computer . The built in system imaging and backup and restore
 center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed
 up and tucked away from pre-release code.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/</a></p>
<p>3. Don‚Äôt do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don‚Äôt install the Service Pack right away. Do it in
 your off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.</p>
<p>4. This brings me to another point, which is, don‚Äôt install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it‚Äôs a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you
 have a UPS connected, you just don‚Äôt know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.</p>
<p>5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven‚Äôt experienced
 the issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which
 is based on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.</p>
<p>6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:</p>
<p>* Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>* Accept User Account Control permission</p>
<p>* If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>* On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</p>
<p>* Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</p>
<p>* Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</p>
<p>* Click OK.</p>
<p>* When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>* After the computer starts, proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:</p>
<p>* Click Start</p>
<p>* Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD</p>
<p>* Click ‚ÄòRun as Administrator‚Äô</p>
<p>* At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f</p>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>

<p>Check your hard disk for errors, Another obscure thing you could try is disabling User Account Control temporarily.</p>
<p>Install the drivers for your LAN adapter (Wireless, Ethernet or Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Its possible you might need to do a BIOS update if one is available for your computer. Also, check for any updated chipset drivers.</p>
<p>Also, disconnect any non-essential devices you might have attached to the system.</p>
<p>Its possible the SP1 download might be corrupt, I would download another copy and try again.</p>

            Hi Yasiru, <br />
licensing is a legal conception and cannot be verified by technical methods. Microsoft says in EULA: Successful activation does not confirm that the software is genuine or properly licensed.
<br />
However you may check whether Windows 10 was preinstalled on this PC running a built-in command
<br />
wmic path softwarelicensingservice get OA3xOriginalProductKey <br />
(need to be run from Windows PowerShell (administrator). If it will show a 25-letter key - Windows seems to be legal.

    <title>After New Experience update, Xbox will not turn off my projector. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> x219c  say:</h3>
<h2>            After New Experience update, Xbox will not turn off my projector.</h2>
                    
<p><span>First, let me say how useless the chat support has been. I have spent HOURS just trying to explain the problem to them. Then it's the useless responses: restart, factory reset, offline update tool... etc. I have wasted so
 much time trying to either A: solve my problem. Or B: Get the problem to the right area so it can be worked on. At this point, I'm really trying for B, at one of the support people's request. Apparently, they're so useless, they want us to put in tickets for
 them. I'm not exaggerating. He literally told me he can't report problems with the update and to report it here.</span></p>
<p>The problem: My Xbox no longer turns my projector off, despite having the "send power toggle twice" option turned on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The background: I use my Xbox with a Pioneer SC-67 A/V receiver, and Optoma HD131xe projector.
<strong>Until the new update to bring backwards compatibility and the new interface... I had absolutely zero problems</strong>:
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">It turned everything on and off without failing, ever</span>. After the update, it now appears to send either one power command to my projector, or two which are too close together. In either case, my projector registers
 only one command received, prompting me to press "power" again to power off my projector. I then need to use my actual remote to power off my projector. It does still control my A/V receiver reliably.</p>

<p>I have this exact same issue, but with an Epson projector. The problem can be resolved if you disable the instant on function. I believe the issue is the fact that the xbox sends the first power signal, then cuts the hdmi signal, then sends the second power
 signal. When the hdmi signal is cut, it cancels out the first power signal, making me press power on the projector remote once to get it all the way off.

<em>(call from a Skype account to another Skype account) </em>anywhere in the world. If you are both using Skype, the call is completely free.&nbsp;You just need to make sure that:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The contact or person you are calling is online. </li><li>Both of you are using the latest version of Skype; </li><li>and that both of you are using a strong and stable connection. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need additional information or assistance.
