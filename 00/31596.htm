<h2>            My computer just upgraded to microsoft 10, lost all my files, photos ect on my dest top.</h2>
                    When my computer did an auto update to windows 10 I lost all my files, photos and folders on my desktop, some of these items are irreplaceable what can I do to restore these. I have tried to go to restore points but these were cleared during the upgrade.
 this up grade was conducted without my consent and was not aware that it was going to take place, given no notice at all. I need my files back.

<p>Open File Explorer and click on This PC.</p>
<p>Open C drive, and there should be a file called Windows.old</p>
<p>Open it and with any luck your files and pictures should be there in the same path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little piece of advice:</p>
<p>Firstly do NOT keep valuable documents, pictures etc on your desktop. The Desktop is not designed for that, which is why you have a Documents folder and a Pictures folder. Make shortcuts for ease of access, but do not store the actual files there.</p>
<p>Secondly, you really really must have a REGULAR backup process in place. What would happen for example if your HDD suddenly died, or your laptop was destroyed in a fire?</p>

<p>Were these files, photos and folders on your desktop, or were shortcuts to them on your desktop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming the latter, do a search for some of them. It may be that just the shortcuts were lost and the files are still on your drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the files themselves were on your desktop, you're probably out of luck. But for the future, two points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You should never put files on the desktop. Put nothing but shortcuts there. It's easy to recreate a shortcut if you lose it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You apparently don't do regular backups of your data to external media. If that's the case, you've been playing with fire.
<span><span>Almost everyone should be backing up regularly. It is always possible that a hard drive crash, user error, nearby lightning strike, virus attack, even theft of the computer, can cause the loss of everything on your drive.
 As has often been said, it's not a matter of whether you will have such a problem, but when.</span></span>

<p>Ken thanks for the info, was not aware that the upgrade would wipe my desktop and restore points,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would have been nice to know that the update was going to happen, could have moved some of the photos of my Dad, Brother and Mother in Law, they are no longer with us and now those memories are gone as well.</p>

<p>Look for a windows.old folder on your hard drive.&nbsp; You should find your old documents there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And totally agree with the other posters, moving forward have separate backups. Regardless of the rights and wrongs of things getting deleted during an upgrade and who's fault it is (much debate on these forums on that front!) what happened if the hard drive
 failed?&nbsp; Tech can go wrong, both hardware and software.&nbsp; As much as we can complain that it shouldn't happen and ooooh big bad Microsoft it does happen so we all need to take our own steps to protect against it.</p>

                    &lt;p&gt;I've recently installed windows server 2012 r2, which turns out to be the wrong product I was after and now cannot get out of the core mode and stuck looking at the command line. I've tried "Install WindowsFeatures Server-Gui-Mgmt -restart, but this
 only loads to 68% then fails as it cannot download the source files. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to remove Windows Server 2012 r2 and go back to the old windows 7 I had installed. Is there any documents, or methods of removing windows server 2012 r2 or restoring
 my old windows I'd like to know please. &lt;/p&gt;

<h2>            Import iPhone pictures to WIndows 8 by Date Pictures Were Taken</h2>
                    How can I&nbsp;import pictures by the date they were taken from my iPhone 5 to my Laptop which has Windows 8? Currently when I import pictures from my phone they are saved in a folder with the date that I'm importing, not the date the photo was taken.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have questions importing photos from IPhone to Windows computer. We will certainly help you with the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, by default the photos and videos are saved in the Pictures folder in a subfolder named with the date (for example, 2013-09-10). But, if you want to make changes with the pattern the files get saved.

</p><p>Also, you may try to&nbsp;refer to the article mentioned below as a workaround,&nbsp;to save photos in&nbsp;groups (folders) by DATE TAKEN instead of by date imported in bulk. Follow the suggestions by

</p><p>when the free Windows 10 upgrade came out I immediately upgraded and thought my daughter upgraded her laptop too. I just found out that she didn't, still using 8.1, and now she wants me to upgrade her computer. Microsoft wants to charge for the OS. Can I
 still get it for free or is it too late? I see websites offering but am nervous that they'd download adware, malware, or whatever. Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Windows 7 Downgrader will let downgrade popular editions such as Windows 7 Ultimate, Enterprise, Professional quickly and easily. Once it downgrades, all you need to do is insert the Windows 7 installation and do a repair upgrade to a desired edition. Lets
 take a look at how to do it. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You can download Windows 7 Home Premium from the following link then create a bootable copy:</strong></p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Download Windows 10, 8, 7 ISOs</p>
<p><a href="https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-iso-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-iso-download-tool</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>First you need to download Windows 7 Downgrader <strong><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/download/159805048/Windows_7_Enterprise_Downgrade_by_MP7000.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">here</span></a></strong></p>
<p>Save the file to your hard disk and extract it. </p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/downgrade.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2fdowngrade_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d568%26amp%3bh%3d427" height="427" width="568" /></a></p>
<p>Double click the <strong>Windows 7 Downgrader </strong>executable (notice I currently have Windows 7 Professional installed)</p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/image45.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2fimage_thumb45.png%3fw%3d371%26amp%3bh%3d290" height="290" width="371" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, the Windows 7 Downgrader utility is quite simple. You have three options which will allow you to downgrade to any of three editions: Ultimate, Professional or Home Premium. Downgrading to Ultimate is useful if you are running
 Windows 7 Enterprise and would like release that license, but don’t want to go through the chore of backing up and install from scratch.
</p>
<p>Once you have identified the edition you would like downgrade to, click it. You might receive error message, click
<strong>Continue. </strong>Do not restart your computer. Insert your Windows 7 installation DVD for the edition you want to downgrade to. In my case, I am downgrading to Windows 7 Home Premium, so I will insert the Windows 7 Home Premium installation DVD.
</p>

<p>Click <strong>Install Now</strong></p>

<p>Click <strong>Upgrade</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/win7-step-5_thumb1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2fwin7-step-5_thumb1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d567%26amp%3bh%3d426" height="426" width="567" /></a></p>
<p>What you are doing now is a repair upgrade. </p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/upgraded.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2fupgraded_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d568%26amp%3bh%3d427" height="427" width="568" /></a></p>
<p>When the downgrade is complete, you should be successfully downgraded to the specific edition.

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think you can change the default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use the keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold">WinKey+Q</span></b><span> = Display the Search Bar with
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Apps</span></b> selected</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold">WinKey+W</span></b><span> = Search Bar with
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Settings</span></b> selected</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold">WinKey+F</span></b><span> = Display the Search
 Bar with <b><span style="font-weight: bold">Files</span></b> selected</span></p>

You would need to use a debit or credit card to pay for a subscription.</p>

    <title>Windows Management Instrumentation - causing massive freeze, stutter - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Management Instrumentation - causing massive freeze, stutter &#38; system overall slowdown.</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,<br />
<br />
It took me 14 hours today to debug this issue on my brand new system. The system goes as follows: AsRock Z390 Phantom Gaming iTX/ac, Core i9 9900k, 32 GB DDR4 3000 MHz XMP RAM, RTX 2080Ti, Samsung 970 Pro 512 GB [OS - Windows 10 Pro Genuine], Samsung 970 Evo
 2TB and PSU is SilverStone SFX-L Titanium SX800-LTI 800W, all is under mid-ranged water cooling from Aquacomputer and EK-WB, running on Dell Alienware 35 something something 2560 x 1080p display, meaning I'm no 4k guy juicing my PC. That said, the PC is a
 state of art HW, <em>shouldn't have</em> any issues of any kind whatsoever. I'm running newest BiOS on my motherboard [P1.50] and...<br />
<br />
After 14 long hours of debugging today, I found out that service called&nbsp;<strong>Windows Management Instrumentation</strong> is causing massive freezes, stutters and slowing down everything. When I move window in Windows Explorer, the cursor of the mouse "sticks"
 to the upper part of the windows, and I can move "another" cursor while the window is slowly moving like in slow motion.<br />
<br />
Also, opening My Computer, or any folder shared via SMB from my server is taking ages. Start works slowly, everything is terrible.<br />
<br />
When I <strong>disable</strong> in <strong>msconfig</strong>, or <strong>services.msc</strong> the Windows Management Instrumentation, I'm getting what I paid for. Fluent, near-light speed experience. As soon as I enable the WMi, hell breaks lose on my computer.<br />
<br />
Is this a known issue of Windows 10 Pro, 1809, Build 17763.379? Or is it something "at my side" and HW/FW specific?<br />
<br />
<strong>Also there's absolutely no high CPU usage, nor GPU usage, nor SSD, network, or any other usage. Everything runs up to 10-15% and hovers around 0%.</strong> It's just slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise<br />
<br />
With kind regards<br />
<br />
Bryan</p>
<p>
</p><p>//edit 1: I tried leaving it enabled, manually running it [it starts automatically] and it shows errors to literally every single process it works with in an Event Viewer log. The only way how I can use PC normally for now is to disable it completely, where
 Eset isn't working well with it disabled :/</p>

<p>Hey there dear Rohit Raina<br />
<br />
I was debugging this issue yesterday for 14 hours, today for 3 and I found it. WMi was incorrectly bridging communication among Eset Internet Security &amp; Malware Bytes Premium, putting my system into turmoil. After uninstalling of MBAM, everything runs buttersmooth.<br />
<br />
Your's was one of my first steps, although, it didn't point out to the problem. What did was trying to reset the WMi repo.<br />
<br />
By running elevated/run as admin cmd/powershell I went through these somewhere in the half of the whole process:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;<strong>winmgmt /verifyrepository</strong>&nbsp;This one told me there's nothing wrong with my WMi repo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. <strong>w</strong><strong>inmgmt /salvagerepository</strong></p>
<p>This one told me again there's nothing wrong with my WMi repo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. <strong>winmgmt /resetrepository</strong></p>
<p>This one told me that iP Helper &amp; MalwareBytes services cannot be stopped. This happened in normal mode [<strong>NOT</strong> safe mode, there it simply deletes the repo, it works for one restart and that's that, back in the circle of doom of slowness].<br />
<br />
That's what got me thinking, since <strong>Eset Internet Security</strong>, Samsung Magician and about 20 other programs which were giving out erros in event viewer, might be the culprit, since they're both AVS/AMS. [Antivirus System, Antimalware system].<br />
<br />
Today at work I confirmed it my my mind and at home, I ran my OS without WMi service running, uninstalled the
<strong>MalwareBytes Premium</strong> via <strong>Revo Uninstaller</strong>, restarted the OS, started the WMi via
<strong>msconfig</strong>, and did a few restarts.<br />
<br />
Well, the PC is blazing fast, immensly so.<br />
<br />
Thank You kindly for Your reply, I appreciate it a lot.<br />
<br />
With kind regards<br />
<br />
Bryan<br />
<br />
P.S.: <strong>Temps</strong> on my <strong>SSDs</strong> and in <strong>whole system went 10°C down</strong>. Wow, what a mess :). If I may, this is a bug on the
<strong>Malwarebytes side,</strong> or <strong>Microsoft side</strong> in their WMi service? My
<strong>SSDs were idling</strong> at around <strong>45 - 50°C</strong> and so was the
<strong>motherboard</strong> and <strong>CPU</strong> :/.</p>

            <p>Yea, I just download the user guide for the Pro 3 and no mention of where to store the pen. &nbsp;I was for sure, though, that the speaker in conference mentioned it for about a couple of seconds but did not demonstrate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not there, then there is no storage location for the pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People are going to lose those things and it happened with the Pro and Pro 2. &nbsp;Even if you did attached it to the newer power slot, it could still get bumped off and lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the tablets, best to get a case for them like you would for a laptop. &nbsp;I have a small 11" case that I keep my RT in along with all the accessories that works pretty good. &nbsp;I will be looking for a 12" plus sized case similar for the i3 Pro 3 that I will
 order and keep it in it. &nbsp;Those cases are dirt cheap and work pretty good.</p>

            <p>Thanks everyone for your quick replies. Guess I didn't explain myself well enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I attach the pen to the keyboard with the supplied loop (as it appears to be designed) I won't have access to the pen if I remove the keyboard from the Surface Pro 3. From past experience I anticipate using the pen in tablet mode and hence I would not
 have the keyboard and the pen with me. I can't seem to find a place to attach the pen loop to the Surface Pro 3 that it won't be&nbsp;blocking access to any of the ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I was looking for was has anyone found a solution to this dilemma short of putting the pen in my pocket?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Keep the keyboard attached and fold it back. &nbsp;The keyboards are designed to shut off when you do that to get them out of way. &nbsp;If you do that, there is an open area at the bottom to where you can clip on the pen and it won't be blocking any port and the
 pen is out of the way when you are doing other things. &nbsp;You won't lose the pen that way.</p>
<p>

<p>No it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SP3 doesn't have the power slot attachment SP2 does.&nbsp; However, the magnet connection is strongest on there and the pen will stick, but not as a permanent solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You get a little loopy flap that stick onto the keyboard to hold the pen.&nbsp; It's a pretty weak solution on MS's part, imo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pen does fit nicely on the cover betwixt the magnet and keyboard - where the fold area is.</p>

            <p>Yea, that is what I mentioned above regarding the keyboard.&nbsp; I had found the user guide for the Pro 3 buried on Microsoft's web site and there is no designated location for pen storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty pathetic and makes it very, very easy for a pen to get lost.&nbsp; With the newer type 3 cover, that excess flap space next to the connector (when you fold the keyboard to the back) makes for a temporary place to clip the pen to get it out of the way.&nbsp;
 Other than that, there is nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get mine, I plan on getting a small bag for it to keep everything in it.&nbsp; Personally, I wouldn't use the pen 99% of the time anyway and the pen can just stay in the bag.</p>

<h2>            All my inbox, sent items, junk mail and deleted mail have all gone after computer automatic shutdown</h2>
                    <p>While working on my PC there was a sudden glitch and the screen said that there had been an error and was in need of restart which began automatically. Have not seen this before</p>
<p>When the PC had rebooted I then went into my Windows Live Email and <strong>all my inbox, sent items,junk mail and deleted mail had been lost.
</strong>One sent email from 2014 remained and 20 odd random deleted items. There was not even an inbox folder listed anymore. There was a folder of 'recovered items' that I hadn't noticed before but again all the recovered items were empty and there was only
 about 30 of them&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contacts were still there and some random drafts.</p>
<p>This could be a disaster for me if I can't recover them</p>
<p>Help</p>
<p>I'm not even sure if this message will send</p>

            It sounds as if the 'glitch' caused a corruption in the message database index. This is quite a robust database, which can usually recover from corruption without data loss. When this happens, the database will move orphaned messages to the folder called
<em>Recovered items </em>in Storage folders. You can see which folders have been recovered by pressing Ctrl-Y, which reveals the entire folder tree.

            Thanks. For some reason my Mail now shows&nbsp; "Archived Folders" which is only showing my recent emails. Looks like I've lost my inbox, sent items, Contacts, junk emails etc.&nbsp; It also has another "Archived Folders" in the list and this only shows emails up
 to 4 years ago. Where are those from then to now? Thnx.

<p>Windows Live Mail does not create or populate <em>Archived Folders</em>, so they come either from your mail server via IMAP, or else you're using some other program.

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the following steps to Turn ON the auto rotate function.<br />
<br />
</span><span>a</span>: Right click on an empty space on the desktop and click <strong>
Personalize.</strong> <br />
<span>b:<strong> </strong></span>Then check the option <strong>Allow the screen to Auto-rotate.</strong><br />
<span>c</span>: Then click <strong>Apply</strong> and then <strong>ok.<br />
<br />
</strong><span>If the issue still persists, then </span>I suggest you to check the tablet manual to turn on Auto Rotate. &nbsp;If the issue still persists, I suggest you to contact device manufacturer support for further help.</span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
Please post back if you have any issues related to Windows and we will be glad to assist you further.
</span></span></p>
<span><br />

<p>Good to know would be if you play Gears of Wars on the old 360 or the new XBox one.</p>
<p>In the one I have now and then also the problem. Since stored on my two profiles, I have to load both, however, the game itself with only one, or even with two games.</p>
<p>If the problem occurs every time, I would look again at your place, whether really the correct profile was loaded.</p>
<p>If this is not the case, simply remove the profile and save the actual game as usual.</p>
<p>This should in theory at any rate, the problem to be solved. If this is not the case, you can easily like report again.</p>
