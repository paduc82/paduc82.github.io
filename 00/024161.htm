<h2>            Account sign-up won&#39;t accept my domain name</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to sign-up for a new Microsoft account using an email address on my owned, personal domain name. When completing the email address field, I am told "You can't sign up here with a work or school email address." which seems to indicate the
 domain name is associated to some form of a Microsoft tenant organization. &nbsp;I own the domain, this is not the case (though I did do an Office 365 trial a while back). I have other accounts created on this domain name and when signing in I indicate they are
 "personal" accounts, not work/school accounts. &nbsp;But because of this incorrect identification of my domain name, I am unable to sign up new accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Level 1 support has not been able to understand my issue. I can accept that, but I need to get this escalated to someone who can help.</p>

<p>Neither of the above is applicable to the question.</p>

</p><p>However, this issue is now resolved and I'll document the problem for anyone else that may encounter it.&nbsp; In 2014, I trialed Office 365 for Business using the domain name in question.&nbsp; I ended up not subscribing and the trial went to a cancelled status.
 It appears that when the trial cancels, the domain name is not removed from Azure AD services. Upon logging into the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com), I navigated to Azure Active Directory &gt; Domain names, removed the domain in question as primary by
 promoting the onmicrosoft.com placeholder, and was then able to remove the domain from Azure AD. Once completed, Microsoft no longer thinks I host services with them and I can sign up for accounts using the domain name.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 wastes more screen space than outlook 2010 or 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 wastes more screen space than outlook 2010 or 2007</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>I use reading panes, and like it on the bottom. &nbsp;But in 2013 the header is MUCH bigger and there does not seem to be anyway to change the headers in the preview pane.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I try to scan 100's of emails at a time. &nbsp;If I more the reading pane to the right, then I don't have enough room for the "from" "subject" "receive" to fit on one line.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) &nbsp;Is there a way to reduce the reading pane header footprint? &nbsp;In fact I don't need to see the header information at all (or it can come from the bottom). &nbsp;Logically&nbsp;I can see sender/subject by seeing which message I've clicked on and do not need to
 see it again - and then a worthless picture icon.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2) &nbsp;Anybody else struggling with what feels like a downgrade for Outlook? &nbsp;I know many users say that with new upgrades, but this really feels bad.</div>

            I came here looking for a way to save space in outlook 2010... On a 14 inch portable, every pixel counts. I disabled the useless people pane, but there is still tons of waste!
<div><br />
<div>for example, I wish there was a way to make ribbon icons smaller in size. The top bar that shows your email address, total waste of space. The heading of every message - so much mostly useless info taking so much space, what were the devs thinking?</div>

            <p>Same here, a &nbsp;lot of wasted space.</p>
<p>On Excel the top of the window to where the cells start was very little in Office 2003, in Office 2010 it was about 177 pixels, in Office 2013 it is about 208 pixels (WITHOUT added functionality. In fact: The formula bar used to expand automatically in 2003
 if the text could not fit into it, now it doesn't...) and all of this is carried on across the whole office suite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS: WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MY SPACE? </p>
<p>I don't think I will use a touch screen in the office for the next 10 years at least. I can see no advantage of having smudges on my screen. The distance from keyboard to mouse is already too big, and troublesome if you work a lot. So why should I want to
 reach up to a Monitor that is even more difficult to reach and I need more effort (lifting my arm up).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So PLEASE stop trying to suit customers you don't even have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Privately I am still using Office 2003 or Open Office, no upgrade needed, except the filters in Excel I am not missing a single bit of features there!)</p>
<p>PLEASE add an option on future updates to remove that white space (and give me some more contrast, you are hurting my eyes still (even with dark grey background enabled).</p>
<p>Outlook still has no decent outgoing message filtering which my Eudora Mail from Year 2000 can do just fine or even better than Outlook in some regards.</p>

            <p>This is an ancient topic, but since it is one of the first things that pop up, I know there are going to still be people like me stumbling across it. I have found three things that can be done in order to get the space usage back close to the level of Outlook
 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first is straightforward but can be missed at first. In the bottom right corner of the header pane, there is a button with a chevron that can be used to collapse the header back to the size it was in Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second is a little less straightforward but still easy. On the "View" tab, under the "Arrangement" section, click on "Message Preview" and set it to "Off".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third is buried in the Outlook options and will only get you a little space. Click on the "File" tab, select "Options", then go to "Advanced". Under the "Outlook panes" section, click "Navigation", check the box for "Compact Navigation", and then click
 the "OK" button. This will compact the Navigation Bar and move it under the Folder Pane where it used to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

<h3> joaquin galvez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Partial Exports and BackUp on Outlook 2011 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I've been using over years the *.pst files system on Windows to save all the mails of a year and then open this file when you need to review an issue. It was plenty flexible and export and import
 was incredibly easy. With Office 2011 for Mac this has become impossible and there is absolutely no way to export nothing but the whole amount of mails: no folders exports, no partial exports, no other protocols, only one total *.olm file. Thus, impossible
 to organize myself. I feel really frustrated and looking for any solution with no results. Anyone can help on that?</p>

            If you want to export just messages for 2011, create a Smart Folder "Date Sent" - "Any Date". (make sure you selected "All Mail".
<br />
<br />
After the folder populates, select the messages from 2011. Create and apply a category "Year 2011" to these messages.<br />
<br />
Under File &gt; Export select to export by category "Year 2011". You have the option to delete after exporting if desired.<br />
<br />
This gives you just messages from 2011 as .olm file. You have to import .olm files in order to view messages. Not the same as .pst file, but that's our option on a Mac.<br />
<br />
Another option is to drag a folder to the Desktop. This creates an .mbox file. Each folder and subfolder has to be dragged individually. Even a smart folder can be dragged as a .mbox file.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Some users create a second Outlook Identity to store the imported .olm files so they can be read by "Switch Identity".
</li><li>Other users will import the .mbox files into Apple Mail so they don't have to use "Switch Identity" to view.</li><li>EagleFiler is a third party option that will import files from Outlook where they can be easily viewed and searched.</li></ul>

            As search has greatly improved you'll find you need fewer folders and subfolders as we did previously.<br />
<br />
Try this...<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Duplicate your Identity in the Finder.</li><li>Open the duplicate and do the smart folder for all mail.</li><li>Assign a category to any mail older and newer than the year you want archived. I suggest the category "export"</li><li>Now, under File &gt; Export select to export by category &gt; "export". Select delete after exporting.</li><li>You are left with an Identity with only one year. Use File &gt; Export as .olm file. This gets all mail by folder.</li></ol>
<br />
You have to import the .olm file in order to view. I suggest you create an Identity and name it Mail Identity Year 2011 for example and import the .olm file into this Identity. I would also save the .olm file as backup.<br />

            <p>Hi Mukhtar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is specific to these websites, this could be due to add-on or compatibility view settings. Try the following steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Use Compatibility view </p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Open Internet Explorer </p>
<p>b. Click <strong>Tools</strong> and click<strong> Compatibility view setting</strong></p>
<p>c. Add these websites one by one and click <strong>OK</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Manage add-ons </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're missing an add-on that you need to view a page, Internet&nbsp;Explorer will let you know, and will prompt you to install the add-on. Some add-ons come pre-installed by other apps or your PC's manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To view installed add-ons:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Internet&nbsp;Explorer, select the <strong>Tools </strong>button , and then select
<strong>Manage add-ons</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Show</strong>, select <strong>All add-ons</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><strong>To turn add-ons on:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Internet&nbsp;Explorer, select the <strong>Tools </strong>button , and then select
<strong>Manage add-ons</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Show</strong>, select <strong>All add-ons</strong>.</li><li>Select the add-on, <strong>Enable</strong>, and then select <strong>Close</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My OneDrive is full and I am not able to delete any files because I get an error saying that storage is full and I should clear the recycle bin.&nbsp; I don't have anything in the recycle bin to delete.&nbsp; There is only 1 files that is causing the issue, it's an
 Outlook archive file.&nbsp; I tried deleting the old versions as well since it was archiving but with no luck.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error:</p>
<p><strong>This site has exceeded its maximum file storage limit.&nbsp; To free up space, delete files you don't need and empty the recycle bin.</strong></p>

            I already tried this and got no luck.&nbsp; It's like I need more disk space to delete a file, create a folder, rename a folder, etc.&nbsp; It doesn't make any sense why the system wouldn't allow me to delete a file because I am out of disk space.&nbsp; It is not a permission
 issue.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be that you're signed in to a different Skype account. You may access the reset password link for you to see if there's other Skype account under the same email address. To do&nbsp;this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Go to the&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset password</a>&nbsp;page.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Enter the email address you registered when you created your Skype account, and click "Continue". We will send you an email with a password token to reset your password.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Check your email inbox for an email from Skype entitled Password token. If you can’t find it, remember to check your junk or spam folders. The email can take up to 30 minutes to reach you and must
 be used within six hours.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Open the email and click the temporary code link, first. If the temporary code link does not work, that’s the time you can click the second link entitled enter the code manually.
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>• The “temporary code” link immediately takes you to another web page that will let you change the password.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>• The “enter the code manually” link takes you to a web page where you can enter the temporary code contained in the email. Make sure not to use the temporary code as the temporary password to sign
 in on your Skype application. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. If you have more than one Skype Name, reset the password for each account. Then, click on Reset password.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>6. Open and sign in to the Skype application via Skype name or email address. Locate the Skype account which has your Skype contacts and Skype Credits.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you have any further questions or clarifications.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you!</span></p>

    <title>Dependency tree not updating correctly when referring to a table&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hsarai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dependency tree not updating correctly when referring to a table&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I paste rows in to a table, some formulas that referred to a column in the table (like Sum(Table1[Column1])) does not recognize the new rows. Hitting F9 does not help, but doing a complete recalc with Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F9 does it. Dependency tree not updating?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example let's say the table contained the following values in Column1:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Column1</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sum(Table1[Column1]) returns 15</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I paste new values in to the tables and it looks like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Column1</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>now Sum(Table1[Column1]) returns 22, since it only recognized the first five rows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The odd thing is that this doesn't always happen, just sometimes. And as far as I can tell it's only happened in one workbook. So I haven't been able to pinpoint the cause of this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks, but like I said in my post I'm already aware you can do that and rebuild the tree. That's not the point of my question.

<h2>            Unchanged emails prompting to save changes</h2>
                    <p>If I Forward or Reply to an email in Outlook 2016 (16.0.8201.2102 on Windows 7) but make no changes to it in any way (open then immediately close), I get prompted "Want to save your changes". &nbsp;I do not want this prompt and until recently did not have it.
 &nbsp;I am opening emails many many times a day (to copy contents) so although this does not seem like a big issue, it is frustrating to have to add just one more step.</p>

    <title>Option to turn off Multiple Desktops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john582n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Option to turn off Multiple Desktops</h2>
                    <p>The multiple Desktop feature is great, and I can see how it would be useful to many people. However, for home use I would only use one Desktop and I am finding the "Add Desktop" a nuisance. Also the Multiple desktop feature might confuse some novice users.</p>
<p>I think there should be a option to turn off the multiple desktop feature, also perhaps asking on setup whether the user wants it on or off.</p>

            I would suggest you leave the book in Word. You can insert a page number in the header or footer using Alt+Shift+P, but if the problem is that you are not seeing the Page Numbers gallery in Word, see

<h2>            Header Issues with Word 2010</h2>
                    I have a new document I'm working on. I copied the text from a PowerPoint presentation we did last week to give the committee a narrative of our report. I have all the section breaks inserted (with Next Page) and the "Link to Previous" shut off, and yet
 when I start at the beginning and set the header for section 1, then I go to "Next Header" and select it and change the text...it changes ALL of them.
<br />
<br />
The footers are all linked, as I had no desire to change the formatting for that portion.<br />
<br />
I've tried saving it different ways, copied the entire document into Wordpad and saved it as ASCII text and reopened it...all with no luck.<br />
<br />
What is going on here? What has changed on Word 2010 that would make this such a PITA?<br />

            The Windows 10 upgrade does not reliably retain your software in working order. You may need to reinstall Office 2007.

            <p>I'm running Office 2007 on Windows 10 Pro and it works very well. I had to reinstall it from Office 2010 (Windows 7) because MS refused to honor my product code for Office 2010.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just as well. Word 2010 is a pile of junk compared to Word 2007. They introduced a ton of bugs and removed some very nice features. Typical! But I digress... :)</p>

            Yup! The .POTX file format is a template format. This won't really cause issue, but it might make it difficult to save future changes. Templates don't encourage overwriting the original template file and encourage you to save it under a different name.
 Again, this will work, but it's not the correct use of that file format.
<div><br />
<div>The PPTX I was recommending is located at the very top of the <b>Format</b>&nbsp;drop down when you choose
<b>File &gt; Save as...</b>. Alternatively, you might also try the .<b>PPSX </b>format. This is for a self-contained PowerPoint Show, which is perfect for sharing with other people.</div>

    <title>Bike Riding... Breakdown for Mountain Biking verse Road Biking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sean_flip  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bike Riding... Breakdown for Mountain Biking verse Road Biking</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering if anyone would like to see a breakdown in Biking for "Mountain Biking" verse "Road Biking"?<br />
<br />
Personally I would like to have them separated or identified differently since average speed, distance etc... Is very different between the two. &nbsp;When I look at average speed on my Bike summary and it's very low since I do more Mountain Biking. &nbsp;It would be
 a nice feature to filter by just "Mountain Biking" if I had an option to tag it that way. &nbsp;That way I could see if I am improving in the Mountain Biking space. &nbsp;The same would apply to "Road Biking", "Down Hill" etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After writing this out maybe what we need is the ability to specify a type of biking, so we could filter on that. &nbsp;I could see where "Down Hill" might be something another athlete would want to filter on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speaking of "Mountain Biking" verse "Road Biking" I have monitored both over the past 3 or 4 years and nothing scientific here, but based on how tired I feel, how long I spend and how many miles I cover it tends to be (2 - to - 1 favoring road). &nbsp;Basically
 I feel 1 Mountain Bike Mile is equivalent to 2 Road Bike miles probably slightly more. &nbsp;Just from a work put in to miles covered and time perspective. &nbsp;Understandably there are several variables to this based on terrain etc... Does anyone have thoughts on
 this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Sean</p>

            <p>My cycling computer (Bryton Rider 40) platform (not the computer it self) notices when I took routes offroad, and marks the ride as Mountainbiking after uploading, so I guess it would be simple to do the same in the MS Health platform.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree on the intensity. I just commuted using my 29er and I feel I've done a lot more work than with my road bike. No objective measurement though - yet.</p>

<h2>            Saving and moving info to MMC</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought a 6230i and have found almost no information about using an MMC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two most burning issues are ..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) how do I copy info from my phone memory to my MMC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) how do I make sure that in the&nbsp;future,&nbsp;when I save files on my phone (images or audio) that they get saved to my MMC and not to my phone memory?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p>Hi Mike;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) As for copying information (Files) from phone memory could be done once you have selected the file you want to move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eg: Moving an image from the phone memory to MMC</p>
<p>Select Menu&gt; Gallery&gt; Images&gt;*highlight the image you want to move* &gt; Options&gt; Move &gt; *Then it will open the Gallery again &gt; Select target folder &gt; Press middle key (move to)</p>
<p>Thats it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) As for making sure your information is saved to the MMC, you have to define the settings before hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eg: Saving your Photos taken from Camera directly to MMC</p>
<p>Select Menu&gt; Media &gt; Camera&gt; Options&gt; Settings&gt; Image Storage&gt; Other Folder&gt; * Then it will open the Gallery again&gt; Select the MMC (*if you have not renamed it you will see "NO NAME")&gt; press middle key (SET)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps :)</p>

<p>Hello Cheryl_Jean,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to this article to import data to Outlook for Mac 2011 client:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2413370/importing-data-into-outlook-2011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2413370/importing-data-into-outlook-2011</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it’s highly recommend that you upgrade to Outlook for Mac 2016 client for a better user experience.</p>

<p>Be sure Outlook is at version 14.7.7 before proceeding (Outlook menu &gt; About Outlook)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy the backup identity to the Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities folder in your Documents folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is the name of your default identity, the next time you open Outlook, it will rebuild the identity and you should be good to go. If you have more than one Identity, hold the Option key down when you start Outlook and set your copied identity as the
 default identity, then open it. Outlook will immediately rebuild it, and you should be fine.</p>

</p><p>I am not sure that it is possible to successfully use or rebuild an identity that is located on an external drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try, though. On your startup volume, the documents folder make an alias called Microsoft User Data that refers to the Microsoft User Data folder you copied or moved to the external drive.</p>

                    I can go on any site, just not google. Also I can't use the search function when I go to yahoo or bing.<br />
Somebody had the same problem a while back and were told to go to the location C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc to find a file called
<strong>Hosts</strong> and open it in notepad. There are only supposed to be a few entries but mine has tons, and most of them are google websites.&nbsp;There were no instructions as to what to do&nbsp;in the event of having all the extra entries.&nbsp;What's the next step
 in solving this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks&nbsp;

<p><span><span>Hey Joe_1919,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>You can use this “Fix it” to reset the hosts file back to default:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How do I reset the hosts file back to the default?</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Normally the hosts file shouldn’t have entries being written to it. After you reset the hosts file back to the default I would monitor it to make sure more entries
 aren’t written.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Remove an Office365 Group without Exchange license.</h2>
                    <p>We are in the middle of a Office365 test. We are testing with Office365 ProPlus licenses.</p>
<p>I have found something stranges...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A normal user can create a new Office 365 Group\Team. But the administrator cannot delete this group because their is no Exchange license in place... I will show it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a new group:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9c68b52-2590-4f9f-8c27-74feaf02e952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9c68b52-2590-4f9f-8c27-74feaf02e952" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a new group:</p>

<p>
</p><p>The new group is showing up in the admin portal:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But I (administrator) cannot remove or change the group...</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/436f28d6-0352-4b40-9fe5-298b83e6792c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/436f28d6-0352-4b40-9fe5-298b83e6792c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That means that user can create unlimiteds groups, inviting colleagues... And I cannot delete is...</p>

    <title>Password case sensitivity issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matteo fazioli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password case sensitivity issue</h2>
                    <p>The password for my Live account associated contains mixed case letters and I have&nbsp;two factor authentication enabled.<br />
</p>
<p>The live account is associated to my Windows 8.1 user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today totally by chance I've logged on to my Windows 8.1 typing the password with the CAPS LOCK on and I've been able to log in as well.<br />
I've repeated the test using only lowercase and I've been able to log in again.<br />
I've tried logging in my Outlook.com account from the web and the above procedure worked once more, except I've been correctly prompted fort the two factor verification code.<br />
<br />
Is this a normal behavior?<br />
<br />
Regards, Matteo</p>
