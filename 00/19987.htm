 contacts), it erases all my contacts from my phone. Help?<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's the deal:<br />
I have set up my WM6.5 standard phone (Samsung JACK) to sync with my home PC and my work PC. The other day I wanted to back-up my contacts to my home PC, but I don't want it to sync contacts on my work PC because then it will download the entire office directory
 - do not want.<br />
<br />
So I selected "CONTACTS" to sync while at home. I did it, it saved all my contacts to my PC, and now I'm happy.<br />
<br />
Trouble:<br />
When I went into options and un-selected "CONTACTS" it now has to remove all my contacts from my phone. Why??? It says that it has to remove all sync'd contacts to stop it from sync'ing in the future. That makes no sense, and is now causing me trouble.<br />
<br />
To get my contacts back on my phone, I sync'd it with my home PC. But, now I can't sync with my work PC because I can't remove CONTACTS from the sync list.<br />
<br />
This is also true with CALENDAR. I was thinking of trying to sync my Outlook calendar with GOOGLE Calendar, but to start a new sync with Google I have to unselect my calendar sync. If I do that, it removes all of my calendar items. THIS IS NO GOOD!<br />
<br />
How can I unselect something to stop it from sync'ing in the future but leave those items alone on my device and PC as they are.<br />
<br />
Help?</span></span> </span>

<p>Are you referring to deselecting something in ActiveSync on the phone or on the PC?&nbsp; If the former, are you using ActiveSync on the PC (with Windows XP) or Windows Mobile Device Center on the PC (Windows Vista or 7)?&nbsp; Are you synching with Outlook or with
 an Exchange mailbox?</p>

<p>I should have been more clear.</p>
<p>I am using ActiveSync 4.5 with Windows XP. &nbsp;I am syncing with Outlook.</p>
<p>If I try to deselect something in either the phone OR the pc, both give the same results. &nbsp;The items are removed from my phone. &nbsp;They remain on the PC, but are completely removed from the phone.</p>

            Odd.&nbsp; I can't reproduce it.&nbsp; If I deselect something, ActiveSync merely ignores it from then on.

<p>I have a similar problem.</p>
<p>I have a HTC touch pro 2 running WM 6.5.&nbsp; When I bought the phone I worked for company A, and synced the phone to my desktop.&nbsp; I no longer have access to that desktop, but my phone still thinks the contacts are synced to that computer (it was running XP,
 synced with active sync).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I open ActiveSync on my phone and go to uncheck the box that shows contacts synced to my old computer, it wants to delete all of my contacts.&nbsp; It opens a dialog box "This will delete all of your contacts" with "OK" and "Cancel".&nbsp; I always cancel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I want to do is sync those contacts from my phone to my new computer at company B.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello. From what I understand, the deletion is by design to protect against business users having sensitive info leave the company with the employee.</p>
<p>@Bill Katz</p>
<p>Since the Company A&nbsp;partnership is essentially useless to you now, you might as well delete it from the phone (Start&gt;programs&gt;Activesync&gt;menu&gt;options&gt;select the Company A PC&gt;delete). However, this partnership deletion will probably delete the info from the
 phone as well. So you need to backup your PIM info prior to deleting the partnership. Best way would be with the free program PIMBackup at<a href="http://www.dotfred.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.dotfred.net</a>. Make a new partnership with the&nbsp;Company B&nbsp;PC and select the desired
 sync options.</p>
<p>@MelloJoe</p>
<p>Same advice. The work partnership is useless to you. In your case you have to delete the partnership off the PC and the phone after proper PIM backup. Then remake the partnership, this time don't select contacts. I'm not sure what you mean about the calendar
 sync to Google. Google Sync is a separate app from Activesync. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So we should probably just use a 3rd party software to do a full backup, delete the partnership (which will delete all the info), restore from backup, then create a new partnership?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess that is the best solution I've heard so far. &nbsp;Thanks for the tips.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@Brian, thanks for checking. &nbsp;I really do appreciate your trying.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be a common issue, and I have tried various solutions. None work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Word on Office 2016 Professional plus, version 1812, build: 11126.20196.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Things I have done:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Created a folder named 'INetCacheContent.Word' for each user in appdata &gt; local &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows</li><li>Uninstalled and reinstalled Office 2016. I used the removal tool.</li><li>I had a look at the environment variables, and the TEMP variable points to C:\Users\Lee\AppData\Local\Temp</li><li>Regedit shows '<em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</em>' - Cache value as '<em>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache</em>'</li><li>&nbsp;Internet options show the temporary internet files location as '<em>C:\Users\Lee\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache</em>'</li></ul>

<h2>            CosmosDB bulk query</h2>
                    <p>I have Cosmos DB collection with set of documents in Persons Collection. I want to query Cosmos DB Collection by passing Batch of Persons data as input. For instance, I have below batch of 2 Persons data in JSON format and am passing batch of 2 Persons data
 from Postman client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "FirstName": "firstname1",<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "LastName": "lastname1",<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; },<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />
]</p>
<p>After requesting above JSON batch of data, my Web API Service will query Cosmos DB which will return results based on batch of FirstName, LastName and Zip matching data</p>
<p>When I search Cosmos DB Collection using batch of Persons as said above, I should be able to query Cosmos DB in batch rather than looping each Person data and returns results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to query Cosmos DB Collection in Batch?. Please let me know the pointers to achieve this?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your iexplore.exe files are located at:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe . . . (32-bit)<br />
and</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe . . . (64-bit)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create a shortcut to either of those for the desktop or Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To open 32-bit IE11, go to Internet Options&gt; Advanced and uncheck "Enable Enhanced Protected Mode" then use the 32-bit shortcut you created. If you do not uncheck Enhanced Protected Mode, you will probably continue to get 64-bit manager processes and either
 32-bit or 64-bit tabs, depending on the webpage content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have only one IE shortcut on the Start Menu, it's probably the 64-bit version. That's the default installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IE&gt; Help&gt; About doesn't provide bitness like it used to.</p>
<p>To see whether 32-bit or 64-bit IE10 has opened, open Task Manager (Ctrl+Alt+Delete&gt; Task Manager) and look at the Processes tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>64-bit IE10 will appear as iexplore.exe.</p>
<p>32-bit IE10 will appear as iexplore.exe *32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&nbsp;may see both processes &nbsp;with only 1 window and 1 tab open- the 64-bit Manager Process and a 32-bit tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get the 64-bit Manager Process to open automatically, go to Internet Options&gt; Advanced and check "Enable Enhanced Protected Mode." I've also seen reports that 64-bit IE10 cannot be accessed/run (using any method) if Enable Enhanced Protected Mode is not
 checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, in Internet Options&gt; Security, verify that Protected Mode is enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, from Control Panel&gt; Action Center, Change User Account Control Settings, verify that the slider is not set to "Never notify." If User Account Control is set to "Never notify" Protected Mode and Enhanced Protected Mode can't be enabled.</p>

            Don, thanks for the reply.&nbsp; My slider is down to "Never Notify."&nbsp; In the Internet Explorer files I have both icons.&nbsp; However, with both open, I do not have the one in Task Manager processes with the *32 icon.&nbsp; It looks to me that, for each icon in the
 Internet Explorer files, the same version opens regardless of which one I use to open it.&nbsp; "About Internet Explorer" displays no difference between 32- and 64-Bit, as it did with IE9.

 located one:&nbsp; 2147500036, from the IE11_main.log.&nbsp; The IE11_NR_Setup.log does not appear to have errors.&nbsp; That error code does not appear with the others on that page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that IE11 is installed, it did not go into an automatic restart as I expected.&nbsp; I think I will reboot anyway before installing the three updates available.&nbsp; There are now three windows open and four process in Task Manager, none of which for IE have
 *32.&nbsp; The top one is 64-bit, probably the one that opened automatically, where I am posting and which has a welcome tab about IE.&nbsp; I opened the other ones by clicking on the 32-Bit icon in Program Files (86).</p>

<h2>            What TTS Does Voice Aid Use To Read Contact Entries&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, The Voice aid application on some newer Nokia phones reads text on the display, and the phone's built-in voice engine synthesizes the entries in the phone's 'contacts list'. What TTS does Voice Aid use to read the contact entries? Could anyone kindly
 tell me: 1. What's the name of this built-in voice engine? 2. Is it available as a separate download/file? 3. Why isn't it selectable/detectable under the Menu, Tools, Speech? 4. Is there any way to make it appear under the above menu? (a Nokia programmer
 for sure can tell me these) Yours, bye

            The Message Reader feature of the Voice Aid reads unread English text messages, and the two default built-in voices (Martin and Ellen) which synthesize these text messages are selectable under the Menu, Tools, Speech. Although 'this hidden TTS' is built-in
 too, but it's not selectable under the Speech. I would like to select 'this hidden TTS' as the default voice under the Speech, and to make the Message reader read text messages using it. Could anyone tell me how is this possible? Yours

    <title>Mobo change invalidates 17133.1 update from activation. 0xC004C003 - - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mobo change invalidates 17133.1 update from activation. 0xC004C003 - Please....HELP&#33;&#33;&#33; LOL&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Need help with activation. Put in similar mobo to old one, but with more ram. Had to clean install 17127. Activation issue due to hardware change. Activation tech used remote access and entered a common Win 10 key. It worked for one day. After midnight,
 windows would not activate. Called again, was sent to Tech Support, who did the same thing with the same key. It worked for one day, then update to 17133.1. Have to activate again. Tech Support says they are not allowed to help Preview Insiders, so they sent
 me here to ask someone for help. Something else they said was that the key previously used had been used too many times. They also had me try my old Win 7 key that I had free upgraded from in 2015. Of course, no dice. I honestly have no idea what to do anymore.
 The tech even had the gall to say well it will mostly work unactivated….!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any one have any clue as to what to do? Troubleshooter just sends me straight to purchasing. I did link my Microsoft account, but the digital license is refused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Thanks to KeshkaKotera for a working solution: "<span>what I ended up&nbsp; doing was to wipe my op sys drive then use the MS media creation tool on a flash drive. Loaded box stock 10 which DID activate with my old windows 7 key. I logged in
 and checked fast ring in win update and was promptly upgraded to the latest version."</span></p>
<p>His advice is to use the MediaCreationTool to make a Windows install USB stick (has to be 8GB minimum). I only have 4GB USB, so I made an ISO and burned it to DVD. I ran the install, entered my Windows 7 Home key (since I did the free
 upgrade back in 2015), deleted the partitions and created new ones and did a Clean Install. In this case, W10H v1709/16299.125. It autoactivated immediately. Then I linked my MS account to the Insider Preview and let it download the current 17133.1 update.
 (Currently, in Progress). This has allowed me register my motherboard with MS and let the device (mobo) activate W10H.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also thanks to Colin Barnhorst for his gracious education and advice. Without him, I wouldn't have understood how the new activation process worked.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks to all of you for your help and understanding! :)</p>

<p>Your Windows 10 license is based on the unique IDs of the motherboard.&nbsp; That is what is registered with Microsoft.&nbsp; When you change the mobo, the unique IDs change of course and you have a different and unregistered device.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you replace a mobo with the manufacturer's recommended replacement part ("repair replacement"), you can transfer the old license to it.&nbsp; If you replace a mobo with a retail upgrade part ("upgrade replacement"), you have to purchase a new license and register
 the new device.&nbsp; For licensing purposes, the mobo is the computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>New mobo, new computer, new license required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think you have made a repair replacement or have further questions, please use the activation wizard (type "activation wizard" in Cortana/Search) or use the Get Help icon on your Start Menu to contact a Microsoft Answer Desk agent for help.</p>

<p>The license is not part of the software in Windows 10 so it doesn't matter whether you have installed an Insider or non-Insider copy.&nbsp; Insider previews do not have their own licenses (since July of 2015) and previews older than about six months will not
 start the device since they are all time-locked to an expiration date.&nbsp; The expiration date applies only to the Windows 10 build.&nbsp; It does not apply to the license, which is permanent for the life of the device (mobo).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device means the motherboard.&nbsp; Your problem has nothing to do with what build or version of Windows 10 is currently installed.&nbsp; The problem is that the unique hardware IDs of the new mobo are not yet registered so the device cannot activate any copy of Windows
 10.&nbsp; With Windows 10 the device activates Windows, not a product key.&nbsp; The product key is only used for the one-time registration of the device as a "registered Windows 10 device" on Microsoft's servers.&nbsp; After that, a product key is not needed to install
 Windows unless you are installing a different edition.</p>

    <title>SharePoint Landing Page - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Landing Page</h2>
                    <p>We have just implemented O365 SharePoint after 10 years of on premise usage and I'm struggling with a few setup issues. The most infuriating is I am trying to control the start point for anyone who clicks on the SharePoint Icon in the O 365 Apps List. This
 appears to be a customised, personal list of recent sites, favourites etc. and there seems no way to edit the page. I really just want to present a different URL to the initial portal site. Anyone have any ideas how this can be done, or at least how to modify
 the current landing page to make it more accessible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi David,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There is no out of box solution to change the page after clicking the SharePoint tile. This SharePoint home page is new experience for Office 365 users. End users can get more information from the new SharePoint home page (e.g. their following site, recent
 sites, the links added via tenant admin). To learn more, see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Find-sites-and-portals-in-Office-365-6b85097a-87e0-4611-a29a-dfd49b1a1220?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-GB&amp;ad=GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Find sites and portals in Office 365</a>.<br />

If you want redirect cx to another page or URL, you may <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-custom-tiles-to-the-My-apps-page-and-app-launcher-1136115a-75af-4497-b693-640c4ce70bc6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
add a custom tile to Office 365 app launcher,</a> and then let users add the custom tile to their app launcher. So, when users click this custom tile, it will redirect them to the URL or page which you add to the custom tile.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>:Users need to have Exchange Online licenses and enable their Exchange Online mail boxes.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As we discussed above, the new SharePoint home page (the page after cx click the SharePoint tile in the portal) is for both end users and admins. End users can see recent
 sites and following sites. Admins can add some links to the page. There is no out of box solution to directly change it.

<p><span>For your requirement, we suggest you submit feedback via

<h3> streetracer911  say:</h3>
<h2>            Belle FP2 QWERTY</h2>
                    
<p>I updated my Nokia 701 yesterday. Very pleased with the new swipe to unlock and the refreshed music player. However, the new QWERTY (copied from Opera Mini), is not as functional as the old one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the old one, I could quickly access the '?' by simply tapping the uppercase button. Only the '!' required going to the symbols page. The new layout does not have such quick access to the '?'. When using the uppercase button, the '.' and ',' stay the
 same. No '?' available there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my suggestion is this: Make the '.' and ',' change to '?' and '!' when in uppercase mode. Will really improve the functionality of typing chat messages.</p>

            And on the suggestions topic, here are two more:<br />
1. Add WhatsApp new message notifications in the drop-down menu, similar to how new SMS's are shown there.<br />
2. Add a 5th button at the bottom of the homescreen to quickly pop-up the task manager (as is available through purchase of 3rd party software). Would save a lot of time by simply pressing this button, than holding the menu button for a few seconds.

    <title>Delete and scroll keys 3x slower in Word 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> latlas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delete and scroll keys 3x slower in Word 2016</h2>
                    The delete and scroll keys repeat at a rate more than three times slower (166ms vs 50ms) than other keys in Word 2016. It is not a Windows 10 or office common issue as they are not slower in Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, WordPerfect, WordPad, etc. I have
 done the usual changes and the other keys are now as fast as 2010. Yes, I know how to &lt;Cnt&gt;Del for whole words and use pagedown.&nbsp; I use multiple word processors on multiple platforms and having a slow delete key throws off my timing when typing. Typing is
 my business. I can read and proof much faster scrolling than paging, but I think I could read out loud faster than this scroll speed. Does anyone know if there is a Word 2016 specific setting that is slowing down scroll and delete? &nbsp;

<p>Oh drat. On poking around to see if anything changed, I was delighted to see that the context menu now included auto-correct in this build. Then I realized that it was still the Add-in by Greg Maxey which had not been removed by a full delete and reload.

</p><p>I stopped the add-in and my keys sped up.&nbsp; Sigh. I will contact Greg to see if he is aware and has a fix.&nbsp; So not a Word problem, exactly. The fix recommended for one bug caused another. Now I have to choose between functions.

<h2>            Power Point and Open Type</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a suite of OpenType fonts to load onto Microsoft 10. I loaded them, and they are not working correctly in PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gave the department that has the Microsoft 10 a power point presentation that has the Helvetica NeueOpenType fonts being used from a PowerPoint for Mac program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how they are showing in the fonts pull down...I loaded 16 fonts. None of the Italic fonts loaded. HELP!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>attached is the way powerpoint shows the fonts, and the next photo shows how the fonts are listed in the folder that they were purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your HELP!!!</p>

<p>If you look at your original screen shot, you'll see <strong>HelveticaNeueLT Std</strong>,
<strong>HelveticaNeueLT Std Blk</strong>, etc. <em>without numbers</em>. This is a different set of Helvetica Neue that you had installed earlier.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>An operating system can be confused by multiple versions of the same or very similar fonts being installed. It's these font without numbers that you need to rid of. First, delete all, Helvetica Neue fonts, then just reinstall the versions with numbers and
 retest to see whether italics begin to appear. In addition, the font menu as shown in your first screen shot should include a preview of the font, as all the other fonts display, and should include an icon to the left of the font name that shows the font type
 (TT for TrueType, O for OpenType, etc.).</p>

<h2>            stuck on safe mode login screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi, &nbsp;I was trying to use Avast tool to remove antivirus from my PC. It prompted me to go to safe mode to run the app, so I clicked the box and now I am stuck on safe mode login screen. Won't except my password - says it is incorrect try again. The password
 works on my other 3 PC's and also worked on the PC when I started it in the first place! I am hard wired and the screen says I'm not connected to internet. Can't access any menu with F8 key. No power icon present. On screen key board doesn't work. Did the
 power disconnect and got startup repair screen and then defender offline screen, windows defender scanned PC then looped back to the same safe mode login screen. &nbsp;Tried to run fresh install DVD disc Build 14393. DVD booted to windows logo but looped back to
 safe mode login screen. </p>

            <p>Many with older Intel Graphics are having display issues, but can use the Microsoft Basic display Adapter driver as a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Acer uses Esc or F2 to choose boot device at power-up. So if you hold or tap Esc or F2 you should get a menu that you can use to ensure it boots from DVD (or USB if you create Windows 10 install media on that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you get it to boot the install media, you could try SHIFT-F10 to get a Command Prompt from the first install screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At Command Prompt, run <strong>Diskpart</strong>. In Diskpart, <strong>list volume</strong> to see what drive letter is currently assigned to your usual C: partition, as sometimes this changes.
<strong>Exit</strong> to end Diskpart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If C: drive is still letter C:, use this command to try to reset it to normal boot mode. Use whatever letter is assigned in place of C: if this was different in Diskpart.</p>
<p><strong>bcdboot C:\Windows</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then <strong>exit</strong> the Command Prompt and cancel the install to restart hopefully to normal Windows 10 with Internet access, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course you still want to uninstall Avast somehow, unless you choose to do a clean install of Windows 10, after backing up and wiping your disk.</p>

<h2>            Indexing stops at the same place</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently noticed that searches showed results only up to certain point in time, a week or 2 ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebuilt the index several times, but indexation always stops at 15, 579. Guessing a .pst problem, so tried scanpst. No help. I'm now suspecting that there is a problem with a particular email item. But how to identify other than trial and error?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can see the last item indexed? And is it in inbox? Sent? etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<h2>            Moved email from junk folder to inbox and it disappeared.</h2>
                    I received an email that went into my junk mail folder, after I moved it to my inbox it disappeared. I have searched every folder both via the search tool and by manually looking in each folder. I also can not find a way to contact outlook/microsoft directly
 about this issue. Thank you in advance for any help you are able to provide.

            The same thing happened to me. I moved two emails from the junk folder to the inbox, using the move feature of course. It then went into inbox temporarily for a second then it disappeared. I tried recovering emails from the deleted folder to no avail.
 It only recovers emails a week old from what I can gather.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I tried searching with the domain names to no avail. I checked my blocked list, and those emails are not there. One of the emails, I am quite certain i have others from the same domain in my inbox already.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>What do I do?</div>

<h2>            Surface Laptop, can&#39;t activate One year Microsoft office Subscription</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new surface laptop on 26.12.2017. After creating my account I was able to login. But whenever I try to open Microsoft office it gives message please activate. Upon clicking on activate button it takes to "Confirm your account" screen. On confirming
 account details it takes to screen which gives option to enter product key to activate or buy a new office or start 30 days trial. Please help.</p>

            If your Surface included a 'free' I year subscription to Office Personal you follow the instructions provide by MS/Surface to activate the 'free' subscription, which will require you to create/use an MS Account

    <title>How do I turn off delete email confirmation&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the spackler  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn off delete email confirmation&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am not talking about Outlook 20xx or Outlook.com or Outlook Office 365. I am only referring to the online Hotmail service (which is maybe called Outlook.live.com?).&nbsp; Every email that I delete by clicking on the Trash Can displayed with it or the Delete
 button at the top or right-click &amp; select Delete, I always get a dialog box asking me to confirm deletion. I have two desktop PCs, both are running up-to-date Win10, yet one continuously asks for email confirmation while the other PC never does or ever has.
 I've searched everything on the Hotmail/Outlook email service and found no answer. And it doesn't work to type it in the browser address bar because
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">everybody</span> responds with the Outlook in Microsoft Office, which apparently is different than Hotmail. Please help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The prompt that you are getting is preventing you from accidentally deleting important emails. However, we need to gather more information for us to provide the best resolution for your concern:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the exact error message that you are getting?</li><li>From which email folder/s were you deleting those email messages?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Robelene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for unexpectedly quick response.</p>
<p>I find that I must apologize for a mistake I made: There is no problem deleting Inbox emails from Hotmail. My friend uses my second computer all the time, and when they showed me the delete confirmation message they were getting, I thought they were in the
 Inbox, but it was the Trash Folder instead. They have the habit of immediately deleting read emails and then going to the Trash to delete them right after. Had I realized that, I would've explained the confirmation is normal when deleting from the Trash.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your fast response and attempt to help me. Actually, you <em>
did</em> help because it caused me to become aware of what my friend was misunderstanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>G.</p>
