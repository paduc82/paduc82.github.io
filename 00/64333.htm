<h2>            how to get touch macros working in desktop mode&#63;</h2>
                    <p>i tried to do the support ticket but MS site doesn't work properly in chrome so i'll copy and paste it into here.&nbsp; hopefully this will work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft support professional,</p>
<p>After following the steps at the online hardware replacement check page <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hardwarereplacement/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hardwarereplacement/en-gb</a> I would like to provide you the following information for my support incident.</p>
<p>I can confirm the following:</p>
<p>1 - I accepted the hardware support policy and agreed on the process to follow for submitting this incident</p>
<p>2 - My hardware is not OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) hardware and is therefore eligible for Microsoft support.</p>
<p>3 - Hardware test on another computer (delete as applicable):<br />
B - I was not able to test my hardware on another computer, but the issue still exists.</p>
<p>4 - I have downloaded the correct drivers and installed them properly.</p>
<p>5 - Wireless or wired hardware (delete as applicable):<br />
A - My hardware is wireless hardware, and that the batteries are new or good to use, but the problem still exists.</p>
<p>6 - I understand and accept the product support lifecycle and support options.</p>
<p><br />
i have windows 8 and your touch mouse. i want to change the touch options e.g swipe to the right which should be open recent apps (i think metro only) to be basically alt + tab. win+ tab would be ok too.&nbsp; neither work.&nbsp; your software (got the mouse today, downloaded
 drivers today so all new) doesn't allow the option to use "tab" and when i press alt+tab, it doesn't register and jumps me to my browser.&nbsp; the software doesn't recognise the windows key at all.</p>
<p>i want to rearrange the touch commands. that's all. in my browser, 2 swipes up = open link in new tab, in media player = full screen.&nbsp; simple things but you're software is too limited it seems to let me do this.</p>

That's odd because the new Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center does and I'm not sure that that is new.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. I had an old macro which did Win-R which was definitely showing the Win-key and not some hex value I had tried to exploit to force the use of LWIN.</p>
<p>Maybe they want you to buy a new W8 ready Keyboard too?&nbsp;&nbsp; It has all those swipe commands featured as buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>Do you have MMKC installed?&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like a Touch mouse user should be able to do that.</p>

            <p>hi, i do have that installed.</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/touch-mouse/3KJ-00001</p>
<p>that;s the mouse i've got.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>if i go into touch settings and then commands and try to add a key combo, if i hit alt then "L Alt" comes up as expected but if i then press tab, i swap programs. &nbsp; windows key doesn't register at all as i said before.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>the software is lacking.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>as far as buying a new keyboard goes = no way.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1 - i only have my keyboard with me when i type (as in now) otherwise it gets put on the desk to my right.</p>
<p>2 - even if those options were built in - they probably won't work &nbsp;i don't and will not use metro - only desktop mode (added a start menu replacement) so the "view recently used apps" etc only works in there.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>i might throw away the mouse or keep it for emergencies as without these touch options it is massively inferior to my logitech mouse.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>it's a shame as i recall microsoft making decent hardware (mice/KBs) once upon a time</p>

            <p>hi, tried that before but it won't work due to each key on being pressed for 10ms. &nbsp;it won't do both at the same time.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>if i add alt and del alt is used for a set amount of time and THEN tab. &nbsp;not both together. &nbsp;i tested it and in my browser when i used the gesture my menu appears. i can't see an option there to not have a delay. &nbsp;i assume that's what the command section
 is for where you can record your own macro.</p>

<p>ok thanks. i've found the "split" option. &nbsp;now i have "alt-pressed", "tab" then "Alt-released"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>still not working though. the swipes register as you get the visual confirmation. &nbsp;if though, i choose for the gesture to mean middle click then that works. &nbsp;but this alt+tab thing just isn't working for me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>even weirder? &nbsp;i go the same thing for windows key and D. &nbsp;that works fine. &nbsp;so i guess i'm going it right in principle but somethings off with the alt/tab macro. &nbsp; ??</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>microsoft? &nbsp;pretty please look at logitechs software. &nbsp;it's soo much better it's unreal.</p>

It's not clear to me what you want it for.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try Win-Tab instead?&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognizing that it would only be of use when you had&nbsp;a Metro app open.</p>

            <p>if i have a video playing and i'm posting quickly on facebook then i want to quickly swap between the 2. &nbsp;that's what alt/tab does (not holding alt down and tabbing between various programs). &nbsp;my logitech mouse has 3 side button where your left finger can
 easily reach. &nbsp;the top one basically does this. click it and i swap programs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>i don't and will not use metro. i'm on a PC not a tablet. &nbsp;i have installed a start menu replacement to get rid of it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>i did actually try win/tab too but it also doesn't work. seems anything involving tab doesn't work. &nbsp;as with alt/tab the 2 blue gesture orbs appear on screen to confirm i've done the motion correctly but it doesn't actually do anything.</p>

Have you noticed the MMKC saying that there is a Flip command you could try?&nbsp; I tried to find one, e.g. expecting it to be listed under Window commands but there was no sign of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Curiously, also, there was no sign of&nbsp; Flip 3D&nbsp; which I do have a key for
 but now it appears that it isn't even seen by&nbsp; mskey.exe&nbsp;&nbsp;although it does provide a "ring" of thumbnails that I can use my Mouse wheel with.&nbsp; &nbsp;WTH?&nbsp;&nbsp; I am just about ready to remove MMKC and go back to the old way of doing keyboard customization.</p>
<p><br />
Another option I tried was Next window.&nbsp;&nbsp; But to make any use of that you would probably need to have another gesture (or Shift- with the first gesture) to invoke Previous window.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also I thought that&nbsp; both have unexpected behaviour depending on window states.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
That won't be of any use to you if you aren't going to be using Metro.&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; }</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW while doing some research about&nbsp;using&nbsp; Intellitype and Intellipoint macros I found some people concluding that if you really needed the generality that those features lack you should consider using&nbsp; AutoHotKey&nbsp; (third-party program)&nbsp; in conjuction with&nbsp;
 Intellitype.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is really astonishing how&nbsp;functionality&nbsp;appears patched in so irregularly.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, why would a Mouse user need to be able to use&nbsp;extra
<u>button clicks</u>?&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose I can see why a keyboard button might be defined that way but it still seems slightly useless when you consider all the other possibilities which have been left out.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would really love to see the list of plausible use-cases
 that the designers envisaged when they created this stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ha.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm on W7 now and on it I do see all 3 choices:&nbsp; Flip, Flip 3D and Instant Viewer.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, then, in W8 I am being limited to having Instant Viewer and only on the Flip 3D key which as I mentioned is not being seen by mskey.exe.&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp; judging by
 the Help, Flip and Instant Viewer appear related as just a means of showing thumbnails which can be wheeled through...&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm...&nbsp; I had better check to see how Alt-Tab is defined because Flip looks mostly like the way Alt-Tab works.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's like Alt-Tab
 but different:&nbsp; it outlines all windows then goes to the next window which it shows.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Shift- of the Flip key reverses the direction but still results in only one window being shown.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who would want that?&nbsp;&nbsp; And trying to use my wheel on the ring
 of thumbnails of the "Instant Viewer"&nbsp;is depressingly laughable (though&nbsp;its array&nbsp;will be useful for Touch users).&nbsp;&nbsp; Those two alternative features&nbsp;make Flip 3D look like craftsmanship!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Good luck</p>

            &nbsp; &nbsp;i'm sure win/tab used to work on win7, same as alt/tab but showed a preview or something? anyway, thanks for the help rob but i give up with this software. sticking with my logitech. if i have to install 3rd party software on top of MS own, and mess
 around this much to get 1 macro going - what the **** is it going to be like getting the rest done? that mouse can be my laptops travel mouse or something thanks again :) &nbsp;

<h2>            I still cannot decrypt files containing windows 10 apps from my hard drive to my new Windows 10 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>I also have the same problem with everyone else, but mine is a little bit different. My friends gave me the download so I can change my Windows 10 32-bit to Windows 10 64-bit. I already backup some of the files I need, then I also moved a Windows
 Store app to the hard drive. When I tried to move the folder containing the Windows App, it is said that "A problem is preventing this folder from being encrypted." I right-click the folder and I select&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>, then in the&nbsp;<strong>General</strong>&nbsp;tab
 I clicked&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>. The checkbox saying<strong>Encrypt contents to secure data&nbsp;</strong>is checked. It cannot be unchecked but on top of that there is a checkbox that can be checked saying "<strong>Compress contents
 to save disk space</strong>". I check then uncheck that box, what happens is, the first checkbox saying&nbsp;<strong>Encrypt contents to secure data</strong>&nbsp;is also unchecked. I pressed&nbsp;<strong>Ok</strong>&nbsp;then I pressed<strong>Apply</strong>.
 It applies to folder, subfolders and files. I pressed&nbsp;<strong>Ok</strong>, the next thing that happened. They told me it cannot be decrypted. So as long as it is not decrypted it is not going to be able to be moved from my hard drive to my new Windows
 10 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me with this, I really need the answer ASAP.</p>

            Simply transferring a Store app folder is unlikely to work properly, so why don't you just reinstall the app from the Store on the new system?

            Yes, I tried this, it works. Thanks a lot. But maybe it is a coincidence that the server from the app saves the data. When I download the app again, I thought that I should start the game all over again. Turns out they offer me to use the data that is
 connected to the account. If it doesn't work, then moving the app to the new computer is our only choice.&nbsp;

<p>Ideally Store apps should sync settings, progress etc. to their servers or with the user's MS account (perhaps using OneDrive or something). If they save data locally then the recommended method would be to install them afresh on the new system and transfer
 only the local database/files created by them from the old to the new one. Attempting to move entire installed Store apps between systems is neither recommended nor supported by MS.</p>

<h3> voodooknigh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display driver NVIDIA Windows Kernel Mode Driver, Version 358.50 stopped responding and has successfully recovered.</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I've been having a lot of issues with my Nvidia drivers.&nbsp; They always seem to stop responding when I'm playing high maintenance games like CS:GO with no FPS cap and Mortal Kombat X to name a few.&nbsp; I have run a GPU stress test for an hour and it
 did not crash.&nbsp; I have a GTX 660 and aside from the driver crashing, nothing else seems to go badly with the card.&nbsp; Sometiems it doesn't even recover and I'm forced to eat an abandon!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could shed some light on how to fix this issue, it would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> ugn‰ó k.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting old laptop &#40;Win10&#41; to TV with VGA. Screen resolution.</h2>
                    I am using a pretty old Acer Extensa 5220 laptop (which does not have a HDMI output, so I am using VGA cable) and TELEFUNKEN TV (not a smart one). &nbsp;Everything seems to be working after connecting them with VGA, but laptop screen shrinks to a square (the
 clock widget (rainmeter) doesn't fit anymore)<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b91db84f-717f-41e1-8593-98c2a8932401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b91db84f-717f-41e1-8593-98c2a8932401" /></a>and
 TV screen expands. <br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d35c3c45-53e2-4eac-a8e8-eaaa55ce59d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d35c3c45-53e2-4eac-a8e8-eaaa55ce59d6" /></a><br />
<strong>BUT</strong> when I select different resolution the laptop turns to normal, but the screen on TV becomes to big (I can't see the taskbar).<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1491ad0c-e840-4919-a88e-acf1020174cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1491ad0c-e840-4919-a88e-acf1020174cb" /></a><br />
On other occasions the screen on TV moves to (usually) to the right, leaving a blank space in the left, and half of the screen can't be seen then or it adjust the way it want's and some part can't be seen then. (if I understand correctly, this happens because
 selected resolution for TV is to big??)&nbsp;<br />
Is there a way to fix it? I would like that my laptop would stay with the same resolution as it is before connecting the VGA cable, and I would like to expand the resolution on TV without making it to big.

<p>Hola,</p>

<p>Tengo un codigo prepago de 12 meses a xbox live gold, la cuestion es que ahora mismo estoy usando el mes gratis que te dan por crear un perfil y me gustar√≠a esperarme a canjear el codigo, pero antes quiero comprobar si funciona el codigo, podria meter el
 codigo y mirar si funciona pero no canjearlo aun¬ø? Es decir, mirar y no canjear, la proxima vez que meta el c√≥digo me dejar√≠a canjearlo con normalidad¬ø?</p>

<p>Gracias y un saludo.</p>

<p>No tengo seguro que caduquen -al menos me dijeron los del SAT que no-, y en principio si metes el codigo desde la xbox siempre te sale antes de canjearlo lo que es, por lo que puedes comprobarlo. Desde el ordenador no estoy tan seguro si te deja leer que
 es antes de confirmar el canje.</p>

<p>Desde la pagina de xbox si introduces el codigo te lo canjea directamente, en la consola lo puedes ver antes como dice el aqui compa√±ero, pero introducelo y asi lo tienes y quitatelo de la cabeza ya que se acumulan y asi, con esos 12 meses y el que ya tienes
 tendrias 13 meses, puedes comprovarlo en el administrador de cuentas. Un saludo.</p>

<h2>            Is anyone else getting calls from someone saying they are from Microsoft Technical Support&#63;</h2>
                    I think this is a scam again.&nbsp; These calls come in and I just tell them that if I need Microsoft I will call them myself and hang up.&nbsp; Then I redial the number on my caller ID and it says it is not a working number.&nbsp; FYI &nbsp; this is the latest scam number.
 &nbsp; 1 712-527-5938.&nbsp; Don't let them into your computer.

            You are right in that it is a scam, MS never cold call. The scammers will all try it on and I suspect it will continue for some years to come.

            <em>Everybody</em> gets calls from people claiming to be Microsoft Support ... and also from people wanting to give me a free vacation or sell me an extended warranty for my car. It's a scam like any other scam. Treat it as you would any other junk call.

<p>That's <em>physical</em> access.</p>
<p>What you need to consider is <em>online</em> access.</p>
<p>Most (if not all) computer security professionals and experts recommend that you use a Password-protected User account as part of your on-line security.<br />
A password won't protect you from an attacker that has actual physical access to your computer, but it is part of your defence in depth when on-line.<br />
<br />
It's not just <em>your</em> on-line security that a password helps to protect, but the security of many others, as it helps to slow down or stop the proliferation of viruses, Trojans and other nasty stuff like bots.</p>

    <title>Proxy Settings disappear periodically after Creator&#39;s Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> razdeep  say:</h3>
<h2>            Proxy Settings disappear periodically after Creator&#39;s Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently updated my Windows 10 with the Creator's Update, and since then I have been encountering a strange problem.<br />
Using the internet at my University requires me to access it through a proxy (10.3.100.207:8080), and the system already had it set when the update happened.<br />
Things were fine after the update as well, until I removed the proxy to access a local address. When I was putting the proxy back on, I noticed that the Address and Port values weren't saved, like they used to earlier (Earlier I had to just flick the switch
 on and the greyed out saved values would activate again). Except that "80" is already filled as the value in Port.</p>
<p>I put the values in again and put the proxy back on. Things were fine till after 5 minutes, my browser couldn't connect to the internet.<br />
I check the proxy, and weirdly it was turned off, and the values missing as well.<br />
</p>
<p>Now I have to put the values in and turn the proxy on at intervals of 5 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me out on this? I have done multiple scans on both Spyware Search and Destroy as well as Malwarebytes, but the problem persists. Tried out modifying the registry (as suggested in some other posts) as well, but I still can't seem to solve
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: So after a lot of tinkering and inspecting, I've discovered that the "ProxyEnable" file in the Registry is automatically changing it's value to 0, causing the proxy to be removed. When I change the value to 1, the proxy is enabled again, but the "80"
 Port value is no longer already filled.</p>
<p>Haven't noticed any suspicious background processed running in the background yet.</p>
<p />

<p>I am also having this issue. I will have to reset to before the last update and hope that it gets fixed to enable me to update at a later date. Will this affect automatic updates of Windows if I go back to an earlier version? Will it just automatically update
 again causing the same problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will let you know whether this keeps occurring after the restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I assumed that meant going back to an earlier build. I am not willing to go back to Windows 7. What should be done?</p>

<p>Hello Nick,<br />
<br />
Yeah, Charianne does mean that you use System Restore to revert your system back to before the Creator's Update, and
<strong>not to a previous version of Windows.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the issue, I just realised that the fix was temporary, and the proxy settings disappear regularly in a few minutes' interval after I restart the system.
<br />
I'm just relying on the temporary fix for now. The first answer in the following link has a method in which you create a new entry in the registry using the registry editor: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie11-iewindows8_1/lan-connection-settings-keep-changing-back-to/76a0f5d2-167f-41fa-bf40-1461b8c01642</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll revert my system as soon as I get the opportunity. Thanks Charianne.</p>

            I got this problem too and this is super annoying as I need proxy at my workplace.<br />
<br />

<br />
I home MS will release patch for this ASAP

                    <p>Original title: BSOD and The sfc scan</p>
<p>Recently my computer has started to BSOD on me Once or twice a day. As a result I do what I always do.. I start searching for issues with what little knowledge I have. I started by doing virus scans with a couple of programs I prefer and fixed whatever issues
 they found. I then decided that a sfc scan was in order.&nbsp; I did this 4 times.<br />
<br />
The first time it got to 60% and couldn't complete.<br />
I did it again and it completed but couldn't fix some of the issues.<br />
This was repeated twice more. Here is a partial cbs.log of my last scan<br />

<p>I guess the first thing to do is check that the game is set to an online game, being connected to the internet isn't enough.</p>
<p>Again the privacy settings need to be checked, minecraft allows you to post pics to facebook so they have to be able to media share, not sure exactly what option that is under. If you look through and are not sure then &nbsp;the best bet is to have no privacy
 settings to see if you can connect at all and then when you know you can, you can start adding privacy settings and check as you go.</p>

<h2>            Skype shows me offline when I am on &#34;away&#34;</h2>
                    I usually set my Skype status as "away", but I have just found out that I result to be offline for my contacts. Any guess about what's going on?

<h2>            Windows 10 System Image Backup error&#58; System Error&#58; Access is denied, System Restore error&#58; &#34;0x80042306&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have yet again reinstalled Windows 10. I run 1 System Image Backup that works fine, if I run System Image Backup/System Restore/Windows 7 Backup after they all fail.
</p>
<p>Event viewer has&nbsp;3 errors for me, CAPI2 "System Error: Access is denied", VSS "Incorrect function", System Restore "0x80042306</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had VSS and SPP errors in Windows 8, 8.1, and now 10. I have also seen this problem on this forum many times, often without a solution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can give me maybe an idea of what to do with my problem it would be greatly appreciated. I feel as my only option is to reinstall Windows every time I want to run a backup, in reality something is up with Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>=============</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little moan about Microsoft as a customer...</p>
<p>I have used the Contact Support feature in Windows 10, I was disconnected 3 times, each time I re called MS the guy was called Jazz. The 4th time a lady informed me it would cost something like ¬£60 to fix one problem or 100 and something ¬£&nbsp;for as much help
 I needed? T&amp;C states after 30 days la la la. Either way I'm not a happy Windows user, with a licence costing me ¬£100 in the first place only to have someone remotely connect to my PC, run some 3rd party programs and create copies of everything, along with
 requesting my email then disconnect. More importantly not resolve the issue I have on a fresh install of this OS.
</p>
<p>That's like selling a car with a wheel slightly loose, it falls off, you then charge for an issue you should have sorted in the first place. This isn't ware and tear of the OS, this is a totally fresh installation.

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you, we will help you to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try few of the below troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>I suggest you to start<strong> Volume Shadow Copy service
</strong>and set it to Automatic.</p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Steps to Start the service and set it to automatic:</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows Key + R</strong>&nbsp;on the keyboard and type <strong>

<strong>Startup type </strong>to <strong>Automatic</strong>.</span></span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict&nbsp;and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> Putting your system in <strong>
Clean Boot</strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 3: </strong>I suggest you to perform SFC scan t6o check if there are any corrupted or missing files.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>System File Checker</span></span></strong><span><span>is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.<br />

            <p>Thank you for your reply. Please try not to be offended but your advice (carbon copy), as many times as I have seen it in this forum wasn‚Äôt the solution. And I would ask you to present my findings to your software engineers with urgency as this problem is
 common and very avoidable. Since Windows 8 have I been having this problem, it almost seems MS is doing this on purposes.&nbsp; But anyway...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue and error codes all point to a problem creating the Shadow Copy right, my active disks all have over 50% free space. The
<strong>Volume Shadow Service</strong> is working as it should (<em>being a clean install of Windows).
</em>It turns out the problem in question is the "<strong>System Reserve</strong><strong>d</strong>" partition created during installation of the OS. Windows sets this to 100MB, after the "<strong>Recovery</strong>" partition and before the "<strong>Windows
 System</strong>" partition. This is the drive low on space, Disk Manager says it has 70MB free when it has about 30MB, Shadow Copy on this drive needs ~40MB. On Windows Server 2008 (when the problem first started to spring up), people could do work arounds
 using Disk Manager on that OS, selecting properties, making drives active etc, all greyed out on Windows 10 (helpful).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have used 3rd party partition software to <strong>shrink the Windows partition</strong> and
<strong>extend the EFI System Reserved partition to 450MB</strong> (anything over 500MB will mess things up). This initially didn‚Äôt work, so I have rebooted and started the Windows installation again.
</p>
<p><strong>Deleted the Windows partition, deleted the 16MB MSR partition, clicked New in the free space, deleted again the MSR partition and clicked next. I kept the 450MB Recovery and the 450MB EFI System Reserved Partitions as they where.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now in Windows 10, in the same clean, fresh install state as before but with the ability to create System Restore Points and System Image Backups (EFI, Recovery, System) using Back Up (yes you renamed it to Back&lt;space&gt;up, to stop people using it instead
 of FileHistory) as many times as I like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again if you can bring this to the attention of Software Engineers that would be grand. This issue has effected me for a long time and others. I hope this can help anyone in the same shoes looking for a solution. I have attached my resources in finding a
 solution bellow if people need it, as you can see this is people using Windows 7 on. "Contact Support" proved to be useless and is there only to get people like me to pay ¬£60 (or ¬£100 for more than one problem) to fix your error (I was laughing at the guy
 trying to do the basics. msconfig, services, regedit), again he fiddled about, the phone cut out and after a few reboots he left the chat leaving me with rubbish all over my desktop, so dont anyone bother with them. Disgrace really, today has been long, its
 lucky I know my way round a computer and have a mind for research and problem solving. But thanks for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindest regards,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third party firewalls from the anti-virus are sometimes unblocked and may be a prominent cause of the errors that you receive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you have can reinstall your favorite anti-virus again, I would recommend you completely uninstalling the anti-virus from by downloading and installing its removal tool&nbsp;from the corresponding anti-virus' website and then, check if you get any backup
 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable or uninstall&nbsp;your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists even after uninstalling the anti-virus, please reinstall it to reinstate the security of the system.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Continuation to the above thread, he's saying if you have installed any third party security software like Avast, MacAfee else then disable it. Yes Windows Defender is a built-in feature, we cannot uninstall it.

            <p>I'm having the same problem, trying to create a restore point and getting the 0x80042306 error code.&nbsp; I tried the same solution that&nbsp;MSE (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/21ba688b-7ecb-4ce9-918a-f1b48fcfce9f" title="Harkanwar Singh"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Harkanwar
 Singh</span></a>) replied on &nbsp;entered and got almost the same error results as Tomtalk24 did. The exception was that msxml3.dll also failed on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting very frustrated with Microsoft not being able to fix a problem like this that so many customers are running into. Luckily, I have Windows 10 installed on a Mac mini and I have Acronis True Image for Mac installed on that O/S. I'm using it to
 also back up Windows so I'm not as exposed to a Windows failure on this system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do like to have all 15 systems in my lab able to be setup the&nbsp;same so that's why I frustrated that they system can't Create a Restore Point.

            It looks like MS removed the option to contact real person. If you cannot select from the list of common issues you are out of luck. Any attempts to start chat or be redirected to customer support redirects back to profile page instead.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What type of files are you trying to sync with windows media player?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What happens when you try to sync windows media player with external hard drive?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you getting any error message?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are two methods for syncing items to a device: automatically or manually. When you connect a device to your computer
 for the first time, <span>Windows</span> Media Player selects the sync method that works best for your device, depending on the device's storage capacity and the size of your Player library. After your device is set up the first time, you can choose a different
 sync method if you want.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let‚Äôs start with setting up your device to sync with windows media player.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Turn on your device, and then connect it to your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<span><strong>Start</strong></span> button, click <span><strong>All Programs</strong></span>, and then click
<strong><span>Windows</span><span> Media Player</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the Player is currently open and you‚Äôre in Now Playing mode, click the
<span><strong>Switch to Library</strong></span> button in the upper-right corner of the Player.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Then, do one of the following:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the Player has automatically selected to sync your device, click
<span><strong>Finish</strong></span>. When you do this, the Player will sync your entire Player Library to your device. After that, your device will automatically sync every time you connect it to your computer while
<span>Windows</span> Media Player is running.</span></p>
<p>
<span>For automatic sync, if you want to sync only a portion of your Player Library, you can choose which media will automatically sync. For more information, see "To choose what files
 sync automatically" in this topic.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span>If the Player has selected to sync your device manually, click
<span><strong>Finish</strong></span>. Then, on the <span><strong>Sync</strong></span> tab, select the files and playlists you want to sync manually. For more information, see</span><span><span>

    <title>Cannot login to Windows after changing default font - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tuan minh phan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot login to Windows after changing default font</h2>
                    <p>I followed an instruction on the internet and I'd change the default font of Windows from Segoe UI to (Unicode) Google Sans that I'd also downloaded on the Internet. Then I restarted my laptop, but at the moment when I clicked to get to the login UI to enter
 my password, it didn't show that up to me and then return to the screen with the clock and date instead. Before doing that I'd created a recovery point but I cannot seems to get to the recovery screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd also done something kind of like that 5 months ago and luckily the login UI showed up and I could be able to log in and change the font back to default.</p>
<p>I also think that I'd misswritten the font name, S√°n instead of Sans (cause of a Vietnamese program that helps me write Vietnamese) because the date and time's font seems not to be Google Sans.</p>

            Hi Tuan, try booting into Safe Mode and then undo the registry edit by pasting the text at the bottom of this post into the reg file to replace the text you already used
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />

<p>I've created a recovery point before changing the font. So is it possible to reset the font back to default when I get back to the recovery point?</p>
<p>By the way, thank you so much. You've saved my laptop</p>

            Hi Tuan, if you created a Restore Point, that would have backed up the registry and in theory would undo the Font Change . . .
<br />
<br />If you can get into Windows, initiate a System Restore
<br />
<br />If you cannot get into Windows:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
