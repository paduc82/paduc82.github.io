<h2>            Current song playing</h2>
                    When I have my zune player running in my collection of music, the list does not skip to the song currently playing. So if I want to add the song currently playing to a play list, I have to scroll through my whole list to find it or do a search for the
 artist/song. Is there a way to have it bring up the current song automatically like itunes does? It's a really big pain to have to search for it. I don't understand why it isn't brought up in the list automatically.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Here is one way to do what you're asking - One of&nbsp;couple different&nbsp;ways to get to the "Now Playing" list and then add the item/song to a playlist.</p>
<p>When you're in your "Collection" view you will see the current song playing at the bottom center of the Zune Software. Click on the "Album/Artist" picture and you'll be taken to the "Now Playing" screen - The "Now Playing" list will Highlight the current
 song (in pink) - Right Click On that Item/Song and Click "View In Collection" - At this point you'll be taken to the Artist/Song within your "Collection" - At which point you can drag-n-drop onto the playlist you're creating.</p>

<h2>            Table Design for Multi-relational Database</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having trouble figuring out how to create tables for a multi-relational database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have three tables, each with one primary key. Each primary key can relate to one or all of the primary keys of any of the other two tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example; The first table contains schools, the second table contains classes, the third table contains teachers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each school may offer any class, and any class may be taught by any teacher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to query a class to show all the schools that&nbsp;offer it as well as all the teachers that teach the class.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I query&nbsp;the teachers, I want to see all the classes they teach and at what schools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I query the school, I want to see all the classes offered there and what teachers teach them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I&nbsp;want the primary key in the table to provide the instructor number and not duplicate, I can't figure out how to associate one teacher to&nbsp;multiple classes within the same table,</p>
<p>
</p><p>how to associate one class to multiple teachers in one table</p>
<p>
</p><p>how to associate one school with multiple teachers and classes within the same table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this makes sense and someone can guide me in the right direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            What you have is a ternary many-to-many relationship type between schools, classes and teachers, which should be modelled by a table which resolves the relationship type into three many-to-many relationship types:<br />
<br />
SchoolsClassesTeachers<br />
....SchoolID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
....ClassID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
....TeacherID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
<br />
The primary key of this table is a composite one made up of the three foreign key columns, i.e. it is 'all key'.&nbsp;&nbsp; This table on its own would assume that all schools can teach all classes, all classes can be taught by all teaches, and all teachers can teach
 at every school.&nbsp; This would seem unlikely, so you'd model the relationship types between each pair of entity types with further tables.&nbsp; To model which schools each teacher can teach at therefore would be modelled by a table as follows, which models the binary
 relationship type between schools and taechers:<br />
<br />
SchoolsTeachers<br />
....SchoolID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
....TeacherID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
<br />
Which classes each teacher can teach would be modelled&nbsp; by a table as follows:<br />
<br />
ClassesTeachers<br />
....ClassID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
....TeacherID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
<br />
And to model which classes are taught by each school:<br />
<br />
SchoolsClasses<br />
....SchoolID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
....ClassID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
<br />
Again, in each case the table is 'all key'<br />
<br />
The relationship types between each of these tables and SchoolsClassesTeachers will in each case be on the relevant pairs of columns, e.g. that between SchoolsClassesTeachers&nbsp; and SchoolsTeachers will be on SchoolID and TeacherID.&nbsp; In all of the relationships
 referential integrity must be enforced to ensure the integrity of the data.<br />
<br />
You might like to take a look at Relationships.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />

<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file illustrates how relationships are built up across a database, using a simple medical prescriptions database as an example, and shows how the model is represented in the user interface by forms/subforms.<br />

<p>&gt;&nbsp;<span>Each primary key can relate to one or all of the primary keys of any of the other two tables</span></p>
<p><span>Not so. Each PK relates to a Foreign Key (FK) in the related table.</span></p>

Not the entire picture. Each school may offer any class AND ANY CLASS MAY BE OFFERED BY ANY SCHOOL.</p>
<p>Same with teachers and classes. They can work at various schools to teach several classes.</p>
<p>This sets up many-to-many (M:M) relations, not 1:M like you explained it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you think clearly about the relationships, the database design should become apparent. Ken and Gina are giving you hints (or more) in the right direction.</p>

<p>Thank you all for taking the time to reply. I've been working on this but took a break over the weekend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up 7 tables:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Schools - one primary key for each school</p>
<p>2) Classes - one primary key for each class</p>
<p>3) Teachers - one primary key for each teacher&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) SchoolsClassesTeachers - I highlighted and selected all three rows to create a composite key (only 3 numbers will exist for each record, those numbers are the composite primary key to include the primary keys for tables 1 - 3)</p>
<p>5) SchoolsClasses&nbsp;- selected both rows to create a composite key (records will only have two numbers each, the composite key to include the primary key of schools and classes)</p>
<p>6) ClassesTeachers - " with respect to ClassesTeachers</p>
<p>7) SchoolsTeachers - " with respect to SchoolsTeachers</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually entered the data into tables 1 -3 because Access wouldn't let me upload the data with numbers already put into the primary key field which was set to autonumber.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Table 4's composite key is made up of table 1, 2, and 3's primary keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Table 5, 6, and 7 have composite keys made up of the primary keys for each combination. Each row/record contains only two numbers. the composite primary key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Table 5's composite key is made up of the primary key for Schools and the primary key for Classes.</p>
<p>Table 6's composite key is made up of the primary key for Classes and the primary key for Teachers.</p>
<p>Table 7's composite key is made up of the primary key for schools and the primary key for Teachers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I related tables 1 - 3 to each of the primary keys listed in table&nbsp;4 with no problem. When I try and drag and drop the titles from table 4 to create relationships with each of the tables 5 - 7, I get the message "No unique index found for the referenced
 field of the primary table."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very new to relationships and primary keys, so, it probably sounds like mud to you, but do I need 7 tables?&nbsp; Why do I get the error message about no unique index?</p>
<p>

            When creating a relationship on composite keys you don't drag both (or more) columns between the tables in the relationship window.&nbsp; What you do is firstly drag one of the columns, which will then appear in the relationship dialogue.&nbsp; You then select the
 other columns in the second row of the dialogue.<br />
<br />
The image below is the first stage in the creation of the relationship between The DrugForms and DrugFormStrengths tables in my Relationships demo, to which I referred you earlier:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fa456cc-929f-4090-bc9d-cec891132fc1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fa456cc-929f-4090-bc9d-cec891132fc1?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
The following image is the final stage in the creation of the relationship.&nbsp; Note that the relationship is enforced, and cascade updates are enabled as the keys are 'natural keys' rather than numeric 'surrogate keys'.&nbsp; If a drug name were changed in Drugs for
 instance this would cascade through all of the related tables.&nbsp; Some years ago this did happen in the case of Levothyroxine, which is one of the examples in the demo.&nbsp; Previously the synthesized version of thyroxine (derived from bovine thyroxine) was referred
 to simply as Thyroxine.<br />

<p>Well, I completed all the tables you mentioned above, but when I try to make the relationship I get a message saying "No unique index found for the referenced field of the primary table."<br />
</p>
<p>I have entered the text info into the 3 single tables, and then entered only the primary key data into the binary tables. Can you see the picture below? I can only see half of it.</p>

            The table designs are fine, the problem is that you have the relationship back to front.&nbsp; All relationships are directional, so you need to start by dragging the ProviderID column from the referenced&nbsp; table ProvidersInstructors to the referencing table
 ProvidersCoursesInstructors.&nbsp; You should then find that the former appears in the left column of the dialogue, the latter in the right.&nbsp; You can then select the InstructorID columns in each on the second row.

    <title>COUNTIF function randomly breaks in Excel 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wallac7  say:</h3>
<h2>            COUNTIF function randomly breaks in Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes when I create an excel spreadsheet from our database, the COUNTIF function in Excel 2016 will stop working</p>
<p>When I do COUNTIF(A2:A2000, "bread) to search for how much bread (obviously not what I'm actually seraching), the function just sticks as COUNTIF(A2:A2000, "bread) in the formula bar and refuses to return. Is there any way to correct this? I am forced to
 recreate the entire workbook just to fix this bug.</p>
<p>Looking for a solution</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>~wallac</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: The data is sorted. When I deleted all the sorted columns (I copied data from those columns to one column to unify the data), the countif function worked again. I am not sure what the sorting has to do with the countif refusing to return tho. It
 was underneath a sorted column but I would assume that would make no difference? This did not occur in most of the previous workbooks that were sorted (although it did occur in one other one that was also sorted). Very confused.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the upgrade for your Dopod an official one? If so try a reinstall of this upgrade. Maybe within the flashing something went wrong</p>

<h2>            Phone timeline does not save all calls history</h2>
                    <p>I have a MS Lumia 950XL. Fully updated. Many times an incoming call is not recorded in the timeline.</p>
<p>I answer a call. The incoming number is displayed. Then if I want to return the call a few minutes later, the recent incoming call is not in the timeline.</p>
<p>So I cannot return the call as I don't have the number.</p>
<p>Very annoying 😒 </p>
<p>Is this a known issue ? Will it be fixed in Creators Update ?</p>

<p>Hi Matthew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help us better assist on this case, we'd like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Does the issue occur to all Excel workbooks? Please try creating a new test workbook to see the result.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Can you save another types of Office files to the network share such as Word document, presentation files?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Please check if another user is editing the document as the same time. Also confirm with other people to see if they can save document to the network share.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Your Office version build (Excel menu&gt;About Excel).</p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp; P</span><span>erform a clean startup (</span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>safe
 mode</span></a><span>) to your computer and then try to save an Excel workbook to determine whether background programs or add-ins are interfering with Excel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Changing MX record</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>we are currently in Hybrid deployment and everything is working fine. Current MX record is pointing to our On-prem server, but we plan to change so that it points to Office365 instead.</p>
<p>Are there any check list of things to do in this scenario?</p>
<p>What do we need to be aware of (ex transport rule) ?</p>
<p>Been reading some article in this forum, that we need to re-run Deployment wizard again, is it true?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Failed to upgrade from 9841</h2>
                    <p>I've tryed and tryed, I've read tens of discussions, questions, threads. But it simply doesn't work.</p>
<p>During the installation, he tells me: setting up........setting up driver........then restarts........attempting to recover installation....restoring your previous version of windows. I can't reset the system, he tells me that some files are missed, so I've
 watched in the WinRec folder and here there is a file that tells me: you are in the 9926 windows version but i'm still in the 9841. I've a hp laptop (pavilion g6).</p>
<p>Someone can help me?</p>
<p>I'm sorry for my bad english......</p>

This also means .ISO media (which is a digital replica of a disc) will also be delivered at a slower pace. This decision is partly because Microsoft wants Windows Insiders to stress test the new Windows Update mechanism for updating to revisions of Windows 10 in the future. This will be a new part of delivering revisions of the operating system in the future to both businesses and consumers. For persons who prefer to upgrade using physical media, this will continue to be an option available. In this article, we take a look at using that option.">How

            Before you try that iso try this for me if you would.&nbsp; Go and run, if you have not all ready, all the troubleshooting options under view all.&nbsp; Make sure you don't have comodo or an antivirus running when you start your update to 10041 or 10049.&nbsp; I have
 found my avast! caused the same error for me.&nbsp; I also was have trouble with comodo not being compatable so I uninstalled it.&nbsp; Also don't forget to update all of your drivers, Motherboard, sound, graphics, networking, ect....

<p>if you want to make it sim free, not sure why, it has firmward made specifically for ATT, then you would need to get the unlock code form ATT or take it to a cell phone store that can unlock it for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then you can put any sim in it and so long as the network for that sim maches the frequencies in the handset, it will work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but the oriningal question was answered, though because this is a e71x for ATT, i cant say all or what software would be allowed like a factory unlocked unit would be able to.</p>

    <title>MS Excel 2016 VBA import csv file based on cell content name - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianroberts999  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Excel 2016 VBA import csv file based on cell content name</h2>
                    <p>I have VBA to bring in a specific csv file (HYS.csv) to cell C5 - e.g.</p>
<p>Sub HYS_Import()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; With ActiveSheet.QueryTables.Add(Connection:= _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "TEXT;C:\Users\User\Downloads\HYS.csv", Destination:=Range("C5"))<br />
I would like the flexibility to name the file in cell A1 - and whatever name is at A1 then the VBA imports that file.<br />
e.g. say i want to bring in file&nbsp;C:\Users\User\Downloads\ABC.csv (assuming it exists of course).<br />
I would like to be able to put "ABC.csv" in cell A1 and the macro brings in that file.<br />
I have very naively tried&nbsp;<br />
Sub HYS_Import()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; With ActiveSheet.QueryTables.Add(Connection:= _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "TEXT;C:\Users\User\Downloads\"A!"", Destination:=Range("C5"))<br />
but predictably the syntacts are invalid..</p>
<p>I would be very grateful for any suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks Brian Roberts</p>

<h2>            No abre una pagina de internet, sin conexion</h2>
                    Hola que tal, tengo un problema al accesar a una pagina de internet. Mi equipo de computo cuenta con internet, pero en especifico una pagina no me carga, al parecer es un problema de Dns, porque modifique directamente el archivo Hosts y colocando su ip
 y su nombre me la abre sin ningún problema, al hacer esto se que ya no consulta mi server DNS, si el problema es el DNS como puedo solucionarlo?&nbsp; Gracias.

            <p>The answer depends entirely on what you want these parts to "do." For example, if you want page numbering to restart in each part of the book, you'll have to separate them by section breaks.</p>
<p>If all you want is a page with "Part 1: Introduction" (and similarly for parts 2 and 3), you might use a manual page break (Ctrl+Enter).</p>

            <p>I imagine section breaks will still be required because I suspect Sudhir will not want headers/footers/page numbers on the part title pages, nor, probably, on the first page of a chapter. Therefore an arrangement such as the following will probably be required:</p>
<p>Section 1 (or more): Front matter (if any), perhaps numbered with roman numerals; more than one section will be required if some pages (other than the first) should not have a page&nbsp; number or&nbsp; header/footer.</p>
<p>Section 2 (or higher): Part 1 title page; Odd Page section start, header and footer unlinked from the previous and empty but numbering restarted at 1 if front matter uses roman numerals.</p>
<p>Section 3: Chapter 1; Odd Page section start, Different First Page enabled; First Page Header/Footer empty; Header and Footer unlinked from previous and containing desired content (Different Odd and Even enabled if desired).</p>
<p>Section 4: Chapter 2; same as Chapter 1, although header(s) and footer(s) can be linked if the content is the same or changed by using StyleRef fields.</p>
<p>And so on throughout the book. Reference to <span>

                    I am having trouble with my Nokia Lumia 640 LTE. With my own home WiFi it cannot find the WiFi signal whereas my Samsung galaxy finds and connects to I no problem. Then at my parents house it can find the signal but says this phone cannot connect to WiFi.
 The phone runs on 8.1 software. Any help to resolve this would be appreciated.

Note that you should
 not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.

<h2>            Manage and revoke oAuth access to an outlook.com account</h2>
                    <p>Consider the following scenario.</p>
<p>You grant access to your outlook.com account from different devices that support oAuth (like Windows Phone) or oAuth enabled applications.</p>
<p>My questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where can I view and manage the list of devices and applications that have access to my outlook.com account using oAuth?</li><li>How can I revoke access to my outlook.com account for one or more of these devices and applications from within my outlook.com account?</li></ul>
<p>Things I have already tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the 'Your devices' section in the outlook.com account. This section is empty as the outlook.com account has not been added as the primary account of the device, but as an additional email account.</li><li>Change the password of the outlook.com account. =&gt; devices are still syncing as a password change does not seem to revoke existing tokens.</li><li>Enable/disable two-step authentication =&gt; devices are still syncing as this does not seem to revoke existing tokens</li></ul>
<p>Anyone knows how I can manage oAuth access to an outlook.com account?</p>

<p>Hi, thank you for the suggestion. Unfortunately, this does not solve my problem, as this is exactly my problem...</p>
<p>I want to be able to revoke access to my account if the account is not the primary account of the device.</p>
<p>If I set it as the primary account, the problem is not resolved but shifted to the account that was previously set as the primary account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I addition, this problem is not limited to Windows Phone, but it affects all apps that connect to outlook.com accounts using OAuth as described here: https://dev.outlook.com/RestGettingStarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If access cannot be revoked centrally from within the account, this seems like a big security issue to me. So I really hope this is possible.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem - looked everywhere and could not find where to revoke OAuth tokens for connected apps. I finally found it today though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Sign in to Outlook.com</p>
<p>2. Click your user icon at top right</p>
<p>3. Click "View Account". This takes you to an account overview page on account.microsoft.com</p>
<p>4. Click "Security &amp; Privacy" on the menu bar</p>
<p>5. There is an "Apps &amp; Services" section there. Click the "Manage permissions" link in this section.</p>
<p>6. You'll see a list of connected apps, you can click Edit to view/remove their access to your account</p>

<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your formula can be shortened to this and you can keep AB2 as an absolute reference as shown in the simplified formula.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=Y4*Z4*$AB$2-AA4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a look at the link below for an explanation of absolute/relative referencing.</p>

<h2>            Embedding Excel file on web using Windows Live - view full-size workbook</h2>
                    I have tried the iframe method and the javascript method to embed an excel file on a web page, and noted that the "view full-size workbook" button does not appear on the embedded excel div using javascript method, but the button does appear using the iframe
 method.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way that I could set this behaviour using either the iframe method or the javascript method?</div>

                    Hi, I had a skype account from way back and now I have a new Microsoft account with a new skype account that I don't want as all my info and contacts are on the old account. How do I either transfer the info from the old to the new or delete the new without
 deleting the Microsoft account? thank you&nbsp;&nbsp;

            You can't delete new Skype account without deleting Microsoft account. Hence, let's abandon this.

            Hi  Aneldu,
<br />
<br />Since October 2016, Skype accounts are now linked to Microsoft Accounts just like other Microsoft Services such as OneDrive. Due to this change, it is no longer possible to delete your Skype account without also closing your Microsoft Account. 
<br />
<br />The best thing you can do is no longer sign into that account and use the available options of transferring your contacts and credits to the new account. 
<br />
<br />Here steps for doing both:
<br />
<br />Transfer contacts:

<br />
<br />Transfer credit:
