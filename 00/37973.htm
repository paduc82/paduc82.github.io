<h2>            Automatic Repair Loop - &#34;Your Computer Didn&#39;t Restart Correctly&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Important note: I am using Windows in Chinese, so my translations may not be accurate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shut down my computer yesterday as I was going to sleep. I was going to allow it to update overnight, but I woke up to a Windows Automatic Repair loop. However, this one is different from the ones I could find on the Internet - instead of showing that
 Automatic Repair couldn't fix my computer, the message I got was something along the lines of "Your Computer didn't restart correctly." I was given the options of "Restart" and "Advanced Options." I clicked restart, but every time I did, it restarted back
 to Automatic Repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did to attempt to fix this problem -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling the latest update (my computer couldn't find the latest update)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using bootrec.exe/rebuildbcd</p>
<p>bootrec.exe/fixmbr</p>
<p>bootrec.exe/fixboot (didn't work, was responded to with "access denied")</p>
<p>
</p><p>chkdsk</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning off automatic repair (brought me to "Your computer needs to be repaired" and into another loop")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking "repair my computer" (brought me to "Your computer couldn't be repaired", which is the common automatic repair loop that I saw on the Internet)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Continuing to Windows (brought me back)</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Solved after completely resetting my computer, but I wouldn't exactly recommend doing this.</p>

            Hi Ron.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC following the steps in the middle of the downloads page here:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   You can also try System Restore to a point before the problem began.  
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I have a similar problem, I can see the picture but no sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using HDMI to a second monitor which is a Sony Bravia LCD KLV series. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested with Acer laptop -HDMI -LCD and it works. </p>
<p>I follow the closing both monitors and desktop and to reopen desktop first before second monitor.
</p>
<p>Both my playback and sound setting are to Sony TV-34 HD.</p>
<p>I tried display setting to both monitor and display 1 only, still there is no sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have update my driver realtek and of gigabytes.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're having similar issue as the original poster, and you have the updated drivers, we suggest trying to use another cable aside from HDMI to connect your monitor and see if it will work. Try using an external speaker as well to play sound as a workaround.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome so we can provide further assistance. </p>

<p>I use the current HDMI with a LED monitor and it works, I have not tried another HDMI cable to connect cpu to the LCD bec of its weigh and size. maybe as a last resort?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also emailed gigabytes for comments regarding their mother board. they ask me to update BIOS but I wasn't able to do it because window said its not a 64bits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used cpu to another Sony Bravia LCD higher version and its did have sound. tho when I tried to do it again, I wasn't able to have both picture and sound even if I restart it with cpu first then monitor right after in starting it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>my suspect maybe the LCD is much older version that did not have driver or something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. As we were able to isolate the issue that it was working with your&nbsp; LCD using the same connection, though the issue persists after doing so, we suggest contacting your device manufacturer and have them checked if your LCD's firmware
 is compatible with the HDMI cable that you have right now. </p>

            I don't know of any automated feature in Windows to do that. There are a number of "duplicate file finder" type tools I have used in the past. I haven't tried any photo finder tools (but I should be using one).
<br />
<br />Here are links to a couple of articles reviewing that type of tool:

    <title>HP Photo Connect and Desktop APPs picture &#40;icon&#41; overlayed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulettebraunbeck  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Photo Connect and Desktop APPs picture &#40;icon&#41; overlayed with a document downloaded from an attachment to an email</h2>
                    <p>Received an email that had a document attached.&nbsp; The document was upside down, so I "downloaded" the attachment to an area where I could rotate it.&nbsp; Later I was dismayed to find out that this upside down document overlayed two APPs on the START SCREEN.&nbsp;
 One was the DESKTOP APP and the other was the HP CONNECTED PHOTO APP.&nbsp; From past experience I knew that, by going into the control panel, you can change the background picture on the DESKTOP, so I was able to get the original picture back.&nbsp; But while in CONTROL
 PANEL I noticed that the default library for selecting the picture you want was "downloads!".&nbsp; It became obvious that that was the reason it picked up the downloaded document!&nbsp; Why would it do that automatically and why would it be the default?&nbsp; I changed
 the library to HP pictures and selected the original picture that I wanted back.&nbsp; That fixed the DESKTOP APP problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will that default library change back to "download" on its own causing more problems in the future?&nbsp; The second problem is, I cannot get
 rid of this upside down document on the HP CONNECTED PHOTOS APP.&nbsp; I unpinned it from the START SCREEN, then repined it from ALL APPS.&nbsp; The same old upside down document comes up.&nbsp; I can't find any setting for APPS that allows for the changing of the APP PICTURE
 or background, so I am stuck with this.&nbsp; What can I do?</p>

            <p>Thank you sir for your prompt&nbsp;reply.&nbsp; Your answer did not fully address my dilemma, but it made me think.&nbsp; I corrected the problem myself by going to the Start Screen, right clicking on the HP Connected Photo tile, then selecting TURN LIVE TILE OFF.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
 then reverted back to the original tile.&nbsp; How this upside down document found its way to the HP Connected Tile as a live tile, is beyond me.&nbsp; I did not initiate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Addressing your answer, are you saying that everytime you download a different type of file (song, photo, or webpage, or movie) you must go to Settings, Change Pc Settings, Search and apps, Defaults, then change the default?&nbsp; That seems cumbersome&nbsp; Besides,
 HP Connected Photo was not an option there.&nbsp;&nbsp;All it had was Paint, Photos, Windows Photo Viewer, and&nbsp;Look for an App in the Store.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Upgrade from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 Ultimate fails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan hicks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 Ultimate fails repeatedly and rolls back.__Need help interpreting cbs.log results</h2>
                    I have been trying to upgrade windows 7 home premium to windows 7 ultimate. It appears to install fine until it gets to 99% then immediately rolls back. I have worked with level 2 microsoft support and they are drawing a blank, so I turn to the internet
 community for help.<br />
<br />
In the CBS.LOG file I have identified the point at which the upgrade failure occurs.&nbsp; Here are the lines leading up to the 'Faillure will not be ignored' message.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you notice there is a reference to the path d:\w7rtm which does not appear in the rest of
 the log file, and is not on my original Windows 7 Home Premium install DVD. nor is it present on my system at all.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to resolve the problem are appreciated! <br />
<br />

            Hi Dan, <br />
Thanks for posting. Please remove all un-needed hardware and try again. If your still cannot upgrade then try to perform a normal upgrade rather than the anytime option.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Windows Mail will not minimize to the System Tray (Notification Area) so you have to use a 3rd party<br />
application to check mail from there.<br />
<br />
You can also check with the experts here : (just re-ask your question)<br />

<p>You may need to use your "Get Help" app and communicate directly with Microsoft to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>(To save time it suggests you try Alan Russell's response over on this thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/windows-photo-viewer-doesnt-open-jpegpng-image/9b6c30a5-0172-45e1-943a-2e5021155d79">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/windows-photo-viewer-doesnt-open-jpegpng-image/9b6c30a5-0172-45e1-943a-2e5021155d79</a></p>

<p>You can save it as a JPG-file, and then you SHOULD be able to see it in Windows Photoviewer or the Photos-app.</p>

 like to get rid of it.&nbsp; Thanks.

            Hi πανοςπανος, most likely your Nvidia graphics card is causing the crashing, however, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

            Hi πανοςπανος,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. This error indicates problem with your graphics driver. But there may be other causes as wel.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            You can upload without zipping. Zipping is not mandatory but a convenient way to have more than one files in a single container.

</p><p>
</p><p>I have a windows 10 OS and I'm&nbsp;using Microsoft Edge to try and connect to the internet.&nbsp; I don't know how it got this way, but I can only connect to the internet by disabling and enabling the Ethernet Realtek PCLe Fe family controller in the change adapter
 settings menu.&nbsp; And then the internet only works for about 5 minutes and then I have to disable and enable the adapter again.&nbsp; If I try to connect without doing this, the&nbsp;webpages&nbsp;show this message:&nbsp; "Hmmm, cant&nbsp;reach this page".&nbsp; &nbsp;I need my internet to work
 continuously because of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please help me!!&nbsp;&nbsp; The settings in Windows, says, that all my drivers and updates are the latest.&nbsp; Why am I having this issue?&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have a router that I have used too, but it does the same thing, whether I'm using the Ethernet
 cable to the modem or using my Wi-Fi.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any real help will be greatly appreciated!

            <p>Hello. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for responding to my issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed the windows troubleshoot as you suggested, and here are the messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The connection between your access point, router or cable modem and the Ethernet is broken."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or </p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your computer appears to correctly configured, but the device or resource (DNS server) is not responding. &nbsp;-network diagnostics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would also like to try the uninstall and reinstall of the network adapters, but where do I go online to reinstall the drivers? &nbsp; How much does it cost? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>You might have to download the Network Adapter drivers onto a computer which has internet and then you can transfer them to your computer in order to uninstall and re-install the drivers.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to use my computer in both English and Portuguese and I have already changed the keyboard layout setting in the Windows Control Panel. The problem is that what I type doesn't match the keyboard. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I type <strong>Shift+6 + a</strong>, the computer types <strong>ä</strong> (instead of
<strong>â</strong>)</p>
<p>When I type <strong>;</strong> , the computer types <strong>Ç</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;When I type <strong>"</strong>, the computer types <strong>^</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know what can I do to have a accurate keyboard (cant find the question mark)</p>

            <p>Hi Thâmita,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<p><strong><span><br />
</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does the issue occur when typing on a particular application or web browser?</span></li><li><span>Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>This issue could have occurred due to</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> damaged Keyboard driver. Let’s check if the issue occurs while using On-Screen Keyboard.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/type-with-the-on-screen-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Use the On-Screen Keyboard (OSK) to type</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not reproduce&nbsp;while using OSK, I would suggest you to try the following methods to troubleshoot&nbsp;issues with the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><br />
</span><span>I would suggest you to run the hardware troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + C</strong> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> under
<strong>Settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Now type <strong>Hardware Troubleshooter</strong> in the search option.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click on <strong>Hardware troubleshooter</strong> to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span><br />
</span><span>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to reinstall Keyboard driver\software in the Device Manager.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Expand the node for <strong>Keyboards</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Right&nbsp;click on HID Keyboard Device and click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Reboot the system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let the Keyboard driver install and check if the issue persists. If, however, the driver for keyboard is from a different manufacturer, then install the driver from the manufacturer's website or install the drivers in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To install the </span></strong><strong><span>Keyboard driver\software
</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">in compatibility mode, I would suggest you to follow these steps.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. <strong>Download </strong>the latest </span><span>Keyboard driver\software
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">for Windows 8 from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.<br />
<br />
b. <strong>Right-click </strong>on the setup file of the driver and select “<strong>Properties</strong>”.<br />
<br />
c. Select “<strong>Compatibility</strong>” Tab.<br />
<br />
d. Place a <strong>check mark </strong>next to “<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>” and
<strong>select Windows 8</strong> from the drop down list.<br />
<br />
e. Let the driver\software install and then check the functionality.</span></p>

    <title>Network between computers doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nt14_55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network between computers doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>We used to be able to network the 2 computers in our home.&nbsp; We could share the printer, see and transfer files on the other computer, etc. That was before Windows 10.&nbsp; Now we are both on Windows 10, latest updates, and ever since we don't seem to have a
 network.&nbsp; Neither computer cannot access the other computer's files on File Explorer.&nbsp; We are unable to share the printer.&nbsp; (Unplugging the USB connection and replugging it to one computer or the other is getting very old.)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are on a wi-fi connection and both computers can access the internet just fine.&nbsp; Both computers have Windows 10 Home, Version 1803.&nbsp; One has OS Build 17134.48 and the other has 17134.81 (6 days newer update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, this afternoon, we went through all the instructions Microsoft provides for sharing a printer.&nbsp; On the primary computer, the printer is shared.&nbsp; Both computers have network discovery and file and printer sharing turned on.&nbsp; When the second computer
 tries to add the device, it cannot be found.&nbsp; We've tried checking "old printer"&nbsp; -- still can't find anything.&nbsp; We've tried typing in the name of the printer (\\computername\printername) and that doesn't work either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know whether this is relevant or not, but after my computer (primary computer for printer) finished updating this morning, I was looking at what was new and tried out "Share a picture with a nearby device."&nbsp; "Photos" can see the names of 5 photo
 folders from the other computer (there are many more than 5) but when I click on any of those folders, it can't actually see any of the images.&nbsp; Earlier, it actually showed part of a photo as an image for each folder, but it's not doing that now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My File Explorer lists the other computer on Network, but can't access it.&nbsp; Windows Network Diagnostics says "Your computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device or resource (DS-HP) is not responding."&nbsp; On the other computer, File Explorer does
 not list my computer on Network. When we run Windows Network Diagnostics on the other computer, it acknowledges there's a problem, but the message says it doesn't have enough information to diagnose the problem!&nbsp; That leaves us exactly nowhere!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just tried a Network Reset on the other computer.&nbsp; Didn't make any difference. Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Greg, and thanks for your help.&nbsp; We did that fix on both computers.&nbsp; On my computer, it had been&nbsp; Manual, so I changed it to Automatic and clicked Start.&nbsp; On the other computer, it was already Automatic.&nbsp; It did not help.&nbsp; It may be worse:&nbsp; My File Explorer
 no longer lists the other computer on Network.&nbsp; </p>

            Hello ThomasBurns4 
<br />Please follow these methods 
<br />1. Make Sure Your Webcam Can Work
<br />First and foremost, let’s start with this pearl of wisdom. Please do take it seriously – lots of webcam issues are reported to have been resolved by following this pretty straightforward piece of advice.
<br />
<br />So, take a closer look at your device:
<br />
<br />Is it on?
<br />Is it pointing towards you?
<br />Is there anything obstructing it?
<br />Is your video switched on?
<br />If answering those questions hasn’t helped you fix the ‘Skype won’t detect my webcam’ problem, then you should dig a little deeper.
<br />
<br />2. Connect Your USB Webcam to Another Port
<br />Here are some port-related tricks to make your webcam accessible:
<br />
<br />If you use an external camera, try connecting it to another USB port.
<br />If your webcam is connected to a USB 3.0 port, connect it to a USB 2.0 port.
<br />Your USB hub / docking station might be having issues – connect your camera directly to your computer’s USB port.
<br />Check whether Skype can find your webcam now.
<br />
<br />No luck? Then move on to the following tip – this decision may prove momentous.
<br />
<br />3. Test Your Webcam
<br />We know you can go to great lengths in order to recapture your precious webcam – especially if you have spent a small fortune on it. But before resorting to drastic measures, you should carry out a proper investigation into the case.
<br />
<br />Let’s start with testing your webcam:
<br />
<br />To test your webcam with the Windows Camera app, do the following:
<br />
<br />Windows logo key + X -&gt; Search -&gt; Type Camera into the Search box -&gt; Enter
<br />Camera app -&gt; Allow to give your computer permission to use the camera
<br />Examine the output on the screen -&gt; Close the Camera app
<br />You can also go to TestMyCam.com to test your device.
<br />
<br />Besides, it is a good idea to check whether your external webcam is fine by testing it on another Windows-based PC. Obviously, a defective camera will not work anywhere, which means it must be replaced.
<br />
<br />Now read on as it is time to run some diagnostics.
<br />
<br />4. Run the DirectX Diagnostics Tool
<br />First, make sure your DirectX version is at least 9.0 – otherwise, Skype video calls will not work.
<br />
<br />Then run the DirectX diagnostics tool to shed some light on your webcam mystery:
<br />
<br />Windows logo key + R -&gt; Type dxdiag.exe into the Run box -&gt; OK
<br />Wait for the diagnostics to complete
<br />Save the results to a text file
<br />We hope you have just scared up a valuable piece of information.
<br />
<br />5. Make Sure Your Webcam is Compatible with Skype
<br />The sad truth is, Skype can afford to be picky about webcams. So, if it refuses to detect your camera, chances are your device is not among the chosen ones. Examine this page to check whether you are the lucky owner of a Skype compatible camera.
<br />
<br />6. Close Other Programs That Could Be Using the Webcam
<br />Regrettably, Skype becomes too shy every now and then. Therefore, it is important to prevent other apps from hogging the limelight as well as your webcam.
<br />
<br />So, if Skype’s attempts to detect the camera are futile, try closing other apps – they might be exploiting your webcam to the full.
<br />
<br />To do that, make use of Task Manager:
<br />
<br />Ctrl + Alt + Del -&gt; Task Manager -&gt; Processes -&gt; Select the process which can be using your camera -&gt; End Task
<br />
<br />7. Disable and Enable Your Webcam
<br />Reportedly, this quick and simple procedure is capable of fixing the ‘Skype doesn’t find the webcam’ issue.
<br />
<br />Windows Device Manager can help you out:
<br />
<br />Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Performance and Maintenance -&gt; System -&gt; Hardware tab -&gt; Device Manager
<br />or
<br />Win + X -&gt; Device Manager -&gt; Imaging Devices
<br />Right-click on your webcam -&gt; Select Disable device
<br />Right-click on your webcam again -&gt; Select Enable device
<br />Close Device Manager
<br />Using Device Manager to fix your webcam issues.
<br />
<br />Check whether your webcam is OK now.
<br />
<br />8. Delete and Reinstate Your Webcam
<br />If you want to beat ‘My webcam has disappeared’ problem, deleting and reinstating the problematic camera may prove really helpful.
<br />
<br />Here is how to perform the trick:
<br />
<br />Win + X -&gt; Device Manager -&gt; Imaging Devices
<br />Left-click on your webcam -&gt; Press Del on the keyboard to remove it from Device Manager
<br />Make sure Delete the driver software for this device option is unchecked -&gt;Confirm your actions
<br />Device Manager -&gt; Action menu -&gt; Select Scan for hardware changes -&gt; Your webcam will be automatically reinstated
<br />9. Check Your Privacy Settings
<br />If Skype can’t see your webcam, make sure your privacy settings are correct.
<br />
<br />To check them, go this way:
<br />
<br />Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Privacy settings
<br />Automatically receive video and share screen with -&gt; Anyone or People in my contact list only should be selected
<br />10. Check Your Video Settings
<br />If your webcam has ‘gone missing’, we recommend you to check whether it is correctly configured.
<br />
<br />To access your video settings, go this way:
<br />
<br />Skype app -&gt; Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Video settings -&gt; Check your webcam configuration
<br />Select webcam -&gt; Check what device is set as a default webcam (Skype might have picked a wrong device)
<br />If your webcam cannot be recognized, open its software
<br />Switch your camera on using its software
<br />Restart Skype
<br />Check your video settings again
<br />Can you see video from your webcam being displayed?  If yes, your webcam has just made it up with Skype. If the issue persists, there is no need to worry – just move on to the following tip.
<br />
<br />11. Check Your Webcam Settings
<br />If you cannot be seen while Skyping, check your webcam settings – this may save the day.
<br />
<br />Here is how to do that:
<br />
<br />Skype app -&gt; Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Video settings
<br />Webcam Settings -&gt; There you will find your webcam’s detailed configuration and driver settings -&gt; Make sure all the settings are correct
<br />12. Run Device Troubleshooter
<br />‘Skype not recognizing my camera’ can be just a preamble to a general webcam malfunction. We recommend you to make use of the built-in Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter – this tool can help you out by spotting and fixing your webcam problems.
<br />
<br />To run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter in Windows 10, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Windows logo key + S -&gt; Type troubleshooter into the Search box
<br />Troubleshooting Control Panel -&gt; Hardware and Sound -&gt; Hardware and Devices -&gt; Next
<br />The Hardware and Devices troubleshooter will run a scan
<br />Restart your PC after using the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />I hope it helps

<h2>            Problemas al descargar Halo&#58; Reach &#40;Juegos gratis con Gold Xbox 360&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Tengo un problema, me he descargado Halo: Reach con la promoción de juegos gratis con Gold, tengo una suscripción de Xbox Live Gold hasta septiembre de 2015 pero al descargar el juego la descarga se cancela al pasar el 80%... voy a almacenamiento entro al
 disco duro y veo los juegos y aplicaciones y aparece Halo: Reach con un icono amarillo que dice "dañado", borro el juego desde ahí y vuelvo a descargarlo, el problema se ha repetido en mas de 5 ocasiones son 6.55 GB de descarga y es molesto esperar tanto descargando
 y que el fichero se me dañe al final, varios amigos lo han descargado y no han tenido ningún problema.</p>
<p>Estuve buscando soluciones pero no encontré nada, espero que alguien acá pueda ayudarme, también probé a descargarlo en una unidad de memoria de 16 gb por si el disco duro de mi consola esta dañado pero no encontré opción para cambiar el lugar de descarga
 de los juegos.</p>
<p>Mi consola es Xbox 360 E de 250 GB.</p>

<p>Me doy por vencido, quite el disco duro de la consola utilice la memoria de 16gb como unidad de almacenamiento, descargue mi perfil, fui a historial de descargas y volví a descargar el juego... y se dio el mismo problema, al sobre pasar el 80% descargado
 tira el mensaje "No se puede descargar Halo: Reach" el juego aparece en almacenamiento pero dañado.
</p>
<p>No puede ser cuestión de espacio ya que en el Disco Duro cuento con 180 GB libres y en la memoria con 14.7 GB libres... no me tira ningún error de que el juego no sea valido en mi región (Vivo en Guatemala) ya que entonces ni siquiera iniciaría la descarga...
 me rindo al menos queda en mi historial de descargas por si algún día se da la solución... si alguien tiene alguna otra idea de como solucionar el problema bienvenida sea.</p>

<p>Como puedo ver en que región esta configurada mi cuenta? la membresia que compre es de 12 meses región libre, la consola la tengo también como otra región ya que Guatemala no aparece aun en el marketplace sin embargo las compras que he realizado me las carga
 en Euros, mi cuenta de microsoft si esta registrada en Guatemala, aunque ayer que estuve revisando el estado de las compras aparecen como que si mi cuenta estuviera registrada en España, y no lo esta.</p>
<p>Alguien que me instruya bien en el tema de las regiones y como puedo solucionar esto para evitar problemas en el futuro de cualquier índole.</p>
<p>Gracias por su tiempo.</p>

<p>Ya encontre como migrar mi cuenta, si esta en región de España (ni idea porque), al llegar a casa haré el proceso para migrarla según leí se puede una vez cada tres meses y como nunca la he migrado supongo que no hay problema, les comento en la noche como
 me fue con el cambio de región y con la descarga del juego.</p>

<p>Compre Juego Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 online en Xbox 360, empezo a descargarse pero no se descargo todo el paquete por que no tenia memoria suficiente, agregue una memoria con 16 GB a mi Xbox 360 para transferir el juego y no se pasa todo me marcaba error,
 tengo Xbox Live y tambien lo intente transferir a mi nube y me marca error tambien, esta la opcion de cancelar la compra, si lo hago puedo volver a comprarlo y elegir el lugar de almecenamiento donde este el espacio que necesita el juego? No pierdo el dinero
 que hize por la compra ya que me aparece en mi saldo de Xbox descontado por la compra.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>In case you haven't noticed yet, this issue is now resolved as of yesterday evening. If you are still having issues, be sure to hard power cycle your console by holding the power button for 8-10 seconds. If you're still having issues after that, please uninstall and reinstall the game. Let me know how it goes!</p>
