                    <p>Hi Support Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I modified the command line on the post by Coldfury in order to make it run on my machine:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"C:\Users\EndUser\Desktop\windowsupdateagent30-x64.exe /wuforce"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And all I get is an error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows Update Agent Installer encountered unrecoverable error."</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Seraphatar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you made some changes on your device, there's a possibility that it messed up something in it. I was able to find a case that is somehow similar to this one. You can try to check and review a post that was resolved by
<strong>Matt </strong>and <strong>Sohail </strong>on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other/windowsupdate8007371b-windowsupdatedt000/6291e13e-2841-48b2-91d2-71ac0adea82f">link</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will wait for your response.</p>

    <title>Windows XP OS Download. I need the installation disk. Have Product Key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mswhip  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP OS Download. I need the installation disk. Have Product Key Number but no disk</h2>
                    I checked in the Microsoft site everywhere, it seems that Microsoft has decided to abandon its customers to their own fate once they declare a product 'obsolete'. (they need to sell the newer versions) So stopping support of the previous helps them to
 induce (force) people to migrate to Win 7<br />
<br />
Now more to the point does anyone know how would someone that misplaced the original installation disk but still holds a legitimate right of ownership by having a Product Key number of the Windows XP could download a copy of the OS to be able to reinstall it
 in the original computer?<br />
<br />
I will appreciate knowledgeable answers.<br />
<br />
Thank you kindly<br />

            The key you press varies widely depending on which Dell model computer that you have.&nbsp; Some models do not even have this option.&nbsp; Your logical next step now would be to download your computer manual from Dell which will give you specific instructions for
 your model on how to reinstall the operating system.<br />
<br />
Go to&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://www.dell.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com</a> &gt;<br />
On the main page at the bottom under "Support", click on the "Drivers and Downloads" link<br />
Then click on the "Support for Home Users" link on the next page.<br />
You will then be requested to identify your model of computer.<br />
After you do this, click on "Manuals" in the left-hand border and follow prompts to download the manual(s) for your computer.&nbsp; These manuals should contain the instructions that you need to reinstall Windows.<br />

    <title>Extract all files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scruboak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extract all files</h2>
                    
<p><span>I am running Window 7 Home &amp; Student and have downloaded some topo maps.&nbsp; They are zipped map files and I want to extract all files
 into a non-zipped folder. <br />
<br />
When I follow Microsoft's video instructions a zipped folder is created with a subfolder that is not a zipped folder.&nbsp; The Zipped folder is empty except for the subfolder and the subfolder contains the files.&nbsp; The files are still zipped even after I clicked
 "Extract all Files".<br />
<br />
If I delete the subfolder and it's files and then copy and paste the files from the original folder which are already zipped into the zipped folder and wait for the long rezipping process I have zipped files in a zipped folder.<br />
<br />
When the zipped folder is opened in explorer and I click "Extract all files”, the file names&nbsp;are placed into the map folder but not as files.&nbsp; Everyone is a zipped folder.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a solution?</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the clarification.<br />
<br />
I looked into the individual zip files, and there appears to be no recursion (i.e., no zip files inside the zip files).<br />
<br />
When I copied several of the zip files from the 
ftp.agrc.utah.gov site to my hard drive as you described, using Explorer I was able to see the .zip files in the folder into which I had copied them.&nbsp; I could then right-click on&nbsp;any
Extract All...<br />
<br />
</strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforum.ourdarkskies.com%2fuploads%2f1260997161%2fgallery_131_16_4036.jpg" /><br />
<br />
However, it's pretty clear that you'd like to be able to unzip the contents of the many different zip files all at once, to simplify the task.&nbsp; I don't know of any&nbsp;way to do that with Explorer.&nbsp; The "Extract All..." feature only operates on one zip file at
 a time, <em>even if multiple zip files are selected</em>.&nbsp; I'd have liked to see that work, but alas it does not.<br />
<br />
Faced with managing a huge number of different zip files, I&nbsp;would look&nbsp;into using a 3rd party tool.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
There is a free command line tool that can be useful for this task:&nbsp; The Gnu toolkit "unzip.exe".&nbsp; A very quick Internet search turns up a copy available from this page (there are many copies floating around):&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~jeffery/win32/http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~jeffery/win32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~jeffery/win32</a><br />
<br />
With unzip.exe, you can start a CMD window, CD into the folder containing your downloaded .zip files, then run the following command:<br />
<br />
<strong>unzip *.zip</strong><br />
<br />
This will extract all the files from all the zips into the current folder.&nbsp; You can then use Explorer, sort by type, and copy the files elsewhere if you'd like.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />

    <title>AutoPlay via a Remote Desktop connection not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timothyburgess  say:</h3>
<h2>            AutoPlay via a Remote Desktop connection not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having trouble with AutoPlay when connecting using Remote Desktop.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 intel nucs connected. 1 Nuc (say A) controlling the other (say B) over Remote Desktop on a lan. If I connect a card reader into the B computer, watching via remote desktop nuc A, auto play is not working when plugging in a card reader with compact
 flash card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can goto explorer on nuc B &amp; open Explorer, right click on the card &amp; select AutoPlay &amp; the associated software correctly opens. however it requires this manual step, so not working really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas. i used to use ymultiplicity to remote access &amp; had no problems so i think it is related to Remote Desktop. i have explored much on-line but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks. timothy</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your device?</li><li>Have you made any recent update or changes to your device before the issue occurred?</li><li>Have you tried using a different card reader and check if you'll still be experiencing the same issue</li><li>Were you able to do it before using the Remote Desktop Connection?</li></ol>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Christmas time arrived &amp; I only again am now needing to resolve this. The issue still remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions (not in order):</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Were you able to do it before using the Remote Desktop Connection?</span></p>
<p>Yes. I can duplicate this issue. If I have a monitor plugged into the PC, then AutoPlay works fine.</p>
<p>If I connect to the same computer using REmoteDesktop, AutoPlay does not work.</p>
<p>The issue is completely duplicatable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Yes. The issue is not related to the Card Reader (I have tried 3 different Readers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. No</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It's an Intel NUC running Windows10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am pretty sure this issue is to do with Permissions around RemoteDesktop &amp; AutoPlay. When I plug a CF card into the PC, when connected to that PC via RemoteDesktop, I can see AutoPlay try &amp; start (&amp; the desktop does a little flash/refresh as if it has
 detected the card reader). My feeling is there some security setting that prvents AutoPlay from working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>It could be that the AutoPlay settings on PC B have not been enabled that's why AutoPlay won't work. You can enable it by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Ask me anything</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>autoplay</strong>, then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>AutoPlay settings</strong>.</li><li>Check the settings if it’s on.</li></ol>
<p>

<p>The issue is with RemoteDesktop &amp; AutoPlay &amp; is 100% reproducable &amp; I am sure you can easily reproduce the issue.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Slow download speed after upgrading to Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tslone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow download speed after upgrading to Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>My download speeds decreased substantially after upgrading to Windows 7 from Vista. I have a new HP laptop (with Windows 7) and an older Dell with XP--running both wireless off the same&nbsp;(new) router. I am on a 10 mb plan with my ISP and get 8-10 mb downloads
 with my Dell (XP) but consistently get 3.4 mb downloads on my HP with Windows 7. I used recovery manager and after setting the laptop back to factory settings (Vista), I tested the download speeds and they were consistently in the 7-8 mb speed, but after doing
 the upgrade to Windows 7 again, the downloads dropped back down to about 3.4 mb. Seems many others are having this issue--what is the fix Microsoft?</p>

<p>Hi TSlone,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!</p>
<p>I presume you’re using Internet Explorer to browse the internet and download files, is that right?</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d suggest you download and install the latest Windows 7 compatible network adapter drivers by visiting the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>If you have installed any other web browsers on your computer, check for the download speed in that and confirm if the issue recurs or not.</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d suggest you to boot into safe mode with networking and check if the download speeds increase or still remain the same.</p>
<p>Safe Mode with Networking starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers and services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>
<p>If the download speed is normal (high – as it used to be in Vista) in safe mode in networking – we can conclude that the issue could occur due to any incompatible third party drivers or any startup programs or services in the normal mode.</p>
<p>The Advanced Boot Options screen lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes. You can access the menu by turning on your computer and pressing the F8 key before Windows starts.</p>
<p>Refer the link below for more details:</p>
<p><strong>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)<br />

<p>Let us know what happens in safe mode. We shall proceed with the troubleshooting accordingly.</p>

<p>I read the following help information but do not see the "Cancel automatic payment" anywhere. &nbsp;Why not?</p>
<p>Cancel your Xbox Live Gold (paid) membership</p>
<p>Cancel automatic payment</p>
<p>To cancel your membership at the end of the current term, turn off auto renewal by following these steps. With automatic renewal turned off, your membership will expire at the end of its term.</p>
<p>Sign in to the Xbox Live website by using your Microsoft account. </p>
<p>Note Make sure that you sign in using the Microsoft account associated with the Xbox Live account that you want to manage. If you don’t know the Microsoft account email or password, see Find your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>Once you’ve signed in, click My Account.</p>
<p>Click Subscriptions.</p>
<p>If you’re not on a trusted device, you’ll be prompted to choose an existing proof, either your email or a phone number, so we can send you a security code. The code is sent to either your email address or mobile phone.</p>
<p>After you receive the security code, click Next.</p>
<p>Enter the code that you received, and then click Submit.</p>
<p>Locate the subscription for which you want to change your auto renewing payment status.</p>
<p>Click Cancel automatic payment.</p>
<p>Click Continue.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I may be out of luck.&nbsp; When I click on the drivers in Device Manager they come back as "up to date".&nbsp; On the HP site I can't see anything for Beats Audio, and going to the Integrated Device Technology site they have sold their business to another company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least I have Vevo and sound in some other places, but I don't understand why I don't have the Windows sounds.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Play Anywhere Question &#40;Accounts&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there:</p>

<p>I think the Play Anywhere feature has a lot of promise and means I might be getting some more games digitally. My question is this: The email account tied to my XBL gamertag is different from the account tied to my PC. Will this cause a problem for Play
 Anywhere? What will I need to do to make a smooth experience?</p>

<p>Anyone know?</p>

<h3> cw93z  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Purchases on Xbox One</h2>
                    I have recently purchased an Xbox One but most of the games that I purchased on my 360 are not listed in the Ready to Install list. I have checked that they are present on the backwards compatibility list. If I go to one of the games in the Store it only
 offers me the choice to Buy Now and not to redownload.

This issue might occur if BIOS gets corrupted. I would suggest you to contact computer manufacturer and get the BIOS updated.<br />
<br />
Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can Cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<font><span>&nbsp;

Once you refresh the BIOS you will be able to boot to the desktop. Then you will be able to retrieve the data.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect your boot loader was messed up when you removed the 2nd OS...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did you select which one you wanted to boot before deleting it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could try booting with your Win 8 disk and select troubleshoot and\or repair....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could try an automatic repair, or go through the menus and look specifically for Boot Repair...</p>
<p>I don't have access to the menus at the moment to be more specific.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wouldn't think that you have a problem with your bios. Nothing you describe should have any effect on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You usually have bios problems booting when you add or remove a drive, which can screw up the boot device order.</p>

            <p>Modifying the partitions cannot corrupt the BIOS in any way. This would require write enabling the BIOS which in most cases can only be done by the BIOS flash utility. Prove this by disconnecting the drive and booting, it should load into the BIOS OK. The
 BIOS knows nothing about partitions, it is only aware of entire drives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the BIOS check is complete it then hands off boot to the 1st sector of the boot device to load the drive boot block. This is most likely where the problem lies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Esc key is a little unusual to get into the BIOS, what make/model of PC is it? As far as I know only the DTK BIOS uses the ESC key, most others it is an F key or the Del key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you reboot after formatting the D&nbsp;drive? I suspect the Windows BCD will still be looking for an O/S on the D drive as this will still be listed. You may need to connect the drive into another system to repair the MBR or use the repair function by booting
 from the Win 8 DVD</p>

            <p>Thats why you are not getting in to the BIOS then, HP mostly use F10 as is the case for the DV6</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either it cannot load the partition table or the BCD cannot enumerate because a partition it references does not exist.</p>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the information, you are unable to open the external hard disk, as it wants to format it.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if you could reply to these questions to assist you further.</p>
<p>1.<span> What is the exact error message that you get?</span></p>
<p><span>2. What is the File System of the External Hard Drive?</span></p>
<p>3. Are you using the external hard drive for the first time on Windows 7 computer?</p>
<p>4. Are you able to use other external drives without any issues?</p>
<p>5. <span>What happens when you connect the external devices to a different computer?</span></p>
<p>6. Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue may occur if the File system used in External hard drive is not supported In Windows 7.</p>
<p>Let’s try the following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>To check the Files System of External Hard Drive, follow the steps as below:</p>
<p>a. Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>Computer</b>.</p>
<p>b. Right click on the <b>External Hard Drive</b> and select <b>properties</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p><span>Plug in the External Hard Drive in a different USB port and check if it is detected normally.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 3:</span></p>
<p>Copy/Backup all the files from External Hard Drive to another computer. Connect the External Hard Drive on Windows 7 computer and format it using NTFS File System. After that copy the data from to the External Hard Drive and check if it can be opened on
 Windows 7 computer normally.</p>
<p><span>a. Open <b>Computer Management</b> by clicking the <b>Start </b>button, clicking
<b>Control Panel</b>, clicking <b>System and Security</b>, clicking <b>Administrative Tools</b>, and then double-clicking
<b>Computer Management</b>.<br />
If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the left pane, under <b>Storage</b>, click <b>Disk Management</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Right-click the volume that you want to format, and then click<b> Format</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. To format the volume with the default settings, in the Format dialog box, click OK, and then click OK again.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Converting a hard disk partition or volume from NTFS to FAT32 requires that you reformat the partition, which deletes any data on it. Be sure to back up any data you want to keep before you begin.</span></p>
<p><span>For further information, refer the articles:</span></p>

 any formatting or fragmentation, etc n stop it abruptly. I stopped using it for a moment because I had to send in my com for service. After I got back my com I cant open the hard disk. I have tried pluggin the port to other USB holes but it’s still the same.
 It remains as&nbsp;Local Disk K. (Shouldn’t it be named by other alphabets since it is plugged in different ports?) By the way my hard disk is a 1TB Toshiba. I can hear some sounds coming from it sometimes n it vibrates a bit sometimes.</b></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Are you able to use other external drives without any issues?</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Let me take another approach than what was&nbsp;originally proposed. I'm going to suggest that you download, install, and run the following application:&nbsp;&nbsp;EaseUS Partition Master Home Edition. Its a freeware application you download from here:
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Easeus-Partition-Master-Free-Edition/3000-2248_4-10863346.html?tag=mncol;1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/Easeus-Partition-Master-Free-Edition/3000-2248_4-10863346.html?tag=mncol;1</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you run this application for the first time, it should detect your drive and allow you to format it. Once its been formatted, Windows will recognize it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know how you fare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi mikeshyne,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span><span>Have you been getting proper sound from the speakers or headphone for other files? Does the issue occur only with the ‘powerpoint video’ on your email?
<span>&nbsp;</span>I would suggest you to check if you are getting the sound through the same video on some other computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Also for assistance to office related issues,
</span></strong><span><span>I would recommend checking Microsoft Office specific resources. Please visit the link below to find a community that will offer the support you request in the right

<h2>            Rugby World Cup 2011</h2>
                    
<p>Played the demo, thought it was alright. &nbsp;Disappointing that they only allowed for a half to be played, but not surprising. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of you that have played it, what are your thoughts on this game? &nbsp;Worth getting? &nbsp;Wait for Rugby Challenge?</p>
<p>Also, I have Rugby 06 for my Xbox and was wondering if anyone would be kind enough to post or send me the USA Eagles player information and ratings, if possible. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi mate I have had the game since release date and have to be honest it's disappointing, Game-play is bad players seem like they are running so fast there impossible to catch, Online is awful dodgy connection on every match, I'm just glad I sold mine and
 recouped most of the money spent on it. Might give Rugby Challenge a go but will wait on positive reviews first.</p>

1. Check with ASUStek tech support, their on-line documentation and drivers,<br />
and ask in their forums about any known issues. Update the <strong>Bluetooth drivers</strong><br />
and also update&nbsp;the <strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>chipset drivers</strong>, and <strong>
all major drivers on-board</strong><br />
<strong>and separate device drivers</strong> (driver update methods below.<br />
<br />
2. If needed use all the methods in the troubleshooter below.<br />

3, If needed run DriverVeirfier to see if it can identify a CAUSE (DriverVerifier<br />

This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</span></p>
<p><span>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause
<br />
these issues.<br />
<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows <br />
Updates to see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be
<br />
caused by a loose card or cable and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in <br />
Control Panel - Device Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off <br />
during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound and <br />
others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power. <br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>(Use RUN&nbsp;instead of Start - Search as used on Vista or Windows 7)<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in MSCONFIG.exe<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, <br />
Sound, or.....(and it still could be video interacting with something else). <br />
See&nbsp;troubleshooter link above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<strong>&nbsp; Run DriverView</strong> -<br />
set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. <br />
(also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down<br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click Update Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and <br />
Keyboard if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other <br />
major device drivers you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) <br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get <br />
their latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System <br />
Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT </span><span>After each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER <br />
– </span><span>Check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Headsets dont work</h2>
                    I have bought Turtle beach headset which are very compatible with xbox but I cannot get them to work. I have followed all suggestions on this website and still not working. What I see is a kind of mute symbol next to the battery power symbol on the screen.
 When I go to home and scroll to the right to settings I do not have the audio option which should be above settings symbol. It has been back for repair and still doesn't work. Im fed up with going round in circles with this impossible webs site.

            I'm assuming your controller has the 3.5mm plug socket in it. If it doesn't then it will need an adapter to connect the headset to your controller. The audio option does not show, if you are using an adapter though. Which turtle Beach headset have you
 got?

            Hi could it possibly be the audio port on the controller rather than the headset?&nbsp; &nbsp;I've had issues with a few controllers with the audio port.&nbsp; I also find it works much better with the official chat pad.&nbsp; The audio itself sounds so much better.

            Some headsets require firmware downloaded directly from the manufacturers site. I had to download an entire app on my computer to use mine properly. You may want to check the Turtle Beach site to make sure nothing else is required.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>Hey there Rachael,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Sorry to hear that you're afflicted with this problem. </span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have tried the previously posted troubleshooting steps already, then I would suggest trying what we call a soft reset.
</span><span><span><span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Just make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(as</span></span><span><span>they will be removed)
</span></span><span><span>and have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Also make sure that you select the option denoted <strong>reset and keep my games and apps.&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps here on <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to reset your console to factory defaults on Xbox One </a>and let us know how that helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If that doesn't affect the problem you're having, then I would contact
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">customer support</a> as
</span></span><span><span>Microsoft and Xbox have deemed this a known issue that they are in the process of working on internally at the moment.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>They have however, isolated this as being a problem usually occurring when working with third party headsets.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Though, there is a workaround that has been working for some. I would say that you try maybe purchasing a
</span></span><span><span>headset adapter </span></span><span><span>to try and get around this problem, otherwise you might have to wait for Microsoft and Xbox to fix this problem in a future update.</span></span></p>

<h2>            No internet connection after system restore.</h2>
                    OK I have a Toshiba satellite&nbsp;Laptop L305D-S59222. After I was attacked by&nbsp;the fake AV IS2010,&nbsp;I used several methods to get rid of&nbsp;it and once I thought one time it&nbsp;did it, I&nbsp;did a windows update, but it restarted&nbsp;before it&nbsp;finished rebooting and sent
 me to the system repair,&nbsp;and&nbsp;I had to do a system restore, but that brought back the&nbsp;viruses and I lost my internet connection.&nbsp;eventually I did&nbsp;a system restore to a time before it&nbsp;hit and that seemed to get rid of it. but the internet still didn't work&nbsp;both
 wireless and wired. Modem is a 2wire wireless gateway from AT&amp;T, but the modem is brand new and internet works&nbsp;perfectly on another laptop I have both wired and wireless. I have tried reseting winsock. netsh winsock reset on command prompt, but this didn't
 help at all. I uninstalled and reinstalled the driver but no dice. <br />
<br />
what happens is that when It connects, it doesn't go any farther that local only both on wireless and wired. no bytes/packets are recieved or sent no matter how long I wait on wireless and only 3 packets sent on wired. then I tried to manually do IP settings
 on IPv4&nbsp;since I thought maybe the DHCP was having trouble. When I did this,&nbsp;only bytes&nbsp;were recieved but none were sent&nbsp;and when I diagnosed it, it said that it pinged the remote host but did not recieve a response. so I put it back to automatic settings.<br />
<br />
oh the wireless adapter is Atheros AR9281<br />
and I forgot the detail of the ethernet adapter, but it was realtek. I don't know what else to do...

<p>Hi Edi1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I would suggest that you update the network card drivers on the computer and check.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How to update the Network card driver on the machine</span></strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Control Panel</strong>, and then double-click
<strong>System</strong>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the <strong>Hardware</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Network Adapters</strong> to expand.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under <strong>Network Adapters</strong>, double-click the entry for your Network Adapters, and then click the
<strong>Driver</strong> tab.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the <strong>Update</strong> Driver Software Wizard to update the
<strong>Network Adapters driver</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If updating the driver fails, then uninstall and reinstall the latest Network card driver by downloading it from network card manufacturer website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
