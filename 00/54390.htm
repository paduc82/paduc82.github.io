    <title>Start menu is partially off-screen in vertical monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> l.b. disher  say:</h3>
<h2>             Start menu is partially off-screen in vertical monitor</h2>
                    
<p>Left part of start menu always appears off-screen. Icons and the first few letters of each menu item fall outside the left edge of the screen. Any ideas on how to fix it?</p>
<p>OS is W7 Ultimate 32-bit (el-GR)</p>
<p>Screen runs a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">vertical</span> WSXGA resolution, that is 900x1440, and at the larger font setting (144dpi). Aero glass is enabled.</p>
<p>Operating the screen horizontally places start menu properly, but this is not possible in its required location. Solutions that involve dropping dpi are welcome, but will cause problems for its typical users, who have rather bad eyesight.</p>

            Can you physically adjust the monitor width? The monitor should have controls to bring in the sides a little.

            I appreciate the quick response, and apologise for my delayed reply. I have checked the TFT by displaying full screen an appropriately marked grid, and it's fine. Nothing else is being clipped except the start menu, and nothing is missing when the screen
 is rotated back to horizontal. So, it's a Windows 7 issue, not a monitor issue. Alas, this is a known Windows 7 issue. System displays a warning against increasing font dpi at this resolution, which I somehow managed to miss. Start menu is properly placed
 at the lower (default) font size setting. This still leaves me between a rock of a misplaced start menu and a hard place of a user for whom default dpi is challenging. So I guess I'm hoping there's some arcane hack I can apply to fix the issue for a particular
 resolution/dpi combination. There is enough screen space to accommodate such a horizontal offset, but I have no idea whether/how this is possible. I am prepared to do some reading / experimenting, were one to point me to appropriate docu

            Not sure if this will help anyone but I had an issue with my start menu not being fully visible on the side with the time and I used my monitor settings to do an "auto-adjust" and it fixed the problem perfectly. :)

<div>I installed my second antivirus (removed my first one) and now the antivirus is loading after many applications are loaded. I want the computer to load the antivirus program to load first and then the rest of the programs. How can i do that? How can i&nbsp;prioritize&nbsp;the

            <p>I understand this.&nbsp; As with the original poster has said.&nbsp; I believe it is Microsoft responsibility to give us users the option to select a startup order.&nbsp; It could be either by program by program, or group by group.&nbsp; In all editions of windows.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each computer would have&nbsp;three actual&nbsp;accounts, one primary admin account with 16 digit alphanumeric symbol password, and a lower class 'mid level'&nbsp;admin account "only to view important files" not to edit them.&nbsp; And guest account or user account.&nbsp; The user
 account could be changed to either guest, mid level admin, or full admin.&nbsp; But would still require the password when changing any setting.&nbsp; To include activation of syskey, even under full admin mode while logged in as a user.&nbsp; Also when creating or changing
 user and accounts.&nbsp; It will always ask for the admin password.&nbsp; This is to verify the changes are indeed being made by the admin and not a user whom got access to the admin account by mistake.&nbsp; They can view but not make changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lower class admin have admin rights to view several things a higher class admin can.&nbsp; Just they can't edit them.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;they can't&nbsp;run seriously effect admin programs like syskey, regedit, and any other program that would cost the user to replace the computer
 or have to do an Full Factory Restore on it.&nbsp; Guest accounts would require the lower admin account to view them and the higher admin account to be able to make changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Security is the very first group, and would take the high class admin password to assign a program in it.&nbsp; No other group will load until it successfully loads.&nbsp; The higher class admin password prevents other rogue programs to edit this group so that it
 can't disable it.&nbsp; Nor can the default directory it resides in can be edited to prevent rogue programs that try to disable them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the other groups could be named by the user.&nbsp; Like the Game group for Steam, Origin and any other gaming software, device group like for HP scan to computer, Logitech Keyboard, mouse, joystick, controllers.&nbsp; Some of these programs have heavy internet
 usage when starting up loading the user account when logging in.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it get loaded after the security group so their connect cans be monitored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The task manager would get an upgrade, be able to pause all data processing by lower class groups that are not apart of the security group.&nbsp; Be able to pull up the security group main antivirus program.&nbsp; Run scans of the memory to see if a rogue program
 attempt to invade in.&nbsp; This pause feature would help free CPU processing power to give to the antivirus / security group to do its function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have virtualization mode as the default mode.&nbsp; This prevents all important files from being ever edited by the user unless the higher class admin password was entered in.&nbsp; Either directly by themselves, or through a remote desktop app.&nbsp; During a reboot,
 if a failed reboot happens.&nbsp; It goes back to a prior successful reboot configuration.&nbsp; No other software can edit or be installed unless the higher class admin password was typed in. &nbsp; Also if an app was rogue indeed, it only messes up a virtualization and
 not the actual operating system.&nbsp; You would know exactly what app was rogue and be able to report it.&nbsp; The ability for the admin account&nbsp;to save the current virtualization content, forward it to a support line / group that would specialize in helping keeping
 these rogues programs from affecting and infecting other users.&nbsp; It would give McAfee, Norton and the other true actual security protection software makers to help put into their search libraries.&nbsp; It only saves important bootup info and what was ran.&nbsp; Not
 user data that is considered PII.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This virtualization mode would also be a blind one.&nbsp; Meaning not show up as a virtual machine in any part of it.&nbsp; So that if a remote pc hack happens, either through a back door hack or through a remote desktop app.&nbsp; They will not tell the deference.&nbsp; When
 installing applications, you get to tell the OS what type of app it is.&nbsp; Is it a remote desktop app, a game app, a device app such as HP, Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick.&nbsp; And what level privileges it will have.&nbsp; And if need be, be&nbsp;granted a higher&nbsp;class admin control
 either mid level to highest level per session only or permanently with use of the full admin password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically an overhaul on user access and control along with&nbsp;startup and control&nbsp;with level access assigning to apps.</p>

                    <p>I have windows 10 pc and windows live mail. I like using this email service since I have multiple email addresses and I can view them all in one place.</p>
<p>I would like to know how to set up all my outgoing mail to automatically BCC me.</p>
<p>Also, what's up with the signatures. &nbsp;Sometimes it pops up automatically but most of the time I have to select which signature I want to use. &nbsp;Is there a setting I am missing? I would like the email program to always select the correct signatures depending
 on which email is sending the email...</p>

<p>how to set up all my outgoing mail to automatically BCC me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There isn't a way of doing that within the program. A workaround for new messages would be to use a template to start composing:
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Start a new mail message (Ctrl-N or ) and&nbsp;enter the bits that don't change, or don't change much, e.g.&nbsp;addressees, subject, body, pictures, signature and attachments.
 Format to suit.<br />
&nbsp; </span></li><li>
<span>Press F12 to save the message as an .eml file in a convenient place, like the desktop.
<br />
NB: the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Save message As</span><span>&nbsp;dialogue will by default apply the subject line as the filename; edit
 this to suit.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Double-clicking on this file will open a new message ready for completing and sending. The program doesn't have to be running when you start a new message in this way.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I would like the email program to always select the correct signatures depending on which email is sending the email...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is possible, however. On the <em>Signatures</em> tab of the program options dialogue (Ctrl-Shift-O), select the signature you'd like to use for a specific account and click
<em>Advanced</em> to select the account(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A&nbsp;signature will only be added to all new messages if the option to <em>Add signatures to all outgoing messages
</em>is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, a template could also achieve this. </p>

<p>No, I haven't tried the RestoreHealth option yet. I usually run the ScanHealth option first as this tells me whether the image is repairable. I will try the RestoreHealth option shortly</p>

                    <p>I have been seeing poor upload speeds on <em>only </em>my Windows 8 Pro system. It seems to be consistent regardless of time of day or programs running at start up. Has anyone else experienced something like this?

            Hey Jason,
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Are the slow upload speeds your experiencing specific to your internet connection or are you experiencing slow upload speeds when you share files to other machines?</li><li>Is your network card a part of your motherboard or is it a separate card? Can I get the model number of both?</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>Obviously there are several potential causes for this. If you're behind a router and have a separate modem, have you tried connecting straight into the modem, power cycling the modem, and then testing your connection?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If that provides better speeds, I'd recommend updating the firmware on your router. You'll need to contact your router&nbsp;manufacturer&nbsp;for the exact steps to accomplish this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

            <div>Upload speed issues are isolated to a single system and it's hosted VMs. This occured originally back in Septermber, and I was able to system restore out of my issues. That restore point is no longer available, so that won't work. I would say the upload
 speed is probably ok to other systems on the LAN. I have not tested that specifically, but the other systems pulling media from my system have no issues.</div>

<div>The NIC is&nbsp;integrated :(</div>
<div>ASUS M4A87TD/USB3 using RTL8111E&nbsp;Chipset. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have been running Win8 since the first release without an issue, and only started to see this issue in the last month or so.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Asus router is fine, I am running the latest beta firmware. My home network is IPV6, but I had to install the beta firmware to support that.</div>

            <p>I uninstalled my NIC and chose&nbsp;"delete the driver software for this device". This rolled me back to version 8.1.1020.2011</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was only able to obtain a IPV6 address until I rebooted, at which point everything started working again. I will monitor and report back if something changes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;At this time, I cannot recommend either of the updated drivers I found from Realtek.</p>

            My machine was running Windows 7 Ultimate until last week. The upload speed reached a max of 3 MB/s. Now after installing Windows 8, it fell down to 250kB/s. I tried everything except replacing the wireless driver,but I don't think this will help,because
 the issue persists even when the Internet cable is plugged directly into the machine. Looks like I'm going back to the 7 ;(

<h2>            Is MW2 still active&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been out of xbox gaming for about a year, and one of the things I was thinking about doing was picking up a cheap copy of MW2 but what I was wondering is how is the online experience holding up? Do a lot of people still play this or have most moved
 onto MW3?</p>

<p>Yeah Morpheus, connection is fine here since allot of Australians still play this, It only sux when we get a U.S connection due to distance. Now with COD 4 and WAW I can never get a local connection, where as MW2 is still alive and kicking. I spent a few
 hours over easter playing this and it was all good.</p>

<p>There's still thousands of folk still playing or back to MW2. I only play in the hardcore lobbies and each room as over 500 folk at all times of the day.
</p>
<p>I think more &nbsp;and more folk have gone back to MW2 as I thought MW3 overall was pretty disappointing.

We don't know why you can't install programs? You have to tell us exactly what is happening.  Try installing a program and capture the FULL and EXACT error message text and error code.

Why can't you play DVDs. MS decided to save money and not pay to license the required program code.  You have to install a 3rd party tool

The issue is discussed more here:
https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-watch-dvds-for-free-in-windows-10/

https://betanews.com/2015/08/05/microsoft-releases-windows-dvd-player-for-windows-10-free-for-some-but-not-for-others/

Personally, I use VLC.

            Hello Peter.  I'm Greg, an 8 year Microsoft Windows MVP, here to help you.

Did you just Upgrade to Windows 10, get a new WIndows 10 PC, or install it yourself?

Go over this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00

Many consumers don't like the loss of DVD player in Windows 10.  Free alternatives are discussed here:  http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/how-to-play-dvds-in-windows-10-for-free.html
I recommend VideoLAN option which is the most respected free open-source play, will play any codecs Windows cannot and plays DVD as shown in the link.

If you have problems displaying video or animation in your browser while online, install Flashplayer from Adobe.  

Please express your opinion on this and other issues in the Feedback Hub in Start Menu which is a

            Windows 10 does not include out of box DVD playback. Many users have switched to the free VLC Player which works great. You could try out to see if its to your liking.

https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html

As for programs not installing, see the following article for troubleshooting when a desktop program or Windows Store apps are not working:

https://www.groovypost.com/howto/resolve-issues-installing-classic-desktop-windows-store-apps-windows-10/

 Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.

Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
Scroll down to the bottom
Click Windows Store Apps

Click Run the troubleshooter

When complete try opening the Store again.

Also check if the Store works in another user account. 

Press Windows key + R
Type: wsreset.exe
Hit Enter

Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.

Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 

Check Windows

            Like usual, I resolved the issue easily by myself. Not sure why help never includes a solution, just shifting blame. I can see video now with Internet Explorer, not Edge.&nbsp; Windows should actually be used and tested before putting on market. I realize Microsoft
 wants us to use their products instead of Chrome. VLC is awesome as a player. Media player? Yikes! AGE OF Mythology STILL WILL NOT OPEN. I'm DONE WASTING MY TIME.

</p><p><span>I understand that you are not able to install Windows updates. </span><span>This problem may occur if one or more of the following conditions are true:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;If the Windows Update database is corrupted. </p>
<p>
</p><p>b.&nbsp;If the <strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) service</strong> &amp;
<strong>Cryptographic Service </strong>do not receive a content link header.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c.&nbsp;If a required system file is registered incorrectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi, </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The System Recovery Options menu contains several tools, such as Startup Repair, that can help you recover Windows from a serious error.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to this article to know more.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What are the system recovery options in Windows?</span></strong><span>:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/what-are-system-recovery-options#what-are-system-recovery-options=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/what-are-system-recovery-options#what-are-system-recovery-options=windows-7</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> System Restore will not revert any of the non-system files like documents, email, music, etc. to a previous state. These types files are completely unaffected by System Restore. If your intention with this tool was to recover
 a deleted non-system file, try using a file recovery program instead of System Restore.
</p>
<p>Note: It is advisable to back up your data to be on the safer side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            My boyfriends email adress is suddenly connected to my Skype user. How do we fix that&#63;</h2>
                    My boyfriend didn't remember his Skype user name and requested a new password to the email adress he believed was used. This resulted in merging his Microsoft user and Skype. He then tried logging on to Skype on my Iphone, and behold.... my user came up.
 How is that possible and how do we fix that?

<div>You can't. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All 32-bit client versions of Windows (not just XP/Vista/7) have a 4GB</div>
<div>address space (64-bit versions can use much more). That's the</div>
<div>theoretical upper limit beyond which you can not go. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But you can't use the entire address space. Even though you have a 4GB</div>
<div>address space, you can only use *around* 3.1GB of RAM. That's because</div>
<div>some of that space is used by hardware and is not available to the</div>
<div>operating system and applications. The amount you can </div>
<div>use varies, depending on what hardware you have installed, but can</div>
<div>range from as little as 2GB to as much as 3.5GB. It's usually around</div>
<div>3.1GB. You are getting a little more than average.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note that the hardware is using the address *space*, not the actual</div>
<div>RAM itself. If you have a greater amount of RAM, the rest of the RAM</div>
<div>goes unused because there is no address space to map it to. </div>

You can buy Vista Business from the above Microsoft link.<br />
<br />
As well as the Software, you will be buying the Licence/Product Key.<br />

            Hi, the most reliable method for converting WPS files to word is to open them in Open Office, save them as .docx and then they will be MS Word Compatible.
<br />
<br />I know it is a pain to have ot install Open Office, but I have converted thousands of these documents over time and have found this to e the only reliable method
<br />
<br />The official installer for Open Office is available from here:

<p>The problem that I called in for help with was regarding Microsoft Works and the over 100 documents I have created with this product.&nbsp; As Microsoft Works has been discontinued, I am unable to utilize Word as it doesn't recognize the Microsoft Works coding.&nbsp;
 I am not left with all of these documents without a resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially the representatives that I dealt with were under the impression that Word would recognize the Works documents, but after a good deal of time with the last representative who tried very hard to help me, it just couldn't be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I am an unhappy customer left with documents including two books and lists for labels that I created with Works that I cannot open or utilize.&nbsp; I am not unhappy with the representatives that tried to help me as there hands were tied also.</p>

            For viewing only...you could use VLC Media Player.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
VLC Media Player<br />
<a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_vlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_vlc/</a><br />
(runs on XP/Vista/7)<br />
<br />
After installing VLC open a video and pause it...then go to...<br />
Tools / Effects and Filters / Video Effects tab / Geometry tab /<br />
Check the Rotate box / Drag the circle / Close / Play.<br />
<br />
If you wish to rotate the video and save the new version...<br />
Windows Live Movie Maker may be worth a try:<br />
<br />
Rotate a Video 90 degrees with VLC or Windows Live Movie Maker<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/14751/rotate-a-video-90-degrees-with-vlc-or-windows-live-movie-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/14751/rotate-a-video-90-degrees-with-vlc-or-windows-live-movie-maker/</a><br />
<br />
Windows Live Movie Maker - Rotate Right 90°<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sshot710.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sshot710.png</a><br />
<br />
If the video clips are not compatible with Windows <br />
Live Movie Maker...it may be worth a try to convert <br />
them to the .WMV format before importing into Live<br />
Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
There are many converters available on the net...some <br />
free...some retail.<br />
<br />
The following freeware converters are just examples:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
1) Sothink Free Video Converter<br />
<a href="http://www.sothinkmedia.com/video-converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sothinkmedia.com/video-converter/</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7)<br />
<br />
You will need to unzip the file..or you could just drag<br />
the Setup.exe file out of the folder and drop it on your <br />
desktop and install from there.<br />
<br />
Once installed...open Sothink and go to...Add Files button...<br />
browse to and select the clips you wish to convert.<br />
<br />
Next...in the Encoding Settings...Choose...Generic Video / <br />
WMV - Windows Media Video (*.wmv).<br />
<br />
Choose an output folder and left click the Convert button.<br />
<br />
You may want to experiment with other settings later but <br />
this should get you started.<br />
<br />
2) Format Factory (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory</a><br />
(the 'direct link' is fastest)<br />
(the file you want to download is : &gt;FFSetup270.zip&lt;)<br />
(FWIW...when installing...you may want to uncheck<br />
'all' the boxes on the final screen)<br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7)<br />
<br />
First you will need to unzip the file or just open the<br />
folder and drag FFSetup270.exe out of the folder<br />
and drop it on your desktop. Left click it to install.<br />
<br />
Next...after downloading and installing Format<br />
Factory...you may want to open the program and<br />
left click the 'Option' button on the toolbar and<br />
select an 'Output Folder' / Apply / OK.<br />
(this is where you will find your files after they<br />
are converted)<br />
<br />
Drag/drop your video clips onto the main screen...<br />
<br />
Select 'All to WMV' / OK...<br />
<br />
Click...Start...on the toolbar...<br />
<br />
That should do it...<br />
<br />
One more option:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Free Video Flip and Rotate (XP / Vista / 7)<br />
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Free-Video-Flip-and-Rotate/3000-2194_4-10763530.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/Free-Video-Flip-and-Rotate/3000-2194_4-10763530.html</a><br />
(*You may want to uncheck the option to install the DVDVideoSoft Toolbar*) <br />

    <title>Externals not recognized&#47; not accessible - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Externals not recognized&#47; not accessible</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a laptop with Windows 8 and upgraded to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The past few years I've been using two externals. One has my whole iTunes collection (movies and music), the other one is for when I'm travelling and contains just music. With Windows 7, my older and meanwhile broken laptop, it happened&nbsp;that it wouldn't
 recognize an external once in a while. But unplugging and/or restarting the laptop would do it.&nbsp;Now with Win8.1 I can't access both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The big one, a 3 TB WD My Book Essential, shows up as 'Local Drive' (I renamed it to 'BigBook' when I got it)&nbsp;but I can't access it. When I try to I get an error saying:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>E:\ is not accessible. The parameter is incorrect.
</em></p>
<p>I googled for quite a while but I can't seem to find a working solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The smaller one is a 500GB Intenso, which doesn't show up at all. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There shouldn't be anything wrong with them because their data shows up when I plug them into the TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if it has something to do with USB 3.0 because two other externals which use the regular USB work fine (I'm really glad I decided to backup the music on one of those...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to make them work?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The "Bluetooth Mobile Mouse 3600" is a Microsoft mouse device that is listed on the supported device page here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-ca/support/troubleshooting/mouse/supported-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-ca/support/troubleshooting/mouse/supported-devices</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>The Bluetooth Mobile Mouse 3600 is connected and working, and I just want to reprogram the wheel button to launch the Magnifier app like I had done with my previous mouse; the "Sculpt Comfort Mouse".</p>

<p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>my computer typ is: HP EliteBook 8470p</p>
<p>
</p><p>and some other problems :</p>
<p>
</p><p>- sporadisch funktioniert der Energiesparmodus nicht korrekt<br />
- nach Aktivierung des Energiesparmodus kommt manchmal ein BlueScreen<br />
- wenn kein BlueScreen kommt, kann der Rechner nach Reaktivierung nicht mehr heruntergefahren werden<br />
- wenn der Rechner dann hart ausgeschaltet wird, dauert es 20 Minuten, bis der Rechner gestartet wurde<br />
- wenn der Energiesparmodus funktioniert und der Rechner reaktiviert werden kann, funktioniert keiner der USB Ports mehr<br />
- ZUSÄTZLICH: Der Rechner ist extrem langsam bei der Arbeit mit verschiedenen Programmen; er bittet darum auch hier zu prüfen ob etwas verbessert werden&nbsp;kann
