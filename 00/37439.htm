<h2>            USB Flash Drive not showing up in my computer.</h2>
                    <p>HI. So yesterday I was working from a USB flash drive when it suddenly stopped working. In trying to see what the problem was I tried many different methods that included going through the device manager (Which knows there's a USB plugged in and says works
 fine but still doesn't show up in "This PC". I tried going to the disk manager and it says there's no media in Drive F:, I tried changing the drive letter: nothing, I tried uninstalling the device and checking for hardware changes: nothing, doing a command
 prompt showed that there's no media in disk 1 which would be the USB Drive. I'm at my wit's end with this and I desperately need the information stored on the drive and I don't know if I should take it somewhere to see if I can at least get the files from
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help</p>

            Hi Maurice
<br />
<br />Do you have a non-Windows 10 PC that you could try that flash drive in?
<br />
<br />Windows is very unreliable when it comes to removable media like flash drives and external hard drives and a lot of the time, those drives will still work on a Windows 7 or 8 PC . ..

            Hi Maurice, yes a Mac would be idela to see if that data can be accessed, hopefully you will be able to access that drive, if you can, please backup your data at the first opportunity,
<br />
<br />
Flash drives are great, but they are volatile and can corrupt beyond repair at any moment, and are therefore not suitable for the long term storage of files, they are only meant for the short term transfer of files . ..

<h2>            need replacement operating system disk for xp media center edition 2005</h2>
                    Computer crashed. hard-drive checked &amp; ok. viruses taken off. Computer came with XP Media Center 2005 and Office already installed. It's a HP Pavilion. HP no longer sells replacement parts as it's over 5 yrs old. Where can I find a replacement operating
 system disk? Don't want to lose Office. Not worried about anything else too much.

            <p>If your computer did not come With any restore disks. Then it is possible that there is an image of your windows install residing on the partition of your hard drive. If this is the case, when you boot the computer and it's on the black screen, if you look
 on the screen, you should see an option on the screen that might say something like "Press F10 for Setup". If you have that option on your black boot screen, then you will need to use that option to restore windows back to default / factory settings.
<br />
<br />
You might get two F10 options 1. Non Destructive Recovery or 2. Destructive Recovery.
<br />
<br />
The Non-Destructive recovery will save all of your files and will repair just the windows portion of the system file.
<br />
<br />
The Destructive recovery will wipe the system clean, and you will lose all data. <br />
<br />
or you may only have the option under F10 to wipe the system clean. <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you may want to burn a cd with hiren's boot cd to copy your data, you can do this from a working pc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>Courtesy of Jose Ibarra</font></font></span></p>
<p><b><u><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
</font></span></u></b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</font></a><br />
<br />
<font>The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
</font><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://www.imgburn.com/</font></a><br />
<br />
<font>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install anything from UniBlue or the Ask toolbar (never install the ASK toolbar for anything).<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
</font><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</font></a><br />
<br />
<font><font>It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>cmd</b><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<b>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</b><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp;
</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction
 to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to
 be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>You may have to run the chkdsk c: /r&nbsp;

            <p>burn the cd of Hiren's so you can at least get to the desktop, what you need to do is look at the drive in disk management and see if a second partition is listed on the drive this would be the recovery partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if a recovery partition is not shown, then you can use hiren's to repair the registry:</p>

<p><font color="#000000">You need to start by booting into the XP Recovery Console using a CD you can make (no XP media required) and run a chkdsk with error correction enough times until it runs clean and if that doesn't work, you can create a new boot.ini

<p>Not sure of any controllers that could help as such. I can tell you that the Xbox Ones controller has a slightly different design the ok it's trigger, the outside of the trigger is curved outwards now, this could actually make it a little easier for you
 to reach. I know it's still not ideal for you but it may help a little. Is there anywhere or someone you know that has an X1 so you can try the controller in your hands first?</p>

<p>There is a guy on the internet called Ben Heck that makes controller modifications for folks that have disabilities. He has a YouTube channel called The Ben Heck show, might be worth checking it out :) don't know if he can help you with a customised controller
 but it wouldn't hurt to ask.</p>

<p>I remember getting some extension clips things for my PS triggers a few years ago, they came free in a magazine. Maybe there's something out there along those lines to help. Gutted to hear about your fingers dude.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your accident :(</p>
<p>I agree that you would benefit from a modified controller. There are plenty of vendors on the net that would help with this. It might be a little more pricy then a standard controller due to the extra work but for the sake of playing as comfortably as possible,
 it may be worth the price.</p>

<p>As mentioned above there are companies that customise controllers for disabilities. Some on a case by case basis where they work together with the individual and tailor make it just for them. I read an article in GameInformer but as I am not disabled I didnt
 pay attention to the name of the company. You might be able to find more info if you go to GI's website and search their archives. Pretty sure it was within the last two years.</p>

            <p>Hello Sajin7,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Often we see crashes as the result of a program loading on startup.</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve these, we use clean boot troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>The following article describes this process:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in
 Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a></span></p>
<p>If this does not help, then the best route to support would be through call of duty: black ops support.</p>

            <p>Wait for BitLocker encryption to finish. It does this to get rid of data left behind&nbsp;from deleted files. The 6GB is left to allow you to keep working while the encryption is done.</p>

    <title>Trying to connect to a satelitte modem via ethernet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike_ stahl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to connect to a satelitte modem via ethernet adapter&#40;LAN&#41;</h2>
                    I have been trying for 11 hours to connect my new Hughesnet satellite modem to my computer via the ethernet adapter. I have had no luck in even finding out how to do that. I tried to establish a new connection in "Network and Sharing" but there is no option
 for this type of connection. I've never used anything but dial-up and that's a snap. It doesn't seem like it should be so hard to add a new internet connection. Can someone give me the steps to do same. I'll be forever indebted.<br />
<br />
Thanx,<br />

Is the satellite modem also a router or simply a modem?<br />
<br />
If its a modem only are you also behind a router?<br />
<br />
Did you have this working with a different version of Windows before you tried with Windows 7? If so have you simply copied the settings?<br />
<br />
With Windows 7 if your connected directly to the modem use the option to connect to a broadband link. You would need to provide a user ID and password if the modem does not handle that already. If the modem is also a router you should be able to simply plug
 into the modem/router with an Ethernet patch cable. Make sure its not a crossover cable. In all cases make sure that the Windows 7 machine is configured to get a DHCP assigned IP address.<br />
<br />
I would also&nbsp;try the Hughesnet support site for help...<br />

If you have a HN9000 modem here is the&nbsp;installation reference manual with a procedure on activating service and a customers PC, which is looks like should have been done by the
<em>professional installer</em>.<br />

    <title>Surface Dock and external displays - a fundamental issue&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daveahern  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Dock and external displays - a fundamental issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>There are several threads on this and other forums relating to this issue so apologies in advance if it is a well known problem with no solution.</p>
<p>I have a Surface Book (highest spec) and Surface Dock. All updates including Windows 10 updates and Dock Firmware updates.</p>
<p>I have 2 x Dell U2515 2560x1440 displays. Both displays are connected via display port to the dock. I have tried several configurations (using 2 individual DP cables - one feeding each monitor - or using a single DP output from the dock feeding 2 daisy chained
 displays).</p>
<p>When connected I have the Surface Book native display turned off to avoid the horrible scaling issues which are discussed elsewhere and which seem to be down to the small SB screen running at 3000x2000 whilst the large external displays run at 2560x1440.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it all works it is fantastic - the displays look great and my workflow is great. However, it can sometimes take me twenty minutes of fiddling to get both screens to be recognized. If I connect the display port cable directly into the display port out
 of the SB rather than the Dock the screens 'wake up' and work perfectly every time. I then switch the cable back into the Dock and the screens can't be found again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I conclude that there is therefore a fundamental hardware issue with the Dock and external screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really keen to find a work around for this and I would even consider buying 2 4K displays if I was convinced that this would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anybody out there who has a stable setup with 2 external screens fed from the DP output of the Surface Dock?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft acknowledge this issue with its flagship PC platform?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Skype microphone not working</h2>
                    I have to reboot my computer after first booting up just to make the microphone work. Does anyone else have this problem, and what is the solution. I have already pressed Window-I and tried to set the Privacy for Microphone, but Skype does not appear on
 the list. How do I add it to the list?

<p>I am using Skype 7.40 with an Audiobox USB microphone interface, which works fine with all my other recording devices....but Skype will not work unless I reboot the computer a 2nd time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Echo Test Call and as soon as I try to speak Skype pops up the Sound configuration box and says the microphone is not connected. After I reboot it works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have re-installed the drivers, configured the microphone hardware and software. I've tried everything, but the only way I can get it to work is to reboot a 2nd time. I'm stumped. Hope this helps you pinpoint the problem.</p>

<p>Okay...after three phone calls to microsoft and opening a "ticket" on the WoT console website, I got a reply that sounded more like something for Xbox One, but it got the issue fixed. I will copy and paste what they said below. The only difference
 was that I previously uploaded all my WoT data from the hard drive and put it on a thumb drive, which I then transferred back to the hard drive after I followed the instructions below.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>NOTE: Who the guys at microsoft said plug a thumb drive into the one of the USB ports on the back off the xbox 360, they seamed unaware that the case that holds most thumb drives, is too wide for the area where the USB ports are on the back of the
 360, and would not allow you to plug the thumb drive all the way in! I had to pry open the case&nbsp;the thumb drive retracts into and remove it to get the drive to plug in all the way.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here are the instructions I got on the fix. It did take a few tries and I found that I could download and play WoT from the internet and did not have to have my WoT disk in the tray.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Hello Sir Veilance,</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting the Wargaming Support.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>I am able to see the error code, this code may have caused by a corrupted game data.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>We will be needing for you to reinstall the game entirely, let me give you the steps on how to but first, we highly suggest for you to use an LAN/Ethernet cable when installing the WOT game, this will greatly help to have a more stable
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span><span>Reinstalling WOT game</span></span></p>
<p><span>Before you can reinstall World of Tanks, you must first uninstall it from the console's hard drive. To uninstall a game:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Say «Xbox, go to my games and apps» or open My games and apps on the Home screen.</span></li><li><span>Select Games.</span></li><li><span>Highlight the game you want to uninstall, press the Menu button, then select Manage game.</span></li><li><span>Select Manage all, select Uninstall all, and then select Uninstall.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>You can then reinstall World of Tanks by downloading it again from the Xbox Store. To download the game again, search for World of Tanks in the Xbox Store, select it, and then select Install.</span></p>
<p><br />

<h2>            New computer Mcafee trial over and installing new subscription</h2>
                    <p>Just paid for first year of Mcafee and updating computer for protection. It had to remove old software and did. Then it said it had to restart. It did but is sitting with Getting Windows readyDon’t turn off computer message just circling for a while. How
 long do I wait until I turn it off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE - it took a bit longer and restarted normally and continued on with the installation. The secret was to see activity on the LED for the hard drive. Otherwise I would have turned it off! All is well!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro 1809</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>I have been fighting the Microsoft Update issue for over a month, have tried all things posted and to no avail. The troubleshooter finds nothing, I tried starting BITS before updating and continually I get error codes. Does anyone actually have a fix for
 this issue. There must be a solution out there besides doing a re-install as suggested. I have shutdown Bitdefender prior and no help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bob</p>

            Hi,
<br />Try updating to 1809 using Media Creation tool and if it fails let us know.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

            Hi Bob, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>As I stated above, after all I did, 1809&nbsp;and a reboot, the system started to download all the previous updates. I had followed all the info from Microsoft on the errors, different most of the time and did not appear to have any results. It just started working
 like when it had quit working, out of the blue.....</p>

<h2>            Netflix loads to blank screen, even after uninstalling and reinstalling Silverlight...</h2>
                    I just recently re-activated my account with Netflix-- only to find that I cannot watch movies at all. I experience no problems with the website other than when I attempt to watch a movie. It will load 100%, then will show only a blank screen. No sound.
 No picture. Nothing. (Except on the rare occasion that it plays for two seconds, but then stops.) I'm pretty sure this is a Silverlight issue. Please help me.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you.&nbsp;
