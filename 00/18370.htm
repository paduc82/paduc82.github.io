<h2>            how to install apps and games to external memory</h2>
                    i tried it in settings&gt; manage apps<br />
<br />
it only moves the apps to mass memory i.e. The 4gb sdcard0 derive<br />
<br />
does that mean nokia x platform doesn't support moving or installing apps on external micro sd card and only 4gb internal (merely 2gb available ) for apps and games<br />
<br />
even my previous nokia 603 has that functionality of installing apps and games direct to any derive<br />
<br />
c(phone memory) e(mass memory) or f(memory card)<br />
<br />
<br />
nokia x should have this functionality somewhere help me if it is

<p>Unfortunately, that is an issue with all Android devices, not just the X Platform.</p>
<p>Unless you root your phone and do the required changes, you cannot move the apps to the External SD Card. Now because Rooting is not too be discussed in this forum, the only answer we have is that "<strong>You cannot move the Apps/Games to the MicroSD card</strong>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>603 was a symbian. Even the Nokia Lumia Windows Phones can install apps to the SD card 9with the latest 8.1 update). With the XL, its the issue with Android which is the base of the phone's OS. Nokia can make this chnage at their end, but I hadly see it
 coming.</p>

<p>It is impossible. If you do a quick search, you'll see how thousands of users having phones (with 2 sd cards) are facing the same issue.<br />
Android by default mounts the internal SD as the primary SD card, hence that's where the
<em>Move to memory Card</em> option moves the files to.<br />
There are ways to mount the External SD as the primary one, but that's a job to be done after rooting.</p>

            To ferd7<br />
To move an app to the sd card you have to go to<br />
Settings -&gt; apps -&gt; manage apps<br />
Then select an app, on the left bottom corner there is the button move to the memory card.<br />
Not always it is enable. It depends by the app

<h2>            Onenote web &#38; Android App, error &#34;sorry we ran into a problem&#34; &#38; error code e0001bc, 4 days straight now</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been working on a notebook <strong>Windows 7</strong>, in onenote for 5 weeks, just getting ready to complete, and all of a sudden I
<strong>can no longer</strong> <strong>edit one of the pages</strong>, due to error message, &nbsp;<strong>"sorry we ran into a problem" then "exit or refresh"</strong>, neither of which does anything. I
<strong>do not have onenote installed on the computer</strong> this is only the <strong>
web version</strong>. I have been using firefox the whole time creating this notebook. There is no way to download the notebook. There is<strong> no way to edit delete or copy, anything on this one page
</strong>in the tab of the notebook. The <strong>most important page in the notebook</strong>, and this error only happens with this
<strong>1 page</strong> in the notebook. The page contains, tables, links, photos, and text. Happens in both
<strong>firefox &amp; IE.<br />
</strong>I also had onenote installed on my android phone, I was getting a sync error on the phone that said could not download section view error in menu. The error states
<strong>"can't complete task, try again, error code e0001bc".</strong> I <strong>
uninstalled it from my phone</strong>, <strong>rebooted laptop browser,</strong> restarted onenote,
<strong>still the same</strong>. Then I <strong>reinstalled Onenote&nbsp; on my phone, and still the same</strong>. The phone states it synced right now, but I can't view that page, and there is a message that says
<strong>"can't refresh". </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this issue, <br />
</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Yes I'm starting to believe it is corrupt. I <strong>wish I could copy it, but there is no way to do that</strong>. If it were as simple as re-creating but I will never remember all the info over the last 5 weeks of re-search, I would be lucky to remember
 20%. or I would have done that &amp; not posted the issue. I have<strong> tried IE, same issue</strong>. I wish I could recreate it! I have now
<strong>tried moving the notebooks to a new folder (in onedrive}, and deleting the old one, still same issue. I've also tried dragging the accessible pages to a newly created tab, and completely lost all images after doing that. So once a page is corrupted,
 there is no way to edit or delete it. Meaning the notebook will be forever corrupted, because you can't move pages to new tabs. I also tried to copy the accessible pages info into a new notebook, by just selecting each image with copy &amp; paste, &amp; they wont
 copy. Also, the phone app will not even open any part of this notebook, how can I delete this page so that the software will work properly in my android phone.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After 3 days of rebuilding what I could remember of the page, it has happened again, I now can't access the rebuilt page. This software is in need of major repair!</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Seems that the android app causes major sync/corruption issues when running in the background on the Samsung Note 4, that never resolve themselves. Uninstalling wont fix web based computer software errors, but at least (by uninstalling) they wont be
 never ending &amp; at some point you will be able to create new pages to copy old info from except, from pages you can no longer access, you will have to rebuild those, and then after that delete entire sections, to permanently remove the errors. Don't forget
 to uninstll the app, as it's not compatible, with the web computer based software. This should prevent future errors that cause pages not to be access/viewed from the web based software</em>.</p>

            I've tried every imaginable scenario, including your suggestions, but nothing worked, that notebook is too large to copy, it was just one page in one section. That section has been recreated, &amp; the old section deleted, the page with the error, could not
 be copied, as the error doesn't allow for copying. I had to throw it away, by deleting the section. it could not be re created. during the recreation each new page and section become corrupt at some point, so then I had make double copies of each page, in
 order to prevent total loss, this happens with all notebooks, including new ones so you must make double pages of everything and update both copies with new info each time, it's an awful problem.<br />

<p>I was able to fix this issue on a PC by pasting my contacts in wordpad &amp; clicking the "replace" option in the toolbar - in the field "find what" type , &amp; in the field "replace with" type ;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will change all your commas to semicolons &amp; you can then copy and paste from wordpad into BCC resolving the "no results found" issue.</p>

    <title>When can we expect Denim update for 925 in Indonesia&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> william sanjaya  say:</h3>
<h2>            When can we expect Denim update for 925 in Indonesia&#63;</h2>
                    Since the update to Cyan my 925 has been very unstable, and I'm putting my hope for better stability on the Denim update. &nbsp;However, the Lumia 925 is the only model in Indonesia that has not received the update. &nbsp;Any information on when we can expect the
 update will be appreciated.

            Well, nevermind that. Soon after I posted the question above, I performed a hard reset on my 925, left it for a while (without developer preview), during which time it may have updated itself, and now suddenly I'm greeted with a Denim welcome message.
 I was on developer preview before the reset. So it maybe that during the few hours the update was released or it had been there but just not accessible to developer preview users.

<h2>            Min and Vlookup an option&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi Everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have values in sheet 2 (called To Do) cell A2 through to A557.&nbsp; My formula is in B2 through to B557.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to look up each value in sheet 1 (called Open Animals).&nbsp; Seems easy (vlookup), but I need to incorporate a min function I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There will be lots of matches in column A but I then want to find the one with the earliest date which is in column B and then return the subsequent value in column C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this be reported using a formula?&nbsp; I have played around with the following</p>
<p>=(MIN(VLOOKUP(A2,'Open Animals'!A:AI,3,FALSE),'Open Animals'!B:B)) but I only get 01/01/2014 returned in all the cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be even more efficient could I then add to this formula something to show that if the result has already been given then to go to the next available positive result.</p>
<p>i.e</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Ox I need 24532 returned in B2 (sheet 2)</p>
<p>Bird - 4200</p>
<p>Dog - 69871</p>
<p>If Ox appears again then result would be 23/01/2014</p>
<p>etc</p>

<p>

            When you set up the Google Mail account if you chose Email only then it is a POP account and you&nbsp; will just get 15 minutes sync intervals - and you will not have 'as items arrive'. IMO Google Mail and WP8 do not go together or play nicely with each other.

<h2>            How to delete blank last page with a header and footer&#63;</h2>
                    I am using Microsoft Office 2011. &nbsp; I am completing a resume from a Microsoft template. &nbsp;I have a blank last page with a paragraph mark in the header and the footer. &nbsp;I have tried EVERYTHING to get rid of the paragraph mark. &nbsp;I have tried highlighting,
 shift+command+forward, typing before and after, going to the last page and nothing works. &nbsp;I am getting really frustrated, I tried copying it to a new document but am getting the same formatting errors. &nbsp;I just spent hours putting this together and I can't
 fix it! I have tried deleting the header and footer all together, but there is no "delete header" that I can find. &nbsp;Anyone have any tips?? &nbsp;Thanks in advance!&nbsp;

            It isn't the Header [or Footer] that's the problem -- even though they can be removed the blank page would still be there... it just wouldn't have a Header or Footer :-)<br />
<br />
What's causing the problem is that there <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> an empty paragraph at the top of that page, but it isn't in the Header. It's in the body of the document. It's there purposely because a Table in a Word document must be followed
 by one. The program automatically generates it &amp; it cannot be deleted. Apparently there is not enough space for it at the bottom of the preceding page so it is being forced to the beginning of a new page.<br />
<br />
As I said, though, the empty ¬∂ cannot be removed but there are a number of adjustments you can make to draw it back onto the previous page. Once that happens the blank page will evaporate.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>One of the most common contributors to this type of issue is that empty ¬∂s have been used to create vertical space -- a technique which is best avoided for several reasons, this being just one. If you delete one of the empty ¬∂s, that alone should do it.</li><li>Quite honestly, <span style="font-style: italic">all</span> empty ¬∂s should be removed, then create the required spacing between paragraphs by formatting the paragraphs containing text with the
</li><li>As a last resort, select the ending ¬∂, then reduce the Font Size to as little as 1 pt.</li></ul>

            No, but you could have a macro that repeats the settings.<br />
<br />
Printer settings in each Word session start with the default printer settings for the computer. Any changes to printer settings in one document apply to all documents printed thereafter in that Word session.<br />
<br />
So, if used it should either be the last job done in the Word session or you should have another macro to return the settings to their previous status. Such a macro could be run upon opening the document or intercept the print command in the document.<br />

                    <p>Hypothetically - if I purchase an unlocked 950 series handset, I'm assuming it will work on a non AT&amp;T GSM network such as T-Mob? &nbsp;If so, and I realize there may be drama in doing that, where will the software updates come from?? &nbsp;I refuse to let myself

<h2>            Microsoft Office Accounting 2009 - problem connecting to SQL - really really stuck - H EL P</h2>
                    <p>I have been using MOA 2009 for several years without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background</p>
<p>I had a hard disk crash, and also installed SQL Server 2014 (as a new install). I think one of these has caused the problems.</p>
<p>Another symptom is that Business Contact Manager stopped working in Outlook 2007 - I turned it off in Outlook but it may be connected to the MOA problems.</p>
<p>(I know i tried messing about with connection strings, so i may have added to the problem here).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I launch MOA as administrator, i get to the 'get started' screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>'open an existing company', and i select the relevant .sbc file</p>
<p>
</p><p>'starting microsoft sql server'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>then 'ExecuteRestricted.exe has stopped working'</p>
<p>
</p><p>then 'Microsoft Office Accounting cannot open the company because of a connection error'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>back to 'get started' screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>'start a new company'</p>
<p>
</p><p>i type in some dummy details and then i get</p>
<p>'the database that you requested could not be opened, or access is denied.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>i try to do a restore and get 'Unable to cast object of type System.DBNull to type System.String'</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Q &nbsp;How can i get back to a position where i can use MOA again - and what order do i need to do things in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help</p>

<h2>            Files disappeared in Adobe reader app</h2>
                    <p>Hi , I have Nokia Lumia 635 with windows 8.1. I've just noticed ALL my PDF files in ' documents ' have disappeared,but I know I didn't accidentally delete them as I haven't even looked at the lists recently. The list of ' recent ' documents is still there,
 but it only goes back a few days. (nothing special happened to the phone just before then)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking maybe a problem with Adobe app because ever since about a year ago I can't reopen downloaded files, even though they opened fine when first download. However at least list of them was useful to remind me to get them again when needed. Now they
 gone I'm really annoyed. It used to take a while to show the full documents list but now it's just blank, ( except message telling you tovlog in, which I never have) the ' recent ' ones don't show as repeated there. Also why I think something to do with the
 app ( not me) is that where it said ' outbox' used to be a message in a rectangular box ( forgot what it said) but now there isn't one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you tell me if my documents really have been deleted or is there a way to get them back? How can I stop it happening again? Note I have been refusing updates till now for fear of losing things. Is it possible I could've accidentally allowed an
 update has caused this. </p>
<p>
Many thanks</p>

<h3> kurtkaufman---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Google Mobile app result - Web&#58; No Gateway Reply</h2>
                    
<p><span>Using Google Mobile (search) app v2.03 (14) [788], on Symbian system s60v3.2 on Nokia n79.<br />
Perform search and click on an item in the list of results. Very often the Web browser will start up and instead of displaying referenced page, a warning will pop up-<br />
<strong>Web: No Gateway Reply!</strong><br />
If I return to the list of results, and click on the Google cached version of the link, the Web browser WILL display the page properly.<br />
If I then Click on Google's reference to the "current page" in the outer frame of the cached page, it also will then properly display the current page.<br />
This leads me to believe that there is something about the links on the <strong>initial</strong> Google page of results that the Symbian Web browser cannot deal with.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts, suggestions welcomed!<br />

<p>I can't say I've been able to come up with an answer to the mystery outlined above, but here's a workaround:</p>
<p>I have used Vlingo to speak my search terms (with Google set in the Vlingo preferences as the search engine).&nbsp; I'm not sure I get
<strong>exactly</strong> the same results as when using the Google Mobile app, but all of the results appear as a list of links directly in the Symbian web browser, and all of them seem to work as expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(OT: I understand that I'm using an older phone with an obsolete operating system, but it works fine otherwise, and I'm loath to add it to the ever-inceasing stream of electronic waste unless I really have to.)</p>

 can think of. I'm pretty sure the problem lies at the Google-server end of things: something about the way the search result links are formatted provides insufficient data to the&nbsp;Symbian web browser. It's strange that going through the cached page version
 to the current version works (as described above). Nokia s60 users experienced a similar (but not identical) problem in May of 2011, but someone at Google noticed the situation described on the Google Mobile Forum, and had the problem corrected. No such luck
 this time, I'm afraid. It may be that the s60v2 is getting to be too old for Google to bother with. It's a shame, but at least using Vlingo (or the runaround with the cached pages) there is a workaround.</p>

    <title>Assigning Work as Work&#47;Working Day in MS Project - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nelsontang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assigning Work as Work&#47;Working Day in MS Project</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tasks that are set to pre-defined durations (ie 5 days). I've allocated resources to those tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is input the required amount of hours the resources should spend each day on that specific task (ie 2 hrs/day) and have MS Project calculate the total hours of work they need to do for that given task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the task is 14 days (ie 10 working days), I want MS Project to only do hrs/day * working days so in my scenario it would be 2 hrs/day * 10 days = 20 hrs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I've set the task Type to Fixed Duration, when I change the duration of a task, MS Project will automatically calculate the total Work hours required while maintaining the hours/day intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current work around is to pre-calculate the hours required prior to inputting the work. So if I am looking for 2 hrs/day for a 5-day task, I set the work to 10 hrs right from the beginning. But I am looking for a way to input (not just view) the hours
 spent on a task per day (Work/Duration?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Nelson,</p>
<p>Unless I'm missing something in your scenario, it should be a simple matter of assigning each resource to a fixed duration task with the desired unit level. For example, let's say you have a 10d fixed duration task and want to assign a resource at 4h/day.
 Assign the resource at 50%, (assuming the resource works a normal 8 hour day), and Project will calculate the work to be 40 hours. If you then extend the duration to 20 days, Project will re-calculate the work to be 80 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this answers your question, please mark it as the answer. If not, what am I missing?</p>

            <p>NelsonTang --</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are assigning a resource to a Fixed Duration task, you will need to specify the correct Units value that reflects the number of hours per day that the resource will work.&nbsp; For example, on a task with a Duration of 10 days, if you assigned the resource
 at a Units value of 25% (representing that the resource will work an average of 2 hours per day over the life of the task), Microsoft Project will calculate 20 hours of Work for the resource.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you use a Fixed Duration task, and then you change the Duration value, Microsoft Project will always recalculate the Work and will not mess with the Units value.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

            1. In most of the cases, Skype plug-in installed in browsers was found to be a problem. Hence, close all instances of IE, Firefox, Chrome and other browsers if Skype plug-in is installed and see if problem disappears. If it disappears, you will have to
 either keep all instances of browers closed or you will have to disable Skype plug-in in browers<br />

2. GetRight /Flashgot are known applications which cause this kind of troubles. You will have to open the options in these applications and uncheck "Monitor the Clipboard". Windows snipping tool also sometimes cause the above problem. Open Snipping tool &gt; Options
 &gt; Uncheck "Always copy snips to the clipboard". MS Outlook is another known culprit. Shut down MS Outlook and see whether it impacts. TWimber (source -http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-excel/excel-error-we-couldnt-free-up-space-on-the/0ebf3553-996b-44e1-87b3-3b72bad5f09e)
 lists down following problem which can cause conflict with Excel for clipboard -<br />
<br />
Bing Desktop (fixed?)<br />
ZoneAlarm<br />
MS Internet Explorer 11<br />
MS Outlook<br />
Google Earth<br />
Google Earth Pro<br />
NetGear Genie<br />
Chrome<br />
NoteTab<br />
ZA Extreme Security 13.3.209<br />
TightVNC<br />
Jabra Direct<br />
Skitch<br />
Dropbox<br />
Skype<br />
Teamviewer<br />
Ask Toolbar<br />
MultiMon Taskbar<br />
Real VNC Server<br />
Free Download Manager<br />
M8 Clipboard (Freeclip)<br />

3. If above are not the case, it is time for some detective work. Start your Task Manager by CTRL+SHIFT+ESC or by CTRL+ALT+DELETE and choose Start Task Manager (or right click on Windows Task Bar and choose Start Task Manager). Look into Processes tab. Remote
 Desktop applications are known culprit. You can try locating rdpclip.exe and kill it. Also look for other applications as listed above in point 2. If these are not part of processes tab, then you have to do detective work. Now kill the processes one by one
 and monitor whether the problem has disappeared or not. After killing the process, restart your Excel to determine if problem has disappeared or not. This way you will be able to locate the culprit process / application.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
4. Type msconfig.exe in search program/files box above Windows icon (bottom left), look into Services tab and check "Hide all Microsoft Services" to hide Microsoft Services from the list. You can disable / enable services one by one as in step 2 and monitor
 whether the problem has disappeared or not. After disbling a service, restart your Excel to determine if problem has disappeared or not. This way you will be able to locate the culprit service. If you don't prefer msconfig.exe route, you can click on Services
 tab on Task Manager (in step 2). At the bottom, you will notice Services button. This button can be clicked to reach to all Services. Here, also you can stop and start services to locate culprit service.<br />
