            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This appears to be a new issue that the iTunes users are experiencing while trying to update to the latest version of iTunes in Windows 7. I checked in the Apple support sites and found out that uninstalling iTunes and then reinstalling it by running the
 installer with Administrator privileges has resolved the issue for many users with similar problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer to the replies made by the user <strong>turingtest2</strong> in the following threads from Apple Support forums, the steps are properly described there:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://discussions.apple.com/message/24609674#24609674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://discussions.apple.com/message/24609674#24609674</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://discussions.apple.com/message/24616175#24616175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://discussions.apple.com/message/24616175#24616175</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steps that were voted as helpful in those discussions are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, uninstall&nbsp;each one of&nbsp;these programs from your computer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>iTunes</li><li>Apple Software Update</li><li>Apple Mobile Device Support</li><li>Bonjour</li><li>Apple Application Support</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Then,</strong> download and save the iTunes installer by going to this link:
<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>And finally</strong>, reinstall iTunes by running the saved installer file with elevated permissions. Here is how you can do that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Right click</strong> on the downloaded installer.</li><li>Click on <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>Continue</strong> when Windows asks for your consent.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should help you resolve this issue. If you are still not able to get the iTunes program working properly, you might also want to post your query in the Apple iTunes Support Forums. Here is the link to those forums:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes. We will be glad to be of further assistance. Thank you and have a good day!</p>

    <title>External WD HD Driver issue in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpc401  say:</h3>
<h2>            External WD HD Driver issue in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 320 Gig WD My Passport Essentials HD (Model: WDBAAA3200ABK-00).&nbsp; The drive works perfectly on my Windows Vista HP laptop, however on my new Dell Inspiron 570 the drive will not load.&nbsp; I have tried all of the USB ports (front and back) as well as
 purchased a Dynex powered USB hub...thinking that the USB did not have enough power for the drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the drive is plugged into any of the ports, it is running with a white light flashing.&nbsp; I have noticed that it is detected in the Control Panel under
 Devices and Printers as "My Passport 070A".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The device status is "No drivers are installed for this device. "&nbsp; There is no option to update the drivers either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been searching for an answer to this as well.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for considering to suggest an answer to this issue.&nbsp; Cheers, J</p>

    <title>The OLD xbox one experience - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The OLD xbox one experience</h2>
                    
<p>Can we get the old xbox one dashboard back please? This new one is awful. It reminds me of the PS3s and that's not a good thing.<br />
I dislike that my five most recent tabs are on a separate page, they were perfect lining the bottom of the main tab. I don't like that my pins are scroll down instead of to the side, I also don't like that I have to scroll to the pins with the triggers, im
 used to scrolling to them with the bumpers like I spent two years getting used to. The store isn't as easy to navigate as it used to be, the achievements app is now 100% useless as you have to go your main profile or individual game hub, both of which can
 be tricky to find if you're not savvy. The old dashboard had a LOT more info on it especially in the social aspects, direct gamerscore comparisons, a leaderboard of gamerscore change AND the recent achievements screen which is the only social page aspect to
 be brought forward. I don't want a "oneguide" page either, im aware of what's on or what I want to watch, I don't need the xbox recommending me films/tv if I have interest in them I will find them, I have never seen one thing on the xbox recommends that I
 have given more than a second glance.<br />
Long story short please please please please let us revert back to the old xbox one dashboard. This new one is an evolutionary step back for consoles</p>

<p>Took me a while but I like the NXOE.</p>
<p>The whole recommendation thing has always been funny,even on the 360.</p>
<p>It recommends me games that I already have most of the time.</p>
<p>There are some changes coming which we are testing in the preview program at the moment &amp; the Gamerscore leaderboard is coming back.</p>
<p>I'm afraid you are stuck with the new design,they won't revert back to the old one now.</p>

<p>a rollback will not happen, rolling back would actually be a evolutionary step back.</p>
<p>you're best options are to give up and deal with it until the next redesign comes down the pipe(next year i bet), and then go to where MS is actually listening (because it ain't here) to offer constructive input.</p>

<p>Just as a note I am a member of the preview programme.</p>
<p>I've tried giving it a while, that's why I left it until today to say something, that's about three months since I first laid eyes on the monstrosity. But nothing is better than it was before, going back to the old version would be a step forward, sometimes
 people need to realise new doesn't necessarily mean improved, and that is just the case in this situation</p>
<p>This is exactly what they did with the 360, the bladed dashboard was always better than the so called "sleek" dashboard but an incredibly small number of staff at Microsoft decided for us. Its called a focus group and customer feedback Microsoft, listen
 to them.</p>
<p>I stand by my point that the new dashboard is both ugly and inefficient and in future updates concerning the layout of my households main media supply they should at least have the option of opting out.</p>

<p>the old dash was sluggish, clunky and to much like windows 8 rubbish, this new one is faster, acheivements load up quick, hit the trigger once and it highlights the game library tab and then your pins. &nbsp;but if it was to me i would have the classic blinds
 &nbsp;system back from the 360 lol.</p>

<p>there is nothing to realize, you don't like the new dashboard, are you alone in your opinion? no, but just because you don't like it doesn't mean that everyone is going to hate it, there are plenty of people that do like, personally i'm indifferent on that
 front, the old dashboard did do some things that i though were handled better, but is such a minor complaints that i'd hardly call them complaints, i just understand that it is a new dashboard and i have to learn how to use it, you will save yourself some
 trouble and frustration if you did the same, life is too short to stress about having to use a trigger instead of a bumper.</p>
<p>so just like they did with the 360, expect it to change several times over the life of the console, and don't expect an option to opt out, or just don't take it online.</p>

<p>I think you're all missing the point.</p>
<p>To put it in simple terms its like a car manufacturer selling "blue sports car" and you think yes this car is perfect ill buy it, you spend two years getting used to it then wake up and find the company you bought it from has painted it white and you're
 not allowed to change back. Life may be too short to argue about a bumper or a trigger but ill enjoy ir a lot by doing so than just meekly bending to the will of the powers that be.</p>

<p>The Windows 10-like UI on Xbox 1 is WAY faster than that old Windows 8 slow hunk. I've had Xbox 1 since Launch and remember how slow it was like at Launch. They did improve it after the following months, but when they introduced the new UI late last year,
 I was amazed at how much faster the UI is. <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-NZ/xbox-one/experience?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.xbox.com/.../experience</a></p>
<p>It's a Microsoft product, thus it will get regular Updates with tweaks and improvements and new stuff. I love how it says "My Stuff" instead of "Pins" or something. The Sidebar loads fast. UI performance is not based solely off your ISP speed, but also how
 they make the software. Life is about changes so we should try to adapt to them. The old UI struggled to load stuff fast like Friends, Messages, Avatar app, etc but with this new one, it can open stuff and load stuff roughly in 1-3 seconds, faster than the
 previous UI which was "Windows 8-like". People say there is no difference between Windows 8 and Windows 10, but there is. At Launch, the UI took 30 wopping seconds just to open up one thing like Friends or Messages, is that rotating circle and UI still struggling
 to load this stuff? But with this new UI and the 8 core AMD Jaguar APU that Xbox 1 has, it can load Friends and Messages in 0.5-2 seconds roughly. Just like how Windows 7 was a speed improvement compared to Windows Vista, Windows 10 is the same to Windows
 8. I think it looks a lot nicer, but the Community page looks a bit cluttered but there is a "go back to top" option useful because you can get spammed by activity alerts and what friends post and their achievements etc which show in that section. I would
 like the Community section to look like Xbox 360's Social section (Xbox 360 now has Activity Alerts they rolled it out late last year) where you can see your friends avatars and see who's in Xbox Live Parties without even joining it. I played Minecraft on
 Xbox 1 and was in Party Chat with some friends and Party Chat worked fine. I also like how quickly friend notifications get off the screen compared to the previous UI version. The notification box no longer sits on the screen for like 20 seconds or so, getting
 and staying in your way. </p>

<p>I also had xbox one since day one, and like all technology I expected (and still expect) sluggish menus and glitchy screens here and there, no matter how good technology gets, its man made so its flawed. I don't care that the new dash might be 1-3 seconds
 faster at loading things, I'm not going to benefit from having those three seconds, I can't imagine myself penning a novel with the cumulated minutes of life this buys me, I would sooner spend those few seconds looking at the spinning circle in front of a
 faded out aesthetically pleasing dashboard than this monster that has been forced upon me, it should at least be customisable, I want to change the layout and just straight up remove the oneguide tab.</p>
<p>Its the lack of minority consideration from Microsoft that I hate.</p>

<p>And several people may want their devices to talk back to them. Google and Apple phones already have a digital personal assistant which talks back to you. Microsoft rolled out this with Windows 10's Cortana and I heard they may be bringing this feature to
 Xbox 1 which would be kwl. They probably noticed that the UI on a next gen console was too slow for a console with an 8 core processor and 8GB RAM. In fact Xbox 360's UI was faster (navigating it with the controller) than Xbox 1's UI with loading Friends/Achievements/Messages
 in 2013 and throughout much of 2014. But with Xbox 1's new UI experience, it is now clearly and noticeably faster than the previous gen's UI. I remember a post from last year or the year before "some people got weird relationship [with their things]" They
 want their Xbox 1's to talk back to them? I'd say give the machine some personality and colour. And Personality is a key feature behind Windows 10. It isn't really fun putting up with that previous slow UI version which also looked too boxy. The new experience
 continues that boxy-ness in some respects, but it is LESS boxy and I pretty much enjoy it. Though it may take others some time to get use to it. Remember, Xbox 1 will continue to get Regular Updates (like one every month).

<p>I think as long as Microsoft have to make concessions to incorporate Kinect it will always be a below par UI, and and unfortunately as the Kinect won't be fully dropped for this console i think we're gonna have to make do as they won't be changing back anytime
 soon.</p>
<p>Personally i don't think it's terrible and the more i use it the better it gets, however for me the one glaring, unforgiveable mess is the 'left sidebar lag' which opens ok'ish but clicking up and down has appalling &nbsp;lag and as it's such an integral part
 of the UI just can't be ignored. (please don't tell me to do a restart - i'm not stupid).</p>
<p>The 'Store' also needs to be totally scrapped and re-designed as it's quite funny how bad it actually is, fortunately i 'can' ignore this as i rarely us it and cause it is so bad helps me spend less money - so i thank Microsoft for that.</p>
<p>I guessing there won't be a 'Kinect 3' so maybe the next console might have a decent UI !</p>

"It's not a true crash, in the sense that the bluescreen was initiated only because the combination of video driver and video hardware was being unresponsive, and not because of any synchronous processing exception".<br />
<br />
Since Vista, the "Timeout Detection and Recovery" (TDR) components of the OS video subsystem have been capable of doing some truly impressive things to try to recover from issues which would have caused earlier OS's like XP to crash.<br />
<br />
As a last resort, the TDR subsystem sends the video driver a "please restart yourself now!" command and waits a few seconds.<br />
<br />
If there's no response, the OS concludes that the video driver/hardware combo has truly collapsed in a heap, and it fires off that stop 0x116 BSOD.<br />

            I have tried using different drivers, but it didn't really fix the issue. As far as I am aware from pretty much monitoring my temperatures it cannot be a overheating issue, and I clean my pc on a monthly basis with compressed air to get all of the dust
 out.

<div>I also have forgotten to mention a piece of info that could be important. When rebooting after the aforementioned error, it doesn't recognize my SSD on which the OS is installed on. Which is usually solved by turned the computer on and off again.<br />

            You may want to try this.&nbsp; TP-Link has a 150Mbps portable wireless N router (TL-702N) that works.&nbsp; Plug the ethernet cable into the unit and you use the USB port on the RT machine to power the device.&nbsp; Connect the TL-702 to another 5 volt source and you
 have a portable hotspot.

            I am currently using my (android) phone as a (hotspot) router after inserting the dongle sim into it.
<div>This is cumbersome on account of two things:</div>
<div>1. Am unable to use the phone (normal sim) while doing this</div>
<div>2. Phone battery drains out quickly making this a short term solution</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a cheap android tablet that works with a 3g dongle (no add ins or additional drivers). Can't understand why an RT based device should fall short. Is it just an area that Microsoft has not paid attention to? or does it need app development from Huwaei
 for the same?</div>

                    <p>Hello I have a Windows 8.1 PC.</p>
<p>My PC was working fine until it restarted, &nbsp;so I am thinking that I must have deleted something to cause this error.</p>

<p>As you can see above it says the 'msisadrv.sys' is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the options that F8 gives (such as booting into safe mode with command prompt) &nbsp;but instead, it redirects me back to here, almost like a loop. Welp. I Have tried almost everything on the F8 list and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could repleace the file but I don't know how or where to get a backup copy of it from.</p>

    <title>Xbox one activity feed broken. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fear2eternity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one activity feed broken.</h2>
                    
<p>I've posted this before but I can't remember where or if it was in the support forums or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my problem is that the &nbsp;activity feed is pretty messed, yesterday I removed my account and hard reset the console then put my account back on. Then I thought it was fixed but none of my friends saw any achievements I got. This has been happening since
 May and it hasn't fixed itself.</p>
<p>Some stuff appears days after I post it but not all of it. Any help is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey GRADY 1999,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So I'm just trying to prone a bit here. If you wouldn't mind answering a question or two here. Just to see what we have going on :D.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; First off is your console updated with the recent most update. </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~ To check if it is. </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Go to settings </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Select the System tile </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- In the first Column the last selection </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Ether states "No available updates" or "update available" </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- If there is a update just go ahead and update that console.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Check to see if the issue persists) </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Second let's check your privacy settings. </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Go to System &gt; Privacy &gt; Select Custom </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just scroll through custom just make sure that all of your settings are set to everybody or Yes :D</p>
<p>Okay, so let's see if that fixes the issue. I'm also going to look into this issue a bit more and see what I find. Does this normally occur all the time or only during select times or occasionally?
</p>

<p>I have the latest update and the privacy settings are set to everyone. This happens very often. None of the achievements I got yesterday are on the feed. Also If I get a achievement I see it on the feed but if I get another one it replaces the first one.</p>

<p>This has happened to me as well...again. I am not surprised though. I am pretty sure that there is no permanent fix as this is a recurring problem for a lot of users. The general consensus for a fix is to remove your profile, do a hard reset &amp; then add the
 profile back. But this does not work. In the end, the only thing to do is to wait for it to fix it's self. It usually does so in a day or two. However, I'm hoping myself it doesn't take weeks or months like it has for some people. Why Microsoft has not officially
 looked into this and provided a permanent fix is beyond me. It's not a console problem but a server side problem on their end. Time to play the frustrating waiting game.</p>

<p>Same. I think I may have fixed the issue by signing out, then hard resetting,then unplugging the power brick for 5 minutes. Then Turn it back on and it might be fixed. I can't tell right now with the service alert. I can't fix my showcase though.</p>

                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><p>If your computer includes a DVD Player, you can use it to watch DVDs. Prior versions of Windows included native DVD Playback. Since the launch of Windows 8.0, Microsoft&nbsp;made DVD Playback optional. The company initially offered a free copy of Media Center

custom install</a>, you will need to purchase the Windows DVD Player app separately or use a third party application. In this article, we show you how to use the Windows DVD Player app.
</p>
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p>The Windows DVD Player is quite basic, but functional for most user needs. To check if you have the Windows DVD Player app&nbsp;installed, press Windows key + Q then type:
<strong>dvd</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it shows up in the search results, hit Enter on your keyboard. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1678176f-ea5a-4b51-b8e8-fcf1b09f4eb5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1678176f-ea5a-4b51-b8e8-fcf1b09f4eb5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not inserted your DVD disc, proceed to do so. Please wait while the app scans your disc. This can take a short time and appear to not detect the disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a8f5e5f-8f12-45dd-bf3b-8d531a2d6c7c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a8f5e5f-8f12-45dd-bf3b-8d531a2d6c7c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows DVD Player will begin playing the DVD. Use the player controls at the bottom of the window to pause, stop, play or fast forward, manage volume, manipulate the player window or access special settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/617fa947-1f4a-46de-89d6-8c644ff6ecc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/617fa947-1f4a-46de-89d6-8c644ff6ecc2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to skip the previews, hover your mouse pointed at the bottom region of the DVD Player window to activate the player controls. Click the more actions menu at the extreme end (...) then click
<em>Root menu</em></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you want to watch a video in full screen, click the full screen arrow listed among the player controls.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>What if the DVD does not play? </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Check to make sure your DVD Player is actually reading the DVD. Click File Explorer on the Taskbar or Start &gt; File Explorer, open This PC and check to see if the DVD shows up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/57c9f708-021e-431f-930c-6bcdb0b72532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/57c9f708-021e-431f-930c-6bcdb0b72532" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the disc is not recognized by Windows, try isolating the issue by trying another disc. If that disc does not work, check to make sure they are not scratched.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the disc works in another computer, try the following:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1) Press <strong>Windows key + x</strong> and select
<strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2) Then, at the command prompt type the following ( you can copy and paste) and press "Enter":</span></p>

            <p>NOT NOT helpful!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a post from 2015 that was not helpful, Andre, and this is more of the same. I *still* cannot play DVDs that played before on Windows 7 on my same hardware that played it before with Windows 10. I got no free DVD app. I don't think I should
 pay *again* for something that worked before with Windows 7. Like DUH Microsoft! People want to play DVDs on their computers?!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried VLC media player. I have tried Leawo Blueray/DVD player. I have tried both running them in Compatibility mode with Windows 7 and 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still get the message: Insert a DVD, when the DVD is already inserted. I tried updating my DVD driver software; apparently it is up to date</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTHING WORKS! This is just amazing BS that we can no longer play our DVDs that we paid money for on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What on earth is going on? Where is the solution to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft? What are you doing? I do not want to pay *again* for media/entertainment I already paid for just because your OS won't play it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for a resolution.... NOW!</p>

            Very appointing....I was given a computer for Chrismas....with windows 10 (why bother) it does notihing. I can write I can't listen to a cd I can't play a movie...I can do nothing with it with out buying apps what a scam.... You really should be ashamed
 of this product. My free phone from metro does far more than this HP computer with 10....even with no phone service the phone does more....extortion is the only word that comes to mind thank you

            Hi,<br />
<br />
We do have a wireless technology that projects the image from your computer screen onto another monitor, TV screen, projector, or streaming media player but you have to check whether your PC supports Miracast or not.
<br />
<br />
• If your computer came with Windows 10 installed, it supports Miracast.<br />
• If you upgraded your computer to Windows 10 from Windows 7 or an earlier version, use the following steps to check whether your computer supports Miracast.<br />
<br />
1. In Windows, click the Action Center icon on the taskbar in the lower-right corner of the screen.<br />
2. In the Action Center, click Connect.<br />
3. If you see Searching for wireless display...devices, your computer supports Miracast.<br />
<br />
• If your computer doesn't support Miracast, go to the Updating Drivers section to update the wireless and graphics drivers for your computer.<br />
<br />
To project to a wireless display with Miracast, you may check this <em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15053/windows-8-project-wireless-screen-miracast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em>. (also applies to Windows
 10) <br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further help.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the answer, but my issue is already beyond this. I have Windows 10 and it supports Miracast, and i can connect to wireless devices and already have a list of Connected Devices - the problem is, my Sharp AQUOS smart tv is listed as Other Device,
 and not as Wireless Display. So when i try to Project, i can't because there is no wireless display found, but my Sharp smart TV is already connected as Other Device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is - why is my smart TV recognized as Other Device and not as Wireless Display? How to change my TV from Other Device to Wireless Display so i can project to it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*my Sharp AQUOS smart TV can accept Chromecast seamlessly, from Google cast-supported apps or from the Chrome browser. but why Miracast can't?</p>
        </p>

            It seems that this has something to do with your Sharp AQUOS Smart TV's settings. we recommend that you check it with your device manufacturer for any settings required to resolve the issue.<br />

    <title>Motherboard Support For Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> george hookings  say:</h3>
<h2>            Motherboard Support For Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a rather old MB in place (ASUS M2N-SLI).&nbsp; This is a Socket AM2 board and the WIN 7 PRO, SP1 OS that IS installed on it WILL NOT upgrade to WIN 10.&nbsp; I suspect that the reason is the Drivers for this board were never upgraded from Vista versions to
 Win 7 versions by ASUS because the Vista drivers WIIL (and Do) run WIN 7 just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THEREFORE: I propose to change my MB to a Gigabyte GA-MA74GM-S2, which will allow me to use my current CPU (AMD Athlon 64x2 Dual Core 6000+) and memory (6gb), and I have a qualified Graphics card and driver as well.&nbsp; I have confirmed that Gigabyte does have
 a set of drivers for WIN 7, which I can download and install when I re-install my WIN 7 OS on the Gigabyte board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, I have been advised by Gigabyte that this board is not supported by WIN 10 and "there has been no driver support released by AMD".&nbsp; This is very confusing because I have repeatedly read the qualifications criteria for upgrading, my system does meet
 all the requirements, but Gigabyte tells me Windows 10 is not officially supported on the board in question, but there ARE Windows 7 drivers available for the board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom line questions:&nbsp; If Windows 7 Pro, SP1 is installed on this board, will I be able to upgrade the system from 7 to 10 and will this board run Windows 10?</p>

            That’s very possible. Do you have any other external media (usb drives, etc) that you can plug in. If they work fine, there is an absolutely a problem with the card. <br /><br />I’ve had luck booting up a Linux distro and reformatting that way. You don’t have one of those at the ready do you? (Long shot) <br /><br />I’ll think of other solutions in the meantime. <br /><br />- C

            Well thank you very much! I appreciate that. <br /><br />I’m sorry about the card, a new one may be the best option right now. <br /><br />Note *keep the card. If you have a chance to hop on a Mac/Linux box you may be able to format it* <br /><br />Good luck, and please leave a positive review if possible! <br /><br />- C

                    I own an SF-666 Condenser mic. My HP laptop does not have a microphone plug in, only a headphone plug in. I have tried every way I can think of, and can not get my laptop to even read that the mic exists. I am wondering if the mic is compatible and I just
 haven't figured it out or if the mic just won't work with my laptop. Looking forward to a reply to maybe get some answers.

            Hi Dan, that model does have a microphone input . . .
<br />
<br />The Headphone jack is a Headphone/Microphone Combo Port
<br />
<br />You will need to purchase a small adapter for a few dollars, that will enable you to use your Mic, like the one listed below

            Alright, thank you. I was wondering about that. The fact that there is one port had me wondering about it being an input/output port. Makes sense.

<span>Hi, crjman</span>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Since when are you
 facing this issue?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did you make any
 changes to the computer before this issue started?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does it pop up randomly
 or only while using this particular application?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Disabling<strong>help and support</strong> will not get any updates or help content from Microsoft. You cannot

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try performing the<strong>Clean Boot

<p>This sucks, I want to remove my credit card info or turn off the automatic renewal because I rarely play my Xbox, but am forced to call customer support to do this even though I can remove any other credit card info other than the one setup for automatic
 renewal. Almost seems as if Xbox Live wants my credit card info burned into their system and they know it's a hassle to be on hold with customer support for 2 hours and want me to just forget about it so they can take $50 when it's time.</p>
