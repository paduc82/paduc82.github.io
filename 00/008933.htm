<p>You should never have more than one security product installed on the PC providing active protection/scanning. This can cause performance issues, system instability, and can hinder the
 effectiveness of both products at providing protection.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled.</p>
<p>Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</p>
<p>Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 and updated with all patches.</p>
<p>In Internet Explorer 8, use the SmartScreen Filter.</p>
<p>Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</p>
<p>Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</p>
<p>On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that
<span>User Account Control (UAC) ON<span>&nbsp; </span>and not running with elevated privileges.</span></p>
<p>Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible
 after being notified of available updates.</p>
<p>Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many vendors are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</p>
<p>Never click through links from unknown sources and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.</p>
<p>Never open unsolicited email attachments.</p>
<p>Practice safe web browsing.</p>

<h2>            Outlook has spontaneously deleted my entire inbox</h2>
                    My entire inbox has been emptied. I did not choose to empty it. Thousands of archived and important emails have been destroyed. My laptop has had no virus infection recently, all anti-viral protection measures are installed and enabled.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am not referring to the program Outlook, I mean the online browser-based replacement to live mail/hotmail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only thing that I have changed recently is configure my Gmail account to access my email sent to my outlook account. I though this would have merely copied the emails over so I could have a backup.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Have the emails been lost&nbsp;permanently or is there a way to revert the changes?&nbsp;</div>

    <title>DDE Links in Mac Excel 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billdavis380  say:</h3>
<h2>            DDE Links in Mac Excel 2011</h2>
                    Hi All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an Excel Spreadsheet that will not open in Excel 2011 for Mac. &nbsp;It keeps telling me to check the spelling of the file name, and verify the file location is correct. &nbsp;I can go to the same file on a PC and it will open just fine. &nbsp;I know that it has
 DDE in it so I think that is the problem. &nbsp;I know in the Windows version of Excel that there is a setting to Ignore other applications that use DDE and it will fix this issue. &nbsp;Is there something like this in the Mac version that I can set? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Bill</div>

<h2>            Powerpoint and Excel will not open&#59; shows on task bar but will not display on screen</h2>
                    I have Office for Home working on Windows 10. Excel was working on 12/25/18 but now it only shows on the task bar and does not show on the screen. I have uninstalled and re-installed Office 365 and I have run Re-image but it still doesn't come up on the
 screen. Word is work fine and I tried Power Point and it also is not working. It shows on the task bar and sound plays but the image will not appear on the screen.

<p>Hi Cheryl,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for providing a detailed information about your concern.</span><span>&nbsp;</span>We would like to verify, since you've already uninstalled and reinstalled Office 365, have you
 tried opening your Office applications on a different user profile?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have another user profile on your PC, we suggest using it for the meantime and check if the same issue persists. On the other hand, i<span>f you only have one user account on your PC, you can try creating another local user or administrator account
 to check if the same issue persists. For the steps on how to do this, kindly check the article:&nbsp;</span><span><em><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Create
 a local user or administrator account in Windows 10</strong></span></a></span></em></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify us so we can get back to you and provide you more answers.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10&#47;DX 12 release date - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garretgiordano  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#47;DX 12 release date</h2>
                    <p>Ok I speak for many of the gamers I know in saying one of the biggest things we want and need is DX12 from win10. It is sad to me that NVidia already has 8-9 DX12 API cards out with oldest one dating back 1-1.5 years. Honestly the hardware makers are making
 hardware for windows 9/10 for over a year. Stop stalling the gaming industry to satisfy big business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do I make this statement? DX11 is a&nbsp;terrible tool for many developers hence why DX9/10 is still far more common. Development is super difficult on DX11 and it is said that DX12 will fix those issues. If your going to make hardware for DX12 years in advance
 don't stall this hard. Either make it possible to run DX12 on windows 7 and or 8.1 so that we can get on with our lives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this sounds angry I am sorry. I am not angry,&nbsp;just trying to be blunt and clear&nbsp;about something impacting a lot of people by skipping windows 9 that I don't see&nbsp;near enough&nbsp;discussion about.</p>

<h2>            Missing icons of some apps in Windows 10 version 1903</h2>
                    <p>Hello. Since i installed windows 10 version 1903, icons of some apps are missing randomly. Also when i click to properties of that app, i can see icon.</p>
<p>This problem usually happens after installing another app.</p>
<p>Maybe there is a problem of losing icons in version 1903, So i reported to you to fix it in next updates.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>N95 8GB periodically opening camera lens for no reason - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a57737  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 8GB periodically opening camera lens for no reason</h2>
                    
<p>Running firmware v31.0.015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the phone's been on for a while (even just sat on the desk, untouched) the camera lens opens up. This doesn't envoke the camera software, just opens the lens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure it didn't do this with the previous firmware. I tried re-flashing and starting from scratch and it still did it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Do you want to save this file, or find a program online to open it&#63; in IE 8 under Windows XP for Adobe .pdf files.</h2>
                    
<p>When attempting to open a .pdf file in IE 8 under Windows XP I receive the "Do you want to save this file, or find a program online to open it?" message and need to save the file in order to open it. My Adobe Standard 6.0 is able to open any files that I
 have saved. However, I generally do not want to save these files prior to opening them. FYI. I am not having this problem in MS Office applications such as Outlook where .pdf attachments are opening properly. Finally, I have a similar system running IE 7 under
 Windows XP and do not have this issue. Please note that in both instances my Adobe preferences are to display the .pdf files in the browser.</p>

<p>Tools&gt;Internet Option, Security tab, click the "Reset all zones to default"</p>
<p>There is a security zone setting to "Open files based on content not extension", the PDF file you are trying to open may not actually be a PDF document.</p>
<p>Do you have anti-virus installed? Is the IE8 Phishing Filter turned on....</p>
<p>This is why Adobe has its own reader application that you can use instead of the Browser to view 'pdf' documents.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you update to Adobe Reader 9 (the latest) and also turn off the Adobe Reader setting to Open PDF files in the browser.</p>
<p>A common hacker trick is to rename a program file (evil.exe) to something else (readme.pdf) and attach it to emails or hack into web sites and place it on servers. Without protection, one click and your toast and you computer turns into a brick.</p>

<h2>            product id for office 2013</h2>
                    Tech at store where I bought new computer running Win 8.1 also&nbsp;installed and activated Office&nbsp;Pro 2013 but did not provide Product ID.&nbsp; I logged into My Account at support.microsoft.com and clicked Overview under My Products and Subscriptions.&nbsp; The resulting
 scan shows Win 8.1 (with its 20 character product id) but does not indicate detection of Office Pro 2013 (with its 25 character product id) even though it is clearly present and&nbsp;functioning properly.&nbsp; It seems like I won't get Office updates if MS does not
 recognize that I have this suite.&nbsp; Also I need the id for some of the other circumstances described in the Ask the Community topic for install/upgrade/activate for this Win/Office combination.

            Your intent is good, you are just asking for the wrong thing.<br />
<br />
The "Product ID" is generated when you activate Office. It is pretty much useless. But if you really do want it you can find it by going to File menu&gt; Account command &gt; "About Word" button. It is displayed near the top of the dialog box<br />
<br />
What I believe you want to ask for is your unique 25 character "Product Key". This is
<b>required</b> to re-install Office 2013 Pro. You should keep a copy of the key some place other than your computer (incase the computer crashes) or you have to re-install Windows for some reason.<br />
<br />
You can "extract" the product key from you HD using freeware.&nbsp; Here is a list of tools that I have tried on earlier versions of Windows and Office.&nbsp; You will have to go to their web sites to find ones that have been upgraded to work on Win 8.1 AND Office 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 (Please let me know which one works, or not works, for you).<br />

</span>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>You can use any of the following tools to extract the Product Key from you computer. These tools report on many installed programs on your computer, not just Office.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><b><span>PS</span></b><span>: you should keep a copy (printed and/or file copies on external storage devices) of the report(s) generated by these tools so you have all of your product keys / registration numbers available for future
 re-installs</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><b><span>FYI</span></b><span>: I (Rohn) have not tested these tools in Windows 8 (just haven’t had an excuse to make/waste the time), but I don’t expect any problem. The underlying mechanics of Windows 8 are essentially the same
 as Windows 7 if you ignore the Metro User Interface. Think of metro as “lipstick on a pig”. The pig is not changed by adding a little paint on the surface.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span>Normally you have several resources to find your Retail Product Key.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><span>o<span> </span></span><span>Your original package or purchase confirmation e-mail</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 1in"><span>o<span> </span></span><span>Activation backup utilities</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">From what I’ve read, MS uses a file called <b>TOKENS.DAT</b> to store encrypted product activation keys:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\<b>Tokens.DAT</b>
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SoftwareLicensing\<b>Tokens.data</b><br />
<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">C:\Windows.Old\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\<b>Tokens.DAT</b> (if you did an in-place Windows Upgrade)<br />
<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><b>NOTE</b>: Do not expect the Windows.OLD folder to be there until you delete it. Many people have complained that windows 8 and 8.1 automatically delete it WITHOUT WARNING<span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-files/windows-8-has-deleted-my-windowsoldprogramfiles/dbdf75c0-09d9-4992-b8eb-d9fac3efe9b8?page=2">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-files/windows-8-has-deleted-my-windowsoldprogramfiles/dbdf75c0-09d9-4992-b8eb-d9fac3efe9b8?page=2</a>
</p>
<p>After you extract the Product Key, make sure to write it down and keep it in a safe place. Burning a copy of the installation file to a CD would also be a good idea if you don’t have the installation disk.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><b>NOTE</b>: OEM (factory install and activated) licenses use a different key than the one reported.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Only the factory can use the PK from the original factory activation. You would have been provided with a separate piece of paper with a Product key for reactivation.</p>
<p>Sorry, I have not had opportunity (aka need) to test Win8 and Office 2013 on these various tools:

 not that complicated and your not going to break anything else. Select the circle next to “Load the product keys from external Software Registry hive”. Now from here you may have to browse to a slightly different location depending on where your windows.old

<p>Even the Care point can't resolve the issue ???&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not much options left ..</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Is it same if you remove the SIM and the SD Card ?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If it doesn't keep rebooting, try again after inserting one at a time to isolate what is causing the issue. If its the SIM, get it replaced. Make sure the new SIM is a ready Micro SIM and not one which is cropped from a standard
 SIM</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If its SD Card, back-up whatever possible data on PC and Format it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">See if this resolves the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, check whether the battery is sitting properly. Put a paper packing in the Battery compartment to rule out a loose fit ..</p>

<p>Yes, I have tried removing the SIM and SD card and have tried everything else suggested here on this site but no relief. I have sent my phone for repair 3 times in the last month and latest being one week back. Every time they update the software, check
 the battery and give it to me, and every time it again does the same restart thing.</p>
<p>I expect some constructive reply from you now.</p>

    <title>Can you edit the cell reference of a linked Microsoft Excel Worksheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuart123_z  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can you edit the cell reference of a linked Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have built a webpage which exports data to a spreadsheet for key stakeholders&nbsp;to use for reporting each month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've then built a PPT which will pull data from the spreadsheet using linked Microsoft Excel Worksheet Objects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of these PPTs has been built after about 6 hours, there are around 12 more to do. These are identical, except each version uses a different area of the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, version one will use cells C40, C41, C42 etc.</p>
<p>Version 2 would use C70, C71, C72 etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it's a single directional change of the cell reference, within the same file in the same location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to edit the cell reference of the object within the filepath? At the moment, I'm having to delete and replace each object, and there are hundreds!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would there even be a macro I could run to update the cell reference of all of the objects, if the change in cell is uniform (e.g. +30)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All help greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>
</p><p>It might also make things simpler/more reliable if you start by linking to named ranges in your Excel sheets rather than cell ranges (assuming that this is practical to begin with).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing else, it'd be easier to create unique range names, which'd make search/replace routines like the macro above more reliable. &nbsp;And if you add more data (rows/columns) to the named range, the new data remains linked; makes things much more flexible
 than using specific cell ranges.</p>

      Then in the search bar next to the Windows 10 logo on the bottom
      off the screen (I call it the "Cortana Search"), I typed in
      google.com and hit enter.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Microsoft Edge opened up with a new tab for Google.&nbsp; You can see
      the offending site still opens in a tab that doesn't have focus.&nbsp;
      Click the "X" to close Edge. Do not click on the offending site
      tab or it will get focus again.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When Edge closes nicely, it won't "Restore" the sessions and the

<p>hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>our external users (not ad) are not able connect/export sp calendar to outlook. they are getting an error: you do not have permission to view this sharepoint list... users have contributor/designer rights. since they ere externals, they do not have actual

<p>in general, can external users export sp calendar to outlook? if not, how can it be archived?</p>

<p>hi&nbsp; kristinajucyte,<br />
<br />
yes, external users can sync a sharepoint calendar to outlook without a license.<br />
<br />
regarding the error message, i suggest you try deleting the sharepoint list(calendar) from outlook via the steps below:<br />
1. go to <strong>file &gt; info &gt; account settings</strong>.<br />
2. switch the tab to <strong>sharepoint lists</strong>, then select the calendar and click
<strong>remove</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a304409f-1081-4dbb-9cb0-1d95d0b37426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a304409f-1081-4dbb-9cb0-1d95d0b37426" /></a><br />
3.go back to the sharepoint calendar, click <strong>connect to outlook</strong> on the ribbon.<br />
<br />
if the issue persists, i’d like to confirm some information:<br />
1. make sure the external user can access the sharepoint calendar from browsers.<br />
2. try syncing the calendar on another computer.<br />
3. try syncing the calendar with an internal account.<br />
<br />
kindly let me know if there is any update.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I color categorize my appointments on my Vista PC but not all the categories and none of the color coding shows up on my Treo 700wx after syncing with Windows Mobile 6.</p>
<p>It worked well with my old Treo 650 and activesync</p>

<h2>            &#34;Something went wrong ooberegion &#34; when booting Windows 10 ISO via VirtualBox 5.22</h2>
                    <p>I have the latest version of virtual box installed on my laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP Pavilion G6</p>
<p>8GB of Ram</p>
<p>windows 10 home 64bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running the latest version of virtual box 5.22 to be precise, i have created a VM and allocated in 60GB of hard disk space and 2048MB of memory, i can also confirm i have installed the latest extension packs to support functionality of Virtual Box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the latest version of Windows from the official Microsoft Website and then proceeded to mount the ISO onto my newly created VM</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i start the VM the initial set up of windows goes fine, i can select my operating system and select the partition i would like the ISO installed on</p>
<p>
</p><p>once the initial set up completes i am prompted with a "just a moment spinning orb" eventually after around 15 minutes or so i am prompted with an error message</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Something went Wrong"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OOBEREGION</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can skip or try again</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i have tried to skip this process and try it again but it doesn't seem to work and i am now stuck in an endless cycle, i know this can work as i have already successfully mounted Windows Server 2016 onto separate virtual machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i noticed Microsoft uploaded a "workaround" for this type of fault</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4020048/windows-oobe-fails-when-you-start-a-new-windows-based-computer-for-the&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>but unfortunately this provides no fix and basically tells you to reboot your machine, i have contacted virtual box and it is not a fault with their software,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>can you please provide a fix on this issue or confirm if Virtual Box and Windows 10 even work together&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>would i be right in thinking that Windows 10 does not work with VirtualBox's latest version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP</p>
