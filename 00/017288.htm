                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>While as I am able to download the attached outlook emails from OWA with
 a .eml extension, its content is not displayed. I have office 2010 installed. What could be the problem and how can I work it out?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Excel 2016 pivot table and slicers not compatible with Mac Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>I already know that Excel 2016 for Mac is severely limited compared to Windows Excel, but I don't understand why a pivot table with slicers will not work in Excel for Mac 2016 created in Windows Excel 2016? &nbsp;Can anyone help me with best practices to make
 the two compatible (Windows Excel pivot tables and Mac Excel pivot tables (2016))? &nbsp;My reports use slicers, and the pivot tables were created using data from MS Access in Windows. &nbsp;Since Excel 2016 for Mac can not connect to Access, what's the best way to
 create reports using pivot tables and slicers so the reports are compatible between Windows Excel and Mac Excel? &nbsp;Thanks. &nbsp;Also, hey Microsoft: I'm getting a strange error message in my Excel for Mac 2016 (see image). &nbsp;I'm not using a 2007 version of Excel.
 &nbsp;I'm using a 2016 version of Excel. &nbsp;What gives?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ccba44e-39e0-4678-b3cc-15742522f80f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ccba44e-39e0-4678-b3cc-15742522f80f" /></a></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I have a tutorial about how to get data from Microsoft Access and other data sources into Excel on my web site:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.agentjim.com/MVP/Excel/2011Relational1Intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.agentjim.com/MVP/Excel/2011Relational1Intro.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The tutorial is for Excel 2011. The SQL commands can be used in Excel 2016 but the Microsoft Query SQL GUI interface is a no-show in Excel 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In <a href="http://www.agentjim.com/MVP/Excel/2011Relational2Setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a><a href="http://www.agentjim.com/MVP/Excel/2011Relational2Setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Part 2</a> I have suggestions on which driver to use. For getting at an Access database that you have direct file access to in Finder I suggest the Actual
 Technologies Actual Access driver. If your Access database is network based, then I suggest trying the OpenLink driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you install the Driver you use the Apple ODBC Manager app (Applications &gt; Utilities) to add data sources. If you try to add a data source using the New button in Excel's data source choosing window you will get a crash. This is a crash that has existed
 for years in Excel and is one Microsoft seems to have no interest in fixing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no problem setting up Northwind.mdb as a data source in the Mac OS X ODBC manager app with the free trial of the Actual Access driver (only first 3 rows of data are returned in the free demo).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, in Excel 2016, on the Data tab of the menu I chose New Database Query &gt; From Database and chose the Northwind data source. The new completely lame, infuriating version of Microsoft Query opened where I could type my query.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34ee5e8f-9d50-4461-823a-700e6a8af812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34ee5e8f-9d50-4461-823a-700e6a8af812" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking the Return Data button returns the data to your worksheet as a querytable as in previous versions of Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42143012-798b-45c5-ad46-b3a9a0f9e121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42143012-798b-45c5-ad46-b3a9a0f9e121" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use your Microsoft Access database as the source of a PivotTable, on the Insert Tab of the Ribbon choose PivotTable. In the Create Pivot Table dialog choose User an External Data source, which will open up the ODBC chooser dialog where you
 can choose the Access database and put your result set directly into a PivotTable</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74e71ae8-078a-4956-8139-f87a17eb6590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74e71ae8-078a-4956-8139-f87a17eb6590" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When a cell in your PivotTable is selected, the PivotTable Analyze tab of the Ribbon displays. Click the Insert Slicer button to add a slicer</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07227d65-7dc5-4d92-ac01-2a495bd873f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07227d65-7dc5-4d92-ac01-2a495bd873f0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click the border of a slicer to get at options such as Slicer Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click the border of a slicer to display the Format Slicer pane to the right of the window. Secret: You can drag the Format Slider pane and turn it into a floating palette!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a Slicer is selected you can choose a color scheme. In an earlier build of Office 2016 for Mac you could make your own color schemes, but that capability is turned off in the 15.18 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d81a407a-dec8-469d-a8f9-51e68c2ebda5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d81a407a-dec8-469d-a8f9-51e68c2ebda5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As for the error message, please start a new question devoted just to that issue. Let's stay on the topic of Slicers for this question.</p>

<h2>            Saving Windows Phones from being discontinued</h2>
                    <p>I have started with smartphones with Windows Phone my mom had android. I tried both and loved Windows more. Now Microsoft is thinking of discontinuing Window phones. I think its a mistake to do this cause Microsoft has a market but they are not telling the
 world about these phones right. Plus IPhones and Samsung made better phones but a very high prices. $600+ and soon $1400+ for there phones and this is were you find your market. You at Microsoft help make laptops for less money with the help of the right companies.
 Now you can again with the Mobile world. I love Windows Phones for many reason one is they are easier to use than Android. I don't wont IPhones nor Android I rather keep Windows. You have a chance at a market of people who don't want to pay these ridiculous
 but want great phones for a good price. I am asking for you to keep Windows Phones please.</p>
<p>If you agree please tell Microsoft too. If enough people show they like it and might be willing to buy it in the future. They may change there minds. Everyone who sees my lumia 1520 really like and said they might even think of buying Windows Phones. If
 I am getting 100 people interested in looking at Windows Phones. Just think Microsoft if you made a Phone that could really compare to the Galaxy 8 and IPhones for less than $500. You found the market to make money. Next you got to tell the world a lot better
 on how Windows Phones work, perform, make better battery life, and great functions plus apps.

<p>Please Help me keep Windows phones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another person 100% in agreement esp since no notification from MS re the end of support for Win10 mobile.
</p>
<p>I love using my Lumia 650 but just this week Edge is having picture problems all of a sudden on certain websites ...hmmm!</p>
<p>Windows mobile is brilliant. Fast, easy to navigate (why would I want an overcomplicated Palm Pilot), simple layout &amp; for die hard Win10 users familiarity from desktop, laptop to mobile.
</p>
<p>MS dominate the desktop market so yes why not the mobile world? you guessed it - PROFIT!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows on a future phone is unlikely so for those of us who have only used windows please Mr CEO of Microsoft give us your android phone with a Windows10 emulator installed out of the box. I will buy one &amp; so will every other MS user wanting to remain loyal
 customers to Bill G your companies founder.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Phishing E-mails From &#64;outlook.com e-mail accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are an Internet service provider and of late our users have been receiving malicious e-mails from random @outlook.com e-mails accounts. The e-mail claims to be monitoring our user's activities and that the sender has the user's password and will share
 user's private information if the user does not pay the sender by Bitcoin. The e-mails are predominantly sent from @outlook.com e-mails address but these are just rand e-mail addresses. Here is a sample of the e-mail below.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<p>I do know ******* is your password. Lets get straight to purpose. Not one person has compensated me to check about you. You do not know me and you are probably thinking why you're getting this e mail?<br />
In fact, I installed a malware on the **** (porn) web site and do you know what, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what I mean). When you were viewing video clips, your browser started out working as a Remote control Desktop with a
 key logger which gave me accessibility to your screen and also web cam. after that, my software collected all your contacts from your Messenger, Facebook, and e-mailaccount. And then I created a video. 1st part displays the video you were watching (you have
 a good taste omg), and 2nd part displays the view of your web camera, yeah it is you.
<br />
You will have not one but two options. We are going to analyze these choices in particulars:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st alternative is to just ignore this e mail. In this instance, I most certainly will send your very own video to all your your contacts and then visualize regarding the humiliation you can get. And consequently if you are in a relationship, how it is going
 to affect?<br />
Second option will be to compensate me $3000. Let us refer to it as a donation. In this instance, I will quickly delete your video footage. You will go on with your way of life like this never occurred and you will not hear back again from me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll make the payment via Bitcoin (if you don't know this, search "how to buy bitcoin" in Google).
<br />
BTC Address: 1G3vy4DXgMyfdhRGpK7EqqonmtQDrUxCc [CASE sensitive, copy and paste it]</p>

<br />I am annoyed that it is receiving these messages so:
<br />
<br />I recommend doing the following.
<br />Block the sender, you must add the sender to the list of blocked senders. For more information, see Block senders or unblock senders in Outlook.com.

            Hello MlungisiSibanda !
<br />
<br />We have seem many similar messages lately
<br />It seems the bad guys got an old password database . Likely the password is not valid anymore
<br />
<br />I'd suggest  to report the mail and recommend the customer to change the password , just for peace of mind.  If that password is being used in another mail ,service,  bank account etc. it'd be good to change the password in those services as well...
<br />
<br />best regards 
<br />

    <title>IE 10 freezing&#47;not responding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mariaadams1952  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE 10 freezing&#47;not responding</h2>
                    <p>I have been having problems ever since an automatic update went through , a few weeks ago. At the time I had IE9 so I deleted all updates. When I still kept having the same problem, I bought Norton. That didn't help either. I have checked defrag It didn't
 need that. I have ran the chk disc option, I have uninstalled programs I no longer used or didn't ever use to make more memory. I update all my Norton updates and scan for viruses everytime I reboot. So thinking I might have messed up IE by deleting updates
 I updated all of them back.. this didn't help, so today I downloaded IE 10 that has helped a little, it doesn't freeze as often or say not responding but it STILL does it and it NEVER did this before the first update that caused all this .is there anything
 I can do other than do the F11 and reset the original factory system ? This is so frustrating esp when I am on facebook and going to different tabs from FB to other sites..but I never have more than 3 tabs open at a time because I know my pc doesn't have much
 memory to start with. I always delete cookies and history when I open or close the pc.&nbsp; I am running windows 7 home edition and IE 10. The pc was bought new a year ago. It is a Compaq Presario CQ57-339WM Notebook pc</p>

            As you've doubtless already discovered, everything Google can find on this error message relates to the faulty update that was shipped in November 2018 and then pulled. Yours is the first indication I've seen that the problem has recurred. Is there any
 chance that the update has somehow resurfaced on your machine?

<p>When I had this problem a few weeks ago I didn't have update KB4461522 installed but someone on this site suggested that I look for update KB4461614 and if I had that one then remove it. &nbsp;I did have that one, removed it and all was well again until yesterday
 when I had a similar problem. &nbsp;That was fixed by removing update KB4462157, installed only this week.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm sure "re-creating" my Windows profile is a solution, but in fact I would like something simpler than that (don't want&nbsp;to re-sync all my OneDrive files, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there really no way&nbsp;to uninstall the mail/cal/people apps and then re-installing them? e.g. using a command?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, I'll perhaps wait the final version of July 29 before starting with a "refreshed" profile of my MS account, as I have other bugs (notification center, etc.) which have to be rectified...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can "uninstall" mail/calendar with this Powershell command:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Get-appxpackage | where {$_.name -like "*windowscommunicationsapps*"} | remove-appxpackage -confirm</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>-confirm will let you confirm that you really want to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"uninstall" in brackets, because it's a bit more complicated than that. Technically you uninstall the user related part/data of the application. The provisioned or 'all user part' of the application is still on the system - but for the signed in user the
 app is 'gone'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that you can go to the store an re-install the app. (technically you re-acquire the license, and the provisioned app becomes visible again. Plus, once configured, your mail and appointments will be resynced).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>Alas my "bad configured" MS account was not purged and&nbsp;still here after the re-install so I couldn't configure "from scratch"...</p>

</p><p>What one need is a way to delete the own (user) config data before re-installing. Is there a way? With regedit? a command?</p>

<h2>            how do I keep outlook 2010 from sync all folders with hotmail&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I keep outlook (office 2010) from uploading all my email folders to the hotmail server? It never used to do this. I jsut started when I got a message that I needed to install the&nbsp; hotmail connector. After doing this then it uploaded all my email that
 was stored on my computer.&nbsp; I would really rather not have it on the server.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft community and posting your question. As I understand you do not want to leave the messages on the Hotmail server. Let me help you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have installed Outlook connector and configured the account when it prompted to do so, the Hotmail account would be configured as MAPI type which is mirror reflection of the
 emails from the server in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to have the emails downloaded to Outlook and removed from server you need to configure the account as
<font><span style="font-weight: bold">POP type</span> and uncheck the option ‘<span style="font-weight: bold">leave copy the messages on the server</span></font>’ option in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the section ‘<span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Change the MSN POP3 account settings in Outlook’</font></span> in the link below to know on how to setup Hotmail
 as POP type:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To disable the
<ol>
<li><span>Open
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Outlook</span><span>.</span>
</li><li><span>Click the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">File</span><span> tab &gt;
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Account settings</span><span>.</span>
</li><li><span>Highlight your current POP3 account and click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Change</span><span>.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span><span> The window that opens will tell you what type of email account you have. (Look under
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Type</span><span>.)</span>
</li><li><span>Choose
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">More settings</span><span> and click on
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced</span><span>.</span>
</li><li><span>You should see a check box titled:
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Leave a copy of messages on the server</span><span>.</span>
</li><li><span>Uncheck the box
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Leave a copy of the message on the server</span><span>.</span>
</li></ol>

    <title>I want to change the default page after signing out from Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> murraynz  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want to change the default page after signing out from Outlook.com</h2>
                    In August 2013 I asked a question on this community about how to change the default page after signing out of Outlook.com.&nbsp; Since opening my email address in July, every time when I sign out it goes to MSN.co.uk - a page I do not want.&nbsp; I want this go
 to MSN.co.nz, for my country.&nbsp; I have looked for settings to change this - but nothing is available on the outlook.com settings. And yes - before anyone asks me - my details all CLEARLY state New Zealand as my country on my profile. I have checked this multiple
 upon multiple times.<br />
<br />
I have asked for solutions but no luck so far. In replies from the Microsoft Community, various suggestions have been provided and webpages to contact - which I have done.&nbsp; But those websites either tell me to check my country details (doh!...as if I am that
 stupid), don't reply or send me to other webpage - which simply repeats the previous responses.<br />
<br />
We can land space vehicles on Mars, do complex brain surgery, find the Higgs Boson, see distant stars and planets...yet no one can provide a simple solution to this??&nbsp; I may not be a computer genius, but seriously, come on...solving this can't really be this
 hard.<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed some specific and direct solutions to this?<br />

</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft community. We're sorry that you're running in to this issue. Let me see what I can do to help you. What I can suggest is that you try to using different browsers and let us know if the same thing happens. This helps us find out and
 eliminate the possibility of a browser specific problem.<br />

            <p>This issue seemed to corrected itself a few months ago and I was getting the NZ MSN webpage on signing out of Outlook - which I was most happy about.&nbsp; All was working fine last week - however when I signed out today it took me to the Indonesia homepage (I
 am working in Indonesia and have been for 8 months).&nbsp; I have <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>NOT</strong></span> changed any settings to my computer - or my Outlook profile - to affect a change like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of points:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not a browser issue - the problem happens with all browers! (Every time I raise this, this same question asked...oh boy...)<br />
</li><li>As I have been using the same computer, IP address and have not changed any settings to effect a change, it would
<strong>NOT</strong> at my end.</li></ul>
<p>The <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">simple solution</span></strong> is that the default signout page should based on the country indicated on user's profile. This is simply logical as one would assume (with a good degree of reason) that when
 a user lists a particular country in their profile, then this is the country content they prefer - irrespective of the IP address (i.e. so it is not effected by travel or working in another country).&nbsp; Microsoft can solve this problem in a millisecond with
 a logical statement along the lines of [at sign out when country profile equals "New Zealand" then load www.msn.co.nz]. I am no computer whiz but even I can see that solution...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, it seems that Outlook has been recently modified by Microsoft to harvest the IP address to appease it's advertisers rather than use the profile provided by the users.&nbsp; If the profile details were used to determine the default signout page, this would
 simply not be an issue. Period.<br />

            <p>Not good enough. Sorry. This issue treats users as being unimportant. Outlook.com (aka Microsoft) just need to deal with this. The solution is so easy - I can even do it, if I was allowed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping the online communities would have some real influence to resolve such issues but, alas, they don't seem to have any influence at all. Just a means to 'vent' on an issue, really. And in the end, we just go 'round and round' and a resolution never
 occurs.&nbsp; Symptomatic really that, while we are more connected in the computer age, we have lost the art of being responsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hold little - if any - hope that it will be resolved. Still, for some strange reason, I have left feedback on the site provided, for what it's worth.</p>

            <p>I have made MSN NZ my homepage and now have to click on the home button after signing out of Outlook to get to MSN NZ instead of MSN.com. &nbsp;It would be much better if It went straight to MSN NZ as it use to do. &nbsp;My country details are NZ, I have cleared my
 cache and done all the other things offered but to no avail. &nbsp;Disappointed!</p>

            <p>It seems Microsoft has changed its redirection in the last few weeks, without any notice to users. I now get redirected to Indonesia (as I am currently working near by) when it was MSN NZ.&nbsp; Not sure what the rationale for the change is but it is not logical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The redirect page asks me if I want to remember MSN.com as my permanent redirect page (because they think I am from the US and travelling...how presumptuous...).&nbsp; There are no options to remember another country as the permanent redirect - just the US.&nbsp;
 Centre of the world, anyone...???&nbsp; Clearly Microsoft only cares about the USA and have no thought for the rest of the world.&nbsp; More than disappointed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem doesn't happen with Yahoo! I had moved my email from Yahoo! but think I will be moving my emails back now because of this fiasco.</p>

            The same has happened to me. Since Microsoft changed Hotmail to Outlook there have been many changes, some better, many worse. Now instead of going to MSN NZ when logging out, it goes to MSN US. In hotmail you could set your logout page, no that right
 has been removed without even asking. If you ask me Microsoft is just too big and no longer interested in the individuals. It's such a pity that one is pretty much locked in as I don't want to change my email address because of all the hassle and inconvenience,
 but I am slowly leaning more towards Gmail. Juding by Microsofts responses above, there is little or no chance of this issue being resolved.

            <p>Outlook 2016 on Windows 10 displays 0x800cce05 when attempting to add IMAP/POP3 account. This can be caused by a number of things, even on a new Windows 10 PC with Office 365.</p>
<p>To resolve right click the <strong>Start</strong> button, select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> and type:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>sfc/scannow </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1755e90e-d24d-4742-98ea-0ad5032796ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1755e90e-d24d-4742-98ea-0ad5032796ec" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The line reads: <strong>C:\Windows\system32&gt;sfc /scannow</strong> </p>
<p>Press <strong>Enter</strong>. A message then reads&nbsp;<strong>Beginning system scan</strong>. &nbsp;This process will take some time depending on how much data has to be scanned and how big the hard drive is. The message reads:
<strong>Beginning verification phase of system scan</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When complete, the next message reads: <strong>Verification 100% complete</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not supported in offline servicing
 scenarios.</strong></p>
<p>If you check this file you can view the log activity. You should now be able to create a new email profile for outlook with the settings you would normally use.</p>

<p>I found the solution before your post - to make yourself administrator, right click on CMD exe before left clicking, then set yourself as "administrator", then do as above, ie. enter sfc/scannow. This does a scan and fixed the "corrupt files" I had somehow
 acquired:</p>

<p>From my experience, if you have to restart the router then it is probably the routers fault and vice versa. I've been having problems with my own Netgear routers disconnecting and having to restart to reconnect. Beta firmwares recently issued to me seems
 to have solved the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest updating to the latest firmware available and see if that helps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That could be it. If possible try your phone with another router first, perhaps a friends to make sure. &nbsp;</p>

            What i dont get though is this issue is only with the lumia, wifes BB, PS3, laptops all connect fine, ip addresses are reserved for each item as to prevent conflicts

<p>Don't know the reason but there seems to be an issue between old Netgears and the Lumia. I am also experiencing similar problems with a few of my IP cams. Router logs indicate the problem as authentication failure. In my case Netgear level 2 support issued
 me with beta firmware which worked fine but my routers are all current models. &nbsp;Below is the link to another thread with a simiar issue.</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint 2013 file size after deleting slides</h2>
                    <p>I have a PowerPoint 2013 file with 15 slides that is 2.3MB in size.&nbsp; After deleting all but 2 slides, the files size is still about 2.3MB.&nbsp; The remaining 2 slides only have text (no graphics).&nbsp; Why does the file size remain essentially the same after deleting
 85% of the slides and how do I reduce the file size of this new file?</p>

            Yes, I saved it (also tried Save As to a new filename), that's how I how I saw that the file size was so much larger than I expected after deleting 85% of the slides in the original file.

            That probably will make it impossible to solve then unless there are embedded fonts maybe.

<p>I can try removing embedded fonts/&nbsp; How do I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is that graphics that were in the deleted slides are still in the file, somehow.&nbsp; Any idea how to remove them?</p>

<p>As I said without seeing a file people would just be guessing. If you don't know how to embed fonts it is unlikely that you did that by mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could there be hidden graphics on the master or layouts? After that it's just guessing.</p>

<p>Hi Radar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About how to remove embedded fonts in PowerPoint 2013, you can refer to this <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-permanently-remove-embedded-fonts-in-a-PowerPoint-2013-presentation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify the situation, could you provide the following information?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">1. Is there any change after removing the fonts?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">2. Will its size change if you copy the original file and paste it to a new file, delete the slides in the new file and save it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The problematic file for testing.To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect it. Check it via
