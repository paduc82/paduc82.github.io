    <title>Multicolored crosshach of lines on booting&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multicolored crosshach of lines on booting&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This has happened ocassionally: When first booting my Gateway desktop (DX-4720-03, running W7 HP 64-bit with a Samsung 193P monitor), vertical and horizontal cross-hatching lines (many line of different colors) would appear on the monitor...and nothing else.
 I would then manually turn the computer off and re-boot. On re-booting, the black and white screen gives me various choices on how to open, I choose "open normally," and all is well. Other than that, I have had no problems with the computer or monitor's functioning.
 Any ideas? If this is the wrong forum for this question, please redirect.</p>
<p>EDIT: Two suggestions have been made.&nbsp; One says that my GPU may be overheating.&nbsp; I doubt that as the cross-hatching only appears when the computer is freshly booted (ie, has been off for a long time, like overnight), never while running.&nbsp; The other suggestion
 was that my graphics card could be going. I would have no troube replacing it, if it was that simple.&nbsp; Here's what I havee: 256MB (shared) NVidia GeForce 7100 integrated graphics chip. Although I think not, I'll ask anyway: Can it be replaced?<br />

    <title>Installed software and windows installer registry keys got messed up - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installed software and windows installer registry keys got messed up after a system restore, what can I do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After installing an update, which required me to restart my laptop, I had to do a restore point because it shut off while windows was loading files from the update, which led me to a system restore, which messed up a lot of windows installer registry keys,
 leaving me unable to open the next software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skype</li><li>Avira's Launcher (but not the antivirus)</li><li>Java</li></ul>
<p>I can not longer Install or Uninstall the these programs, either because I need a .msi file which doesnt match the last version of those programs,the program doesn't show up in the uninstall manager or the installer just doesnt show up at all, so what can
 I do to fix those programs and be able to install them back</p>
<p>
</p><p>Java's installer just doesnt show up when I double click the .exe, no matter if its the 64x or 32-bit, and i cant uninstall it because it doesnt show up in the uninstall manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Avira's launcher installer, keeps asking me for a .msi to remove the last version, but I cant find it, so the installation fails, also the program doesn't show up in the uninstall manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype's installer just can't update, and I uninstalled it with a 3rd party uninstaller, but now it just throw up a critical failure when attemping to install</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main question is, how can I fix those installers, should I format this laptop and do a clean install of windows?</p>
<p>

<h2>            bootup SUDDENLY pauses &#64; startup screen for 30 sec before continuing sucessful boot</h2>
                    Win7 (upgrade from Vista 32-bit) suddenly wants to pause for 30 secs before continuing to boot. This is a<strong> sudden</strong> change from its normal bootup process (5 sec? delay).
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">All</span> services/addons&nbsp;are the same for several months. Nothing new.&nbsp;Sysconfig reset 'timeout' to 5 seconds from default of 30 sec. Made NO difference. A couple of times, after proceeding it paused on the next screen,
 asking to&nbsp;boot into Vista (as default). This behavior has since corrected itself (or by me fiddling with resetting timeout etc. and re-booting.)&nbsp;Now just the annoyance of the pause/delay before proceeding.&nbsp; Worried about any total 'restore' to prevent add'l
 issues. Can windows7 backup, restore INDIVIDUAL files (boot manager) and What might the name of THAT file be if so?? TIA

            <strong>Microsoft support resolved the issue</strong>: I had re-arranged the boot startup order to check FIRST for a CD-DVD and NOT finding one, the system would wait the allotted 30 seconds then move forward. &nbsp;Only change the order of boot when you know
 that you want to boot off the CD for MS repair, etc.<br />
<br />
So for Dell systems,&nbsp;do this as system is starting to boot: F-12&gt;system setup&gt;maintenance&gt;<strong>Load Defaults.<br />
</strong>This changes the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">bios</span> only defaults BACK to factory setting, thus, returning the boot order to original settings. After this, system boots normally.<br />
<br />
Hope this experience will help someone else.

    <title>Unable to disable or stop Windows 10 update service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom the coder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to disable or stop Windows 10 update service</h2>
                    <p>I can no longer stop Windows 10 update service from the command prompt (net stop wuauserv) or from the Services.msc console.&nbsp; All options are grayed out.&nbsp; When I try it from the cmd prompt running as admin, I get "System error 5 has occurred. Access is denied.",
 even signed in as admin.&nbsp; This just started today.&nbsp; Winver is 1709 16299.847</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current update status is manual.&nbsp; I want to change it to be disabled.&nbsp; A few months ago, a real MS tech (not the scammers with the fake BSOD) disabled it permanently for me using registry settings, but over the last week the status has changed on its own
 to started &amp; manual.&nbsp; I would go in, stop it &amp; disable it.&nbsp; Now I can't disable it or stop it.&nbsp; I do not want to mess with the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want an Windows 10 software updates since they remove Windows 10 legit software, wipe out my printer &amp; change the GUI to make it resemble a smart phone&nbsp; I don't want my PC to look &amp; operate like my smartphone- I'm happy with it the way it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy getting security updates.</p>

            set the network to metered, you will still get small, important security updates but not the larger updates such as new features.
<br />
<br />settings -&gt; network &amp; internet -&gt; wifi (ethernet if connected using cable)
<br />click on the network name
<br />turn on "set as metered connection"

            Hi, Tom,
<br />
<br />Start &gt; Type Services.msc
<br />Locate Windows Update Service &gt; Click Stop on upper right.
<br />
<br />Also, instead of using Command Prompt use PowerShell (Admin) to execute the commands.
<br />
<br />As Martin states the metered connection will still get the Security Updates.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Regarding the issue, I would like to let you know that controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro , Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.
<br />
<br />Another way would be to use a 3rd party app like Stop Updates10. which allows you to disable Windows 10 Updates with a single click.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-windows-10-stopupdates10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-win...</a>
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />You can use Group Policy to block automatic updates. This ensures updates are downloaded/installed only when you want them:

<p>Changing Group Policy editor settings did not work on either PC.&nbsp; On one PC, the Windows Update service somehow gets switched from disabled/stopped to manual/started.&nbsp; There's something going on behind the scenes that sniffs around &amp; enables the update service.&nbsp;
 On the other PC, the Windows Update service recently blocked all abilities to control it in any way- all options are grayed out.&nbsp; Even "net stop wuauserv" from PowerShell won't work.&nbsp; A folder named Software Distribution under Windows gets created &amp; populated
 with updates on both PCs every day or so.&nbsp; I delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a metered connection does not stop updates.&nbsp; Plus it means I have to turn that off to get Office updates, which I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've come to the conclusion MS is going to force updates on users regardless of what steps are taken (even by their own support staff) to disable them.</p>

<p>Yes, I've started seeing this too over the past couple of days. Previously, there were a number of services that I could disable via Task Manager (albeit temporarily, the bastards turn them back on :/ ) that I receive the "Access Denied" message on when
 doing so now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, ever since getting Windows 10, I've been disappointed over and over again, what with it being slower on a brand new computer than an 11-year-old desktop with Windows 7 installed. But the fact that I can't even have control over my own computer and
 the processes running on it? That's <em>insanely</em> suspicious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's nice to know that Microsoft would rather play god with its shiny new OS than maintain the reputation it had built for
<em>not </em>being scumbags.</p>

<h3> proseif  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface book 2 lock screen options needs improvement</h2>
                    <p>So here's the thing I have a surface book 2 and I pretty much use it Sometimes with the keyboard sometimes without the keyboard. When I use this device with the keyboard it's simple and easy to lock the screen using (control + L). But the problem is I detach
 the screen and I like to use the screen separately and the function of the power button On that screen Doesn't lock it; it only turns off the display. I have looked into all the settings but couldn't find anything that has to do with the power button Change
 in function So that when I press the power button it locks the screen immediately and protect My device. In order for me to lock the screen I have to attach the keyboard again and then press (control + L). This really annoys me I have to call Cortana to lock
 the screen sometimes. Just simply make the power button options More customizable. I suggest that Microsoft should look into improving the power option in the control panel which right now only has on battery or plugged in Options so I suggested they add an
 additional 2 options for the surface devices that can be called attached screen, Detached screen. This will fix a lot of issues for the surface book users because it will allow for customizable options For Power management and locking screen. Please consider
 how people might want to have customized options for the device position they prefer adding those two options will allow consumers to have ready options that they customized for their own preference. For example, for my own preference if there was an option
 to customize the detachable device power option I would customize the power button so when I press it; it will lock the screen protected by a password also I would have it on Battery Saver so every time I detach the device the options on my device will switch
 automatically.</p>

<p>The lock function isn't under the power button, it's under the user options. A few icons above the power button is your profile picture, or a dude in a grey circle if you have no profile picture. Tap there, and you will find the lock option.</p>
<p>

screenshot</a>. There the power button, then above that the Settings app, then above that the user options button. You may have additional buttons between power and user options, but user options is always on top of that stack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the options for immediately locking your computer after pressing the power button in the Settings app under Accounts&gt;Sign-in options. When you have Windows Hello configured, the option "After how long does Windows ask you to sign in" that's forced to
 "every time".</p>

            <p>Hello JTSRDS, <br />
<br />
Have you been able to download and install Windows 8?<br />
If you are still experiencing an issue, then try the following suggestion. <br />
</p>
<p><span>- During the installation,&nbsp;temporary files going to the following path:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WebSetup\Panther&nbsp;<br />
<br />
- Delete the files the temp file and&nbsp;copy &nbsp;them in a backup directory. <br />
<span>- Disable all non-essential hardware such as printers, external hard drives etc.
<br />
- Verify all Windows updates are current on your current Windows operating systems.
<br />
-&nbsp; If you have an antivirus installed, check to see if it is Windows 8 compatible. If not, uninstall using the removal tool from the antivirus manufacturer.
<br />
- <span>
Run the following troubleshooter and then try the download again: The troubleshooter is for Windows Update. The Web Installer of Windows 8 uses the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS).&nbsp; This is the same component that is used
 when you download updates via Windows Update.&nbsp; A common cause to this problem is a “broken” BITS.&nbsp; The Windows Update troubleshooter rebuilds BITS.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2714434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2714434</a><br />
Once the troubleshooter has completed, try again to see if you can install Windows 8.
</span></span></span></p>

Let us know if this helps. <br />

    <title>Certain Apps displayed too small - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coffeethug  say:</h3>
<h2>            Certain Apps displayed too small</h2>
                    <p>Just got a brand new ASUS zenbook with integrated graphics card. Super excited to get to video editing. But my program (AVS Video Editor) opens and the window/fonts/buttons are incredibly small. So I went to settings--&gt;system--&gt;display--&gt;screen resolution,
 and tried bumping it up (all the way to 300%) and down (100%). Nothing worked. When I bumped it way up, the window/fonts/buttons did get bigger, but the layout was all messed up. I'm so frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone to all the threads around here and tried to fix the issue. Here is what I have done:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-ensured all updates have been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-tried every display setting (including changing the font size in every category @ settings--&gt;system--&gt;display--&gt;advanced display settings--&gt;advanced sizing of text and other items--&gt;drop down bar</p>
<p>
</p><p>-tried every scaling option for display settings @ settings--&gt;system--&gt;display--&gt;advanced display settings--&gt;display adapter properties--&gt;Intel HD Graphics Control Panel (tab)--&gt;Scaling (drop down menu)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-resized the window manually and pressed CTRL +</p>
<p>
</p><p>- tried every setting @ settings--&gt;system--&gt;display--&gt;screen resolution, and tried bumping it up (all the way to 300%) and down (100%).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has worked. Please help!</p>

            <p>1. Yes AVS Video Editor has it's own settings, which can be accessed by opening the program and finding the settings tab. There are no settings that have to do with display, or aspect ratio, or resolution. I played around with the settings that are available,
 and it was to no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Yes, I uninstalled and re-installed. No dice.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I understand you correctly you are unable to scan documents after installing 2132 Deskjet All in one printer. The issue could be if there is some settings corruption or driver issue. Try the steps provided below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>“<strong>Shell Hardware Detection service</strong>” is an important Windows service which controls autoplay and autorun in plug and play devices. Sometimes this issue may also appear when Shell Hardware Detection Service is disabled.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let’s follow the steps below to restart Shell Hardware Detection and Windows Image Acquisition services and check if that solves the problem. Follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on Start, type in <strong>services.msc.</strong></span></li><li><span>Select “<strong>Shell Hardware Detection Service” </strong>from the list, Right click
<strong>properties.</strong></span></li><li><span>Change the startup type to <strong>Automatic.</strong></span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Start</strong> button.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Apply, Ok</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer and check with restarting the “Windows Image Acquisition service” service again.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also check if all other dependency services are running. Try the steps to check Dependencies.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right-click on <strong>Windows Image Acquisition (WIA</strong>) and select<strong> Properties.</strong></span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Dependencies</strong>, you will find all the <strong>dependency services under&nbsp;box labeled</strong> “<strong>This service depends on the following system components</strong>.”</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>If issue still persists, try the steps provided in the article mentioned below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/product/HP-DeskJet-2130-All-in-One-Printer-series/7174550/model/7529634/document/c03466081/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Scanning from the Computer with HP Scan (Windows)</span></a>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p>If you are following the above document and are still unable to scan, try downloading and running the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/product/HP-DeskJet-2130-All-in-One-Printer-series/7174550/model/7529634/document/c03466081/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">HP

    <title>PVR Help please - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b3nje909  say:</h3>
<h2>            PVR Help please</h2>
                    
<p>Ok here's my dilemma.<br />
<br />
I've been keen to start recording gaming footage for another website I'm very active on. (see sig).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I use a 360 elite, a Benq monitor with hdmi, d-sub and DVD-I (dvi-d??) inputs.<br />
Currently I am using hdmi to go from the Xbox to the monitor, I also have a the microsoft hdmi/optical out thingy to go to my turtlebeach dx11's (this may seem like a pretty crap setup to some but it took me ages to get this).<br />
I also have all variation of xbox component outputs (that I know off, the original optical one, and then the non optical elite one).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've been told of the Hauppauge pvr, but it's component only.<br />
<br />
Is there any PVRs that Would be able to connect to my monitor, that has minimal screen lag, or do I need an adaptor for say a HD Fury (I'd rather not, as they are quite expensive).<br />
Or is there a way to just record what's on my monitor somehow with the ports I have listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>            Battery Problem &#123; hp envy 15&#125;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop get shut down while the battery icon shows 30% remaining( I have checked it out just before it get auto shut down) but when I press the power button light indicator shown "White light blinking i.e no power".
</p>
<p>And most important things are...<br />
1- When I am going to charge my laptop it doesn't 100% charged, it's just stuck on 99% charging, I have given it to at least an hour to 100% charge, but it is still stuck on 99% ( Battery indication is yellow light i.e charging).&nbsp;<br />
2- It is always shut down on 30% charging but when pressing the power button indication is "White light".</p>
<p>3- Charging speed very fast up to 60% than usual( I have noticed it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have been facing such problem for 2 month.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When was the last time it was working fine?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you tried plugging in the
<b>mic</b> at the rear end and checked?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Firstly, I’d suggest you to run the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Recording-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">audio recording troubleshooter</a> and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>

</p></span></b><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update</a> your sound card
 drivers and check if that helps.</span>
<span>
<p><br />
</p><b><br />
Method 3:</b></span>
&nbsp;
<p><span>I would also suggest you to verify the recording levels for input devices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. In the
<b>Control Panel</b>, select <b>Sounds</b> and <b>Audio Devices</b>.<br />
b. Now select the <b>Voice tab</b> in the <b>Sounds</b> and <b>
Audio Devices Properties</b> dialog box.<br />
c. The Default device should be the device you want to use for voice recording.<br />
d. Next, click the <b>Volume button</b> under the <b>Voice recoding heading</b>.<br />
e. Adjust the vertical volume slide on the <b>Mic Volume</b> or Line Volume depending on which device you are using.</span></p>

    <title>Communication bans&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> effective merc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Communication bans&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was&nbsp;communication banned and I know why so I'm not going to get into&nbsp;complaining and ranting to much&nbsp;but &nbsp;do have a few questions on things that aren't very clear about this to me.

</p><p><br /></p>

<p>To start I have had one&nbsp;24 hour communication ban prior to this according to xbox&nbsp;enforcement. However i never knew this due to the fact I probably didn't get on for its duration or check my messages. Oh and it was at a time when I didn't have electricity in my house due to storms knocking the power &nbsp;out&nbsp;a few days prior&nbsp;according to the date on the enforcement page. So I'll assume it was undeserved anyway. I know this much for a fact as it was within a few days of pokemon go coming out and i spent time doing that due to having no power or access to xbox live.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>So now what i want to know is how does me sending a single swear word in a message warrant a 7 day ban? And lets say some angry kid decides to randomly report again for something as small as me saying "F*** off" again? Will it then be like a month plus? I don't care so much that I can't talk for a week but what irritates me is it seems to be a second strike and it came only 30 minutes after I was probably reported.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>So yeah&nbsp;if it happens again am I like totally screwed over? I was ban free like 10 years and now in the last&nbsp;9 months it happens twice one time of which I couldn't even access&nbsp;the internet. Really like what?</p>

 </blockquote> <p>See that's my concern. After 10 years of not having a single issue and sending one swear word on only a single message I am now possibly&nbsp;1 step away from losing my account? Now lets say I have a short lapse in judgment, do it a year from now,&nbsp;somebody gets slightly offended in party, I could unintentionally make a individual mad or offend them, etc. All these situations equals being reported. Due to the fact that enforcement would only review what is reported and have almost no way to be directly contacted I'd more then likely loose my entire account for close to literally nothing. If I were modding, hacking, tampering with my profile, stealing information, or anything like that I could be more understanding. But that's not the case.</p><p><br /></p><p>If I screw up and get punished it is what it is.&nbsp;I just don't like that I never knew I had a first ban and now I've had a second one that's 7 times as long&nbsp;for yes breaking a rule but only a very small one and in a&nbsp;har

            <p>I never implied that it would be a fight and I understand that. In none of the situations I listed is anything really anyones fault. It's more a matter of "Oh im going to report you for this or that."

    <title>Cannot disable touchpad with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bythec1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot disable touchpad with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Just installed Windows 10 and noticed that I have no way to disable my touchpad on my Asus S550CA Computer. &nbsp;There is supposed to be a feature where you press fn+F9 to disable it but that is not working any longer. &nbsp;I have tried going into the new Settings
 feature and under the Mouse/Touchpad section there is no way to disable the touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else having this problem and more importantly does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>I was having this problem and found no solutions online, so after some fiddling around, I was able to successfully disable my touchpad while keeping the mouse fully functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, you must uninstall your current driver; then, upon a restart it will automatically install the updated driver with which you can disable with Fn+F9 normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the steps to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open up the Control Panel, then search for "Mouse" in the upper right search bar. Click on the first result to open up a "Mouse Properties" box.</li><li>Navigate to the rightmost "Hardware" tab to find installed touchpad devices. Assuming device drivers for a mouse are installed, click on the device which is not your mouse. For my system, it was named, "Asus Support Device."</li><li>Once you have selected it, click on the "Properties" button near the bottom right to open up the device's properties.</li><li>A new box will appear; go to the second tab named "Driver" on it. Continue by clicking on the "Uninstall" button on the bottom. A new dialogue box will appear. Ensure that you will
<em>not</em> "delete driver software," and click "OK."</li><li>It will then ask you to restart your computer. Do so. After the restart, it should tell you that it is installing the new device driving for "ASUS Touchpad." In my situation, it required me to restart my computer again.</li><li>After the second restart, your touchpad driver should be completely up to date, and Fn+F9 will disable the touchpad, as it should.</li></ul>
