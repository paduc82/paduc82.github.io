<h2>            printing a document that has a cover page and chapters</h2>
                    Typing a manuscript. I have a cover page that does not have a header or footer. Chapter 1 starts on page 1 with headers throughout the rest of the doc. Beginning this project, when I would print several pages, I would click on custom page range and enter
 the desired pages, i.e. 9-15, 18, 20. Then the printer would print pages (as numbered in the header) 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, and 20. But something happened. Now, when I try to print any portion of the text, no matter what range I enter in the custom
 print field, it prints the cover page, page 1, 2, 3, etc. until the end of the range I specified. I don't want to print the entire 300 page manuscript every time I make changes to one of the chapters.&nbsp;

            Hi Rose,
<br />
<br />This may be very complex, or not. Take a breath. I feel your frustration.
<br />
<br />Cover pages add their own quirks to Word.
<br />
<br />Here is my page on page numbering and its complexities. Hopefully I will be able to help you through this and you will not need to refer to it. 
<br /><a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections2007.htm#PageNumbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections20...</a>
<br />
<br />Here is some about how Cover Pages mess with us:
<br /><a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections2007.htm#Cover_Pages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections20...</a>
<br />
<br />The linked pages will help you get a better understanding for what is going on but won't give you a direct answer. I hope I can do that.
<br />
<br />That said, if you restarted page numbering you added a section. My guess is that you have at least one section for each chapter but that may be wrong. Sections and restarted numbering make it tougher to print. You can have section numbers display in the Status bar and that helps.
<br />
<br />Can you let me know if you have multiple sections, how many, and whether your page numbering restarts in more than one place in the document?

            To print a range of pages that may scan sections you need to use special page numbering.
<br />PageNumberSectionNumber-PageNumberSectionNumber
<br />
<br />So, to print from page 3 of section 4 to page 27 of section 6 you would tell Word you want: p3s4-p27s6
<br />
<br />Example: you have restarted numbering and have 
<br />Section 1 - cover page
<br />Section 2 - front matter numbered i - iv
<br />Section 3 - 15 pages numbered 1 - 13
<br />odd-page section break
<br />Section 3 - 20 pages numbered 15-34
<br />odd-page section break
<br />Section 4 - 21 pages numbered 35-55
<br />odd-page section break
<br />Section 5 - 15 pages numbered 1-15 just to make it tough
<br />odd-page section break
<br />Section 6 - 35 pages numbered A-1 - A-35
<br />
<br />Print Section 2: p1s1-p50s4
<br />Print Sections 2-5: p1s2-p15s5
<br />Print pages A-5 to A9: p5s6-p9s6
<br />Print pages 11-37  11-37

<p>Thank you for your reply. It would have helped if I knew what I was doing before I began this project. That said, here is what I have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A title page that has no header. There is a section break and then I begin the next section on the next page. It is labeled Chapter 1. This page and all subsequent pages have a header. In my header I have some non-changing information followed by a field
 that is tied to my section style Chapter 1. Following this field is another field for page numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chapter 1 (which is a section) starts with page 1&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chapter 2 (another section) begins on page 8</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>There is no re-numbering anywhere else in the document. Only the different first or Title page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, it was working. But then I decided to add foreground information. This caused a myriad of problems with the document. Finally, I took out all that foreground info and tried to go back to what was working. But I somehow managed to change something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, in the print dialogue, under Custom Print, it would explain the function by saying to enter the print range separated by a dash or individual pages followed by a comma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my trip to Microsoft Purgatory, the explanation under the Custom Print option now has changed. It very clearly tells me that when I enter a print range, it will print from the beginning of the doc to that desired print range. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. I will give that a try. However, it doesn't explain why it changed. Previously it was working. After I tried to add a section back at the beginning of the doc, I messed up the sections and the general page numbering. When I finally
 got that resolved, the wording on the Print Dialogue has changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously when I would click to print and select Custom Print, it used to describe the function by saying to enter the page range separated by a hyphen or to enter individual pages separated by commas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying to fix the problem I caused by adding that section, the Print Dialogue now reads differently. It now says that it will print from the beginning of the doc to that desired print range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to search for Printer settings but feel like I must have somehow reconfigured Word. (I'm not seriously giving myself that much credit but can't figure out what I did.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can make it print what I want by doing Current Page (just this one page). My main concern is that this messed up formatting will stick with this doc when I try to send it to my editor.&nbsp;</p>

            No. How it works has not changed. (the dialog wording may have changed). It has been this way since at least Word 97. It has never explained about sections in that dialog. The current pop-up explanation is shown below.
<br />
<br />Do you know how many sections you have? It sounds like you have one for each chapter, but with the StyleRef field that probably would not be needed.
<br />
<br />(The presence or absence of a header is irrelevant to the page numbering.)<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed2a3840-2bd9-4db6-bf97-60f78f61d4c4?upload=true" />

            Is the pop-up text or other text in your print dialog different from what shows in my screenshot?
<br />
<br />Here's how to post a screenshot:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />You should not need printer settings, just the page range in the print dialog.
<br />
<br />See the screenshot. Right-click on your status bar if you need to add more info.
<br />
<br />If your document has only one each of page 57-63 and you tell it to print 57-63, that is what you will get. If you have 3 page 1's and you tell it to print page 1, you will get the first page 1, even if you are currently on the third one. Practice by printing to pdf!<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84c27b79-bdb2-4070-b7e6-826dae1d1e7a?upload=true" />

<br />Most likely you are using a different Skype ID to login. Rather than login with your mail ID, login with your Skype ID. 
<br />
<br />You can also use Web Skype (only Edge/Chrome browsers) to check

    <title>Deleted Sites Leave a Tile that takes you to an error page - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Deleted Sites Leave a Tile that takes you to an error page</h2>
                    <p>So I have deleted some Sharepoint sites in the last few weeks but they still have visible tiles on the site page. The little boxes on the tiles are white, and when you click the tile it takes you to an error page. Is there a way to remove these tiles to
 no where?&nbsp; How do I remove them?</p>

            Your question has nothing to do with "Ovi.com and Ovi Sync", so I presume the moderators will move this thread.<br />
<br />
If switching profiles the usual ways does not work, and even removing the battery and rebooting the phone does not help, then...<br />
<br />
1: Check that you have a SIM card inserted.<br />
<br />
2: If that wasn't the problem, try reformatting the phone or updating its firmware.<br />
<br />
3: If those didn't help, either, then have your nearest Nokia repair center take a look at the phone.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, just in case, the usual ways to switch profiles:<br />
<br />
- A long press of the '#' key<br />
<br />
- A short press of the power key, and then selecting the profile from the list<br />
<br />
- Using the Profile app in the phone menu

            This is quite a common problem on the E65 and the solution is often quite simple.<br />
<br />
Try this:<br />
Switch off the phone.<br />
Remove the memory card.<br />
Switch the phone back on.<br />
If it asks you to stay offline say no.<br />
<br />
Usually this will allow the phone to work online normally.<br />
<br />
Now try it again with the memory card in and it should work properly. If not you will need to format the memory card.<br />

<p>On my E65, the SIMM card was not being detected by the phone, if that is the case I fixed it by inserting a paper (with several folds) between the silver plate and my simm so as to put&nbsp; pressure on the SIMM. Once SIMM card is well in place turn the phone
 ON and change the profile to General or anyother except Offline! :) Hope it helps.</p>

<h3> andrewlabonte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Joining multiple Tables in Microsoft Access 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have several tables for various years that I am trying to link with one main table, all of which have one common field.&nbsp; The problem I am encountering is that if I create a relationship using the one common field,&nbsp;the only output I get is for&nbsp;numbers that
 show up in every table.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, table 1 has&nbsp;numbers ranging&nbsp;from 1-5 which I want to use as my main table that everything else links to.&nbsp; The other tables&nbsp;also have numbers ranging from 1-5, but may not contain all the numbers during that year.&nbsp; The
 end result I am trying to get is a table with numbers from 1-5 on the left from the main table and years on the top for my headers, and the associated data from each year going across next to the main row numbers like in the example below.&nbsp; Any help would
 be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you for your assistance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>you can use a Outer-Join.</p>
<p>In your query design double-click on relations from main-table and the others and select second option.</p>

            <p>First, your structure is incorrect. &nbsp;You should not have tables specific for a year. You should have ONE table with a field to indicate the year. Then you wouldn't need to use a query at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, you should probably use a UNION query to consolidate your data rather than relating them. If you think relating is the answer, the using an OUTER join is what you need.</p>

            You really should coalesce your tables into a single table. By having multiple tables, one for each year, you are doing what is known as 'encoding data as table names'.&nbsp; A fundamental principle of the database relational model is the Information Principle
 (Codd's Rule #1).&nbsp; This requires that all data be stored as values at column positions in rows in tables, and in no other way.<br />
<br />
With a correctly structured single table you can easily return the result table you want by means of a crosstab query.<br />

            <p>Thank you all for your input.&nbsp; Some the responses seemed quite complex as are the datasets I am working with, over a million records.&nbsp; The simplest solution was just to edit relationships, change the join type to the third option allowing me to show all
 the fields of the first table and any associated fields in the additional tables</p>

            <p>The problem with the Join approach is that it is a band aid to get around bad design. it just means more jury rigging in the future. The better solution is to correct the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should not be difficult to create one large table with a field to indicate the year. If you tell us what the table structure looks like, we can suggest a way to get what you need.</p>

<h3> pologirl12usc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does EOMONTH for September give the 31st&#63;</h2>
                    Using the fomrula =EOMONTH(MONTH(DATEVALUE(X$5&amp;" 1, "&amp;$C6)),0) where X5 is Sep and C6 is 2010 as part of a larger formula. Alone this gives the 31st. There are only 30 days in September and thus it throws it off the bigger formula.

<p>EOMONTH's first argument is a date.&nbsp; Month is not a date is it is a number like 1 to 12.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So use</p>
<p>=DAY(EOMONTH(DATEVALUE((X$5&amp;" 1, "&amp;$C6),0))</p>
<p>to return the day of the end of the month or</p>
<p>=EOMONTH(DATEVALUE((X$5&amp;" 1, "&amp;$C6),0)</p>
<p>To return Sept 30, 2010</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Two pcs running Outlook 2007 connected to an Exchange server 2010.&nbsp; Both Outlook using the same Exchange account.&nbsp; Both are configured to sync the address book offline.</p>
<p>When searching the address book, one returns all results as it suppose to, the other often "yield no results" or returns some of them !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions ?</p>

Instant search on "Address book" !!&nbsp; Not on the messages !<br />

            <p>Hi A.Moore,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting in the forum.</p>
<p>As far as I know in Windows Phone 8.1 we do not have option to remove unsecure warless signal or use only WPA2 personal connection, but that is an excellent feature suggestion. To insure your voice is heard, please go to this official suggestion site:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>And add your suggestion there, after first searching to insure it is not already suggested. If it already exists, be sure to vote for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Phone Suggestion site is the official avenue for future functionality requests.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for your contribution to the forums!</p>

    <title>Why is the A3 &#40;or 11&#34; x 17&#34;&#41; paper size not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steveballantyne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is the A3 &#40;or 11&#34; x 17&#34;&#41; paper size not available&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    Going into Page Setup &gt; Size , one would have thought it would be an option to select A3 sized paper, or 11" x 17" without having to do this manually.&nbsp; Why is this not an option?&nbsp; (and... slightly annoying &amp; time consuming having to manually lookup A3
 sizes then input these....)<br />
It would be good to have a function whereby a link to the net could feed back more useful standard paper sizes... frustrating as this function is in use in previous versions of Word.&nbsp; Can the A3 or other sizes be added??<br />

            The info &amp; options offered in Page Setup are provided by the driver software for the printer drivers you have installed -- they are not provided by Word. If A3 isn't in the list it's because the selected printer doesn't have the capacity to print on that
 size stock. Try choosing <i><b>Any Printer</b></i> from the <b>Format For:</b> list &amp; see if A3 [along with a number of others you hadn't seen] shows up.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you're aware that you can specify any dimensions you wish by using the Manage Custom Sizes feature to define the paper sizes you prefer... That, however is an OS X feature -- again, simply hosted by the program you're using.<br />
<br />
IOW, everything in Page Setup is basically Word saying "OK, this is what I've been given for you to pick from."<br />

            <p>Unfortunately, everyone has their own idea of what a standard paper size is and the result would be an unwieldy list of hundreds of formats.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is simple enough: install a model of printer that includes A3 size. The best idea is to install the same model that your client is using, then you know the margins will be right. Use File for the port, since you don't actually have to print
 to it.&nbsp;</p>

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Welcome screen comes only when you start Skype. There is no way to go back to Welcome screen once you leave this screen. If you want this feature, I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open Skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Office 2013 is the last version you have the EASY option to have both installed.&nbsp; Just in case you want time to adjust to the changes in the ribbon (not all that significant, mostly visual).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do decide to do that, at the start of the install process select the option to "Customize" install.&nbsp; You also have to add a "registy hack" to prevent office from "Configuring" every time you switch versions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, if you select the default install 2013 will uninstall 2007 for you.

            There is no upgrade from Office 2007 to Office 2013.&nbsp; You can uninstall Office 2007 before installing Office 2013 or you can leave it so that both programs are on your computer.

            Hi Jozaan, you need to deactivate your previous Installation and then re-install Office 2016
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/myaccount</a> and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted
<br />
<br />Select Install 
<br />
<br />Under Install information, locate the PC which Office was installed on 
<br />
<br />Select Deactivate Install to deactivate the Office installation 
<br />
<br />Then, click Install to install Office

    <title>My Favorites website links in Internet Explorer 11 all disappeared out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russellmcpherson  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Favorites website links in Internet Explorer 11 all disappeared out of the folders</h2>
                    <p>My internet links all disappeared out of my Favorites folder. All of the subfolders I created throughout the years are still there, intact under my Favorites folder, but all of the links are gone. I have it set up where any computer I log into my Microsoft
 account all share the same favorites links. Any of my computers I log into all show empty subfolders. The websites on my Favorites Bar have also disappeared.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8.1. My computer is set to do automatic updates and I believe very recently did an update, which I have already tried System Restore with no luck of retrieving the lost links. I know where my favorites folder
 is, and it still exists with all of the subfolders intact. The links themselves are all missing. How on earth did this happen and is it possible to recover them? My computer unfortunately is not set up for previous version file recovery.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a mystical cloud online where these are stored? Since normally I am able to access the same links on any computer anywhere I login to my Microsoft account&nbsp;I would assume they are stored online.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your efforts. Unfortunately no luck. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First off I am not sure which update may have caused this. I am not even sure exactly when it happened, but it was sometime over this last weekend I believe (Friday at the earliest I think). My computers are set for automatic updates, so whatever updated
 this weekend could have been the issue. "About Internet Explorer" is telling me I am running update version 11.0.16 KB3021952.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 did not restore them, so&nbsp;I turned the protected mode back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 I have already tried. The folder is there. Even all of the subfolders I made that organized my favorites are still there. It is only the links themselves that vanished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Russ</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT- I checked my update history, and it would probably be one of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB 2267602</p>
<p>KB 3034196</p>
<p>KB 890830</p>

            It happened sometime between 20 hrs ago (when I last used IE) and this morning (12 hrs ago), but strangely enough my last IE update is KB 3034196 dated 13th of February, Desktop was changed (New opening Picture and page) and ASK was configured as the default
 browser, so something definitely happened during those 8 hours. I see this update is similar to one of Russels,

            More seriously, all files in my document folder are gone as well. And I cannot find&nbsp;my iCloud,&nbsp;&nbsp;probaby because my Windows 2013 installation as gone as well. My 8.1 desktop contains virtually nothing.

            This seems very amateurish I'm afraid, but it seems the&nbsp;update created havoc with my account settings. Once I sorted them out, it seems things are back to normal.

            <p>Does anyone else have any ideas or answers? I even tried the online Microsoft support where they take control of the keyboard and he just told me the links were gone... No explanation of how it could have happened or anything. If my entire "favorites" folder
 was gone I wouldn't be so confused about this. Not only is the favorites folder still there, but all of the sub folders I created are still there. There is absolutely zero chance I accidentally deleted all of the links out of all of the subfolders. I would
 have had to open up each subfolder and delete all of the files without deleting the subfolders.
</p>

</p><p>I am now using Google Chrome as most every computer expert I know has been telling me to do for several years now. The only thing that kept me using IE was my links. If someone can figure out how to get my links back I may consider switching back to IE.
 Thanks.</p>
