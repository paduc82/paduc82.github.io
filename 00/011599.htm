<h2>            how do i update my lumina 822 with windows 8.1 to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I had to replace my phone with a new one due to damage. I had received a pushed window 10 on my old phone but the new one came with windows 8.1. I have been unsuccessful trying to find a way to get the new phone updated to windows 10. I have contacted my
 phone service carrier and they are worthless.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help?</p>

    <title>Trying to Sync with both a server and a PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randav2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to Sync with both a server and a PC</h2>
                    I have a Sprint Mogul running Windows Mobile 6.<br />
<br />
I have an free account set up with mail2web.com and the sync with that account works quite nicely for calendar, contacts, tasks and email (for the most part).<br />
<br />
I would like to also be able to sync via USB with my laptop to sync documents, music filles and other things. I had that working pretty seamlessly before I set up the mail2web account.<br />
<br />
Now I cant get the device to connect with my laptop. I keep getting a message that says that in order to connect with this device ActiveSync 4.5 is required on my PC.... well that's what I have.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Also with the mail2web account active sync keeps defaulting back to "text only" for the emails. Is this an ActiveSync issue? When I sign into the web-based version of my account, the emails are in html.<br />
<br />
I appreciate any insight anyone can offer,<br />

            I also use Mail2web and sync with Activesync on my PC without any problem. Have tried uninstalling activesync and reinstalling after a reboot of the pc. Also, delete the partnership on your device before reconnecting. I cannot answer the second part of
 your question because I don't have WM6 yet.

            <p>There are several things wrong with your code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, you appear to be trying to split a line into two. To do that you must put an underscore at the end of the first line to indicate that it is continued on the next line. So do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set ashape = ActiveDocument.Shapes.AddPicture(FileName, LinktoFile, (1) _<br />
&nbsp;SaveWithDocument, Left, Top, Width, Height, Anchor)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, you need a comma to separate the parameter (1) from the parameter SaveWithDocument. So do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set ashape = ActiveDocument.Shapes.AddPicture(FileName, LinktoFile, (1), &nbsp;_<br />
&nbsp;SaveWithDocument, Left, Top, Width, Height, Anchor)</p>
<p>
</p><p>That will fix your list separator problem. However, there is a lot more wrong with your code, far too much to explain here. I suggest that you try recording a macro while adding your shape in Word and then look at the code that it generates.

 explain VBA terms that I can understand, being the technology simpleton that I am. If you know of a good one I would appreciate it if you could give me the link. I use the macro recorder as often as I can but there are some functions that I'm not able to record
 so I have to try to figure out the code and I get totally lost or I have to try to find the macro code already on the web.

            <p>Thank you Suzanne--very helpful.</p>
<p>First let me say that before posting myquestion I had gone round and round on the properties--from the print file and&nbsp; the control panel approaches--I never found a waytoselect the output location either.</p>
<p>However, your info about the rear door sent me back to the printer,&nbsp; I don't believe my printer has a rear door--but it does have a purple gear shaped thing that I had thought was for paper jams.&nbsp; No--it has a little arrow pointing up, and when I rotated
 the wheel up a few degrees: "click", and now I have uptput at the top fo the machine, as I wished.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

 Bld 14396, with no problem.</p>
<p>My one other insider PC device is also running well on Bld 14396.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say if Bld 14396 loads OK for you, ignore the script patch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I have not tried the script, because I have the latest insider build on all insider devices and running OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problem being involved with the Insider program but I must say they issue update / upgrades with very little info, I would like them to be a bit more open. Even some of our 'expert PC /IT Journalist' I think get confused some time and their info
 is sometimes just so,so.</p>

<h2>            Confused</h2>
                    
<p>What does this do that I can't do with&nbsp;Live Mesh and Windows Live services&nbsp;(Contacts, Calendar, Photos, SkyDrive, etc).&nbsp; With Windows Live services all my data is stored elsewhere off my phone.&nbsp; So if I need to replace my phone, I haven't&nbsp;really lost anything.&nbsp;
 Live Mesh not only allows me keep some document folders&nbsp;stored/sync'd to&nbsp;my phone but it also allows me to remote access the desktop storage on the occassion I need that.&nbsp; Sharing documents, photos, etc can easily be done in Live SkyDrive, etc.</p>

<p>Hey John,<br />
<br />
The promise of the Microsoft MyPhone service is to always keep your data on the phone secure anywhere you go and in any scenario. Let us look at this in detail below<br />
<br />
Contacts/Calendar/Tasks :</p>
<p>The Microsoft MyPhone application syncs all your Outlook Mobile Contacts, Calendar and Tasks&nbsp;with the MyPhone portal whereas the Windows Live Services only maintains your Live contacts (contacts on your messenger, Address book) and not contacts who are outside
 that service. So if you lose your phone today and get a new Windows Phone, Windows Live services will NOT restore your Contacts/Calendar (outside of your Live service data) and Tasks back to your phone<br />
<br />
Photos &amp; Files:<br />
<br />
The Windows Live service allow you to publish photos but NOT keep them in sync.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
For example : With Windows Live you can upload your photos from the phone but if you have lost it, you cannot sync it back to your phone. Also, you can manage your photos, files and videos from the portal (Archive to Web, which means they will be backed up
 on the site and need not be preserved on your phone from now)<br />
<br />
Among many other features, MyPhone syncs your Text messages , videos and documents on the phone which you can manage from the portal.&nbsp;It seems to make more sense for a&nbsp;user to have 1 application that syncs your contacts/calendar/tasks/photos/videos/Text Messages
 than use 3 different products to do the same. At the same time this is a Beta release and we are evaluating future options (which we cannot reveal at this point :) ) and also address customer feedback in the future.<br />
<br />
Keep the questions coming :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

            Hey MyPhoneLover,<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;have just posted a similar question on&nbsp;<a href="http://myphoneteam.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!500D40C76E07BE24!151.entry?ccr=988#comment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://myphoneteam.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!500D40C76E07BE24!151.entry?ccr=988#comment</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I guess I am not the only one getting very confused.<br />
Brand and product confusion - I think it is very odd that you are not using the "Live" brand for this product, i.e. Live Phone.
<br />
<br />
The KISS-model would in my opinion be the way to - Keep It Simple and Short.

            Hi MyPhoneLover<br />
<br />
I guess for the&nbsp;average mortal user (e.g. my mom or other non-techie) this is utterly difficult to figure out.
<br />
Can you imagine a salesman in some phone outlet store trying to sell a phone&nbsp;using that long speech you just wrote???
<br />
<br />
The dialogue (assuming customer is non-techie):<br />
<br />
Salesman: "If you want to publish photos taken on your phone you can download and install something called Windows Live - just a second I will write down the web address for you"<br />
<br />
Customer: "OK"<br />
<br />
Salesman: "However, what you have to remember is that your pictures will not be in sync using Windows Live - you can only upload them. Also Windows Live will only sync your contacts from Messenger and Address book&nbsp;- but only the Address book on your PC"<br />
<br />
Customer: "Ehh... OK -&nbsp;If I&nbsp;publish the photos they would be saved online?"<br />
<br />
Salesman: "Yes, but they will not be in sync - if you upload photos from your PC as well, they will not be synced to your phone...you see, you have install another program called Live Mesh" - salesman struggling here, " - which is btw free - you only pay for
 the amount of data you download through the internet connection provider from your mobile phone company"<br />
<br />
Customer: "Ok - so if I install these two programs my mobile phone will be backed up?"<br />
<br />
Salesman: "Actually you have to install a third one called myPhone, this will keep all your contacts in sync and not only the contacts from Messenger."<br />
<br />
Customer: "uhmm... I probably have to ask my son to help me in that case, but he's out traveling for the moment... I just want something very simple"<br />
<br />
Salesman: "I understand your concerns, but you can always come into our store and ask for assistance - or call us and we would be happy to help"<br />
<br />
Customer: "What time do you close today?"<br />
<br />
Salesman: "We close at 6pm"<br />
<br />
Customer: "Ok, I will think about it and maybe come back later"<br />
<br />
Salesman: :-( &lt;- no sales...<br />
<br />
<br />
An average user does not care about 3-4 different overlapping products - he/she just wants something that works out-of-the-box.
<br />
<br />
A perfect sales speech would be something like:<br />
"With this mobile phone from Microsoft your data is always safe - you just have to&nbsp;connect to the internet with your mobile phone once in a while."<br />
<br />
<br />
This is why iPhone sells like it does - it is simple and&nbsp;works out-of-the-box.

    <title>Word not responding after selecting spelling correction - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> just another office user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word not responding after selecting spelling correction</h2>
                    <p>Word has recently started freezing when I correct a spelling error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replication:</p>
<p>- Open Word.</p>
<p>- Create new blank document.</p>
<p>- Type a word with incorrect spelling.</p>
<p>- Word highlights the spelling error with a red underline.</p>
<p>- Right-click on the word and select a correction.</p>
<p>- Word freezes for about 120 seconds. The Word window goes mostly blank.</p>
<p>- The spelling error is corrected and normal behavior resumes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue also occurs when typing a spelling error that Word corrects automatically.</p>

<p>After a lot of trial and error, I have fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps are very specific:</p>
<p>1. Disable all of the Actions add-ins (Address, Date, Financial Symbol, etc). It doesn't matter if the "Enable additional actions in the right-click menu" option is selected or not.</p>
<p>2. Close Word.</p>
<p>3. Open Word in safe mode.</p>
<p>4. Type a word with incorrect spelling.</p>
<p>5. Right-click on the word and select a correction.</p>
<p>6. Wait while Word freezes (title bar says "not responding").</p>
<p>7. Word crashes, so close it.</p>
<p>8. Start Word in normal mode.</p>
<p>9. Enable all of the Actions add-ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spelling correction now works properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that just doing steps 1 and 2 is not sufficient. Word must crash in order to fix the problem, and Word only crashes when started in safe mode. Repeating the process without the safe mode part of step 3 is not effective. In normal mode, Word does not
 respond for about 2 minutes when a spelling correction is selected, but it doesn't crash and the spelling error is eventually corrected (though the next spelling correction again causes Word to not respond).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original problem of Word not responding after selecting a spelling correction could be recreated by doing step 9 above. However, after running through the process several times, I now cannot recreate the original problem and doing step 9 no longer causes
 the problem. I made no other changes to Windows or installed/running programs/services.</p>

<p>If you're unable to see the POP folder under your Deleted folder on Outlook.com then it is possible that you did not enable the option

<strong>Leave a copy of messages on the server </strong>on your mobile devices or mail applications that's why you're not seeing a POP folder under your Deleted folder on Outlook.com.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Kindly check if you have enabled the option

<p>Please be informed that a POP folder will only appear under your Deleted folder when you didn't enabled the option

            I had this same issue.&nbsp; Following this thread I understand what is going on.&nbsp; I have POP Enabled and Leave a copy of messages on the server on my phone enabled.&nbsp; Is this why I am now getting the "Your messages are in your POP folder...." message all the
 time?&nbsp; I didn't use to get this message but did do an upgrade to my IOS on my IPhone so maybe it changed some settings?&nbsp; What should I do so I don't get this POP message or is it best to leave it the way it is and just close the box when it comes up?&nbsp; Thanks<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have understood correctly your account has&nbsp;a POP folder and you want to know if you should delete it since your&nbsp;emails are no longer being directed to this folder. Just to verify,&nbsp;is your account still configured&nbsp;in your device via POP? If yes, it's
 possible that the option to "Leave a copy of messages on the server" is already enabled. Please note that if this option is enabled, the account will not move the messages to the POP folder anymore. If that's the case, then it would be safe to delete the POP
 folder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope this information helps. Should you have other concerns, please don't hesitate to post back in this thread so we can provide assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business search not working correctly</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just noticed that the search inside a OneDrive for Business library does not work correctly when trying to search with keywords inside the files. I have spreadsheets which have serial numbers (8 digits) and corresponding item/object (text). When I input
 the serial numbers in the OneDrive for Business search, I do not get any results. But then if I input the corresponding item name (text), it does give me the correct result. So my question is that why the search won't work when trying to search with the 8-digit
 serial numbers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Tenttu</p>

<p><span>We are not able to change this behavior in OneDrive for Business.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a workaround, you can enable enterprise keywords to the Document library and add serial numbers as the keywords. Then you can search the file via the keywords. To enable Enterprise keywords,
 refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-an-enterprise-keywords-column-to-a-list-or-library-314ce556-e4bf-4ef7-9939-6a1bedfc434a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Is it possible to have calendar reminder alerts working when Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is it possible to have calendar reminder alerts working when Outlook is closed</h2>
                    <p>Using Win 7 (64 bit) and Office Professional 2010 (32 bit)</p>
<p>A couple of times I have inadvertantly closed Outlook and then the Calendar reminders do not work. (They work when Outlook is opened again and tell me when it is too late.)</p>
<p>I have been looking for an option that allows the calendar reminders to continue working while Outlook is closed but can't find so thought I would ask the question.</p>
<p>In Vista I was able to operate a calendar separately to Outlook but unfortunately it appears that option has been removed in Win 7.</p>

            <p>In order for reminders to fire, SOMETHING has to be reading the Outlook database at the time they should appear.&nbsp; Thus you have to have a program running to do&nbsp;this.&nbsp; There are third-party utilities out there that can do the job, but to my mind you might
 just as well use Outlook minimised to the taskbar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said I use a program called Rainlendar which puts a small calendar, event list and to-do bar on the desktop of your PC.&nbsp; The paid-for version also reads your Outlook db and will fire the reminders. (The paid for
 version will also work across a home network without needing MS Exchange, which is my main use.)</p>

<h2>            Office365 and DKIM setup with - &#40; dash &#47; hyphen &#41; in domain name</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I am trying to set up DKIM for a company with a dash in the name.&nbsp; Let's say my domain name is samwise-gardens.com and my</p>
<p>initial domain name is <strong>&lt;removed by moderator for protecting your privacy&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the documentation, I would setup the CNAME as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>selector1._domainkey.samwise-gardens.com CNAME selector1-samwise-gardens-com._domainkey.frodo.onmicrosoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that will cause a problem as the "-" in samwise-gardens.com will be replaced to make samwise.gardens.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Every technique I found to solve this involved going into powershell on your Exchange server, which of course we don't have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally solved it when I realized the existing Office365 system used the same naming convention.&nbsp; I used "dig" (you could also us nslookup or a web-based tool) to look up the existing MX record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"samwise-gardens.com" had an MX pointing to samewisegardens-com02b.mail.protection.microsoft.com,</p>
<p>so the final CNAME is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>selector1._domainkey.samwisegardens.com </p>
<p>CNAME to</p>
<p>samewisegardens-com02b._domainkey.frodo.onmicrosoft.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am leaving this up in case someone else has a similar problem.</p>

<h2>            Cannot switch command prompt with Powershell on Win&#43;X menu</h2>
                    <p>I'm seeing this issue on two different computers, both running Win10 TP build 10122 (x64). &nbsp;One device is a custom PC, which was upgraded to 10122 from a clean install of 10074. &nbsp;The other is a Surface Pro 3 which was cleanly installed with build 10122.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option in Taskbar and Start Menu Properties to replace Command Prompt with Windows Powershell in the Win+X menu is not working. &nbsp;Without the option checked, Command Prompt appears in the menu as normal. &nbsp;However, once the option is activated, neither
 Command Prompt nor PowerShell appear in the menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made great use of this feature in older builds. &nbsp;Is there a way to restore it myself, or will it be looked at for a future build?</p>

<h2>            Email delivery problems to Hotmail</h2>
                    <p>I have just sent a newsletter that has been around for 12 years for the first time from a brand new IP address. All name server settings are correct and the IP address is totally clean, not blacklisted anywhere. The delivery rate for all other ISP's is close
 to 99% but Outlook / Hotmail has decided to give our IP a red flag for absulutely no reason. I tried to get more info and unblock the IP address via&nbsp;http://postmaster.live.com/snds/ but all that I got back was "IP address not qualified for unblocking" - without
 any reason given.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is truly annoying. Is there anything I can do?</p>

            Thanks. I did, for the second time now. After the first time I only got some general reply that didn't really go to the core of the problem, which is why a newsletter that has been sent in this format since many years now suddeny gets blocked by Outlook/Hotmail,
 after we have started sending from a new, absolutely clean dedicated IP address.

            Got the same standard reply again. Our new IP address gets 100% blocked by Outlook, so even if we make changes to our newsletters, how would that affect the blocking? Sorry, it makes no sense at all.

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been successfully using office 2016 for some time with no issue. The odd freeze and shut down but after opening it again all works fine.</p>
<p>Until yesterday. I view a newspaper webpage while working on an excel document, it caused everything to freeze and it forced the closure of excel. Since then, if I click on any microsoft office programme a get the error message stating that it unexpectedly
 closed and to click re-open to continue. Or I can click ok. When I ask it to open I get the same error message pops up.</p>
<p>Here is the detail of the error message, any help would be most welcome. By the way it is possible I updated my Mac Book air software the other day too. This is now operating using the OS X El Capitan version 10.11.4 and every think else works fine, it is
 just office I am having problems.</p>

    <title>Computer License Security ID - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bonnie_645  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer License Security ID</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I just received a call from a company stating that they are from Microsoft. They claimed that my Computer License Security ID has been hack and that it was compromising their systems. They directed me to do 'cmd' to verify the number. The number they read
 to me was correct. Then they had me do 'netstat' to see how many established hackers there were. After that they tried to direct me to a website that would link my computer with the Microsoft secured network so we stop the hackers. I felt very uncomfortable
 at that point and ended the call. My question is the following;</p>
<p>Is this a scam or is it real? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Hello Karlog,
<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />I would suggest to begin with IP address reputation check
<br />
<br />Probably your IP address is blacklisted by Microsoft. Please fill out the form in below link to try to get off from Microsoft's blacklist.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportrequestform/8ad563e3-288e-2a61-8122-3ba03d6b8d75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportrequ...</a>
<br />
<br />When submitting if you get an error that means there's too much info in one of the text fields. Correct that and then submit.
<br />
<br />Then wait for an answer.
<br />
<br />I also, recommend reading below article
<br /><a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/services.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a>

            Hi Karlog,
<br />
<br />thanks for the update. in that case best would be Microsoft support, which also you have already contacted them. 
<br />
<br />The only I can think off is the ISP address. Not sure how your IP routing is done. if, your ISP IP address doesnt' have a good repute with MS server, it could be also a problem. You can try below tool to check
<br />
<br />Microsoft Office365 DNS Check

            Hi Karlog,
<br />
<br />apologies for the delay in my response. can you try to add your mail address in the safe Sender list and try.
<br />
<br />A. Add the email address to your Safe senders list
<br />
<br />1. On your inbox, click the gear icon and select More mail settings on the dropdown list.
<br />
<br />2. Under Preventing junk email, click Safe and blocked senders.
<br />
<br />3. Click Safe Senders.
<br />
<br />4. In the text box, type in the email address or domain you’d like to always receive email from, and then click Add to list &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Parmi

<p>Hello Parmi</p>

</p><p>For some reason, I was unable to access this question for a few days, so I was unable to reply to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We cannot ask all of our customers to make their customers to add their domains to the safe sender lists, as it is a too difficult task for many of our sub-clients, as many of these are not the best to computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other ideas about how we solve the issue?<br />
</p>
<p>We have tested our reputation with a lot&nbsp;of sites by now, but we have not found any issues on domains or IP´s</p>

                    <p>I notice that Microsoft's new apps don't use Share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSN News won't let you share articles&nbsp;with Twitter, Mail or anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook doesn't list itself in the Share list at all, so there is no way in Spartan or Reading List, for example, to email things to friends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened!&nbsp; Is this feature being discontinued in Windows 10.&nbsp; It was and is what I liked about Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8.1.</p>
