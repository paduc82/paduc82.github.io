<h2>            Xbox One Wifi Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Having some issues that seem pretty uncommon, at least from my research. Been playing online via wifi on my 360 for a few months now problem free. I recently purchased an Xbox One, and when connected via wifi I am lagging in games (teleporting, player skipping
 forward, shots not registering etc).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When i run the "Detailed Network Stats", everything looks great; 6.5mb download, 1.5mb upload, 0% packet loss, 150ms ping (I live in Germany), and 100% signal strength. Now, the router and modem are in the next room, but I strung some long ethernet cords
 just to test and when hard wired to the router, there are no problems.</p>
<p>My NAT is open, ports are forwarded, and the console has a static IP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tested the wifi on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands with the same result. If I play the same game with the 360 (with the consoles right next to each other and on the same wifi network) the problem does not exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me, it seems like there is a problem with my Xbox One internal network card, but you would think it would show on the Detailed Network Stats no? I'm not sure what other tests to run at this point. The router is an Asus RT AC66U. I have also tested with
 a ISP provided modem/router combo (Speedport w724v) with the same issues, so it doesn't seem like a compatibility issue with my router.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;The problem with an internet connection is that if you're using the net on multiple devices it can degrade the quality of your connection. &nbsp;This happens more with a wifi connection.</p>
<p>If at all possible you should always try to use an ethernet cable when playing. &nbsp;If you cannot do this then you may need to look into getting slightly faster internet or a wireless booster to see if that helps.</p>

<p>I'm sorry but that is a terrible answer. Did you even read the post? Xbox 360 connected the same exact way, in the same spot, using the same game has no issues at all.
</p>
<p>There are no other devices using the wifi while I am doing these tests. </p>
<p>Obviously, connecting via an ethernet cable is the best method, however it is not possible as a long term solution for me.
</p>
<p>There is &nbsp;a problem with the wifi connection between my Xbox One and the router, and the issue is not showing itself on the "Detailed Network Stats" page.

            <p>You may consider it terrible but it is truthful non-the-less.</p>
<p>If you are having issues with your wifi and it is recent then try powercycling the modem/router. &nbsp;Beyond that, contacting technical support for your ISP or seeing about upgrading your service is the best answer to give.</p>

<p>Truthful? The part about using an "ethernet is better than wireless"? Yes, that is true. But it hardly does anything to resolve my problem nor does it help.
</p>
<p>I'm not trying to come across as arrogant, but it just seems like you aren't reading what I am writing. My internet speeds, although not the fastest in the world, are more than sufficient to play online and that is proven when I connect via an ethernet cable.
 Heck, it even works wonderful via wifi on my 360! So your comment about contacting my ISP is moot.
</p>
<p>Now, you mention wireless interference or other devices on the network. Would you agree, that if my bandwidth was being limited by interference or other devices, that it would show up on the Detailed Network Stats page as: decreased speeds and/or packet
 loss and/or loss in signal strength? All of which show up fine; same speeds wired and wireless with 0% packet loss and 100% signal strength.
</p>
<p>I have power cycled the modem and router. And I have tested it against a totally separate router with the same results.

<p>Reapr,</p>
<p>Even though you have 0% packet loss, 6.5mbps download and 1.5mbps upload. That 150ms ping is a little higher then what is considered good.</p>
<p>A good ping would be under 100ms. (I myself am running 38ms for ping)</p>
<p>In my opinion, I think the Xbox One uses more of your speed and connectivity then the 360. As it is always listening for inputs, motions, and all the background apps you can have open at once (with or without snapping an app)</p>
<p>I would look at your router configuration page, see what can be optimized in order to give your Xbox One more speed. Such as giving it priority over all other devices, and posibly changing your DNS servers to something more open that offers a better speed.
 Also a majority of routers have enabled 20/40 coexistance (good neighbor policy), so when your router detects a nearby wifi signal, it will lessen your speeds and signal distance in order to not interfere with theirs, I personally would uncheck that box, so
 you dont miss out on speeds just because of someone elses wifi.</p>
<p>Try switching from a Static IP to DHCP. (I personally would use Static, as you can control priorities easier)</p>
<p>I would not reccomend using long Ethernet cables, as the longer they are, the longer the data will actually take to reach your Xbox. (funny and as comical as that might seem, its true)</p>
<p>Hopefully something ive said has helped you, if not, I hope it was good reading material. Ill keep racking my brain to think of any other ideas in the meantime.</p>

<p>Ice DJKilla, thank you for the response. </p>
<p>For the latency/ping, I would tend to agree with you. However, from everything I've read, that test (Xbox Detailed Network Stats) pings a server in or near Seattle, and really has no bearing on actual latency to the servers of the specific multiplayer game
 being played. I have kind of proved that, with the fact I get the same ping whether I'm wired or wireless. The only difference being the wired connection doesn't have the lag I'm experiencing.
</p>
<p>With regards to the 20/40 and nearby networks...I have already used an app similar to InSSIDer to detect nearby networks and I've chosen a channel that is least congested on the 2.4ghz band. And I never see any 5ghz networks when using that app. And like
 mentioned, I've tested both 2.4 and 5 with the same results unfortunately. </p>
<p>I was curious as to whether the Xbox One DID in fact use more bandwidth, even with the same game being played on 360. That could possibly explain my problems, but it' seems like I would need to have really poor wifi connection/speed &nbsp;in order for it to bottleneck
 the actual internet speeds enough to see a difference in online play. As it is, I've tested with two different routers and had them as close as several feet away, which should ensure a strong connection, as seen in the settings. However, it did not make a
 difference. </p>

<p>There's definitely an issue with the wifi hardware. Mine just crapped out on me and like you I've only had the console for a week (Quantum Break bundle). I can't even use the wireless network on mine, it tells me to get it repaired -_-" . . .</p>

<p>Since I bought my console on Amazon, I already have a replacement from them on the way and i'll be returning this one. Amazons return/exchange policy seems to be pretty awesome. I was initially going to go through Microsoft, but after chatting online with
 a rep, they said an advanced exchange wasn't possible to an APO address. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Crossing my fingers that it is indeed a hardware failure and the new one will work correctly. Will update this post when it gets here.

            Have you tried reactivating by telephone?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;How to activate Windows 7 manually (activate by phone)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2) Next press the 'ENTER' key<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3) Select your 'Country' from the list.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4) Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5) Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
6) Explain your problem clearly to the support person.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950929/en-us <br />
<br />
Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to www.microsoft.com/piracy&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to www.microsoft.com/howtotell and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.<br />
<br />
To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.<br />
<br />
065, 066, 067, 068 for Ultimate, 220, 221 area for Pro and the 230, 231, 221, 232 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted<br />
<br />
About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys <br />
They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.<br />
<br />
In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along
 the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.<br />
<br />
Validate Now:<br />
You can confirm that your software is genuine now. It‚Äôs quick and easy.<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/<br />
<br />
Click the 'Validate Windows' button, if the validation check fails, then click on the 'Get Genuine' button to get a WGA Kit.

            Well, the maximum resolution for that card is 4096 x 2160, so it should handle that monitor . . .
<br />
<br />Open the AMD display software - usually accessibly by right clicking your Desktop
<br />
<br />Somewhere on the settings page in that app, you will be able to set a custom resolution to 3440 x 1440

We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file
<br />
sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy
<br />
them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there. (This is NOT<br />
likely to help a lot on a new build).<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump&nbsp; (Only AFTER you have performed<br />
all the initial suggestions at the top of this reply and IF the BSOD issues persist).
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files<br />

<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1<br />
<br />
</strong>Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my generic
<br />
bluescreen troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low level chipset drivers and <br />
antivirus/antispyway/security programs can also cause this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0xD1: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL <br />
<br />
</strong>The DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x000000D1. This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code</strong> </p>
<p><br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
<p><strong>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Parameters</strong> </p>
<p><br />
The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Cause</strong> </p>
<p><br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</p>
<p><br />
This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</p>
<p><br />
If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for the
 page fault include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><br />
To begin debugging, use a kernel debugger to get a stack trace.</p>
<p><br />
If the problem is caused by the driver that you are developing, make sure that the function that was executing at the time of the bug check is not marked as pageable or does not call any other inline functions that could be paged out.
<br />

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>OK, I researched the problem with Google and here is the solution. it seems as if an update changes the files for each of the folders under the the libraries folder so that you no longer see the picture icons for the folder but just plain folders. This seems
 to be the diagnostic. You then delete all four folders under libraries first (Documents, Music, Pictures, and Video) and then right hand click on libraries and select "restore default libraries". This brings back all four folders&nbsp;(Documents, Music, Pictures,
 and Video) and the icons now are graphic representations again. The camera now works again and all subfolders from these are also restored. I wished Microsoft would fix this issue with updates and not go about saying reboot etc when it was clearly an update
 issue.</p>

<h2>            Recently a net setter installation of &#34;Idea Net Setter&#34; was unsuccessful. Help&#38;Support and msconfig have been lost.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Product:MS XP HOME</p>
<ol>
<li>Recently a net setter installation of "Idea Net Setter" was attempted. The representative installed one and uninstallation was initiated for re-installing afresh with later version. But no sooner Windows prepared the "End Prpgram" window he ended the program
 for restart. Thereafter the installation to ColumnC(default) was denied with alert"Close the program first or confirm if the file is used by any other program. The Net Setter was therefore installed in another column.
</li><li>
<p>But it met with some clash and the dignostic features&nbsp; (1).Help&amp;Support&nbsp; (2).msconfig have been lost are lost from system. Plese assist how to&nbsp; restore?
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The Operating System, originally XP(HOME) SP2 was upgraded to SP3 and hence a reformating is a last resort</p>

            <p>Hi Mnbswamy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What exactly do you mean when you say "installation to ColumnC(default) was denied"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to perform system restore which will restore back the computer to the point when the "Idea Net Setter" was not installed. After system restore you may try installing
 "Idea Net Setter" and check.</p>

            <p>System restoration did not yield results. The problem remains.</p>
<p>Your Query:&nbsp; What exactly do you mean when you say "installation to ColumnC(default) was denied"?</p>
<p>Ansr: The installation by default selects C column for installing the application as in other cases. It was originally done successfully. Somehow, the Idea'&nbsp;staff who installed it ventured uninstall for installing another version. He in a haste clicked the
 "End Program" window before Windows could complete the procedure for saving the settings which I noticed. &nbsp;On restart Windows refuced to install showing a message" First close the files, check whether any other program is using the files."</p>
<p>My cotention: Windows is under the impression that the program is still on as procedure for uninstall was half way through. The program was however, uninstalled from the column C by clicking uninstall icon and what ever remains in the registry was also deleted
 before trying re-install. Thus &nbsp;It occurs to me that the misleading command prior to formal uninstall has to be located and erased. (Excuse me if I'm not correct)</p>
<p>Reformating is out of question due to upgraing the OS from SP2 to SP3. </p>
<p>Please enlighten further. </p>

            Hello mnbswamy,<br />
<br />
If possible could you make it all more clear by telling us what this "net setter" program was intended to offer to you when it was operating? An internet program should not remove any system files from your system. Check if this network company can also be
 liable for damage done to your system. This is unacceptable. You can get your programs back with a windows CD or perhaps windows still has a backup copy saved somewhere. How else is your system
<br />
malfunctioning? You said you would want to reformat as a last resort.<br />
<br />
If this is too difficult for you to complete on your own you can contact me at *** Email address is removed for privacy *** if you would like me to help you through remote support.<br />

<p>I found the following answer about how to turn auto-start for Skype ON in another discussion, and I'm trying the opposite (disabling) to make it stop autostarting. &nbsp;The autostart is a complete time-suck on startup for something I rarely use, and I don't
 need it running in the background either. &nbsp;I agree -- I'll launch it if I want it. &nbsp;Here's the instruction to get it to autostart - hope this works for both of us to make it stop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please make sure that&nbsp;Skype is enabled on the list of startup items for your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change which apps run at startup, press and hold (or right-click) the&nbsp;<span>Start</span>&nbsp;<span>Windows logo Start button</span>&nbsp;button, select&nbsp;<span>Task Manager</span>,&nbsp;and then select the&nbsp;<span>Startup&nbsp;</span>tab.
 Choose an app, then select&nbsp;<span>Enable</span>&nbsp;or<span>Disable</span>.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 950</h2>
                    <p>I bought a used Nokia Lumia 950 off of ebay so I could download and play those phone games which were delisted on older phone models. They install fine and play but when I earn achievements they don't show on my gamerscore. It has been a week since I earned
 an achievement in DoDonPachi but it won't stick to my card. Date and time on the phone are correct and sync options are on. Some games I can't start because it says I'm not connected to xbox live. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried to play Angry Birds Classic on the Nokia Lumia 950 to try and unlock the Seeing Red achievement for unlocking the Big Brother Bird but when I start the game it says "Sorry we can't sign you in. Please sign in at xbox.com, then start this app
 again.</p>

            I tried that numerous times with DoDonPachi and Fling. I would get an achievement, give it a few days to let it appear on my gamerscore but it doesn't show. Someone on TrueAchievements suggested a soft reset of the phone and that didn't work either.<br />

<p>Yea, using the same account that's on my Xbox 360 and One as well as on my old Nokia Lumia 1020.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just unlocked an achievement in Max and the Magic Marker called Fleetfooted on my Lumia 950 and that game is on the marketplace of my Lumia 1020. Not being a delisted game I think it should count to my gamerscore but it's not. I think it's the phone itself,
 not the games.</p>

            It is so weird your situation, but remember those phones and specifically Windows Phone/Mobile are vanishing so it could be a server error. Noy syncing because of this.

<h2>            Acer Aspire BSOD - SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED - Qcamain10x64.sys</h2>
                    <div>Hi, I've been having an issue with my computer (Acer Aspire R5-471T) bluescreening randomly; sometimes I'm not even at the computer, with nothing running, and the wifi driver will still crash and result in a bluescreen with stopcode&nbsp; SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED
 with what failed always being Qcamain10x64.sys.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's honestly been doing this since I got my computer, but only on specific wifi networks (I don't understand that at all) but now it's become an almost constant series of bluescreening; and even then, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. However,
 now it's gotten overbearing to the point that I can't get any work done, and as a full-time student with a part-time job, I need my laptop to do just about everything and this has to stop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>I've tried updating the driver, but I can't get it to update even manually because I get a pop-up telling me that it's detected that I've got the most current driver and won't let me update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through every fix-it forum on the site it seems, but I cannot get this to stop.</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can always force this error by manually disabling the wifi driver, same thread exception error and same driver that failed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If needed, <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArLzzi86kxgIhFQFxs-auWEmbTkK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this is a zip folder with (some of) my most recent minidumps on it.</a> Conveniently, they all occurred while I was attempting to write this question, so the sooner this can be fixed the better. It's taken me two hours to even get this to send, and that's not
 an uncommon occurrence anymore.<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for any help you can provide!<br />

            Hi Reoch
<br />
<br />Qcamain10x64.sys indicates an issue with your Qualcomm WiFI device driver that is causing your system crashes
<br />
<br />You should go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the version of that driver they recommend . . .

            I've tried, but I can't download the newest version- or, I can download it, but I can't update the driver I have installed because I get a pop-up saying that "windows has detected the best driver for this device is already installed", as I said above.
 I'm not sure if there's a way around that, but nothing I've tried has worked.

<br />Date: 27-Oct-2016
<br />
<br />Recommendations
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />2. Qualcomm Atheros Network Driver has a date of 27-Oct-2016 indicating that it is very old. Try to update this from your computer manufacturer's website.
<br />
<br />If you face problem, let me know your computer's make and model.

<p>I've tried to reinstall the driver, but every time I try either windows update stops me with a "windows has detected you are already using the most updated driver" or, if I go through the available drivers and choose one to install, my laptop crashes with
 the same bluescreen; thread exception not handled, qcamain failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking on the <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/AE/content/support-product/6397?b=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Acer website</a>, the drivers shown there are from 2015, even further back than mine, so I'm not sure what to do or if there's somewhere else I should look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, curiously, none of the listed drivers are for the QCA61x4A card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is an Acer Aspire R5-471T.</p>

            You can try to update from here- Download Killer Software Package - for Windows 10 1803+ (They are manufacturer of Atheros drivers)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.killernetworking.com/killersupport/driver-downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.killernetworking.com/killersupport/...</a>
<br />
<br />Most important thing - Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />

            Hi,
<br />If reinstalling drivers hasn't helped, there is a quite possibility of the Wifi adapter being damaged and requires replacement.
<br />Also, did you ask Asus if there is a known issue something to it?

<p>I'm pretty sure this model of laptop doesn't allow for replacing parts; I know the RAM and the battery can't be moved or replaced, but I can't find anything about changing the wifi card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that there's a lot of known issues for this wifi card, across lots of different manufacturers, but I haven't contacted Acer support about it; it hadn't honestly crossed my mind to, but it's probably worth a shot if I can't get an answer here.</p>

<h3> sirius raigo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto clicker problem</h2>
                    <p>So it's a small problem with the auto-clicker, doesn't matter which, tried 3 versions, all have the same problem. So when i open the auto-clicker, even if the auto-click is off, it keeps clicking....i mean, it's like a hidden auto-click and only affects
 when i'm writting and it's interrupted after few seconds, if i'm in a game and it's like an auto alt+tab, the game goes in taskbar, or when i'm on google for example, the bar is grey, when i'm clicking anywhere inside google, but after that it turns blue after
 few seconds, like it's clicking on taskbar.</p>
<p>It's exactly when i use the hotkey to enable and disable the auto-click, it's like a hidden auto-click, but it doesn't opens anything, it's like a hidden auto click to the taskbar or something like that.</p>
<p>This problem didn't occurred few days ago, only started recently.</p>
<p>I must say that i unplugged the keyboard, uninstalled the driver, then plugged back in, no change. And no viruses. Any solution to fix this problem with the auto-clicker program?</p>

    <title>DVD&#47;CD Optical Drive issue in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlesmickler  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD&#47;CD Optical Drive issue in Windows 10</h2>
                    Up until recently (just noticed it today) my optical drive worked fine; now it doesn't show up anywhere in any location on my PC. It isn't shown in File Explorer, Devices and Networks, or Device Manager. All my other drives appear under This PC in File
 Explorer, but the DVD/CD drive doesn't. Again all other physical hardware in or attached to my computer is there in Devices and Device Manager. When I attempted to reinstall the driver software/firmware from the manufacturer, it couldn't find the DVD/CD either.
 I have scoured the Microsoft forums and other forums and found no solution that will restore the drive to use. I can't locate the drive or its associated programs to remove/reinstall it, All the online repair suggestions are useless as they depend on being
 able to at least locate something related to the DVD/CD to work from and I can find nothing.

            When I clicked show hidden devices the DVD showed up, but the Properties panel shows the device as disconnected from the computer and it shows a code 45. Nothing has been done that could have disconnected the device. It is a built in type unit, slot feed
 type. And I can't insert a CD into it nor does the eject function button at the top of my keypad do anything. The light for the touch button lights and my cursor freezes for a minute then the light goes out and the cursor resumes normal operation. There is
 no ejection noise as there usually is.

                    Please advise how I can disable the function which allows a person to remotley access my computer. A trusted person in the family altered my settings which allowes them to now control my computer. I have a back up and want to get rid of the hacking situation.
 Please help if you can. Thanks.

<p>The only "function" that allows a remote user to change anything on your computer without your say so is a complete lack of computer security.</p>
<p>And what makes you think that someone is "controlling" your computer?</p>
<p>You need to firstly create an Admin account (call it "Admin" or something similar) with a STRONG password, then change your User to a Standard user with&nbsp;a STRONG password, and disable the Guest account if you mistakenly enabled it.</p>
<p>That should deter casual "hackers".</p>

<p>If it is hacker case then he or she probably put some Remote Access Trojan in your PC. If it is from Wireless try to put strong Encryption feature in Wireless and put Strong Password on router see User's Guide of Wireless Router for help.</p>
<p>Then run update and full scan with your Anti-Virus.</p>

<h2>            Windows Store has stopped working</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 Professional and it is up to date as of 3/15/2017. For some reason Windows Store has stopped working and gives me error code 0x800705AA. I have downloaded and ran the latest version of the App Store Trouble Shooter. I also tried
 using Wsreset.exe to reset the cache. Neither of these fixed the problem. I can no longer download or purchase from the Windows Store. Is Microsoft going to send out a patch to fix this?

            <p>Hello Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When exactly did the issue start? Were there any changes made on your system prior to the issue?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue usually happens because of corrupted Windows Update files. To help you resolve the issue, we recommend
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">restoring your PC</a></strong> to a previous system restore point. Also, please make sure that the system date and time is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the results.</p>

            The date and time are correct. I also tried resetting to a restore point and this did not fix the error. Windows Store tries to reinstall the app, but the installation fails. I believe Microsoft needs to provide a patch or an updated version of Windows
 Store and push it out with the regular updates.

<h2>            Connecting to a low resolution projector</h2>
                    <p>Tried and failed in my first attempt&nbsp;to use my Surface RT for a PPT presentation - using a client's projector. The Micro&nbsp;HDMI adapter cable was needed to physically connect and the Surface made that connecting bing for a new device, but no image was projected.
 I tried using the various Extend, Duplicate options but they made no difference. Ended up having to use the client's laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have the brand or resolution spec's of that projector, but it is an older machine and I'm fairly sure the issue is one of non-compatibility with low resolution projectors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a work around? </p>

<p>I also get a DCOM error on every bootup but have been advised I can safely ignore it.&nbsp; The two errors reported above, however, are new but, so far, seem not to cause any performance issues.</p>

<p><span><span>I use Microsoft Security Essentials with Malwarebytes free as a support scanner. To remove unwanted parasites I use ADWCleaner on a when necessary basis. I can only remember one serious
 malware incident in recent years, which I quickly resolved. Superantispyware does not conflict but my experience<span>&nbsp;
</span>is that it finds little of consequence. It is not on this computer but I still have it on my laptop. Emisoft duplicates Malwarebytes so why bother with it?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select ‚ÄúCommand Prompt (Admin)‚Äù from the menu.
<br />
<br />2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver
<br />
<br />3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />
<br />4. Now, let‚Äôs restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Typethe following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                        net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />                        net start cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                        net start bits
<br />
<br />                        net start msiserver
<br />
<br />5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it and then restart the computer. 
<br />

    <title>Not able to print from Guest account. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Not able to print from Guest account.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Homegroup problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Dell computer running Windows 7 and I joined our family homegroup. Problem is when I try to print from the Guest User account it will not print to the printer. It only goes to .xps file option. I turned on file sharing and all suggested troubleshooter
 fixes. Now it tells me this computer cannot connect to the Homegroup, yet the administrator user account is fully connected and can even print to the printer. Why can't a guest account do the same thing. I prefer the family to use the guest account so they
 can't make changes to the computer without checking with me first. Does that have to change?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum. As per the description you have an issue with printing from a guest account through Homegroup, please be assured that we will do our best to assist you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to add everyone in the security tab and grant the permissions to have full control as well and check if it helps. To do this, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><em><b><span>Note:</span></b></em><em><span> You should be logged on as an Administrator to take ownership of files/folders.</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u><span>Step 1:</span></u></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1.</span></strong><span> Locate the file or folder on which you want to take ownership in windows explorer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>2.</span></strong><span> Right click on file or folder and select‚Äú<strong>Properties</strong>‚Äù from Context Menu.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>3.</span></strong><span> Click onSecurity<strong> </strong>tab<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>4.</span></strong><span> Click on‚Äú<strong>Advanced</strong>‚Äù<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>5.</span></strong><span> Now click on ‚Äú<strong>Owner tab in Advance Security Settings</strong>‚Äù for User windows</span></p>
<p><strong><span>6.</span></strong><span> Click on ‚Äú<strong>Edit Button and select user</strong>‚Äù from given Change Owner to list if user or group is not in given list then click on other users or groups. Enter name of user/group as ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äù and click ok.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>8.</span></strong><span> Now select ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äù User/group and click apply and ok. (Check ‚ÄúReplace owner on subcontainers and objects‚Äù if you have files and folder within selected folder)</span></p>
<p><strong><span>9.</span></strong><span> Click ok when Windows Security Prompt is displayed</span></p>
<p><strong><span>10.</span></strong><span> Now Owner name must have changed.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>11.</span></strong><span> Now click Ok to exit from Properties windows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u><span>Step 2:</span></u></strong></p>
<p><span>Once you havetaken the ownership of file or folder next part comes isGranting Permissions to that file/folder or object.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to Grant Permissions in Windows 7:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1.</span></strong><span> Locate the file or folder on which you want to take ownership in windows explorer</span></p>

<h2>            Can ping but not browse</h2>
                    Recently installed Windows 10. Since then have been unable to connect to internet using any browser. Tried in safe mode - same problem. Can ping router and external addresses no problem so wireless and wired connections are ok. Briefly resolved problem
 by disabling Windows firewall. However, enabled it and problem returned. Disabled it, restarted and problem remained - strange.

            <p>Hello Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your patience on this issue. I would like to assist you with further information from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that the Windows Firewall is blocking the browsers from accessing the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check in the list of allowed programs if the browsers (including Microsoft Edge) are included. Follow the below steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Right Click on the Start Menu and select Control Panel.</li><li>Choose Windows firewall.</li><li>Select the option <strong>Allow an app or feature through windows Firewall</strong> in the left navigation panel<strong>.</strong></li><li>Further on, you can uncheck the browser applications which you think are blocked by the Windows Firewall.</li></ul>
<p>Hope the above information is helpful. If you need further information, feel free to write to us and we would be happy to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            I need a download link to x16-93703</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have a nasty malware infection which has slowed my ASUS Zenbook to a crawl. Unfortunately the upgrade from 7HP to Win 8 wiped my recovery partition.</p>
<p>I have a valid licence for 7 and 8, bt would like to go back to Win 7. I cannot however find a link anywhere to X16-97303. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>
