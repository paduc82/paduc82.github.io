<h2>            Control Hyperlink of powerpoint using visual basic code</h2>
                    <p>I am developing add-In for power point I can add action button manually and set that button on mouse click it should navigate to hyperlink slide.</p>
<p>This is easily done through power point but My Add-In does not do. I need to handle action button / hyperlink object event to catch on mouse click when it is fired on that action button it should do same as power power point does could you please suggest
 how it can happen through code.<br />
Note : Action Button and Hyperlink is added manually and need slide change on presentation view when click on that object&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Taxonomy ID changed on Term Store - Sharepoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spiketj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taxonomy ID changed on Term Store - Sharepoint</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have this issue with my sharepoint app.</p>
<p>
I have a custom form application,&nbsp; it loads the data from the<strong> term store</strong>.&nbsp;The application was running for awhile, but it stopped suddenly.
</p><p>
</p><p>In the form (Custom App), I have a multiple drop-list, like this example: <strong>
Country</strong>, this drop-list shows the all countries that I have on the term store.</p>
<p>
I decided to check in the settings of the term store and found that the taxonomy identification is different than the one defined in the app.
</p><p>
</p><p>My questions:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;The taxonomy (Taxonomy_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) that we have in the Term Store Management Tool change periodically?
<ul>
<li>If the answer is yes:
<ul>
<li>Why?</li><li>Do I have to put the new taxonomy in my customize App?</li><li>Can I roll back and put again my old taxonomy code in the Term Store Management Tool?</li></ul>
</li><li>If the answer is no:
<ul>
<li>The taxonomy is not my problem.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Eliminating background and preserving other attributes when pasting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> honest abe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Eliminating background and preserving other attributes when pasting text</h2>
                    <p>A well documented problem in many applications (including Word,&nbsp;Internet Explorer, Webpage editors, etcetera)&nbsp;is that of an&nbsp;<strong><em>unwanted background color behind pasted text</em></strong> that carries over from the source.&nbsp; The integral background
 appears similar to text highlighting only it&nbsp;cannot be eliminated by adjusting&nbsp;highlighting, shadowing, paragraph fill, page background, or any other special affect Word or most other&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong>:&nbsp; When the text is pasted as text, without formatting, it not only removes the unwanted background, but also all bolding, underlining, italics, or other text attributes that one might want to preserve.&nbsp; This can be an enormous
 problem, especially&nbsp;if the source text is voluminous and has a lot of intricate formatting.&nbsp; We often face this when moving text we have&nbsp;authored for website pages with a background.
</p>
<p><strong>THE INADEQUATE SOLUTION</strong>: The internet is replete with suggestions for addressing this problem, but they all have the same drawback in common. Most suggestions center around copying and re-pasting the text as text only (without formatting)
 or by copying and pasting the problem text into NotePad first (in order to strip all the format codes) before copying it back to the destination. Unfortunately, these work-arounds all strip the desirable attributes along with the undesirable attributes.</p>
<p><strong>THE QUESTION</strong>:&nbsp; Is there any known method&nbsp;for pasting text into Word with all the text attributes (bold, italic, underline, text color, shadow, etcetera) intact, but without the unwanted background?&nbsp; Similarly, is the a way to locate and
 remove the unwanted codes from within Word?</p>
<p>In our opinion, it was a very poor design choice&nbsp;to allow users to cut and paste text with attributes that cannot be&nbsp;accessed and deleted, or modified, without also deleting every other selectable attribute.&nbsp; These are the pesky little problems that drive
 users crazy and alienate them from applications.&nbsp; We see absolutely no reason to prevent&nbsp;users from being able to delete any and every&nbsp;individual embedded formatting attribute!</p>

    <title>Microsoft Excel Focus Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eprice_802  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Excel Focus Issue</h2>
                    Since I have been upgraded to Office 2013, I have had issues where I have one file open in excel, and then try and open another file or files and when I try and do any work in the second, third, etc. file, it will not let me and upon clicking anything
 in those sheets, takes me back to the first file. The only way I have found to somewhat allow work to happen is to move the later opened files to my second screen, but it still takes the focus back to the original file, so I have to click on the later files
 multiple times to be able to do the simplest of tasks or it ends up doing the work on the original file. Very annoying as the only way to really get work done is shut the original file and open it again, and hope it doesn't do the same thing over again. This
 happens at minimum once per day, and mostly several times a day. Any ideas to fix?

            1. Please try to repair your Office as a quick fix.<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx<br />
<br />
2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
3. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.<br />
<br />
4. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
6. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
7. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
8. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
9. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
10. File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options

<h3> ly l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bullets and Numbering in Word 2016 - No combined dialog box&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have recently discovered that that the Alt O,N keyboard shortcut does not work in Word 2016 and, even worse, causes Word 2016 to freeze up whenever I type it. Attempts to set a keyboard shortcut for a command referred to as "FormatBulletsAndNunbering"
 causes Word 2016 to crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, it appears that there is no longer the option of a combined dialog box allowing for selection of list libraries across bullets, numbering and outline numbering. Also, once a new multilevel list has been defined there appears to be no way to modify
 it or customize it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For a heavy user of keyboard shortcuts and outline numbering, this is a particularly glaring omission/mistake. Has anyone figured out a workaround for any of these issues?</p>

<h2>            Windows Phone performance</h2>
                    <p>i upgraded my Nokia Lumia 520 to Windows 8.1 just two days ago. Yesterday, I was changing the memory card on my phone, but when i tried to switch it on, it didn't work. Today, around an hour ago, it switched itself on, then after like 30 seconds, back off.
 Its been doing that for around 30 minutes now until I removed the battery. Is it possible that the Windows 8.1 OS is adjusting??? Please help.</p>

            This is not normal so try a hard reset (Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone). If that won't help; contact your local Nokia Care center.

<p>
</p><p>Yes, my account has migrated to Outlook.comNo, haven't checked with anything other than Firefox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, those emails I sent to myself did finally appear in my inbox about 5hrs later.
</p>
<p>A couple of testers I did later showed up about 2hrs after I sent them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When I try it right now, it seems to be fixed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Perhaps just a quirk yesterday?&nbsp; </p>

<br />
<br />Toggle off Chat notifications
<br />
<br />If that does not work, downgrade to Skype Classic.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<h2>            E-mails No Being Received from Specific Sender &#40;Twitch notifications&#41;</h2>
                    Since this past Sunday, I noticed an unusual occurrence, that my Twitch alert notification e-mails aren't coming through to my inbox. &nbsp;They're already in my safe senders options, not being sent to the junk folder, I have no idea what's going on. &nbsp;I already
 contacted them about the same issue, to which I usually receive a support ticket e-mail in return, and I didn't even receive that! &nbsp;I haven't changed anything in my settings. &nbsp;Don't know if this matters, I use Google Chrome, WIndows 10 on a Surface Pro 3,
 though my browsers on other devices are bring back the same result. &nbsp;What's going o here? &nbsp;What am I supposed to do?! &nbsp;Please leave a reply back with any helpful information as soon as possible! &nbsp;Thank you.

            I kind of figured out what it was yesterday, apparently it wasn't Outlook because I havent changed any of my settings at all, no rules set. &nbsp;At 1st because I had an unusual shortage of mail on both Outlook and GMail on Sunday that something **** off there
 or my Google Chrome, but it didn't matter across my devices. &nbsp;Turned out on Twitch my notifications settings were somehow checked off without my knowing, not to receive e-mails, but not my individual stream notifications, and it's not the 1s time it's happened,
 either. &nbsp;It's like it just happened automatically for whatever apparent reason which is beyond me, and didn't appear to be an acct security issue. &nbsp;I really have no clue why it happened. &nbsp;So that said, I guess I'm kind of done on this topic, no clue how to
 delete it.

If you do a Google search you will find where lot of people have installed the Win10 home 32bit, and most have had problems with missing drivers, also the screen resolution is just below the min for Win10, and the CPU speed is slow, if it works with Win7 starter
 I would not try Win10.&nbsp;

            Thanks for the info<br />
<br />
have you tried the troubleshooting steps in the following Microsoft guide for the OneDrive mobile app?<br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-onedrive-mobile-app-problems-a06710d4-fc32-4eec-a7b5-6d9584fb930c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubl...</a><br />
<br />
<br />
If that fails to resolve it please try to uninstall and reinstall the OneDrive mobile app as follows<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Open Settings.<br />
2. Select Applications.<br />
3. Tap Manage Applications.<br />
4. Find and tap OneDrive.<br />
5. Tap Force Stop and then tap Clear data and tap Clear cache.<br />
6. Tap uninstall.<br />
<br />
Reinstall the app from Google Play.<br />

I hope this helps. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance. I am happy to help in any way I can.

    <title>Excel 2013 Autofill Formula won&#39;t fill properly when dragged down. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blobes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 Autofill Formula won&#39;t fill properly when dragged down.</h2>
                    I have a list of numbers in a column with a simple formula (ie. =400/2) in the top column that I want to apply to the numbers below it. &nbsp;When I drag the cell down it will copy the number but the formula won't apply to the cells below it. I also tried selecting
 'fill formatting' and that didn't work either. &nbsp;Then I reinstalled the program, contacted Microsoft support and did multiple google searches.. No luck... &nbsp;This is one of the most bizarre and annoying problems I've ever had with an Office product... Any help
 would be greatly appreciated.

            Hey mate,<br />
<br />
I actually use the barcode scanner all the time - It's quite useful, especially if you're searching for new programs on the internet that you want to download onto your phone.<br />
Instead of downloading it onto your computer, I copy the weblink for the program .sis or .sisx file, generate a semacode using
<a href="http://invx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://invx.com/</a> and then I can use the barcode reader to read the web address, browse, download and install.<br />
<br />
Quick, easy way to install programs onto your phone without having to type in links on keypad :)<br />
<br />
Hope this gives you a bit of insight into what to do with the barcode scanner ;)<br />
<br />
Have a good one mate!

Actually, calling it a "barcode" reader is a bit of a misnomer because it doesn't actually read "bar" codes, but 2D graphics codes such as this:<br />

The way to use it (on an N95 at least) is menu &gt; office &gt; barcode

            I couldn't resist no!! Thanks for that. That's the first time it's ever worked! I updated the firmware yesterday (albeit only to V12.xx, T-mobile Pah!) I wonder if it works on others from now on. I'll have to find some more!<br />

            It requires a bit of patience to get this thing working. Barcode with more than 13 digits becomes a bit more difficult as we have read them in parts :D

            You need to change the <i>xlAutomatic</i>&nbsp;constant to&nbsp;<i>xlColorIndexNone</i> to avoid the

<br />
Also, it you are going to .<i>Select</i>&nbsp;the worksheet, you can simply use,<br />
<br />
ActiveSheet.Tab.ColorIndex = xlColorIndexNone<br />
<br />
... instead of the <i>With ... End With</i>&nbsp;statement. Only the <i>ColorIndex</i>&nbsp;property needs to be changed.<br />

<h2>            Resolving conflicts between Pc &#38; 8525 using ActiveSync</h2>
                    Hi<br />
I am a new 8525 user &amp; have been synching the device with my PC &amp; noticed that there are only 2 options to resolving conflicts - either "replace items on device" Or "replace items on desktop". That doesn't seem to work too well for me. I have 1 PC &amp; 2 8525
 devices (me &amp; my wife) &amp; I would like to keep everything up-to-date on all 3 (does not include e-mail). I have Outlook XP on my PC &amp; ActiveSync 4.2 (the one that came on the 8525 cd). I would like to have the same address book on all 3 (PC &amp; 2 devices). I
 am especially having problems with keeping contacts in sync. Adding a new contact seems to work fine; but changes to existing contacts is the issue. e.g. here's a scenario -&nbsp; I make a change to Contact A on my 8525 &amp; my wife updates Contact B on her 8525 &amp;
 then I sync our devices with the PC. In this case if "replace items on Device" is the option selected in ActiveSync; then it will override both our updates. If "replace items on desktop" is selected then depending on which device is synched first; one of the
 contacts will be out-of-date on the PC &amp; 1 device. Ideally the option I am looking for is "replace the older item with the newer item on either the PC or Device" based on date the contact was edited/updated. Is there a way to do this? Thanks in advance.
<br />

<p>I understand the situation (and I have experienced it).&nbsp; I currently try to keep seversl devices in sync along with 3 PCs ... a task in itself.&nbsp; What I did was to make sure the PC was up to date, I then did a factory reset on my devices, deleted the partnerships
 and then re-established the partnerships so both devices were now "fresh" with the information that on the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have it set so the PC takes precedence if there is a conflict and so far all has been working (for quite sometime).&nbsp; I'm not sure if there is an absolute solution when you sync multiple devices.&nbsp; I will tell you that I have had a couple on instances where
 a contact will be repeated.&nbsp; I'm not sure why that has happened because there were NO changes made.&nbsp; Because it happened a couple of times, I have re-created that repeated contact and deleted the older ones on both devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what worked for me, I hope it might offer a possible solution for you.&nbsp; I will try to see if there is a solution for this situation in the MS knowledge base.</p>

            You mentioned that you have two similar devices, so I thought I would ask whether your devices have similar IDs. Do they show up in Activesync with the same name?

<h2>            What Happened to my all my Office programs&#63;</h2>
                    <p>WHERE DO I GET HELP? I updated&nbsp;to Windows 10 on my desktop from WIN8 because my new laptop has WIN10 installed and&nbsp;I became comfortable&nbsp;using it&nbsp;. Both computers had Office 365 Installed. When I went to install the free Windows OneNote program on my desktop
 computer after reading the comparisons between it and EverNote, which sounded good to me, 1TB of cloud storage accessible from all my devices, smart phone, laptop etc., I downloaded it. The download instructions&nbsp;were to delete Office 365&nbsp;for Office 16 which
 is required. I did and now I have OneNote and&nbsp;none of&nbsp;my office programs or files&nbsp;including Outlook, Word, Excel, Publisher, etc.&nbsp;It says my Office 16 is up&nbsp;to date, yet when I go to WIN Apps programs, all I get is OneNote 2016&nbsp;a bunch of NEW things I have
 no interest in, e.g. MAIL&nbsp;, CALENDAR, CAMERA&nbsp;etc, and no Office 16 programs or saved documents in their original formats, only the pdf or jpeg versions&nbsp;I am at a loss as to how to deal with&nbsp;this loss. I am about ready to throw in the towel and go off the grid
 or trash everything Microsoft, bite the bullet, and go to Apple if I have to dig my way out this fine mess I'm in. At least Apple has local classes to attend to learn and become proficient.

    <title>Pivot Table slicers&#58; How do I print the built-in indicators&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot Table slicers&#58; How do I print the built-in indicators&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use a large pivot table to report out consolidated, ad-hoc reports to multiple users.&nbsp; I utilize simultaneously several slicers to refine the reports.&nbsp; The built-in functionality of Excel indicates when a filter is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">applied
 by the slicer</span>.&nbsp; The indicator shows in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
color</span> an allows the user to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">clear the filter of that slicer</span> with a single click.&nbsp; In the screenshot below, I point out two indicators where filters are applied and one where the filter is not applied:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b07135d-f495-426f-ad56-6e6139ca4f2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b07135d-f495-426f-ad56-6e6139ca4f2e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I print, the indicators&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">do not show.</span>&nbsp; Below is a screenshot from&nbsp;a
<em>*.pdf</em> print of the same worksheet.&nbsp; There is no indicator showing:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f9984f-a18b-4ca3-a6dd-35c16e1d10ae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f9984f-a18b-4ca3-a6dd-35c16e1d10ae" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The print version of the worksheet looks clean without the indicator. would like tohave the optionto
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">include the indicator on the slicer</span>&nbsp;when the document prints.&nbsp; That way, I can tell at a glance which of the multiple slicers have a filter applied - and which slicers are&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">reacting</span>
 to that applied filter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Slicers in PivotTables are remarkable tools.&nbsp; Having the option to include the indicators on print-to-pdf will increase the future usability of these ad-hoc reports across my management team.</p>
<p>

            Unfortunately, there is no option to include the indicator for the filter in the print out. However, it does show which filter is selected by the color of the buttons in each slicer. However, it seems that doesn't fit your requirements.
<br />
<br />As an option, I'd suggest you submit your request to the Excel developer team and see if they will include it in an update to Office.

    <title>Downloading Chat History - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Downloading Chat History</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to get my chat history through December 2017 so that I can put it in a word doc (my friend and I use Skype as a writing platform and we are trying to save everything that we have written). Skype froze up while I was scrolling and the not-so-helpful
 technical support guy said to re-install Skype but now it only lets me go through last Saturday. All of the old data is stored in files I can't access here: App Data &gt; Roaming &gt; Skype &gt; Username but I have no idea how to access it to pull up chat history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please please please tell me there is a way to recover the data (since it was never deleted) so that we don't lose four months of our chat</p>

<h2>            Groove Music Web Player Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting some really bad issues with Groove Music Web Player from months now. Being a Groove Music Pass user for a year now and there wasn't a single time Web Player worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep &nbsp;getting "Sorry, We can't play right now. Please try again soon." error while trying to listen any of my subscription albuns. My own OneDrive music plays just fine and so every album I have on my Pass subscription using Groove app. Here is the error
 message screenshot:&nbsp;https://1drv.ms/i/s!ArXRM0aF4scajcJaukKZOZSbHd2XZw</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter which network I am connected to (Home, Work, HotSpot) and no matter which browser I use (Chrome, IE, EDGE, Firefox, Opera) it shows the same error, every single time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's clear to me that this is related to DRM files but MS doesn't seem to be able to help me so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be because I'm outside of US? Web Player work only in US?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone experiecing the same issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I am having same issues. Refresing page with f5 doesn't help. Refreshing fully with shift + f5 doesn't help. Switching browser might help. Or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried chrome, firefox and IE (Win7), all have exactly the same issue. I am not offline, and service seems to work sometimes by switching web browser.</p>

            <p>Are you trying to access Groove Web Player from a monitored network (for example, from your office, school, etc)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that when you try to play any of your Music Pass&nbsp;content from "microsoft.music.com" the request to actually get the file is sent to the old xbox music style url (remember that Groove Music was called xbox music). And taht is causing some issue
 within those networks that disallow gaming-style urls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just my guess, but makes sense for me because despite those issues I can play any music that is stored on OneDrive (request sent to onedrive instead of xbox music).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANyway, I don't think we will see any solution anytime soon as Groove Music is not one of MS top priorities.</p>

            <p>Network connection is probably monitored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got the same issue today and also songs from Onedrive couldn't be played. Refreshing playlists and collection also failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I switched browser and everything worked just fine. If I remember correcly, similar issues were there earlier also, and Onedrive music couldn't be played either when the issues appear.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'd also suggest adding a RepairDate Date/Time field rather than separate Mth and Yr fields; a Date/Time field will sort chronologically, while your Mth field will sort Apr - Aug - Dec; and the date/time field can be more easily used for date range queries.
 It's easy to extract month and year from the date for reporting purposes.</p>

            <p>Thanks. &nbsp;I am using the design screens instead of the SQL screens when building the query. &nbsp;I loaded your SQl and it worked. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also removing the mth and yr and using dates instead. &nbsp;The data feed I am using for the tables does not contain a date, but I can add that pretty easily.</p>

            The cost data can and does have credits applied sometimes. &nbsp;They are out of period with the debit. &nbsp; The cost is repair cost so one period, the repair was made and charged, then later a credit applied.

            I think credits need to be applied to the actual period for accuracy.
