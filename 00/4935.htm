    <title>Office 16, 32-bit on Windows 10 - Advanced Find returns no results - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anonymous11847  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 16, 32-bit on Windows 10 - Advanced Find returns no results</h2>
                    <p>I reported this to my internal help desk but have reached a dead-end with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I noticed that Advanced Find (all mailboxes) suddenly stopped returning any results, for me.&nbsp; (I am updated to the most current update.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I noticed that, when viewing an email, if I selected "Find related items ... in this conversation," I&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">always</span> had to tell the search to go to the server (we're Office 365 Pro Plus, here, but I use Outlook
 2016 because I prefer the front-end) and then viewing the results would be REALLY slow.&nbsp; To open a message from the returned list would take forever, to close and open another would take forever, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have rebuilt my search index.&nbsp; I have stopped and restarted the Windows Search service.&nbsp; I have TRIED to move my search index folder, but that didn't seem to work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started Outlook in "safe" mode, and Advanced Find works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I started Outlook in "regular" mode and UNCHECKED all my add-ins.&nbsp; The problem returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed some add-ins that my policy allowed me to remove, RENAMED the "Microsoft Access Outlook Add-In for Data Collection and sharing" (a recent install, that I have NO IDEA where it came from) so that it wouldn't run, restarted in regular mode and still
 have the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else does Safe mode do that disabling all my add-ins <em>doesn't</em> do ?&nbsp; I
<strong>rely</strong> on my searching.&nbsp; Need it desperately.</p>

            It's not the addins  (the Access one is used with Access... if you don't integrate with Access, you can leave it unchecked, but you probably should rename it back to the original, to avoid error messages. The only addin that needs to be checked is the Microsoft Exchange addin.)

<br />What is your build/version number &amp; name? There have been issues off and on with search. They were fixed by Feb update for subscribers (in Monthly Channel Version 1712 (Build 8827.2179)) but could be affecting older builds.

    <title>Powerpoint animations&#47; triggers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Powerpoint animations&#47; triggers</h2>
                    <p>Hello all! </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm trying to do something overly clever with powerpoint animations. I've worked out the first part that I need to do it's just the second.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially what I'm trying to do is have a character appear on the next screen depending on what's selected on the first. Does anyone know how to do this? Google has failed me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have character A and Character B on the screen. </p>
<p>
</p><p>User selects character A to be their "training guide" </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then need character A to move onto the next slide and others moving forward without having to layer onto the first slide</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this makes sense! </p>
<p>
</p><p>any help would be much appreciated. </p>

            I'm sorry. The only way I can think of doing this would be with vba or ActiveX controls that are beyond my capability. There is no method built into PowerPoint for this that I know of.
<br />
<br />If you are interested in trying something like that, though, please write back. I expect that someone else may be able to guide you through the process.
<br />
<br />Someone else may have more. I admit to vast ignorance.

<br />I think this article addresses your question. Have the 2 images, each triggered by  a mouse click , then use the technique described in this tip:
<br />Dynamic transitions help you connect two slides  <a href="http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/pptblog/dynamic-transitions-help-you-connect-two-slides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/pptblog/dynamic...</a> 
<br />By Ellen Finkelstein March 8th, 2012
<br />You have  a table of Excel data and you need to discuss it in detail at a meeting. But thereâ€™s no way it will fit on one slide. You could split the data onto 2 slides and use a dynamic transition between them. Dynamic transitions are new for PowerPoint 2010.  Occasionally, a transition can actually help your audience understand what you are saying. When you need to span data over 2 or more slides, the Pan dynamic transition can help.
<br />
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, try sending your question to Ellen, or to the Bright Carbon site from the following tips. I've seen some pretty amazing animations on both of these sites.

<br />Types of Animation in PowerPoint 2016 for Windows  <a href="https://www.indezine.com/products/powerpoint/learn/animationsandtransitions/2016/types-of-animation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.indezine.com/products/powerpoint/le...</a> 
<br />Adding animation to your slide objects is easy, but needs prior thought. Itâ€™s best to first decide what type of animation works best for a particular slide object. The type of animation used for any object is paramount because it can make the animated end-results viable, or relegate it to a distraction. In this tutorial, let us get started with showing you how many types of animations are available within PowerPoint 2016. When we say "many types," we do not mean the animation effects themselves, but the categories in which these Animation effects are divided.
<br />  
<br />Entrance Animations in PowerPoint 2016 for Windows   <a href="https://www.indezine.com/products/powerpoint/learn/animationsandtransitions/2016/entrance-animation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.indezine.com/products/powerpoint/le...</a> 
<br />Among several types of animations that PowerPoint 2016 provides, Entrance effects are probably the most popular. By applying Entrance animation effects, you can make your slide objects appear on the slide almost magically! You make them appear in the fraction of a second, or get them to fly in from any direction. You can also do a zoom in, or even better, just make it subtle with a simple fade in. Whichever Entrance animation effect you choose, make sure to go for something that is in sync with the subject of your presentation. Most of the time, Appear, Fade, or Wipe effects work the best.
<br />  
<br />Emphasis Animations in PowerPoint 2016 for Windows  <a href="https://www.indezine.com/products/powerpoint/learn/animationsandtransitions/2016/emphasis-animation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.indezine.com/products/powerpoint/le...</a>  
<br />Emphasis animation effects determine how the slide object calls attention to itself while it is on-the-slide. Entrance and Exit effect animations allow a slide object to enter or exit the Slide Area, whereas slide objects with Emphasis Effect animations are already there on the slide area before they start animating, and will be there even after they have finished animating.

<br />Microsoft unveiled new new features for PowerPoint 365, Morph and Designer. Here, I want to discuss Morph and focus on effects that you canâ€™t create with PowerPointâ€™s animation feature.  Using Morph is very easy.

<h2>            Do not have access to the &#34;Present Desktop...&#34; Options in Skype for Business</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have Office 365 Business Premium.</p>
<p>I am unable to see/access the "Present Desktop, Present Programs, Present Powerpoint Programs" Options.</p>
<p>From what I have read, this may be because Skype for Business does not allow "Present" options with regular Free Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm if this is the likely culprit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, are there plans to make Skype for Business backwards compatible with Free Skype? If so, when?</p>
<p>If not, then is the only MS solution to share a screen, Free Skype (or Gotomeeting) ? &nbsp;</p>
<p>(I can't really force clients to get Skype for Business)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            The Click To Run installer does not require any extraction. Just download the 2 MB installer, double click it and Office 2016 automatically downloads then lets you know when you can start using the apps.

                    <p><span><font color="#000000">We recently did a try and buy with Microsoft Online Exchange and decided to adopt the service.&nbsp; So far we are pretty happy with it.</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">During our user testing several computers with Outlook 2010 were set up with @ourcompany.onmicrosoft.com e-mail accounts in Outlook.&nbsp; We did not delete these Microsoft Online
 Exchange accounts from Outlook 2010 prior to setting up our legacy (domain) e-mail accounts in Outlook 2010 after we moved our e-mail to the Microsoft Online/Exchange service.&nbsp; Now we find that Outlook 2010 will not allow us to delete the @ourcompany.onmicrosoft.com
 e-mail accounts from Outlook.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">When we try to delete the @ourcompany.onmicrosoft.com e-mail accounts through Outlook or the Control Panel Mail tool we get this message:</font></span></p>

</font></span></p>

<span><font color="#000000">
<p>"The primary account cannot be removed unless it is the only account in the profile.&nbsp; You must remove all other Exchange accounts before removing the primary account."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently Outlook thinks that the <span>
@ourcompany.onmicrosoft.com e-mail accounts (the test accounts) are the primary accounts in Outlook even though our @domain-name.com e-mail accounts are clearly set up as&nbsp;the default accounts in the Mail user profile.</span></p>
</font>
<p><br />
</p>
</span>
<p><span><font color="#000000">We do not want to have to delete the legacy e-mail accounts from Outlook 2010&nbsp;before we delete the @ourcompany.onmicrosoft.com e-mail accounts.&nbsp; It took a long time to synchronize
 all the e-mail, contacts, calendars, etc.</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">How do we delete the @ourcompany.onmicrosoft.com e-mail accounts from Outlook?</font></span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge Hijacked</h2>
                    <p>HI I had this issue of Edge being hijacked I found a solution by chance if you launch edge and immediately hit the home key (assuming you turned on this feature) it&nbsp;deletes of the offending tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CCleaner claims to clean edge but did not cure this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked for me good luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also Internet Explorer is still there and you can set it as default browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge needs an ad blocker quickly if it is to be taken seriously.</p>

            Thank You!!! Hitting the home key worked for me too!!! Using the task manager would close the offending site but as soon as I opened it up it would be there again and wouldn't let me do anything or get to settings. As with Internet Explorer, Microsoft
 Edge&nbsp; wouldn't respond to what I wanted it responded to The Bleepin' Hi-jack Site. Microsoft, to get The Edge on these low-down sites you've got more work to do.

            <p>I was able to hit esc, which caused the hijack dialogue box to close for a split second as it reopened... just had to get the timing right to close the tab while the box was down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never understood why any browser allows a site to take over the entire program like that... it's an industry standard, but a dumb one.</p>

            These malicious sites are very tenacious. I have been able to close the tabs using methods given in here like yours but unfortunately they show up again. Do Not Track and McAfee are able to deal with THEM&nbsp;on&nbsp;I.E. 11 but THEY are having a Field Day on Microsoft
 Edge. So for now I've given up on Microsoft Edge and am just using My I.E. 11 which works better than it did before my upgrade to Windows 10!!!

 get rid of the hijack culprit.</p>

                    <p>Not a big deal here, since I had it off while waiting for the promised increased message density feature, but I noticed that today. It's unclear what it means for those who upgrade with it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, Office 365's outlook.office.com calls their toggle "The new Outlook."&nbsp; When you do bring it back, maybe that's a better name. It's certainly more consistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: It doesn't seem to be a function of the build. I talked to a friend who actually had it enabled in a recent Insider build, and it's no longer present (or in effect) for him. He was on 10927.</p>

<p>Per the Coming Soon panel:<br />
<br />
"Occasionally, weâ€™ll release a new feature in Outlook that changes the look, feel, or functionality of Outlook. Coming Soon gives you a window of time to try these changes on your own schedule, learn about them, and share feedback with us before the changes
 are released to all customers."<br />
<br />
If there isn't a feature being tested in your ring (Fast or Slow) that falls into these categories, or if the features that were in Coming Soon have been turned on for everyone without the option to turn them off, then the toggle will not show. As the new UX
 is now rolled out broadly, it is no longer a part of the "Coming Soon" feature set. There are not any other features currently in Insider Fast that change the look or feel, or functionality changes that can be toggled, so the toggle is not showing.</p>

<p>OK, that makes sense, and I didn't think otherwise, except for one big point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You seem to be saying that the new UX is "now rolled out broadly." Is that true?&nbsp; I knew that that time was coming, but I hadn't realized that it was here, and I've seen no announcement of the new UX graduating from Coming Soon. Surely that would have merited
 a blog post or at least a tweet concurrent with it happening, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And more to the point, if it is rolled out broadly, <strong>I'm not seeing the new UX</strong>. Are you?</p>

<p>The new UX rolled out to Insiders Slow in the 1809 build (see the What's New page with that information
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-s-new-for-Office-Insiders-c152d1e2-96ff-4ce9-8c14-e74e13847a24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>) as well as production users (see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-s-new-in-office-365-95c8d81d-08ba-42c1-914f-bca4603e1426?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.) I do personally see the UX. Also, as with all Insiders features, things may come and go from build to build, may show up for some users and not for others. Things like Coming Soon are dynamically controlled based on what is available to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not seeing the new UX at all, please confirm that you are running the latest available Insider Fast build by manually checking for updates. If you are seeing that you have the most recent update - 1811&nbsp;<span>11010.20003 as of right now

<p>I thought you were talking about released&nbsp;<em>publicly </em>beyond the Insider sphere--as in no more Coming Soon for anyone, until the next round--since otherwise what you're talking about doesn't make sense. As I mentioned, I had been seeing it in Insider
 for six weeks. Your links show that Coming Soon is very much still a thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm officially lost by the reasoning. Just write me off--no need to reply. I'm sure it'll eventually all make sense. I literally mentioned the Outlook version in question in the subject of this message, but I amended that message by saying that the specific
 Insider version wasn't the key factor. Anyway, forget about it, this is nuts.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume you already saw and followed the advice in my previous posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is only one other possible problem - you didn't install updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the Word menu and choose About Word to display the version you have. It should be either 16.16.5 or 16.16.6 depending on where you are in the update cycle. Either is current at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your version is anything else, then install updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If your Mac is managed by an IT department, have them install updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(247, 150, 70, 1)">INSTALL UPDATES</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection before checking for updates. Install Mac OS X updates followed by Office updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Install Mac OS X updates first:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get Mac OS updates, go to the App store on your dock, and then click the Updates button to reveal available updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Then Install Office Updates</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get the update:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>1. Open any Office application</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>2. Go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>3. Let AutoUpdate check for and install updates</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>4. Restart your Mac</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any add-ins such as WebEx, Mendelay, EndNote, Zotero, TypeIt4me, etc<strong> it is essential that you install the latest updates for
 your add-ins</strong>. This includes font management add-ins, such as Suitcase. If you use Suitcase, you should have at least version 9.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Your copy of AutoUpdate may be too old to run in Mojave.</span></strong><span>
 If you were told no updates are available, you will have to install the current version of AutoUpdate. Install the latest version of AutoUpdate and when it runs, let it do its thing.</span></p>

<h2>            Synchronization problems with 6300</h2>
                    Dear all,<br />
<br />
Recently I got a Nokia 6300. Satisfied with everything except one, HUGE for me, problem: tried many times to edit Contacts on my computer using Nokia PC Suite and synchronize them with the phone. Things in the phone don't change, and I get these messages on
 my computer: "The operation could not be completed" and "Failed to save contact on the phone. Nothing works. It drives me mad. How to solve this problem, please?<br />
OS is XP Pro, PC Suite - 6.84.10.4, connection - USB cable.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
oleg: When you use PC Sync or Contact view or Contact editor -&gt; set phone UI to idle state always!<br />
If that didn't help, install latest pc suite.<br />
<br />
andresmacanas22: what pc suite you are using?<br />
BTW: take backup from old phone and then restore that backup to new phone.....then all your data is transferred.

            Hi, Thank you for the fast reply.<br />
<br />
I'm using PC suite 6.85.14.1 which is supposed to designed for 6300 mi "old" telephone which I am trying to make the backup from. I tried to do what you said and It didn't work. I think the problem could be on the phone because I if I tried to import the contacts
 directly using the application wich comes in the 6301 without using the PCsuit I get the same error.<br />
<br />
Any idea will be appreciated.

If you open PC Suite's Contacts application (nokia phone browser\phone\contacts), can you see contacts from 6300 ?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Maybe you can copy your contact from 6300 to SIM card. After that set that SIM card to your new phone and copy those contacts from SIM to your phone memory.<br />
<br />
(But you may lost some information from contact e.g. pictures.....)

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I finally went to the nokia center and they copy the contacts using another software different than the pcsuite.<br />
However they couldn't find an explanation for the problem of they phone. I hope it will be solved with a future firmware update for the phone.<br />
<br />
If someone else have the same problem I hope this can help.<br />
<br />
Thank you to every one who tried to help me.

            I have a similar problem as my phone reboots during the pcsync operation of contacts folder. Nokia customer care advised to return phone to Service Centre for the operating System to be re-flashed to the phone. THis is not a reboot exercise or firmware
 update process.<br />
<br />
The phone worked well for approximately 1 month when the problem returned. I have returned the phone to the service centre and they they re-flashed the operating system and it has failed again after a period of 1 month. I am not sure what to do next, any help
 appreciated.<br />
<br />
Happy with the phone otherwise, but it is a problem!

            I have exactly the same problem as described. During the contacts synchronization after counting 4 of 69 display becomes white and phone reboots. But if I click Contacts Manager, everyting's fine, and I can see all the contacts in Nokia Phone Browser.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, when this error occur, all the contacts become unchangable, when I try change smth, OPERATION FAIL occur.<br />
<br />
P.S. I had exactly the same problem with my previous phone, Nokia 6151, and I had to sell it out. It's very strange for me, that such concern as Nokia cannot solve this problem for years.<br />
<br />
Thaks for answers, sorry for my bad English, Alexander, Russia.

<p>Jim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some other things to try- delete temporary internet files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove and reinstall all your other 3rd party applications (if possible) to your storage card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Move contents of My Documents to your storage card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently I don't think Good allows attachment storage to a storage card.With Outlook Mobile you have that option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Does Windows 10 Technical Preview support a PS2 mouse&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - PS2 Mouse</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both USB Mouse and Keybord work.&nbsp; If I shut down and install a PS2 Mouse ( I have tried several and a PS2 track ball)&nbsp;during startup at the sign on page neither the mouse or USB keyboard work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My question is does the Windows 10 Technical Preview&nbsp;support a PS2 mouse?</p>

</p><p><span><span>Hi John, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Do you get any error message when you plug in the PS2 mouse?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>After upgrading to Windows 10 Technical Preview, did you update all device drivers and install all pending Windows Updates?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>The computer should support the PS2 mouse as long as there are compatible drivers and updates. This issue might occur due to incompatible or outdated drivers and missing updates.
</span>I can understand that it must be difficult for you when things are not working as it should. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Plug the device and run the hardware troubleshooter. Once this is done, restart the computer and check the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow these steps:<br />
- Press the â€˜<strong>Windows + W</strong>â€™ key on the keyboard.<br />
- Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search box and then press <strong>
enter</strong>.<br />
- Click <strong>hardware and sound </strong>and run the <strong>Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter</strong>.<br />
- Follow the On screen instructions. Once this is done, restart the computer and check the status.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may update the PS2 mouse driver from Device Manager manually and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press (Windows key + X) and click on â€œDevice Managerâ€.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Expand â€œMouseâ€ or â€œMice and other pointing devicesâ€.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3. Right click on the driver and select â€œUpdate Driver Softwareâ€. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Further, you may also look for optional updates in Windows Updates to see if there are any additional updates related to this device and install them as required.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the driver update does not help then I would suggest you to completely uninstall the USB driver and reinstall it to check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Press â€œWindows key + Xâ€ and click on â€œDevice Managerâ€.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
In the list of devices, you should see the <span>â€œMouseâ€ or â€œMice and other pointing devicesâ€.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Right click on the device driver and then select "Uninstall".</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
In the uninstall dialog, make sure you select the option to delete the driver package from the system. This causes the driver package installed earlier to be deleted.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the Action menu of Device manager, select â€œ<strong>Scan for Hardware changesâ€
</strong>option. This will force the computer to recognize any hardware changes. Once the driver is installed, close all windows and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reply with the status of the issue and we will be glad to offer our assistance.</span></p>

            I am sorry about being so long in getting back with the information I promised. &nbsp;After downloading build 9879 and getting it set up, I still cannot get a PS-2 mouse to work in the PS-2 port. &nbsp;I can get the PS-2 track ball to work just find using an adapter
 from PS-2 to USB. &nbsp;The mother board I am using is a new but older ASUS. &nbsp;One I have had for several years as a back-up. &nbsp;I believe the PS-2 port on the motherboard is not working.

            I have tried to get a PS2 mouse to work on Windows 10 since it first came out.&nbsp; It is a Compaq mouse which Windows 10 displays as a Microsoft mouse.&nbsp; What happens every once in a while is that the mouse goes roving about the screen; clicking on everything
 and then quits working.&nbsp; Also, online I can click on something, then it won't click on anything else.&nbsp; I have no problems with a clunky old USB mouse.&nbsp; I will just get a nicer , LASER USB mouse.&nbsp; If I encounter any farther difficulties I will revert to Windows
 7.

            <p>I have discovered a Standard&nbsp; PS/2 Wireless Keyboard and a Wireless Keyboard Filter Device have been installed on my computer (HP 15-f233wm) without my permission or assistance. Assuming PS/2 is related to Play Station, which I dont and never have had and
 would not feel it necessary to install anything related to Play Station. Despite Deleting/Uninstalling them, they regenerate themselves and make themselves the default printer.</p>
<p>HP Remote User and HP Remote ePrint have also been installed which I do not have or use, and appears to be the way information, files, pics&nbsp; etc are being harvested from my computer. There regenerate after deletion/uninstall as well. HELP!!!</p>

            <p>PS2 in this case is a type of a connector; nothing to do with PlayStation.&nbsp; It is the little round connector so many mice and keyboards used pre-USB.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've been reading forums and scanning YouTube and I can't find an answer to a Very Simple question:</p>
<p>Is today's Hardware, and software advanced enough to let me write numbers on the tablet, and have it converted to digital type?</p>
<p>
</p><p>this would help speed up the job i do, make it more efficient to not turn in my chicken scratch, only to have the office staff type what I wrote.</p>

            Hi KennyB93940,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
You can refer to this article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/draw-and-write-with-ink-in-office-6d76c674-7f4b-414d-b67f-b3ffef6ccf53?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#OfficeVersion=v2016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Draw and write with ink in
 Office</a>&nbsp;&gt; Other digital ink features section.<br />
<br />
I tested on Surface and just like the article said, you can ink your handwriting to shape in Excel.&nbsp;However, it doesn't have the Ink to Text feature just like OneNote 2016, where you can ink your handwritten text (including numbers) into digital type.<br />
See also: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/austeachers/2015/02/02/microsoft-office-with-a-stylus-unleash-the-power/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Office with a Stylus: Unleash the power </a>- comments.<br />
<br />
Regarding your situation, I think you can turn on touch keyboard instead, tap that to quickly fill in the cells.&nbsp;<br />
Or, use OneNote to record your handwritten text.<br />
You can also share your valuable comments at our&nbsp;<a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uservoice</a>&nbsp;site. This will help better our products and services.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Start Menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beta_tester_fanatic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu</h2>
                    Windows 10 is definitely an improvement over 8, the Start menu especially. However, that's only by the virtue that the Windows 8 was the worst UI ever produced by Microsoft, and frankly isn't something to be proud of. To improve Windows 10 you should make
 the user experience almost exactly the same as 7; it was virtually a perfect user experience, and Windows 8 was a serious step backwards. The whole of Microsoft needs to learn the same lesson the Xbox division learnt recently: you can stand on principle or
 you can make money. Dividing up the UI into competing styles classic and Metro, is the worst thing possible. I was under the impression an OS was suppossed to unite all of the functions of a PC under one 'roof'?

            <p>If start screen of Windows 10 TP was exactly same as Windows 7, so why we should call it Windows 10?</p>
<p>There are people who are asking to bring back the start screen for Windows 8.1 and others asking they want the one in Windows 7. The idea of Windows 10 is satisfy both users and you could customize it in a way you like for example unpin all App to make it
 look like Windows 7. If there was a limit in customization or you don't like it, use feedback app and share your feedback.</p>

            <p>I have installed windows 10 Tech. Preview. Such notation now displays at bottom right of screen on desktop. When I click on windows icon on lower left or press windows key on keyboard, I get windows 8 displayed. I DO NOT get the updated start menu as described
 for windows 10. I go to "system" under control panel and it shows the OS as windows 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Microsoft, why not have an option in the Start Menu properties that would allow the user to select either a 'Windows 7 style' (call it 'Classic'?) start menu or the cellphone-style 'Modern' UI style.&nbsp; It's got to be a very simple programming task for talented
 Microsoft coders.&nbsp; If the intent with Windows 8.x and 10 is to enrich all the third party Windows customizer software companies, well, then, Windows 8.1 is succeeding. The Modern UI's Start Screen/Start Menu work well for some users (users without complex
 software loads and heavy multitasking?), but for many of us, Modern is a horrible monkey dance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the performance and smoothness of 8.1 and 10, aside from the UI, bravo, Microsoft!&nbsp; Windows 10 seems to be a step in the right direction, WRT to the Start Menu, but still is awfully clunky and inefficient for multitasking.&nbsp; I don't want a smartphone
 user interface when I'm trying to get work done.&nbsp; My wife, for whom PC work is&nbsp;usually quite simple -&nbsp;she&nbsp;typically only checks email, writes short documents, goes on the Internet, and plays 2-D games - has no problem with&nbsp;Windows 8.1's UI and Start Menu.&nbsp;
 If flexibility is the goal (one OS core for&nbsp;differing platforms),&nbsp;why not make a simple&nbsp;user selection, so that we can choose which UI and Start Menu is in front of us.&nbsp; If Classic Shell and Stardock can master this, then certainly Microsoft can.&nbsp;

            I believe that windows is all about choice, if you like the current layout that is fine; if you want to customize it, that is fine also, if you want a classic start menu use classic shell which there is a beta that will work with Windows 10.&nbsp; Remember,
 there is usually more than one way to get your job done.&nbsp; Windows 10 allows us choice, and that is what Windows 8 did not do easily.&nbsp; Good job, Microsoft in allowing us to comment on this preview.

            <p>Some of these mentioned already but I'm jumping in with my $0.02. </p>
<p>I have had Win10 for a few months now.&nbsp; Fully customized my Start Menu live tiles.&nbsp; Today had updates pushed out, rebooted and after a long update process, I have a different format for the Win 10 Start Menu.&nbsp; I don't like the new one at all.&nbsp; Never mind
 all of the setup for the live tiles was lost.&nbsp; I don't like talking to my devices, the old search feature was good enough. Not worth what I lost for Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plenty I Don't like about the changed Win10 start menu in build 9926: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jump lists are gone.&nbsp; There is an option for the number of items in jump lists, but no jump lists actually appear, even after opening several remote desktops, there is no&nbsp;&gt; with the most recent desktops connected to. Previously, you could even pin the
 ones you&nbsp;needed to stay and sort them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several custom options are gone, I don't remember all of them but there are definitely fewer options now. How do you get to the Start Menu options now? Only one way, right-click the task bar (not start) and select properties.&nbsp; Not at all intuitive,
 I just happen to remember those tabs on the same properties dialogue.&nbsp;Every other MS OS had more start menu options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Start Menu live tile section won't resize at all anymore it scrolls.&nbsp; The original went from right to left and expanded as needed.&nbsp; the new one is fixed and scrolls up and down.&nbsp; Feels like I'm in a box and can't move my elbows, just stick my feet
 out the bottom. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;preferred the old application listing without grouping.&nbsp; It was longer but much easier to read, and complimented the classic style.&nbsp; The new one doesn't even have all of the apps, as suggested "All Apps".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't reposition icons on the most used list as before.&nbsp; Though, you can remove them.&nbsp; It just makes sense if you can group command prompt and power shell together instead of having them separated by paint.&nbsp; I think they are sorted in the order
 of most used.&nbsp; I'll just position them in the live tile section and ignore the most used list. As I add live tiles, I'm making everything small so I don't have to scroll...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You trashed all the setup I had done previously to the live tiles.&nbsp; I get it, the change was significant enough that the old layout didn't jive with the new layout and you likely couldn't use the arrangement of live tiles that I had.&nbsp;I can rebuild my
 tiles, but as a system admin, you can't do this to users in production without a massive backlash.&nbsp; You already heard how much everyone wants the Start Menu back. Wipe out everyone's settings during an update and you will surely hear about it in the news.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully some of this is just stuck in my profile, or clears up with a reboot.&nbsp; I'll post an update if I can get it to work better.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>THX!</p>

            <p>Hi Shibu, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community Forum and I do apologize for not being able to answer in a timely manner. We are currently experiencing high volume of inquiries. Let me address&nbsp;your concern regarding joining your two accounts together.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feature&nbsp;that we have right now is linking Microsoft accounts.&nbsp;This&nbsp;capability&nbsp;doesnâ€™t provide a way to merge accounts. You can only link multiple Microsoft accounts together in Outlook.com, so you donâ€™t need to keep signing in and out to access the information
 in the different accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Here are the steps on how to link accounts:</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>1. Sign in to your&nbsp;primary account page on this
<a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>2. Under <strong>Permissions</strong>, click
<strong>Manage linked accounts</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span></font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font><font>3. Click </font><font><span><strong>Add linked account&nbsp;</strong>and</span><font><span>&nbsp;on the next page,&nbsp; you have to&nbsp;enter your&nbsp;password and the Microsoft account you want to link.</span></font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">4. When you're done, just click <strong>Link </strong>at the bottom of the page.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to post back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Thank you.</font></p>

            I used to have my 2 hotmail accounts linked and was able to switch between them by clicking the upper right corner where my name is. About a month ago, the link disappeared and i have to log into each hotmail account seperately.
<br />
<br />
If i try to follow the instructions above, the "Manage Linked Accounts" option is gone. There is no other option to link a hotmail acct. with a hotmail acct, although what is new is the ability to link my hotmail acct with everything else!<br />
<br />
Please explain why my 2 hotmail accounts are not linked anymore and if i can re-link them. I have tried on both a Mac and PC.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Lynn<br />

            I tried using Ronniebofa's help dated 2010 and it is outdated.&nbsp; Outlook 2010 setup for iCloud seems impossible to establish with Windows 10 - I was able to do it with Windows 7.&nbsp; The lack of sync possibilities between the two systems is really unacceptable.&nbsp;
 All help requested.&nbsp; My posting date is Jan 3, 2017 and I'd appreciate current, updated info re this problem.

            Actually it worked perfectly in Outlook 2010 for a LONG time... years. then it quit months ago and I don't know what preceded the breakdown. I too am on that quest. I'm about to uninstall Outlook and reinstall but its a pretty big deal for me right now
 since it takes so long. Just thought i would let you know.
