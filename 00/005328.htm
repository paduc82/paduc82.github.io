    <title>IMAP incorrect error message &#34;OVERQUOTA&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick5512  say:</h3>
<h2>            IMAP incorrect error message &#34;OVERQUOTA&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I use my outlook.com account (an old account with an address ending in @live.ca) with Mozilla Thunderbird.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to perform any operation on my inbox (downloading new email, moving email from one folder to another, etc), Thunderbird gives me the following message in a popup box:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The current operation on 'Inbox' did not succeed. The mail server for account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** responded:<br />
[OVERQUOTA] The mailbox does not have enough space remaining to complete this operation. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been going on for a week now and has made it impossible to use the account through IMAP (I've been resorting to the outlook.com webmail interface, which has been working fine).&nbsp; I would very much like to get IMAP working again though.&nbsp; I know that
 the problem is NOT with Thunderbird since I experience the same problem using another IMAP client on a different PC.&nbsp; Also, every other IMAP account I use (a university account, and a couple gmail accounts) still work fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why am I getting this message?&nbsp; I thought I would never get an OVERQUOTA message - I thought my inbox size was virtually unlimited?&nbsp; I have plenty of OneDrive space (over 30 GB free - but I don't know if OneDrive can possibly have anything to do with this).&nbsp;
 I clean up my emails once per year by downloading everything to a local hard drive to keep my IMAP account clear of old mail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas or insight would be much appreciated!&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the other thread the logon had failed.&nbsp; Your issue is Quota.&nbsp; Generally speaking IMAP has a quota of the number of times it can connect in 24 hours.&nbsp; I have no idea what the finite number for outlook.com is but every device connection counts as one.&nbsp;
 It has nothing to do with space but rather connections.&nbsp; If you have a couple of pc's and a mobile device that checks every 5 mins you could go over the "quota"</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my external servers the quota is 250 connections/24 hours and I had to decrease my mobiles devices connection frequency.</p>

    <title>Account recovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mitch lacey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account recovery</h2>
                    Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
So ive had this issue for the last 3-4 years where I cannot recover my old email address, as I cannot provide enough memorable information on the online form, and the only recovery method, was by Phone because, I only used 1 Email address at the time. My Phone
 number "has" OBVIOUSLY since changed, and I am no longer able to get access that phone number on a new device, whatsoever.<br />
<br />
It feels like my account is locked in a tight circle and there's no way in. Microsoft has taken no note, of the email account i'm using currently, for comparison to the one I want access back too. Which surprises me, because they both will have the exact same
 emails from the same places, from companies like Paypal whom, if had ever suspected suspicious activity, would also have locked me out using my funds. Or my Bank even. But, alas, me, my bank, Paypal, and this new email address are fine. And a carbon print
 of the old email.<br />
<br />
I have alot of accounts tied to online gaming websites that are linked and, are unchangeable due to the nature of the website design and implementation. This is very very frustrating and feels like an unneccessary problem that is easily avoidable with common
 sense. and decency. IF I can be helped here via actual people involvement. And not some robot. I just need a few options made available to me somehow... I want to play Warframe at the moment, but my account is linked to a locked email. Ill buy windows 10 finally
 maybe, if i can get some help. Lol<br />
<br />
Kind regards in Advance.<br />
Mitch

            Ok i can live with that, but speaking for anyone else in this situation, this shouldnt even happen. There should be a working solution for this particular scenario and people running into it. There should never be a road block for anyone. No matter how
 much time passes. That is common deceny, and respect. Its like me providing a service to you, that if runs into a snag... Cannot be rectified, I aplogoize, la di da. You wouldn't expect that, OR respect it. And I wouldnt provide a service that has imperfections
 like that until they were internally rectified.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance again,<br />

            I know thieves can take alot of information, but not all... If you think they can, your giving too much credit where credit is universally, just not required nor due. They aren't being, the end-all, be-all hackers now, and they won't anytime soon. There
 annoying at best.<br />
<br />
Just take a look at some things from people that might otherwise indicate there truth, and your over-reactive mentality to security.<br />
<br />
Comparative's to current existing, or post-existing accounts that have acted as replacements, for an extended BUT SPECIFIC amount of time, for sufficient viewable evidence to state that is indeed the real owner. Dig into the account? Looking at an account on
 the outside with provided information, only allows you to validate a certain level of it...<br />
<br />
You simply cannot determine a true owner, with a few half-centralized questions that don't have any concrete comparison's when people's lives change ALOT in real time...Emails however, from particular people, i.e. banks ect business's. DO act as concrete and
 full-answers to your determining the true owner. Because they don't change and if THEY do, then somethings up. BOTH OF WHICH, I have the SAME FROM... on BOTH accounts, indicating. I AM INDEED the person your very, very bad "automated" services think I am not...

            If its so damaging for the real owner (lol see what i did there) to have his account back, maybe just consider deleting it and making it available for me again? To start over? I'm hooked up to accounts that i cant change. My messages are going to a dead
 email thats been disabled?<br />
<br />
How would you feel if there were routes a company could take to help you that weren't being made obvious to them, and being used? Being locked out uneccesarily regardless of there opinions on the security of the account? Youd feel pretty back doored and fu**ed
 up the backside. I dont expect this to be an issue much longer... Please... -_-

<p>Nice disregard for what I stated. Typical American haha, facts in your face but your own mind shrouds you anyway regardless.<br />
<br />
But anyway, it ''IS''... Theoritically and physically possible, for it to be made available again... While thoroughly figuring through that job, and what is involved, the only excuse for not doing it, would be self-egotistically fed and of no loss but more
 importantly, benefit to anyone. If the email is shutdown and unobtainable, then the email is somewhere in a list that is accessbile. Nothing can be blocked, by no coding at all. So just go to where ever it is being stored, and rectify the issue and make it
 available again? Simple? Once shutdown, there's nothing to protect. So any policies you have on these accounts for keeping them locked? There literally is no excuse, so please...<br />
<br />
Hopefully THAT can atleast be done by someone/you. A week with a pointless issue with my game, and 2 years worth of excuseful security measures rather than more thorough (as mentioned above) methods, (if someone can forsee no important requirements to use there
 email address for any extended forseeable period of time, they should be allowed to do so without UNECCESARY hinderance). I just want what everyone else wants, a smooth run. Please help me make this possible instead of going the ''complete'' opposite direction,
 like i'm of no good value lol.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,</p>
<p>Mitch.</p>

            You can try these steps but is at your own risk:<br /><br />1. Go to Start &gt; Search, Type cmd.exe and right-click the result file and select Run as administrator.<br />Note: If you are on a 64-bit Windows OS, before you move to the next step, type cd SysWOW64 and press the Enter key.<br />2. Type the following in the Command Prompt window and then press Enter each time: <br /><br />Regsvr32 jscript.dll <br /><br />Regsvr32 vbscript.dll <br /><br />Regsvr32 jscript9.dll<br /> <br />3. You should see a message, saying DllRegisterServer in jscript.dll is succeeded <br />4. Then reboot your computer and repeat the JavaScript test using Internet Explorer. If you get a positive response, run Skype again.<br /><br />Source: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_win10-skype_startms-skype_installms/skype-classic-will-not-log-in-gives-a-java-error/338a10ca-2219-406e-9727-895d10cc0777">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum...</a>

            I would suggest that you download the printer driver again and reinstall. 
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work, Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)

            Rather than setting duplex inside of Word, when you go to the Print dialog click on Printer Properties under the printer selection drop down.  The properties are defined by the printer maker so I can't say where to look, but somewhere there should be a duplex/2-sided print option.

            Try putting the battery in again, and taking it out&nbsp;several&nbsp;times. If that doesn't work, try taking out the battery and leaving it out overnight or for a few hours during the day. Allow the phone to be stored in a moderately cool temperature, nothing too
 hot that could melt the phone or overheat it.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're good to go after paying for Microsoft Office activation. If you already have the Microsoft Office apps installed in your computer, it should start working right after paying. However, can you tell us what do you exactly mean when you say "It will
 not let me do any office applications"? Where did you process the payment for Microsoft Office?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2016 update 15.22 causes major HTML formatting problems</h2>
                    
<p>the latest update to outlook for mac 2016 breaks what was a very handy feature from prior versions: &nbsp;in versions up to 15.21, a user could copy-and-paste an html-formatted page (for example, from a browser) into a blank outlook message and have it maintain
 all of its html formatting. &nbsp;with the update, all formatting is lost, font sizes and line spacing render inconsistently, and even some of the html markup becomes visible to the reader. i've also noticed problems associated with html-formatted signature files.
 partial screen capture below, showing html code in message. i need to send html files as part of my daily job. why would msft break a feature that had been so robust and valuable for years?</p>

<p>hi alan –</p>
<p>thank you for your reply and to msft's attention to the issue. to answer your questions from the post you mentioned:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;i have attached "before and after" screen shots of the same html code pasted/rendered in 15.21 and 15.22 here so that you can see the issues side-by-side, but to summarize: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>images are rendered in their native resolutions, not resized per the instructions in the code (we use double-sized graphics for retina displays).
</li><li>tables and alignment formatting are discarded. </li><li>font formatting (styles) is discarded. </li><li>design elements (background colors, perimeter border, etc.) are discarded. </li><li>some html code is visible (tags, styles and attributes are visible at the bottom of the bad email).
</li><li>commented-out header text in the code is visible ("perimeter outline," "masthead," "main body," "legalese," etc.)
</li></ul>
<p>2. &nbsp;we code our html messages on a mac using bbedit (a standard text-editor/code-wrangler tool). we test our messages extensively to ensure they render properly across multiple platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;i have rolled back to outlook for mac version 15.21.1 (160411), which corrects the html rendering issue. because of this, unfortunately i can't tell you which version of 15.22 i was using before i deleted it from my system.</p>
<p>i hope this information is helpful.</p>

<p>Hi Bill-</p>
<p>As the Alan replied you need to send an direct email to the Mac team (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) by name of the reference to the JohnWang_MSFT as mentioned for further investigation.</p>
<p>Although, our most of the client have already did that you may do at your convenience, it will create more attention.</p>

            Hi Kemal,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your posting. According to your description, this problem might be related to the network connection to Proxy server. In this way, we suggest you delete your account and

re-add it</a> to Outlook 2016 for Mac correctly after you connect to Proxy server network to see if it works.<br />
<br />
Besides, if the issue still occurs, we have a dedicated support channel for Outlook 2016 for Mac issue and you can contact them to get targeted help by clicking

<p>Does the proxy server support the ports used for IMAP? Can you just bypass the proxy for IMAP?</p>
<p>The alternate option would be to exclude the domain of the IMAP server in the proxy settings.</p>

<h2>            Opening a word 2007 form made on a PC in word 2011 mac</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I have created many forms and I have used them for years on word 2007 on a PC that I was able to use perfectly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I now updated my computer to a mac and am running office 2011, with word 2011.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Unfortunately when I open the forms using word 2011 for mac, some parts of the form do not work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can still check boxes and write in text fields and tab through, however the drop down menu option does not work. The text "choose an item" is there but there is no drop down choices anymore.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried saving to other formats but have had no luck. I have way too many files to sit there and recreate parts of every form. I thought this would easily open in office for mac.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What am I doing wrong?!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks :)</div>
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            It's an online form. Unfortunately, it has a mixture of "legacy controls" (which would normally work on Mac Word 2011) and "content controls" (which only partially work on Mac Word 2011). All the dropdowns are content controls, and I think all the content
 controls are dropdowns. I don't know of a way to get these to work properly on Mac Word.
<div><br />
<div>Question 1 is whether the there was some reason that these had to be implemented as content controls on Word 2007, or whether it is just an accident. AS far as I can remember the main problem with legacy drop downs is a limitation on the number of entries
 you are allowed. It's also possible that the form was originally conceived as a "content controls" only form but that legacy checkbox fields were used because in Word 2007 there was no content control checkbox field. However, there are also 6 legacy text input
 fields, so I'm inclined to think the form was not conceived as a "content controls only" form.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is rather easy to mix the two types because the user interface does not enforce consistency - it merely "drives you" towards content controls. And typically they will work fine together, at least in simple forms, although I think Microsoft advises against
 mixing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So it is also possible that some of your forms use other types of content control field, and those might have to be replaced to work on Mac.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, the dropdowns don't work on Mac Word 2011, and the only potential solutions I know are</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. modify all the content control dropdowns to be legacy dropdowns (assuming that they do not have to be content control dropdowns</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. maintain two versions of the form, if you need them for both platforms. But in the Mac version, you would still have to do (a).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I may be able to come up with some VBA for use on your Windows copy of Word (assuming that you still have it) &nbsp;that will replace the Content Controls by Form Field drop downs, but I certainly cannot do that right now. In the Windows version of Word, it
 is reasonably easy to see Content controls, once selected, because they have a blue box with a "tag" at the top left, so it may be useful to select some of your forms at random to get a handle on how many forms might be affected.</div>

            Well, I was nearly through the code I was experimenting with when I had to break off, but you can try the following in Word 2007 if you like. It makes a number of assumptions which may not be true (e.g. you may have protected your forms with a password,
 but this assumes there is no password) but it is obviously up to you to decide whether it is actually better for you to redevelop from scratch or attempt a "quick fix" which might not turn out to be quick.

<h2>            Forgotten parental account - Windowsphone.com</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>Recently, I have had a bit of issues with my Windows Phone.</p>
<p>I am not able to download any game or app on the Store as of the fact&nbsp;that I have not&nbsp;accepted the Store terms of use.</p>
<p>This is because I recently wanted to reset my phone since it was filled up with apps, and now I have no idea on how to get back on Store again.</p>
<p>As I am currently 'under aged', I am not allowed to have a Windows Phone account without parental admission.</p>
<p>Thus, I created a email specifically for the pleasure of&nbsp;being able to use the Store, a year ago.</p>
<p>Now, about&nbsp;1 year&nbsp;after,&nbsp;I now have no idea what the email address is, and&nbsp;I wish to&nbsp;get back&nbsp;on the store with to use all the apps again.</p>
<p>Hopefully there's a way I can get back on, again.</p>
<p>If it's not possible to restore, could there be a possible swap?</p>
<p>I have a email associated with my parents, which if possible, I would love to have.</p>
<p>It should be said, that I have parental admission on this case, and&nbsp;I can be contacted on my email if necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On advanced, thanks for the answers!</p>

            After days of talking to Microsoft about how to fix this same issue for my son and I stumbled across a fix!
<div><br />
<div>Log into xbox.com as your child, hit accept to the t&amp;c's and your taken to a page telling you to log in as a parent.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now before you hit "next" look at the URL in the address bar.....it shows the parent email in the URL, it's been web escaped so you need to ignore any %'s etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good luck</div>

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just downloaded trial versions of Microsoft Project and Visio Professional 2013. When I double-click on .exe file to install them on my computer I'm receiving the following error message:</p>
<p>"We can't install the 64-bit version of Office because we found the following 32 - bit programs on your computer:</p>

<p>Please uninstall all 32-bit office programs, then retry installing 64-bit office. If you want to install 32-bit office instead, please run the 32-bit setup"</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I'm currently using Microsoft Office 356.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which Office 365 version do you use? 32bit or 64bit?&nbsp;The 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Microsoft Office programs don’t get along, so you can only have one type installed at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please remove 'Office 15 Click-To-Run Extensibility Component' with tools “Microsoft MSI cleanup utility” (link:
<a href="http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/MSI-cleanup-utility-3889c8db" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/MSI-cleanup-utility-3889c8db</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I suggest you refer to&nbsp;a similar issue:<br />
<a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/5e77322d-268b-47c2-a0ea-346891fd8559/cant-install-visio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/5e77322d-268b-47c2-a0ea-346891fd8559/cant-install-visio</a><br />
Here's the steps to uninstall Office 15 Click-to-Run Extensibility Component:<br />
1. Uninstall all Office 2010 and Office 2013 Preview Versions.<br />
2. Open your register by using “Regedit” and navigate to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\Products\ path. Next delete the following two registry entries.<br />
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\Products\00005102C80000000000000000F01FEC<br />
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\Products\00005105F80000000100000000F01FEC<br />
3. Navigate to C:\program files\Microsoft Office\directory. If you see the Office15 Folder here remove it.</p>

            <p>Do you NEED 64-bit project and visio.&nbsp; Your simplest fix is to install the 32 bit versions of these programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 by default installs the 32 bit version.&nbsp; MS does not recommend you install the 64 bit version unless you have a specific need for it. (They actually make it very hard to find the 64 bit installer.) Generally that specific need is handling VERY
 large files, typically in Excel that are 2GB or larger in file size or use more than 2GB of RAM during calculations (but it could also be large files in other applications).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your other option is to uninstall 32 bit Office 365 and install 64 bit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note: even if you get past this error, many people have reported problems installing Viso and Project along with Office 365.

            This is not entirely correct.&nbsp; I have tried installs for BOTH 32 and 64 bit Visio and get the same error message (just flip "32" with "64" in the message).&nbsp; Apparently, the extensibility component counts as both.<br />

            <p>George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have the same problem and for me this is a BUG in Office365. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed Office 365 in October 2013 on a fresh installed windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I use the 64BIT version of MS Office 365 and I have NEVER installed any other Office Version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now i am facing the same problem and this brings me to the question: WHY is a 32bit program like the "office 15 click to run extensibility component" &nbsp;on my system even if I have only installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I remove the program to be ablke to install Visio and Project, what are the disadvanteges. As I have read that this is for automatic push updates, do I loose this feature and if yes how can I update the Office instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ritchie</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S, i also thought that 32 bit programs should be installed under Programs(x86) while this utility is installed under the Programs folder.</p>

<h2>            Change comments when document is protected for forms</h2>
                    
<p>I have a template that has form fields in section 1, and comments in section 2. I protected section 1 for forms, so a user can fill in the form fields. However, when I do that, I am unable to add or delete comments in section 2. Is there a way to make this
 work?</p>
<p>I am using text and checkbox fields. I can rework it without the text fields, but I really want to keep the checkboxes if possible.</p>

<p>Sorry - that doesn't help. If I protect section 1 for forms, I am unable to set different protection for other sections (at least, I haven't figured out how to do it). And if I allow everyone to make changes to section 2 like in your link, then I can't protect
 section 1 for forms.</p>

<p>Each section in a document can be protected for forms ... or not. For Word 2007/2010 on the Developer tab &gt; Protect Document &gt; Restrict Formatting and Editing &gt; Allow only this type of editing in this document &gt; filling in forms &gt; Select sections. Remove
 the check box from Section 2. Word will remember this setting for the document until you change it, so if you unlock the form later you can use the lock command to reset it. You will find<a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/Classic%20Form%20Controls.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/Classic%20Form%20Controls.htm</a>
 useful if you work with forms and Word 2007/2010.</p>
<p>There are similar protection options for earlier Word versions via Tools &gt; Protect</p>

<p>Sorry - that doesn't help. If I protect section 1 for forms, I am unable to set different protection for other sections (at least, I haven't figured out how to do it). And if I allow everyone to make changes to section 2 like in your link, then I can't protect
 section 1 for forms.<br />

Any other thoughts?<br />

<p>I've done that. I've selected only Section 1 to be protected for forms, and removed the check box for Section 2. After applying protection for forms in Section 1, I can freely edit the content in Section 2, but I am unable to add, change, or delete any comments.
 If I unprotect the document, then I can add/change/delete comments, but the check box controls in Section 1 are unusable.</p>

<p>As you have gathered protected forms and free editing are uneasy bedfellows. Where free editing is required, protected forms are not usually the best solution, and userforms would make better sense as a means of collecting and placing data - For the basics,
 see Word MVP FAQ - Userforms<br />
<a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Userforms.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Userforms.htm</a></p>
<p>for a more in depth explanation, see<br />
<a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/Create_and_employ_a_UserForm.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/Create_and_employ_a_UserForm.htm</a></p>
<p>However you could use macros run from toolbar buttons to insert and remove comments in an unprotected section, which would unlock and re-lock the form - something like</p>
<p>Sub Add_A_Comment()<br />
Dim bProtected As Boolean<br />
Dim strComment As String<br />
'Unprotect the file<br />
If ActiveDocument.ProtectionType &lt;&gt; wdNoProtection Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; bProtected = True<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveDocument.Unprotect Password:=""<br />
End If<br />
strComment = InputBox("Enter comment text", "Comment")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.Comments.Add Range:=Selection.Range<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.TypeText Text:=strComment<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveWindow.ActivePane.Close<br />
If bProtected = True Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveDocument.Protect _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Type:=wdAllowOnlyFormFields, _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; NoReset:=True, _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Password:=""<br />
End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Sub Remove_A_Comment()<br />
Dim bProtected As Boolean<br />
Dim oRng As Range<br />
'Unprotect the file<br />
On Error GoTo Protect<br />
If ActiveDocument.ProtectionType &lt;&gt; wdNoProtection Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; bProtected = True<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveDocument.Unprotect Password:=""<br />
End If<br />
Set oRng = Selection.Range<br />
oRng.Start = oRng.Words(1).Start<br />
oRng.End = oRng.Words(1).End<br />
oRng.Comments(1).Delete<br />
Protect:<br />

<p>Graham,</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice. If the template was only&nbsp;for myself, I would use the UserForm. Unfortunately, I need to share the template with other users - most of whom use a Mac. My past experience using macros with them has been more trouble than it was worth
 (and VBA isn't even included in Office 2008). I guess I will have to rethink my design to make it work.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>~ Horatio</p>

<p>Hi Anant,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the query on our forum.</p>
<p>You can check if you have been assigned the license which you bought via the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Subscription</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to use Office applications, you may need to the “<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The latest desktop version of Office</span>”
 license, you can check it as below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b0dc321-3105-474c-984f-2ab5607fe41d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b0dc321-3105-474c-984f-2ab5607fe41d?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>May I ask if you purchased your account from Godaddy? If so, please contact Godaddy support to help close/cancel your account since they have the management right of your account. We appreciate your
 understanding if this is the scenario. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you purchased your account from Microsoft, to better help you, may I ask what the account type is that you want to close/cancel? Is it an Office 365 for Business subscription or for Home subscription?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm not sure Access 2019 can be purchased on it's own.... if it can, I can't locate it either</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check out the following link for Office 2019</p>
<p>https://products.office.com/en-us/get-started-with-office-2019<br />

<p>Also have a read of this article first:</p>

<br />Actually found a link for the US Store but must admit - was in a very round and about way. Couldn't find it by going directly to the US (or Canadian) MS Store. Instead, found a listing under Bermuda (also Saudia Arabia) and then changed the region code to "us" (same applies to Canada)

<p>It is a very round and about way to find it, they don't make it simple thats for sure. Well done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess you just have to make the decision to either purchase a basically stand alone version or go with 365/19. I would read up on it first to make sure you get everything you want including updates and updated features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just to follow-up.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Search engine searches seem to fail on locating this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's website menus are more than&nbsp;<strong>useless </strong>and you'll never find standalone perpetual licensed versions of software.&nbsp; Heck, you can't even find Access at all!&nbsp; All they seem to push if Office365, and making people turn in circles, over
 and over.&nbsp;That said, if you use the Search function at the top of the main page and search for the term Access, you will then find it.</p>

            <p>Not always is this a malware most are just scare-ware you are redirected to a web page that is cleverly programmed, and cause you to be lock onto their page and you must use the task manager to close the internet explorer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I myself am looking for a way to take away the function of these webpages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me explain the Question so Everyone can understand what I am looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;1. Is there a setting for the internet Explorer that lets you block single pages from asking if you really want to close it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Why is a single page allowed to override the red X for exit on the Internet explorer window after you get ask if you want to close all windows and is there a way to block this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Billie</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps: I already read just about everything I can find on how to protect myself and my system is not infected nor has it been in over 20 years. The thing is other people panic easily on these scare-ware and scams and if I could figure out how to block the webpages
 from asking if you really want to close them then it would prevent these scare ware from working and help keep people from becoming prey to them.</p>

<p>Firstly, check what information did you share?</p>
<p>Did you installed any programs instructed by scammer?</p>
<p>If you share you bank account, credit card number and so on, contact Bank immediately and report this. You may contact local authority in your country in charge of SCAM.</p>

            The idiot, thief, liar who entered my computer and stole all my money, he placed SUPREMO and Skype on my computer. Indian man, said his name is Alex Robertson with this email address: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Phone no:+ 91 8622-985875. Said he is employed
 by Microsoft when he called me, but all the days after that he said that his company is called Globe InfoSolutions. Kill him, I want. He entered and changed and erased things in my computer many days. Called me 10-15 times every day for three weeks and took
 my money.

 year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The called me over and over telling me I had to pay, I told them I took everything off my laptop they had installed and to leave me alone because I knew they were a scam.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I was done with them but today I got an email from a collection agency
