<h2>            Printer MP Drivers - Connection Failure - Canon Pixma MG2570 on Win 8&#47;64 OS and Win 7&#47;64 OS</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have purchased Canon Pixma MG2570 last week and I have been not able to install the MP Drivers on my Sony Vaio Win 8/64 OS nor on Lenovo Win 7/64 OS. I have tried installing from the CD provided and failed in my attempts. It gets hanged on the step
 3, Printer Connection screen and I had to uninstall and reinstall the software number of times. Even then it failed. I have downloaded couple of times latest drivers from the canon website but I have failed to successfully install the printer. Please help
 me to install this printer on my devices with the above configuration. I'm not able to solve this problem in spite of the troubleshooting advice provided in the online manuals as well.</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

            <p>Thank you Srimadhwa for the reply. </p>
<p>I figured&nbsp;out that the issue was with the usb cable provided along with the printer it was not connected properly hence the error on the screen. The Mp drivers got instantly installed on to the system. The printer Canon Pixma MG2570 is working perfectly
 both on Win 8/64 os as well as Win 7/64 os. Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Date and Time Year is 3015 and can&#39;t change to 2015.</h2>
                    <p>I have recently updated my system to Windows 10 and I am having a date and time setting issues.&nbsp; I live on the east coast of the USA and my Date and Time setting is set to automatic for (UTC - 5:00) Eastern Time (US &amp; Canada).&nbsp; The date is close, but the
 Day is off due to the year and time is off by and hour.&nbsp; The year of my system defaults to 3015 instead of 2015.&nbsp; I have tried to go back to 2015 manually but it only goes back to 2046, I will probably be dead by then.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this may be serious? I have other problems as well, but that my be due to time settings so until I get this fixed I will probably stay away from those for now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Syed,I believe I did not give enough details.&nbsp; I update one of my systems from Windows 8.1 to 10.&nbsp; The installation went smoothly.&nbsp; But a few days later I awoke to the system drives grinding away and the system GUI was non responsive, I could not do anything
 with the system a all.&nbsp; I found out that the problem was that my Advast Virus scanner services were running away and taking all the system resources.&nbsp; I had to reboot the system in safe mode to kill the services so I could effectively use the system.&nbsp; Once
 I did that it allowed me to do a little research to see what was going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned on defender and went to do the updates and that is when I noticed that the date was so far out of range.&nbsp; I tried to manually set the date from 3015 using the GUI but it
 would not allow me to go back to the year 2015, just would not allow me to&nbsp;go back that far&nbsp;(I had done everything you suggested before you sent me your e-mail).&nbsp; &nbsp;I was successful on changing the date from the DOS command prompt updating the Date and time
 from there.&nbsp; I did that last night and it appeared to have worked, but this morning when I awoke it was back to 3015, something funky is going on.&nbsp; So, I changed the date again and forced updates and I have restarted several time and it appears to be working
 now, but I will wait till tomorrow to see if it reverts back to 3015?&nbsp; Time will tell on this.&nbsp; I basically sending out this request to see if anyone else has been seeing date issues with there new windows 10 system?&nbsp; And reaching out to Microsoft to see if
 there are possible problems that may need to be looked into and solutions if I can fix it on my own.</p>

            <p>I have resolved the problem and the following is what I had to do to fix the rouge system year problem.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I had to go to the DOS command line and set the date and time manually.&nbsp; </li><li>Once I had the correct date in the system, my system updates were recognized.</li><li>I installed all&nbsp;updates that were required by&nbsp;Windows 10 and restarted.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I would restart this is when I would usually have the problem.&nbsp; My system maintained the correct date and time this go around.&nbsp;
</li><li>It has been 4 days without a problem so I assume issue has been resolved with updating the system.&nbsp;

<h2>            Wifi not turning on when I disconnect from Ethernet in Windows 10 - HELP&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I upgraded to Win 10, my wifi will not connect automatically to any network when I disconnect from ethernet. So I'm in an office, at my desk I'm plugged into a dock with ethernet connected but when I want to take my laptop into a room, I have to click
 in to the wifi icon and turn it on. Previously on any Windows options, the wifi adaptor would always just connect to my designated network when I disconnected from ethernet. When I turn on the wifi, it does then connect automatically, so it doesn't seem to
 be related to recognising networks etc. Also I have made sure in Network Adaptor settings that the option for the computer to turn off the device to save power is not selected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked in other posts and all I'm seeing are issues with connecting to networks when the wifi is turned on - I just want wifi to be turned on automatically when I disconnect from ethernet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks folks</p>
<p>Killian</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the above description, I see that you want&nbsp;Wi-Fi to be turned on automatically when I disconnect from Ethernet.</p>
<p>If the Wi-Fi is always turned on&nbsp;when you disconnect from Ethernet it will automatically connect to Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>If the Wi-Fi is turned&nbsp;off&nbsp;when you disconnect from Ethernet, Wi-Fi will not connect or it will not turn on the Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wi-Fi will not turn on automatically, but it will connect automatically if its turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Guru Kiran</p>

            <p>Thanks Guru - that all makes sense however I am not turning off the wifi when connecting to Ethernet, seems like this is happening automatically. So maybe the question is how do i stop the wifi being turned off when I plug in to landline?</p>
<p>

    <title>Dual Monitors with Surface Pro Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dual Monitors with Surface Pro Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I know this topic has been discussed before but I am unable to find a post that pertains to my particular situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm working with Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Surface Pro&nbsp;</p>
<p>SMBIOS Version 3.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the surface hooked to a dongle via the display port. The dongle has VGA, HDMI &amp; DVI outputs. I have one monitor connected via VGA and one via DVI. I can only get one monitor and the surface itself to display at a time. Both monitors will work but
 only one at a time. If both monitors are plugged in, the DVI displays along with the surface. If I unplug the DVI, the VGA monitor displays with the surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get both external monitors to be recognized and displayed? I don't even care if the surface displays anything, I just want both of the external monitors to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Notes</span></strong></p>
<p>I do not want to buy the MS hub </p>
<p>My monitors are older and not capable of daisy-chaining (I don't think)</p>

            OK, I've moved this thread to the proper topic. As I said, those all in one dongles support a single connection, not multi monitor. So if you can't daisy chain monitors, you'd need the dock or similar hardware.

            Hi Mark
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What type of connection are you using for the display: HDMI, Display Port, DVI? 
<br />
<br />Its possible there might be an issue with your adapter or cable connection. You could try nudging the cable to see if it works or change out the cable. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Monitors
<br />
<br />Right click the monitor that keeps freezing
<br />Click uninstall
<br />
<br />Restart your computer then check if its working again properly.
<br />
<br />You can also try lowering the screen resolution of the monitor to see if that works.
<br />
<br />Are you in close proximity to any microwaves or radios by any chance?

            I don't see any recent updates for this model, but there is a ACPI Power Management update. You might want to apply that and see if it helps:

<br />
<br />Otherwise, I would upgrade to the upcoming Windows 10 1903 release that will be released over the coming weeks to see if the issue is fixed.

<p>We attempted to update Windows Vista to Windows 7 in our Toshiba Satellite A500-137 computer using the disk that we obtained (as part of the free upgrade offer).<span>&nbsp;
</span>We used the first disk and on-screen we followed the instructions to delete several programs (drivers for these programs in Windows 7 would be provided later).<span>&nbsp;
</span>We received the instructions on screen to change disks to the Windows 7 set up disk (the second disk) which we did.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At this point we received a warning message indicating that program Ati Catalyst should be deleted as it would not work properly under Windows 7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, although we received this warning message that this should have been deleted there was only a ‘<span>Next</span> ’ button on screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Therefore we went ahead with the installation (we <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
did not</span> delete Ati Catalyst) .<span>&nbsp; </span>It appeared to be installing correctly and it completed 4 of the five points (ticks) for installation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It was on the final ‘tick’ when it reached about 60%, when it suddenly came up with a blue screen (a blue screen of death), at which point the computer restarted and the screen said that it was not able to install Windows 7 and reverted back to Windows
 Vista.<span>&nbsp; </span>Currently Windows Vista is again working but without some of the drivers that were deleted in the process of transferring to Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Should we delete the Ati Catalyst software?<span>&nbsp; </span>This is related to the graphics card and therefore we did not want to do anything that would seriously affect this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
If I am to delete the Ati Catalyst software should I first change the driver for the graphics card to a standard VGA driver?<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Is there anything else that could cause this blue screen of death?<span>&nbsp; </span>
The system is almost unchanged from when purchased.<span>&nbsp; </span>The only additional software that has been loaded are 2 games (which I doubt would impact the transfer to Windows 7), a full copy of Office 2007 and Kaspersky Internet Security 2010, which perhaps
 could have some sort of impact. &nbsp;&nbsp; <span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please could you provide assistance as soon as possible so that we can successfully migrate the computer from Windows Vista to the new Windows 7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Thank you for your help.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><strong><span>1. Also you may uninstall the ATI catalyst drivers as after upgrade you will get new drivers through windows update
 or you may also download and install the compatible drivers from the manufacturer website –</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>2. No there is no need to change the driver to standard VGA driver.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>3. You may also uninstall the Kaspersky security software while upgrading and reinstall it once the upgrade is completed
 to avoid any issues while upgrading.</span></strong></p>

    <title>Unable to restore from backups &#58; Error 0x8100001A - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to restore from backups &#58; Error 0x8100001A</h2>
                    <p>&lt; Original Title: I can't restore from backups and I always get the (0x8100001A) error. Any ideas or any software that can manage doing a system restore? &gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had no problems before doing a system restore, but I've never tried restoring from backups in my D drive. A couple of months ago I started deleting restore points I thought I had no use for, and perhaps I think I might've deleted few backups but I'm
 not sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I really need to get me computer to a previous state, since my computer is having problems, especially loading takes more than usual and streaming videos can cause CPU to go to 100 and I need to close everything and wait a while before everything is
 settled down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, I don't have any restore points that are useful and I can't do a system image restore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problems:</p>
<p>1) My system restore doesn't completely replace all files and I get an error on that, but in safe mode it works, and sometimes after that it works even in normal &nbsp; &nbsp; mode, which is a bit surprising.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) My system image restore doesn't appear when I boot in safe mode and I can't use it in normal mode, because it takes forever and it doesn't actually restart&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; and continue with the process after the loading the first time. (should I actually wait more than 2-3 hours for that?)</p>
<p>3) My backup and restore menu doesn't show in control panel and doesn't load from search menu when I try logging in safe mode&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Backup and restore in normal mode shows always this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The restore did not complete successfully<br />
<br />
Restore encountered a problem while validating the zip file:<br />
<br />
\\?\Volume{b14a3556-f03e-11e0-9197-806e6f6e6963}\FUJITSU-PC\Backup Set 2012-10-14 195649\Backup Files 2012-10-14 195649\Backup files 1.zip<br />
<br />
The following information might help you resolve the problem:<br />
<br />
The backup file could not be found. Make sure the drive that the backup is saved on is attached or try to restore from a different backup. &nbsp;(0x8100001A)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I also cannot show hidden files and folder in D drive (it takes 66 GB and only about 1 and a half would show)
</p>
<p>&lt;don't know if it's worth mentioning...&gt;</p>
<p>I tried scanning it with avast and it shows an error or something like "a compression bomb", and I know it should be because I've opened it before and used to have zips inside zips and so on...</p>
<p>ANOTHER BAD HABIT OF MINE..... I don't know what I checked (besides showing or hiding files or folders) and now I can't see the zip files anymore :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please let me know if there is a way to get around it, either by safe mode or normal mode doesn't really matter at this point. Also, the file MediaID.bin is right on the D drive so no problem with that. I am absolutely clueless as to why there should be
 a corruption of my D drive, but maybe it's something similar to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other alternative is welcome and highly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Renis,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for the update on the issue, I appreciate your efforts in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft does not recommend any third-party application to do a system restore.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There might be some corruption in the system files, </span><span>I would suggest you to run system file checker to fix missing or corrupt windows files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let’s follow the steps below and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please refer this article.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In the first place, try to run the System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any .dll file corruption.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong><span>Start</span></strong>, click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong> and open
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Right click on <strong><span>Command Prompt</span></strong> in the Program list and then select
<strong><span>Run as administrator</span></strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
<strong><span>sfc&nbsp; /scannow</span></strong></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span><span>For more information, refer to this link: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If method 1 does not help, try to register the following .dll files pertaining to Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) service.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open the Command-Prompt in the elevated mode (<strong><span>Run as administrator</span></strong>) as stated in Method 1.</span></li><li><span>Type the following commands and press ENTER after each command:<br />
<strong><span>net&nbsp; stop &nbsp;vss</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>regsvr32&nbsp; ole32.dll</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>regsvr32&nbsp; vss_ps.dll</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Vssvc&nbsp; /Register</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>regsvr32&nbsp; /i&nbsp; swprv.dll</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>regsvr32&nbsp; /i&nbsp; eventcls.dll</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>regsvr32&nbsp; es.dll</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>regsvr32&nbsp; stdprov.dll</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>regsvr32&nbsp; vssui.dll</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>regsvr32&nbsp; msxml.dll</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>regsvr32&nbsp; msxml3.dll</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>regsvr32&nbsp; msxml4.dll</span></strong><strong><br />
<strong><span>net&nbsp; start&nbsp; vss</span></strong></strong></span></li><li><span>Close the command prompt and reboot your system.</span></li><li><span>Try restoring your system with the available system restore points.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Try this and revert us&nbsp;with the status of the issue, we will be glad to assist you further.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks you.</span></p>

Solution to Fix Youtube or Other Embedded Flash Video No Sound in External Websites<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If needed update your sound drivers.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see if the
<br />
version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take several tries depending
<br />
on how many rollbacks it does.<br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Repeated Blue Screen of Death - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> l mttrs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repeated Blue Screen of Death</h2>
                    When I booted up my desktop PC one day, it took a little while for it to do its little 'intro', but then all of the sudden it goes into the Blue Screen of Death. This is what it says: "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We'll restart for
 you.". But when it restarts, it does the same thing, takes a while, then crashes. It keeps doing that over and over again. I wonder if it's something to do with it's RAM amount, because it's only got 2GB of RAM. Or it could be the processer too, the processer
 is an Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU 6400 @ 2.13GHz. I may have to get a bigger amount of RAM for that PC. Or who knows, it could be that it overheated. It's a Windows 10 Professional and it's version is 1709. Please respond when you can, Thanks!

<h2>            Volume buttons acting weird on SP4</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a few days I noticed my SP4 volume buttons are acting weird. I'm running a release version of W10 with no pending update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Volume up: shows a blue screen listing "Lock", "Switch user",...<br />
Volume down: dims the screen for the time button is pressed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what's going on?</p>
<p>

            I also experienced this, along with the SP4 refusing to recognize the pen near the screen as either a pen (for ink) or as a mouse.&nbsp; I took it to the Microsoft Store and in the course of several reboots, the problem went away.&nbsp; Not real comforting, as neither
 I nor the Microsoft Tech had any idea why it got better.&nbsp; It hasn't come back, though, and it's been nearly a week, so give it a half dozen reboots and see if the flakiness abates a bit.&nbsp; This is a lousy answer, but the only one I know of...

<h2>            Search feature finding nonexistent files</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes I search for a file extension (e.g., *.sdb) just so I can delete all of them and the search engine shows me files that no longer exist.&nbsp; I had over 6,000 files and tried to delete all of them&nbsp;but over 2,000 show up as non-existent.&nbsp; I get a message
 saying "Could not find this item.&nbsp; This is no longer located in (name of directory)."&nbsp;&nbsp;If the&nbsp;file no longer exists&nbsp;how can I stop&nbsp;it from showing up in a search?</p>

            <p>I should have put this question in Windows 8.1 category.&nbsp; But anyway, I figured out one way to stop them from showing up in searches and that was to move all the files in the searched directory to a new directory.&nbsp; Then the phantom files no longer show up
 when searching the new directory.&nbsp; But I am wondering if there is another way of stopping these files&nbsp;from showing up in searches. And, anyway, why would they even show up if they no longer exist (i.e., they have already been deleted)?</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t get drag and drop to work in Windows Xp SP3. It does not want to work at all.</h2>
                    I am uncertain as to when the problem started I only recently found out when I tried to drag files to the recycle bin and it would not work.&nbsp; I then tried dragging files other places but with the same results.&nbsp; Is there a way to fix this issue, perhaps
 in the registry?<br />
<br />
I had already checked all of the settings with no luck so I then did a re-install of SP3 and that fixed the problem.

    <title>Analog stick sensitivity issues&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> descy-25027e29-3b7b-4cbc-9ddb-3f4af949591d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Analog stick sensitivity issues&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Not really sure where else to put this...</p>

<p>Ever since yesterday, my right analog stick (the one used for looking around in most games I play) has been bugging out on me, where my sensitivity will get very low or even just not work at all in some cases. I can push the stick all the way to the right
 or left, but the sensitivity will act as if im barely touching the stick at all.</p>

<p>I've made sure all sensitivites in-game are adjusted to the highest available, yet it doesnt help. I've also tried it on 3 different controllers, 1 of which is only about 2 months old.</p>


<p>Has anybody else run into this problem, or know a fix?</p>


<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
There is actually a controller sensitivity option located on the console itself, that might need to be adjusted or has accidentally been adjusted without your knowledge. To access it press the Xbox guide button on the controller(big green X) &nbsp;go to Settings
 &gt; Profile &gt; Game Defaults. &nbsp; You will be presented with 3 options &nbsp;General, Action, Racing each one with its own controller changes.. &nbsp; The one you will probably want to access is General, as it contains the option for Controller Sensitivity &nbsp;and can be changed
 from Low - High.. Keep in mind those this will change it for both sticks and not just the one.</p>
<p><br />
Anyways, I hope that helps, as this is the only setting available to the console overall and not just specific games and will hopefully fix it. Let us know.</p>

<p>You could always check the game settings + XBL setting to make the sensitivity higher. My wireless controller has a somewhat "slow" sensitivity and my wired one seems to have insane sensitivity.

<p>it seems that some custom controllers of mine would be different from my original controller</p>
<p>all you need to do is change its sensitivity</p>

            <p>&nbsp; I go to Get Now, then a dialog comes up and I click Get and another dialog comes up saying I need an Adult to give me permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Yes, it's my acct. I'm admin on everything else. Office 365, One Drive, Skype and my Microsoft Partner acct. All use the one central Microsoft acct. Never had a permission problem on anything. I even checked my birthday in my acct to make sure it was right.
 Sure enough, it says I was born in 1967. One online help page said to remove myself from the family settings, that also was in vain.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi marilynevans,</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>•
</span></strong><span>Were you able to get the autoplay options before?</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>•
</span></strong><span>Did you make any recent changes to the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The service that AutoPlay needs to start might not be running.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> You may try the following steps and check if it
 helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click the Start button, click All Programs, click Accessories, and then right-click Command Prompt.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Run as administrator.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. At the command prompt, type
<strong>net start shellhwdetection,</strong> and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong></span>If this solves the problem then you may try <strong>to change the Shell Hardware detection service startup type to automatic.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try the following steps to check if the
</span><strong><span>Shell Hardware detection service startup type&nbsp;is set to&nbsp;automatic.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, and type <strong>services</strong> in start search and press
<strong>Enter.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. In Services, check for
<strong>Shell Hardware detection service</strong>, and then verify that the Status column indicates Started.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. If the services are stopped, double click on the services. A window should pop up.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. In that window, ensure that the startup type is "<strong>Automatic</strong>."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Click on the
<strong>Start </strong>button in that window to <strong>start up the services</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Close the services windows.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8 slow buffering video streaming &#58;-&#40;</h2>
                    <p>Since installing Windows 8 Pro direct from MS&nbsp;onto my Dell Vostro 200 Desktop my internet connection is now so slow that I am virtually unable to watch videos on, for example, iPlayers or YouTube.&nbsp; After hours on the phone to MS Helpdesk and a complete re-install
 they advised that the problem is my Dell videocard (which previously was working absolutely seamlessly).&nbsp; Have been going around in circles on the Dell support site and have found no solution.&nbsp; My current video driver is up to date. Can anyone point me in
 the right direction to a Windows 8 compatible videocard?&nbsp; I accept that I will have to purchase this but want to ensure that a) this really is the problem and&nbsp; b) that I get the correct videocard to support Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you and for the late response.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are two aspects that are responsible for the slow streaming video. These are the computer’s ability to "play" the file and your computer’s
 ability to "receive" the file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please perform these Methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Method 1–Create More Resources to Receive the file<br />
</strong>Receiving the video requires that you have the proper amount of space needed to load the video temporarily. The video will be loaded in to your Web Cache. If this area is full, the video will be slow streaming. To clear the web cache&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Click Start, click Control Panel, and then double-click&nbsp; Internet&nbsp;Options. <br />
&nbsp; 3. On the General tab, click Delete Files under Temporary Internet Files. <br />
&nbsp; 4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the Delete all offline content check box , and then click OK.
<br />
&nbsp; 5. Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Open the task manager by pressing CTRL-ALT-DELETE. Click the application tab. End all programs, you are not using. You can also speed up your computer and streaming video by cutting down on your startup programs. Here is how:
<br />
1.Click Start <br />
2.Click Program Files <br />
3.Choose Accessories <br />
4.Click RUN <br />
5.Type MSCONFIG, then Enter <br />
6. In the System Configuration window, Click Startup <br />
7. Uncheck all the programs that are unnecessary</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Method 2–Stop Choppy Playback</strong><br />
To stop choppy playback and slow video streaming is to Disable the use of hardware acceleration.<br />
Click on Start <br />
1. Click Control Panel and Click Display <br />
2. Select the Settings tab and click on the Advanced. <br />
3. Click on the Troubleshoot tab. <br />
4. Disable the hardware acceleration completely by dragging the slider to the extreme left.<br />
</span><span>　</span><span><br />
You can change the default buffer settings in Windows Media Player, use instructions below:<br />
1.Start Windows Media Player <br />
2.Click the View <br />
3.Click Options <br />
4.On the Advanced tab, click Streaming Media(Windows Media) 5.Click Change to alter the buffer settings.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Increase Virtual Memory:<br />
1.Click Start, and then click Control Panel. <br />
2. Click Performance and Maintenance, and then click System. <br />
3. On the Advanced tab, under Performance, click Settings. <br />
4. Under Virtual memory, click Change. <br />
5. Under Drive [Volume Label], click the drive that contains the paging file that you want to change. In most computers its C:
<br />
6. Under Paging file Size for selected drive, click to Custom size check box. You can enter the amount of memory you would like to reserve for Virtual memory by entering the initial and maximum size.
<br />
7. Click Set</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Method 3–Tweak Your Internet Connection</strong><br />
Ways to Speed Up your Internet Connection<br />
1.Stop Background Updating <br />
2.Port Blocking <br />
3.Control Your Antivirus <br />
4.Improve Cabling <br />
5.Using DNS Servers</span></p>
<p><span><br />
To Fix Online Video Buffering Problems : If you are using Internet Explorer, Please perform these steps and check if it helps:<br />
1. Open the Internet Explorer browser and then click the "Start" button.<br />
2. Click "Internet Explorer" and then click the "Safety" button.<br />
3. Click "Preserve Favorites website data" to preserve the cookies associated with those websites in your "Favorites" list. This is recommended for fast retrieval of those websites when you click on a link.<br />
4. Click "Temporary Internet files" and "Cookies," then click "Delete." Other options for deletion include "History," "Form data," "Passwords" and "InPrivate Filtering data."<br />
5. Close out of additional Internet Explorer tabs and windows except for the one that displays streaming video. Attempt to play the video again. If buffering problems continue, go to the next step.<br />
6. Click the "Start" button and then click "All Programs."<br />
7. Click "Accessories" and then click "System Tools."<br />
8. Click "Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)" and then attempt to play the video. If buffering problems continue, go to the next step.<br />
9. Contact the support department of the website where the video is displayed. Ask for recommendations on way to eliminate video buffering problems with videos displayed on the site.</span></p>

<p>Hi Scott, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be a compatibility issue using an upgraded Windows 7 PC between the drivers. We would suggest that you install updated drivers via Windows Update using this

link</a>. If the issue persists, you may need to download the updated drivers manually on your manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to get back to us if you need further assistance. </p>

<h2>            What&#39;s the point of Store credit that you can&#39;t use&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was given a Visa gift card from work for Christmas, which as it turns out cannot be used to buy stuff on the Xbox Store. Ok, that makes sense. No worries. But I used said gift card to purchase an Xbox Store gift card. The game I was trying to buy with this is Fallout 3, obviously an Xbox 360 game. That's when I found out that Microsoft has a policy that prevents Microsoft store credit from being used to buy backwards compatible games.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>This is the dumbest policy I've heard of! If I use my money to get credit on my account, I should be able to use it for anything. But no. Microsoft puts limits on how I can use the credit I buy. What is the purpose of that rule? Meanwhile, I have $15 for Xbox one. Which will only get me lower budget games that I have no interest in playing. That money&nbsp;is going to sit there for a long time.&nbsp;</p>

As for Fallout 3, Game Of The Year Edition does exist.</p><p><br /></p><p>Perhaps you should discuss your issue with Xbox Support.<br /></p>

            I'm with you, Crimson. I am royally peeved with this. It's been a waste of time, money and effort to figure out what went wrong and that I will not get what I want with MY MONEY that Microsoft is now holding hostage. After hours of trying to figure this
 out, YOURS is the best answer I've found. Thanks and sorry for your inconvenience. At least we know better now. Shame on us for thinking an Xbox card would be buying us Xbox games. :rolleyes:

<p>Xbox 360 BC games use the old marketplace rules of purchase as they are run through an emulator for xbox one, this is why you need a valid method of payment linked to your account.</p>

            Hey there, due to some limitations, you cannot buy Xbox 360 BC games on an Xbox One without a Credit Card.&nbsp; Therefore, Xbox 360 games can only be purchased on the Xbox 360 using Microsoft Store Credit.

            I ran into this recently as well as I didn't know about the 360 games policy.&nbsp; Luckily I believe Fallout 3 is on Game Pass, so you can enjoy it there.&nbsp; My best advice is pick out a XBO game you enjoy and use the credit on that!
