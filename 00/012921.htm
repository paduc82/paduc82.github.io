<h2>            Messages not sending</h2>
                    I have tried sending messages to multiple people but the messages status is stuck on "sending...". &nbsp;I am connected to WiFi. &nbsp;The top of the page also says "connecting....". &nbsp;What should I do to get my messages through? &nbsp;Thank you very much for your help.

</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum.</p>

</p><p>Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app? Also, are you connected to a private network?
<span>Private networks are likely to have a firewall, and it may have been configured to block all access to exactly the ports Skype is trying to use. Try disabling your personal firewall altogether and connecting to Skype -- if it still doesn't work, the network
 you're using is likely to be at fault. In this case, you'll have to get in touch with your network administrator to know how to solve the issue.</span></p>

    <title>Outlook 365 missing contacts while composing emails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 365 missing contacts while composing emails</h2>
                    <p>Today, I purchased a subscription to Microsoft office 365. Everything works just fine except for Outlook 365. I imported my contacts from Windows live Mail into Outlook. When I click the people button, all my contacts are there. However, when I go to create
 an email message and click the To: button, or the CC: button, none of my contacts show up. I went into account settings and checked that I only have one data file. I then went into contact properties and the show this folder as an email address book was already
 checked but it was also grayed out. How do I get new emails to recognize my contacts. This is preventing me from sending emails. I can still reply and forward emails.&nbsp; I found a number of solutions on the Internet however, for all of the ones I found, I could
 not figure out where to preform the operations they were talking about. Can someone please help me with detailed instructions for Outlook 365/2016. I would appreciate it very much. As always, if you have any questions or comments please respond.</p>

            Because none of the solutions I found on the Internet worked to solve my problem, I had to come up with my own solution. Through research I learned that the reason the addresses were not showing up while creating new emails was because there was no email
 address listed in the Outlook people option. To fix this, I had to map the column email address to address from the .CSV into Outlook. As soon as the people option that email addresses, address book then contained addresses to select when creating new emails.
 It was that simple.

                    <p>
</p><p>Hi. &nbsp;I've been using Office:mac 2011 for awhile and have been updating automatically&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden the program is not allowing me to use the product without activating it. &nbsp;But I paid for it and activated it already. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And there is no way for me to put in my product key or anything. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>
<p>thanks&nbsp;</p>

            Usually, if you have Office 2011 that you bought (as opposed to rented via Office 365), the activation warning will include a place to input your 25-character product key. But it doesn't sound like you're seeing that. Have you ever subscribed to Office
 365 on this computer? What is the exact message you're seeing? You can also create a screen shot and post it here using the square icon with a dot and jagged shape, that will help us out.

            <p>Thanks so much for the speedy reply! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never subscribed to Office 365 but may have agreed to a free trial that came thru with one of the updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what happens-</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I open a file now it is a read only file with a message that says "Activate Office to Crate and Edit. &nbsp;Buy Office or sign in to activate Office if your've already bought it." &nbsp;When I click on this the next screen says: "Activate Office to Create and
 Edit. . . To start editing documents, buy Office or sign in to activate Office if you've already bought it." &nbsp;Then there are 2 choices
<strong>Buy Office&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Already bought Office? &nbsp;Sign in.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I sign in. &nbsp;The next screen says: Sign in . . . What email address or phone number would you like to use to sign in to Word? &nbsp;If you already have an account that you use with Office or other Microsoft services, enter it here. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I enter my email address: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp;The next screen asks for my password, which I put in. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the next screen, it says:&nbsp;<strong>NO LICENSE FOUND &nbsp;</strong>No license was found for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp;Buy Office for this account or use another account to activate Office if you've already bought it. &nbsp;Under this it says:</p>
<p><strong>Buy Office </strong>and <strong>Use Another Account &nbsp;</strong>and <strong>
Skip for now </strong>which brings me back to my read only doc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nowhere where I can enter the Product Key or other info. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for whatever help you can provide. In the meantime, its OpenOffice!</p>

            <p>You have a real problem :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow, your registration has been wiped out. &nbsp;Possibly by the trial version. Since you never purchased an Office 365 licence, it now can't activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the first time I have heard it getting itself into such a mess with an Office 2011 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid your only option now is to ring Microsoft Support. They will be able to help you to re-install Office 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can't do it here: they have to give you a special one-time download to get the installer back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry.</p>

<h2>            Insider preview software activation 14926</h2>
                    <p>Can we activate a Insider Preview version of&nbsp; release 14926</p>
<p>Ok i know this has all been asked before .......</p>
<p>Only reason i ask, is that i was running under Oracle VirtualMachine and the latest version does not work. As per the feedback known issues list</p>
<p>It wont let me move the vm to Hyper-v and activate, for obvious reasons that it is a different hardware platform</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i don't want to do is spend money on a new license just to test Insider fastlane software under hyper-v when it was working under an Oracle VM setup</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to microsoft.&nbsp; Is this possible, or are you saying that i have to buy a new license just to continue testing your software</p>
<p>Why don't they release a testing key that will expire after x number of days/weeks</p>
<p>
</p><p>No way am i buying another license when i have already obtained 5 licenses</p>
<p>2 for testing Insider releases via Fast and slow lane and 3 x production</p>
<p>Otherwise please release an Insider preview that will run on Oracle VirtualMachine</p>
<p>Any comments would be greatfully accepted</p>
<p>

            Short answer is no. You need a computer that has already been activated. To check your activation status go to an admin command prompt and type slmgr /xpr.

            <p>If your VM has a Digital License for Windows 10, do not delete the VM! You may lose that Digital License.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new Activation Troubleshooter may allow you to move that Digital License to Hyper-V, by installing Windows 10 14393 to a Hyper-V VM and then running the Troubleshooter. Choose that you have changed hardware recently and it may list the Computer Name

</p><p>I have seen this many times, but have never actually tried to move the Digital License from one device to another. It won't let you move from a laptop to a desktop PC, as those are seen as different types of device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't move the Digital Licence, running Windows 10 without activation has only minor, cosmetic limitations (Personalization) but at this point in time, it has no time limit for other functionality and appears that it would run indefinitely without
 activation. You can put an un-activated Windows 10 version 1607 device in the Fast or Slow Ring for Insider Preview and run it that way in Hyper-V until a VirtualBox compatible build is released for your existing VM.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Olga
<br />
<br />You cannot merge two Skype accounts as such . . .
<br />
<br />What you can do, is copy your contacts form one account to the other and move any Skype credit from one account to the other . . .
<br />
<br />Copy Skype Contacts:

            Hi OlgaT2 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />My sincere apologies. Merging of 2 Skype accounts is not possible. 
<br />
<br />However, if you want to continue with only one account, you can transfer Skype Credits and Contacts to your other account so that credits are not wasted and contacts are not lost. You can use both accounts using their respective Skype IDs.
<br />
<br />Transfer Skype Credits through Gifting

            Not to be sarcastic, but <span style="font-weight: bold">File&gt; Open</span> is about the only suggestion based on nothing more than what you've provided.<br />
<br />
Assuming that you have already tried that but have not been successful you'll need to be more far descriptive of the circumstances. What does happen? Any error message or dialog? If so, what is the exact wording? Nobody can offer any responsible replies unless
 you fully describe the issue.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming the document actually contains <span style="font-weight: bold">Links</span> to Excel files which are not available, but that's just a guess.<br />
<br />

            What does "great trouble" mean, exactly?<br />
<br />
Did you just try copying the files using Windows Explorer ( to your phone and its memory card under "Nokia Phone Browser" )?<br />
<br />
You can also connect the phone in USB mass storage (and not PC Suite) mode with the USB cable, and then, again, use Windows Explorer to copy files (including pictures) to the memory card.

 tried reinstalling the drivers, using it in another computer, but nothing works. What can it be ? I'm worried I will have to buy another because they are expensive on my city.

            Word 2011 uses a new Equation Engine. &nbsp;The equations produced by that cannot be stored in .doc format, that format doesn't know about the new equation format. &nbsp;So Word downgrades them to bitmaps.

            The publisher has an automated submission system which only processes .doc.<br />
<br />
But if you e-mail them and ask nicely, they manually process .docx, so that is the workaround for now.<br />

<p>But that means I've to lose my real-time protection &amp; have to find some other antivirus that doesn't slow my exe icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another antivirus softwares never slow down my exe icons like this I've test many of them.</p>
<p>It's been than 5 years that is issue never been fix since MSE from XP era till now.</p>
<p>You should take this seriously fix about this issue already I can't tell is this kind of bug or WD's weakness itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tons of 1470 treasures I want to test it out on W10. All of them are 100% cleaned free &amp; open source softwares.</p>
<p>There are not only regular W10 testers there're also software testers, malware/ virus stress testers among W10 insider preview.</p>
<p>So these exe icons need the revealed faster like when turned off WS's real time protection.</p>
<p>Hope you fix exe icon loading icons more like normal in real time protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Yes, I agree with original poster! Windows defender is causing same issue with mine. Not as many exe files in a folder as 1400 but I have one with about 30 and it's slow to build the icons for .exe because of defender. It's only first time I open, after
 that it's instant - until the next reboot when the same happens! turning off real time protection and it's instant!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has an annoying side effect when I reboot. My desktop displays and some of the shortcut icons on here takes a few seconds to display. They have white generic paper icons on some of them before they draw properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This needs addressing by MS I think</p>

            <p>Thanks for responding. It is a mix of exe files. Some are from locally installed media but most are downloaded (mainly digital game distributors such as origin or steam) but are trustworthy. It's definetely defender to blame. If I set exclusions for a folder
 the issue disappears. I don't mind defender scanning exe files but not at the expense of drawing the icon for immediate viewing. It seems on googling the net this is not an uncommon issue and has plagued users of both security essentials (on Windows 7) and
 persists on defender and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for not being too well informed, when you mention feedback app, what/where is this? Is this a website or do I have to do it from defender settings within Windows 10 itself? Or could I report this from my iOS phone (on which I am typing this email now).</p>

more rendering issues</span> in many cases. Not to mention tracking protection and advanced security options are critical for a smooth browsing experience to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>Since I'm not on the build I can't say for sure it hasn't changed, but have you checked "<strong>Turn Windows Features On &amp; Off</strong>"? It (Windows Features)&nbsp;was previously found in the&nbsp;sidebar of "<strong>Programs and Features</strong>"&nbsp;in Control
 Panel (accessible by typing "<strong><em>control</em></strong>" in the run dialog { WIN+R }). It's possible they just disabled it.</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><del>You could also try getting Internet Explorer from the Microsoft website, though it may stop you depending on the user agent:

            <p>Hi Tomislav,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern, let me help you with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not all your LinkedIn contacts did no reflect on your Outlook page, it is possible that&nbsp;the
<strong>Data sharing with third-party applications&nbsp;</strong>setting from LinkedIn is not checked from your contacts' account. Have them verify if this is enabled, so you can view them from your account.</p>
<p>

 where you could check to not print graphics. I don't see that option in Pub 2010 but the way you describe your problem it sounds like this option is selected.</p>
<p>Try saving your publication as a pdf file. Do the&nbsp;graphics show up in the pdf file? Can you print the pdf file as a temporary workaround?</p>
<p>Check to see if there is a new updated driver for your printer. Just google "HP photosmart 3100 driver" and see if that gives you the page on the HP site for drivers for this printer and see if there is a newer driver.</p>

Your account has been temporarily suspended<br />
Someone may have used your account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to send out a lot of junk messages or done something else that
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ive contacted customer support and they said there is a problem with Hotmail India service and said there are many users experiencing&nbsp; the same problem, but this is now almost a month, and they still say they are working on it which is unbelievable, and
 they said they dont know when they are going to fix it(everything on the support ticket)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im&nbsp;really frustrated with the way Microsoft is dealing on customer support, anybody facing the same issue? or know how to unblock the account? please help me.</p>

<h2>            Cannot open Word file&#58; The XML data is invalid according to the schema.</h2>
                    Dear Support,
<div><br />
<div>Here is another classic..</div>
<div>Editing/correcting my thesis, which is a 166MB, 250+page document. This is a pain as it is, since Word is super slow and freezes all the time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, now I can't even open the file any more, since there appears to be an error in the document.xml.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I tried opening and editing document.xml with Oxygen, but the editor displays 91 errors (!), which even increase when I fix some end tags.</div>
<div>Apparently this has been an issue for quite a while now with Word, with an appropriate fix from Microsoft still lacking.</div>
<div>The live chat support couldn't have been of less use.</div>
<div>Dear Microsoft, do you find it acceptable to have your software randomly smash documents beyond recovery?</div>
<div><br />

<span><font color="#000000">From the provided description, I understand that you're unable to open a Word document.<br />
<br />
I know how this concerns you and will assist you to resolve this issue.<br />
<br />
A quick question before proceeding:<br />
<br />
How are you editing the XML data? Do you rename the Word file to ZIP and edit the XML file or are you the editing XML file from option available in
<strong><span>Developer</span></strong> tab?<br />
<br />
A normal 250+ pages Word document won't be more than couple of MB.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Do you have any images in the document or any other type of objects which is causing Word document to
 be 166MB size file?<br />
</font></span><span><br />
<font color="#000000">You may also refer to the following article for instructions on how to open a damaged Word document and see if it helps:<br />

<p>I don't know why you think a 250-page thesis shoud be only a couple of MB. Technical reports with lots of diagrams can easily be more. My 140 page diagram, which also has the above problem, is 118MB (and that's with all the images compacted).</p>
<p>I am not editing XML data, this is just something that happened to my document. PLease explain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I updated today to 7.5, everything went smooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to see my contacts there was no contacts at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I removed my facebook and gmail contact account and reconnected them for the same result, while syncing these account the bar show the right number of contacts but I can't find them on the pepole hub, also I made sure the filter are off and all account are
 sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>strange thing is that the contact do exists when I receive a call the contact picture name appears and when I do search google directory I can find my goole contacts (but not my Facebook one)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>to share it to my office static ip.</p>

<p>We have windows 7 &amp; 8 users and no AD-sync which means everyone has to log in all the time.</p>
<p>Would make it so much easier to open the site without login to my office ip, still unable to do anything without login in but to browse the first page.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>hi stefan,<br />
<br />
we can't access sharepoint team sites directly like a public website inside office, because of the authentication stage.<br />
<br />
regarding your requirement, you can consider the workaround by clicking<strong> keep me signed in</strong> when logging to office 365 portal.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0ebb8d80-9dc9-4870-953e-86d53dbc04a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0ebb8d80-9dc9-4870-953e-86d53dbc04a5" /></a><br />
after that, your login information will be remembered in the local cache. so your sharepoint sites can be opened with no need to login again.<br />
<br />

                    I use excel spreadsheet (XP). I am working on a spreadsheet. The first column has many names down the rows. In the several columns to the right are data pretaining to each name. I would like to sort the "names" column into alpha order, but I want each
 of the several data columns of info to carry out the same sort as the "names" column. In simple terms, can you describe how I should do that. Thanks

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your question is unclear.&nbsp; Do you want to simply sort the first column of your database in ascending order?&nbsp; You must select the entire database (first row is the header row) and then under Data &gt; Sort, select the heading of the first column and sort in
 ascending order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p><span><span>Skype video calls doesn’t have any logs and Skype does not allow video and audio recording features to protect consumer’s security and privacy. You may
 search for available third-party applications that function as a recording which can be used side by side with Skype but this types of application should be used at your own risk for you to have a video calls logs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information helps.</span></span></p>
