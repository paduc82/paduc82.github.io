<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;Update&#34; Causing Fan to Go Fast&#47;Mad &#40;May 2019&#41;</h2>
                    Last week I received a cumulative update from Windows, number <span>KB346084</span>. I noticed the fan started going crazy whenever I was using Edge, other than that it worked fine, so I deleted this specific update. The fan was no longer going crazy but
 it made the laptop extremely slow and hang on webpages for like a minute, so I used Windows Update Troubleshooter to try and solve the problem.&nbsp; I received the message "Potential Windows Update Database Error Detected" everything else was working fine though.
 I also did a HP hardware diagnostic and it stated the hardware was also working fine.
<br />
From this I reinstalled the update KB346084 manually. The laptop was no longer slow but the crazy fan action was back. I've reinstalled all the relevant drivers and cleared the Update Temp folder to end all pending downloads and updated Windows updates manually.
 I also did a DISM online restore health. However Windows Update Trouble Shooter is still telling me&nbsp;<span>"Potential Windows Update Database error detected", and the fan is still going nuts whenever using the Edge browser, for seemingly no reason. I'm using
 Windows 10 version 1803.</span><br />
Rather than wait for another Windows Update, that may or may not solve the issue, has anyone had a similar problem they've solved? The fan speeding up and down all the time is driving me nuts.

            Hi Simon
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If the update is not installing or making your system unstable, I would remove the update and block it from installation. 
<br />
<br />Due to the millions of configurations out there, some might not be fully compatible with a particular cumulative update.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart into Normal mode then check if stability/functionality is restored. If it is, proceed with the next steps.
<br />
<br />What I recommend you do is block the update for the time being and report it in the Feedback Hub so the Windows engineers are aware of the issue. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-submit-a-suggestion-or-bug-report-in-windows-10-using-feedback-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-su...</a>
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. 
<br />
<br />You can also try upgrading to the latest Windows 10, version 1903.
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

            Hi Simon
<br />
<br />If you are having difficulty with KB346084, that most likely means your Windows 10 system is still on version 1803 . .. 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what Version No. of Windows 10 are you running?
<br />
<br />If you are still on version 1803, your best option would be to update to version 1903, which should resolve any issues you have been having with Windows 10
<br />
<br />Click the link below, then click 'Update Now' on that page to immediately get 1903 and bring your PC right up to date

            Okay, as mentioned, I've already deleted the update and it literally made the laptop unusable. So deleting it and blocking it isn't going to work. The reason I'm using Windows 10 v.1803 is because 1809, just like this update, made my laptop unusable. So
 I don't want to update at all until I am forced to do so. And if/when I am forced to do so I should have the option of rolling back to 1803 if necessary.<br />
I've already tried to System Restore to a previous date but Windows refused to do it. I've also attempted to do a fresh install and keep files, Windows refused to do it.
<br />
It seems like you're telling me I have to do a restore to factory settings. I don't fancy doing that as it's extremely time consuming. Is there not a solution that does not involve wasting loads of time?

            My previous recommendation was to remove that offending update and block it from ever installing again. 
<br />
<br />Report the issue in the feedback hub then try installing the update that eventually succeeds that cumulative update that is causing your fan to spin up.

            Yes I'm using 1803. The reason I'm using 1803 is because 1809 deleted loads of my apps and made them unusable. I don't want to update to anything, unless I am forced to do so. Is there no solution that does not include Windows update potentially doing
 more harm than good?

            As mentioned I did uninstall it and it made the laptop unusable. Blocking it won't make any difference as the damage was done downloading it in the first place. Which is why I guess your next suggestion was "upgrade" to version 1903, to overwrite the damage
 done by the update. However as mentioned I'm using 1803 because 1809 deleted and made Apps unusable.&nbsp; I don't want to upgrade to anything that may potentially do more damage than good.

            Well, my only other suggestion would be to perform a repair upgrade of Windows 10 1803 which will downgrade the build back to 17134.1, which was the original release of Windows 10 1803. 
<br />
<br />download Windows 10 1803 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1803 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />You can right click the ISO, click Mount
<br />Launch setup then perform a repair upgrade:

            Okay, that's a new one to me so thanks for that. But my guess is that will delete all my data same as a Restore to Factory Settings install. Might just wait and see if the next windows update solves the problem. Depends how nuts the fan speeding up and
 down all the time drives me.

<br />
<br />If you wish to stick with version 1803,click the link below to get KB4499183 which is the latest cumulative update for 1803, released on 20 May. Hopefully installing that will fix this fan issue for you . . .

<h2>            Subtitle not displaying</h2>
                    Hi everyone, <br />
<br />
I played a movie from a DVD drive, run by windows media player or Classic player, the subtitles working fine. However after I copied the whole DVD content to my PC's hard drive and opened the film but the subtitle was not there. I tried with Cyber Power DVD
 player to open the whole copied content but nothing works, the sub won't appear either.&nbsp; I right-clicked on that apps, the menu appeared except the Primary Subtitle and Secondary Subtitle were grey ( submerged and not available). Then I tried using that Apps
 to browse the content from the DVD drive and the result was amazing, the subtitle was back there again and the Primary Subtitle and Secondary Subtitle appeared on the Right-click menu. What is the problem? The difference is : Sub works on DVD but won't works
 on hard drive.&nbsp; I am sure that I have copied entirely the content from the DVD, nothing missing. Please help! I
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Hi Wilson, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you checked the issue in a different computer? </p>
<p>2. Is this issue confined to a specific DVD? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like the movie DVD could be copy protected and the subtitle is embedded into the video.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to play the DVD from a different computer after copying the contents. Also you can play a different DVD and check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Provide more information so that we could help you further.

            DVD video file are mostly in .VOB format and subtitles are most likely&nbsp;embedded&nbsp;with the video files.Use VLC media player,it can show the&nbsp;embedded&nbsp;subtitle file.Hope it helps.

<h2>            Program too big to fit in memory</h2>
                    Just installed windows XP media center on a Dell 600M laptop, 512 Mb memory with a 50 G hard drive. Install was fine but when I try to the drivers or any executable application for that matter, it flashes on the command prompt and disappears without ever
 executing the application, file or program. I decided to try running the executables in DOS and captures the error there which was: "Program too big to fit in memory"&nbsp; It doesn't matter what exe I try running. Tried exe's from dell for video, network and audio.
 even tried various Zip extractor programs and they wouldn;t install either e.g&nbsp; winxip, winrar, 7zip, Zip reader. I also tried using a scaled down version of XP pro without the media center, same results. Tried safe mode, same results. Any ideas please?

            Hi! In this case you can either try to fix it yourself or send it to Microsoft in order to let them repair it/send you a replacement.

<h2>            Abo k&#38;&#35;252&#59;ndigen geht nicht&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo, leider ist meine finanzielle lage derzeit an einem tiefpunkt. ich dachte noch daran habs aber dann doch vergessen mich um mein ablaufendes abo zu kümmern, jetzt ist die zahlung seit anfang des monats fällig, ich kann nicht mehr online(nichtmal um
 freunden zu mailen das ich grad nicht online spielen kann) oder den support erreichen(laufende fehlermeldungen(das hätte nicht passiren sollen ... versuchen sie es später nochmal). versuch ich jetzt das konto von dem abgebucht werden soll zu löschen darf ich
 das erst wenn das abo endfernt wurde, um das abo zu endfernen muss ich erst die fällige rechnung bezahlen und um es bezahlen zu können muss ich geld haben ... klären kann ich auch nichts wegen der bugs auf der live website und komme zum fazit typisch MS. war
 in den vergangen 20 jahren nicht anders und wird sich vermutlich nie verbessern. warum leicht wenns auch schwer geht aber das hilft mir nicht an dieser stelle. wenn hier jemand eine idee hat währe ich echt dankbar. ich muss das abbo kündigen damit ich das
 abbuchungskonto endfernen kann.</p>
<p>Mögliche antwort auf eine mögliche Frage.</p>
<p>Was ich damit bezwecke?</p>
<p>Ehrlich gesagt hab ich keine ahnung aber wenn ich mit der 360 versuche online zu gehen heist es ich solle erst mein konto einstellungen aktualisieren, da ich aber kein anderes konto(von dem abgebucht wrd, Bankkonto) hab will ich es einfach löschen und hoffen
 das ich dann zumindest wieder fehlermedungsfrei einloggen kann und hoffendlich zumindest meinen freunden eine abwesenheitsmeldung geben kann wegen fehlender goldmitgliedschaft bis ich sie wieder bezahlen kann nächsten monat.</p>

<p>da du das Kündigen vergessen hast, wird es wohl schwerlich möglich sein, die Sache online zu klären, ohne das du die ausstehende Rechnung gezahlt hast. Der beste Weg zur Klärung ist hier der Telefon Support, ich denke mal da kannst du dann auch das Abo kündigen
 und der/die SupportmitarbeirIn kann dir dann auch erklären, wie es weitergeht. Allerdings kann ich nicht ganz verstehen, warum du, bei geringen finnziellen Mitteln, ein Abo hast. Auf ebay bekommt man 12 Monte Gold zur Zeit für ca 26€ !</p>
<p>Nachrichten kann man übrigens auch mit einem Graitis Account verschicken. Du könntest dir also solch einen zusätzlich einrichten und deinen Xbox Freunden damit schreiben.

<p>ich habs schlichtweg verpennt mich rechzeitig drum zu kümmern(das meinte ich oben damit). der tatsechliche preis beträgt ca 27,50€ bei ebay.</p>
<p>Die frage ist doch die ob nur eine tatsechliche zahlung aushilft oder ob es reicht ein code einzugeben für das ganze jahr um die sperre wieder aufzuheben?! aber ich werd mal anrufen sofern ich die nummer finde. danke für die antwort :)</p>

 mich übern 3. anbieter zur richtigen seite auf der Live website. schade das es so umständlich ist, währe doch schöner wenn amn die zeiten direkt angezeigt bekähme wenn man auf support klickt.</p>

<p>Abschließend kann ich berichten das es da ne möglichkeit gibt mein problem zu lösen, das telefonat war sehr informativ und net. das man momentan keinen zugriff auf den chat hat etc liegt an MS, die haben wohl gravirende system probleme und der support kann
 momentan auch nur oberflächlich statfinden.</p>

<p>solltest du dir auf ebay wirklich 12 Monate kaufen wollen, dann warte noch bis zum WE, da wid es nämlich wieder heißer und dann fallen wieder die Preise ( zumindest meistens ; ) ). Vor ein paar Tagen lag der Preis noch bei ~25,80€ , in Richtung Xmas geht
 er dann wieder auf ca 33€... </p>

<p>naja gehört zwar eigentlich in den Rewards Thread...</p>
<p>für Erfolge also Gamerscore bekommt man keine Rewards Punkte ! (denken anfangs aber viele)</p>
<p>unter "MeineMissionen" kannst du sehen wie du Punkte verdienen kannst und lies dir auch dringend die FAQ durch, insbesondere zu den monatlichen Missionen ! solltest du dazu noch mehr Fragen haben, dann bitte im Rewards Thread.</p>

<p>You might be having memory issues and or an issue with win-10 fast start features,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disable Fast startup<br />
Use Winkey+X or right click the start button and click on Power options<br />
Click the link on the top left Change what the power button does<br />
Center paragraph click Change settings currently unavailable<br />
Uncheck Use fast startup recommended<br />
Now when you shut down win-10 will not use Fake shutdown started in win-8 which is Hibernation on steroids.</p>

<h2>            Win10 failed reset now no operating system...how do I reinstall for free&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I tried resting windows 10 on an older computer because every time it tried to update it crashed.&nbsp; It got stuck at 22% for more than 24 hours so I aborted by hitting the power button.&nbsp; Upon restarting I find that it has no operating system on it so I have
 no more recovery options.&nbsp; I know how to download Win10 and burn onto a DVD and install from there, but given that I don't have Win10 on that computer anymore I want to make sure to do this and not have to pay (since I upgraded during the free year).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded this computer from windows 8 during the free upgrade period, and how to reinstall and still be free is not clear to me.&nbsp; What must I do to get win10 back on my computer for free?</p>

<p><span>Select Start, Control Panel, Folder Options, View, Advanced Settings and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected
 operating system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You need to look rather than search.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is also a System 32 folder located in the "I386" folder on your Windows CD. This System 32 folder contains the compressed form of your Windows XP start-up files.
 If you ever need to replace a System 32 file on your computer's hard drive, you can extract the needed file from the I386 folder on your Windows operating system CD.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The normal way to replace a damaged or missing file is to run System File Checker. This can get complicated where the operating system is SP3 and the CD is SP2 or
 earlier. What is the situation on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Select, Start, Run, type sfc /scannow and press ENTER</span></p>

<p>I didn't look at the User Guide for the MG2260 until I had typed the first 4 points below.&nbsp; The solution to your problem is probably point 5, but if you can't solve it by reading the User Guide, please answer the first 4 points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Why can you not print from Windows Photo Viewer?&nbsp; What happens when you click the "Print" button?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f41c4ddf-a51a-4a75-bd67-0df755742e66?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f41c4ddf-a51a-4a75-bd67-0df755742e66?upload=true" height="449" width="488" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; When you say "goes to Windows Photo Viewer" do you mean that when the scan is completed Windows Photo Viewer automatically opens showing the scanned image or do you mean something else?&nbsp; Please clarify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Notice in the above screenshot that the Title Bar shows "IMG_0206.JPG - Windows Photo Viewer".&nbsp; What is the name of the file shown when your scan "goes to Windows Photo Viewer"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Are you initiating a scan by using the controls on the MG2260 or from a program on your computer?&nbsp; If the latter, are you using Canon's IJ Scan Utility, Windows Fax and Scan, or something else?&nbsp; Please specify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; Have you checked to see that the settings in Canon's IJ Scan Utility are configured the way you want them?</p>

<p>Hi LemP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to you questions,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When I try to print from Photo Viewer the printer produces a blank page</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Yes, the file automatically opens in Photo Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The file name at top right shows whatever file I am trying to print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I am initiating the scan using 'Windows Fax &amp; Scan' on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. How do I access Canon IJ Scan Utility?</p>

<p>Hi Again LemP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did reply to your previous message, but you may not have received it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When I click 'print' from Windows Photo Viewer, the printer starts and a blank page is produced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When I click on 'Windows Fax and Scan' on my computer, the window appears; I click on 'New Scan' and the scan appears with the file name 'Image' above a image of the scan. When I click on 'Image' the scan opens in Windows Photo Viewer with the file name
 'Image' I do realise that I can rename this file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I am initiating the scan from my computer by clicking on 'Windows Fax and Scan'</p>
<p>Some time ago I did call the Canon help line but they were unable to assist. They suggested I contact Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. How can I access scan utility for a Canon Pixma MG 2260? I can't seem to do it online.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Hugh.</p>

            <p>I have a very similar problem but unlike Preyash, so far it is confined to one particular user on one particular machine (Win 10 Home 64bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done is to un-install the last piece of software that was "updated" (and restarted etc. etc.). . . . that did not cure the problem.&nbsp; All very odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I have re-installed that software (which I guess was not the problem) I will come back to here and report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For sure having "File Explorer" "Not respond" is something that is very worrying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bye for now<br />

</p><p>Ah! A "teacher" used to say at school . . ."There is always a clue in the question!"<br />
<br />
I NOW&nbsp;think that what I have is a corrupt profile!&nbsp; I will try to address that issue first (having re-installed the falsely accused software!)<br />
<br />
I will report back<br />

</p><p>The "software" was re-installed and the Explorer problem has gone away&nbsp; . . . . .&nbsp;Therefore I am NOT going to fiddle with "Corrupt profiles"</p>

            <p>Sorry, but it did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>However, I found my own solution.</p>
<p>Win&nbsp;8 saved the "old" Windows as Win.old.&nbsp; I opened it and found Notepad, which worked just fine.&nbsp; Using the new "pin" method in Win 8, I pinned Notepad from the "old" Windows to the Start menu. It works beautifully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion anyway.&nbsp; I'll keep a copy of that for future troubleshooting situations.</p>

<p>If your report is to be believed you are currently only at service pack 2. Windows Updates no longer works unless you are at service pack 3.</p>
<span>
<p><span>Install SP3, </span><span>but before you do, read this article…</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717</a></span></p>
<p><span>…and if your PC is an HP Pavilion, Presario or Media Center and has an AMD processor&nbsp;you need to install this patch before installing SP3…</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;softwareitem=pv-60484-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;softwareitem=pv-60484-2</a></span></p>
<p><span>...to find out if you have an AMD processor...</span></p>
<span>
<ul>
<li><span>Hold down the Windows key (between Ctrl and Alt) and hit the Pause Break key</span>
</li><li><span>Look for&nbsp;your processor type in the Computer: section</span></li></ul>
</span>
<p><span>Then install SP3 by downloading and running from...</span></p>

<p><span>…you can ignore the text that says that it is for network installations and also ignore the text advising Windows/Microsoft Update if only updating one PC.</span></p>
<p><span>Then try and get up to date with Windows Updates.</span></p>

    <title>Placing a Folder in Two Places - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e. sterling sylvester  say:</h3>
<h2>            Placing a Folder in Two Places</h2>
                    <p>So, I'm pretty **** when it comes to organisation. I've been having this issue for a while, and I'm hoping that someone on here will be able to help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I'll have the need to place one folders of the same title and the same contents in two places; and when I add to one, I need to add to the other. I'm not looking for the "Shortcut" option because it doesn't act like a real folder in the way that
 it doesn't order with the rest of the folders and it also doesn't show up as a "folder" or option when saving from the internet. I'm also hoping there's a way that I can save some space by literally not having both contents in two places, but one folder in
 two places with one version of the content inside. Is there a way to do this? An App, a program on Windows, etc.?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently using Windows 8.1, but Windows 10 is also an option. Any help would be extremely appreciated as this issue persists and still eludes me.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>This didn't quite help. It has a lot to do with OneDrive, but I'm actually not using OneDrive in this scenario. It's not so much sharing with others either like the last portion of that. Do you happen to have anything else?</p>

</p><p>Drag and drop your folder to the new location using the right mouse button. When you let go of the mouse you'll get a menu. Click
<strong>Copy here</strong> and the folder and its contents will copied to the new location.

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gave that option a shot, but it seems like it only "copied" the contents over, not made them one folder. The number of files and their size is carried over and takes up space on my drive. Is there another option? (By the way, that's really cool information,
 I didn't know you could actually click and drag with the right mouse!)</p>

            <p>You can use the MKLink command at an administrator level. Type <strong>mklink /?</strong> to get a basic command structure</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make the downloads directory appear to be on the desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>mklink /J C:\Users\Me\Desktop\Downloads C:\Users\Me\Downloads</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want a different drive letter you can use the Subst command</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Subst Z: C:\Users\Me\Downloads</strong> means that selecting the Z: drive takes you straight to the Downloads directory. Its still the same physical location on the disk so a save in one appears in the other.</p>

            This sounds like what I might be looking for, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you give me some more basic directions to get to the command structure?&nbsp;

<h2>            From Dust Problems</h2>
                    
<p>So I got to the end of the From Dust trial and really enjoyed it so thought I would buy it. I clicked unlock full game, it took my microsoft points and then went to download the full game so I can play it. It got to 1% and stuck there and no whenever I try
 to download it it pops up "From Dust - Can't Download". So now im stuck with the Trial version of the game, and my 1200 MSP have been taken. Anyone had this happen before with a arcade game and knows how to fix it?</p>

Hi, I am having BSODs for 2 months. My laptop (Dell Inspiron 15R) is only 3 months old. I've been getting all sorts of BSODs, reformatted thrice, replaced my harddisk + RAM. Can someone advise? I used the Bluescreenviewer to view the dump files but am not sure
 what's causing the BSODs. The dell tech support suspects that it's my antivirus/firewall and ask me to turn it off. I am running Avast 6 and Comodo Firewall. I am posting the bluescreenviewer report here to see if anyone can help me with it. Thanks.<br />

Please do the following (this may not be necessary if you removed the Avast and Comodo products back in November):<br />
- use this page to scan the system to be sure that you are not infected (I suspect that your installed products are corrupted and won't produce reliable results):&nbsp;

DO NOT</span> install it yet ( <a href="http://www.carrona.org/freeav.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.carrona.org/freeav.html</a> )<br />
- uninstall all of the different antivirus, antispyware, firewall, security, internet security, security&nbsp; center, etc applications<br />
- use this link to download (and use) the free tools to remove all remnants of the previously installed programs:&nbsp;
<br />
- then install the freshly downloaded free antivirus and IMMEDIATELY udpate it!<br />
- monitor for further BSOD's<br />
<br />
There are 7 memory dumps<br />
They display 5 different BSOD error codes<br />
and they blame 4 different causes.<br />
In most cases this would be a hardware problem, but it's possible for it to be due to compatibility issues, low-level driver problems, or even malware.<br />
<br />
2 of the 3 most recent memory dumps point to NTFS.sys - the file system driver on your hard drive.&nbsp;
<br />
I'd suggest running the free Hard Drive and Memory diags from this page:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.carrona.org/hwdiag.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.carrona.org/hwdiag.html</a><br />
Post back with the results and we'll move on from there.<br />
