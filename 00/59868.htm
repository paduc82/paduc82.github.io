    <title>Gaming Picture Quality - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> axleifish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gaming Picture Quality</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so I have a 32" LG Tv screen, which plays in 1366x768 resolution. The highest picture quality that it displays is 720p, and will convert down any higher quality pictures. But, to display at '720p', it still upscales the image slightly. So, would upscaling
 a 720p image give a better picture, or should I downscaling a 1080p image? </p>
<p>Also, would running my Xbox at 720p keep it running slightly cooler, as the GPU doesn't have to work as hard? Any help and ideas on this would be greatly appreciated :)</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>It won't really make that much difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why? Because the Xbox 360 doesn't render the majority of games at 1080p natively. It upscales them. Alot of games are even upscaled to 720p.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GPU doesn't even get that hot at 1080p. I find the CPU gets alot hotter than the GPU.</p>

<p>Firstly, thanks a lot for the fast replies :) &nbsp;I had tried the opimum resolution setting before, however it chose 1080i, and although this was good on the whole, it occasionally gave extra motion blur while in fast paced games such as Forza 3, and also gave
 a slight blurring in games with a lot of detail and different textures, such as Fallout: New Vegas. Or is this just me being far too fussy about it?</p>

<p>With anything audio and visual, it's all about what's good for you. If you don't like it, and you have the option to not use it then don't use it.
</p>
<p>Blurring is more the Xbox 360s way of hiding bad anti aliasing, or lack of it. Anti aliasing is very taxing on the ancient GPU hardware the Xbox 360 has so you'll find this is a common technique used on the system along with some other techniques such as
 MSAA and the new (for consoles anyway) MLAA. Some games may allow you to turn it off.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)"><strong><span>If it is really that much of an issue, run VGA. I run VGA in order to correct the image since my TV is 16:10 instead of 16:9. It claims to be 1280x720 but actually I run
 at 1440x900 to fix the issue. The Xbox 360 doesn't work like a PC game in the matter of resolution. If you change up the res in a PC game, your frames per second will decrease dramatically but image quality will go up. On an Xbox 360, image quality doesn't
 change, because all it is doing is upscaling or downscaling the image on the TV, the 360 isn't doing any extra or less work. It is designed to render in one mode, the only difference is what level of quality is transmitted. When you change the res, you don't
 change the quality. Now, I would say that there is no difference between 720p and 1080p because most games are natively designed to run at 720p (same goes for PS3). Only a few games natively run at 1080p and they are usually arcade games that aren't the best
 looking. Some games are even natively run&nbsp;600p like some of the CODs and Halo. The only time you will really see any image quality difference is if you run interlaced vs progressive. So yes, at 1080i you will get an image that may not be up to snuff to 720p.
 And no, at your resolution you said, it is not upscaling to 720p, it is downscaling to 720p, which is fine, since for the majority of games it is the native resolution.</span></strong></span></p>

<p>OP try all options on your tv. On my old plasma with a native 480p res I ran at 720p because it looked better. I have no idea how its technically possible. Even 1080p looked better but I chose 720p. None of this made sense to me as the tv could only natively
 pump out 480p. The tv was designed to handle the higher res somehow...how I don't know. so try your tv with the various options and just take what looks best.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Marketplace Purchasing</h2>
                    <p>When I try to buy Borderlands 2 or ANY 360 game with Games with Gold, I get a message saying; "Your account is unable to make this type of purchase on Xbox.com. Please complete this transaction from your Xbox."</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing/payment-and-purchases/troubleshoot-xbox%20360-marketplace-purchasing Says that child and teen account are not allowed from buying 360 games and I have a teen account. It also says the only way to fix this is by buying
 the game from a 360 but I don't know anyone with a 360 and I just buy a Xbox One and do not want to buy a 360. What should I do? Is there any way to buy the game without a 360?</p>

                    Hello, since last night I've been getting the following Blue Screen Error: <br />
<br />
The initial session process or system process terminated unexpectedly with status of 0x00000000 (0xc0000428 0x00100720).<br />
<br />
I've tried all the automatic repair options and once or twice they managed to allow Windows to boot fully, only to quickly lock up and force a hard reset. Since then I haven't been able to get past the Blue Screen in a dozen or more attempts, even when selecting
 Safe Mode. I'm not sure what else to do.<br />

    <title>Windows media player 12 now playing mode. Autohide of controls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orsonh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows media player 12 now playing mode. Autohide of controls doesn&#39;t work any more. I toggle the option for autohide and it has no effect.</h2>
                    Under the Player tab of Windows Media Player 12 options, there's a toggle called Allow autohide of playback controls. Seems like it might have worked the first couple of days I was using it, but no more. Any way to get this working again. It applies to
 the Now Playing mode.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thanks, -Orson

<p>Hi Robin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update regularly reboots your computer to apply the changes made on your computer. Since that your computer is set on hibernate mode, we suggest that you schedule a time to restart your PC after downloading the update. Please be reminded that if
 there is a new update, it will be automatically downloads but the changes will only apply after a reboot. Please follow this step to set the time to restart your PC:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong>.</li><li>Make sure that you are on the <strong>Windows Update </strong>tab.</li><li>Under <strong>Update settings</strong>, click on <strong>Restart options</strong> link.</li><li>Under <strong>Schedule a time</strong>, toggle the slider to <strong>On</strong> and set a time.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other concerns.</p>

<p>There is no issue to solve with your devices, they are behaving precisely as designed. However, you do note an issue concerning your practices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should always follow the simple steps of saving your work, closing all applications and backing up your data before leaving your PC. These steps have been considered best practices since the inception of the PC.</p>

<p>Hibernation retains its usefulness in conjunction with a UPS, on a laptop - between the office and a remote site, etc... Times when you are not actually leaving your PC unattended.</p>

<p>I'd say standby mode is for that purpose. Anyway, I have to stop you here. This thread is getting of topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is still: How do I disable the automatic power on when hibernated?</p>

<p>Since the Wake On... features can be initiated in several ways, this would be a question for your IT department or device manufacturer's support team. We would only be guessing how your systems may be setup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are default settings for many organizations and manufacturers, not meant to be disabled. Great care should be exercised in this area.</p>

            So if I were to look for a new computer from another manufacturer what technology name or term should I look for in order to be able to disable or not have the automatic power on feature altogether.

            The process was similar to running disk check... It too said file segment unreadable... The files were not recovered. I did checked my hardware "Trouble shooting&gt;Hardware and sound&gt;configure a device" It says a drive for unknow device is not installed.
 I followed the step but at last it says drive not installed... Plz help me...Is it caused by virus...??? I tried restoring my pc but the restore point does not exist...

<h2>            Games With Gold - Problemas</h2>
                    
<p>Boa noite galera!</p>
<p>Estou com um problema e gostaria de saber se mais alguém está passando por isso!</p>
<p>É o seguinte, fiquei uns dias com problemas na internet aqui em casa, hoje finalmente consegui resolver isso e quando conectei o Xbox percebi que o jogo Hitman está disponível no Games With Gold.</p>
<p>Minha assinatura Gold havia expirado &nbsp;e só hoje por conta dessa falta de internet consegui resgatar o código para assinatura para mais um ano.</p>
<p>Porém ao entrar pra baixar o jogo, notei que não tem a opção para baixar, apenas a opção de pagamento de R$39,00 e a opção de incluir os dados do cartão de crédito...</p>
<p>O mesmo acontece quando tento adicionar o download pelo site...</p>
<p>Alguém sabe como faço pra baixar esse jogo?!</p>
<p>Tem alguma coisa a ver o fato de eu ter resgatado o código de Gold no dia de hoje?</p>
<p>Aguardo respostas!</p>

<p>Fiquei pensando que poderia ser isso mesmo!</p>

<p>Só notei este problema no Games With Gold por enquanto.</p>

    <title>Toshiba Laptop unable to install USB Drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> huttit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Toshiba Laptop unable to install USB Drivers</h2>
                    <p>It appears a Windows Update has broken the AMD&nbsp;USB drivers in this Toshiba laptop. Bought just over one year ago with Windows 8 pre-installed&nbsp;and was working fine Sunday morning and by Sunday afternoon (and since then) no USB devices have worked. The laptop
 performed a bunch of Windows updates prior to the USB devices stopping working. In Device Manager, there are 3 devices that will not accept drivers, allow for Driver Rollback or operate in any way. I've run every troubleshooter in Windows and every Fix It
 I can get from Windows Support. Nothing will install new drivers for USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now spent 9 hours troubleshooting this and running around in circles with no&nbsp;hint of a solution. This is very obviously a Windows Update that broke this functionality and all I need is a little guidance on which updates since February 16th, 2016&nbsp;would
 affect Windows Drivers and I'll remove the damn thing, but at this point my client has lost their laptop, I have spent 9 hours trying to fix something that&nbsp;we did not cause and it's absolutely aggravating as ****!</p>

            <p>I'll answer my own question with an unacceptable answer :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1, it appears that you MUST install update&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/kb/3133924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB3133924</a>. This is an optional update but should apparently be required. Although it does not in any way describe
 my issue, installing this did immediately make all of my USB Ports load correctly. The USB 3.0 hub is still not accepting any drivers to make it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2 was changing the default setting in the BIOS to disable USB3.0, thereby forcing all USB ports to USB2.0 which do load correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this ideal, nope.</p>
<p>Have I worked around&nbsp;another MS bug, yup....</p>
<p>My laptop won't have USB3.0 but at least I can use USB now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS admins, feel free to offer a real solution to me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are facing issue with USB device as it is not working. If I un<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>derstand you correctly the USB device is not getting detected by your computer. The issue may arise if the currently loaded USB
 driver has become unstable or corrupt or if your PC requires an update&nbsp;for issues that may conflict with a USB device and Windows. This may also occur if your USB controllers may have become unstable or corrupt. So, I would suggest you to try the following
 steps and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>

</p><p>I&nbsp;performed all of those operations several times with no success. To be clear I am a 20+ year enterprise admin and this is (or should be) a simple fix. There is nothing simple or basic about resolving this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trouble shooter identified it was missing drivers but never did install any or offer solutions, multiple runs of Windows Update&nbsp;never found drivers, multiple removals and reinstalls of Catalyst Center never installed the controllers or USB 3.0 driver.
 Nothing logged in Event Viewer about drivers, failed loads or missing libraries,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Updates were applied prior to the&nbsp;USB disappearing&nbsp;so I know for a fact&nbsp;it was a Windows Update, but as per usual the million dollar question&nbsp;was which one. It would be great if we could see useful information about the Windows Updates without have
 to click into each one and open the KB article in a browser. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Read my semi-successful solution and tell me how that would make the drivers load, because the second I installed that "optional" update the USB Controllers loaded their drivers and began working on USB 2.0. USB 3.0 was still broken and not loading drivers,
 as a workaround I reverted the USB 3.0 controller to USB 2.0 in the BIOS to get them operational.</p>

Hi. I created a user name titled "Visitor". How can I (without a lot of registry changes) allow Visitor to run only 5 or 6 applications. I have created a unique desktop for Visitor with only those icons. Visitor is not a family member.<br />
<br />
Or can I create a unique start menu that only shows the 5 or 6 applications to Visitor?<br />
<br />
I found out how to restrict Visitor to one application but not more than one. Windows 10 Home edition.<br />
<br />
Thanks!&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p>I do not have an option to save a video for an email. Or anything else really for that matter, only to export it to a folder on my computer, and even the smallest save option (540p) is still too large for and email. Why is that the only option? What can
 be done to fix this, because it is very frustrating, and inconvenient.&nbsp;</p>
