<h2>            Heading 1,h1</h2>
                    <p>I seem to be getting more and more documents from clients where they've applied or somehow renamed Heading 1, 2, 3, etc. as Heading 1,h1.&nbsp; In the style gallery it is listed only as h1 but in the Task Pane it's referred to as Heading 1,h1.&nbsp; These seem to
 be causing a lot of document corruption and I can't seem to remove the h1 tag.&nbsp; Does anyone know what these are?&nbsp; Or, better yet, how to correct them?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The "h1" is an alias or alternate name for the built-in style Heading 1.&nbsp; It results when someone tries to rename Heading 1 as "h1."&nbsp; You can't rename built-in styles, so the attempt is simply appended to the style name.&nbsp; It can come in handy for people
 who apply styles using the&nbsp;Apply Styles&nbsp;pane (Ctr+Shift+s) as all they need to do is type in h1 instead of&nbsp;Heading 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can make the "Heading 1,h1" appear as simply "h1" in the style pane by selecting the option "Hide built-in name when alternate name exists" from in the style pane options dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get rid of the ,h1, just use the modify style dialog and rename "Heading 1,h1" as "Heading 1"</p>

<h2>            OneDrive Sync error&#58; &#34;server is read only&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>My users were affected in a recent SharePoint outage that lasted about an hour and a half. Now half the users are back online with what seems to be full functionality, and the rest have errors saving to SharePoint, that read "server is read-only". This is
 the text of the explanation from Microsoft on my Admin dashboard:</p>
<p>For a subset of infrastructure, impact is more severe and engineers are working to redirect SharePoint Online traffic to an alternate capacity that will provide read-only functionality while the network issue is resolved.</p>
<p>I want to know if my users can still work on their documents and will the changes be uploaded to the cloud when connectivity is re-established?</p>

<h2>            Logging in Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I need help. My parents log me into the computer through the Microsoft account. I know the password, but they don't know I&nbsp;know the password. Several weeks ago, I had issues logging into my Skype. I did the verification and had a text sent to my phone.
 In the password changing process, I linked my Skype to my Microsoft account. Apparently, since the two accounts are linked, I cannot change my Skype password without changing the Microsoft password. My Microsoft password is now my Skype password. When my Mom
 logged me in to do my&nbsp;homework, she could not get in because she was using the "old password" that her and my Dad set up. I did not want my&nbsp;Dad to know I knew the password. When my Mom couldn't get in, I told her that I had reset my Skype which was linked
 to Microsoft. I typed in my current (one I set up) Microsoft password and had her change my password back to the old password. It wouldn't let her do that because it had been used before, so she had to change a lowercase letter to an uppercase letter. Now,
 my Skype password is the old password on the computer but with a capital (I do know which one). I am trying to change my Skype password to a password I like, and have the Microsoft account be a different password. I was told to unlink the two accounts, I have
 to use my current email with the Microsoft account that I have no access to because I don't know the password. I also can't reset it because I have no backup email on there. Is it possible that through Skype I can use my phone number to use a different email
 without logging into the email through Microsoft? If it is, I could then from there change that email to the Microsoft account to an email I have access to the new email through the Microsoft account that I have access to. This would then allow me to disconnect
 the Microsoft account from the Skype. Then, the two accounts would be separate and therefore so would the password. I could have my&nbsp;Mom change a different capital and tell my Dad who hasn't logged me in for a while that he had the capital wrong and that the
 password is something different. I don't want to get in trouble for knowing the password that I wasn't supposed to know. If there is another option to disconnect the two accounts, please email me. I know I cannot put personal info on here because this is a
 "public community." Make sure we can email back and forth to resolve this issue. Thank you so much for reading this and helping me.</p>

                    Hi. I just updated to version 15.24 (160709). Based on news articles I expected this to transition Office for Mac to 64 bit, but all of the apps are still 32 bit. Has the transition to 64 bit been deferred to a future update?

 exception: On the MacBook installation I cannot delete shapes, either dragged from the templates or created from the toolbar, via the Delete Key. This problem occurs on older drawings&nbsp;I created elsewhere, and on new drawings I create on the MacBook.&nbsp;I can
 'Cut' these objects with the&nbsp;Edit menu or with Control-X. I see some potential reasons, but can't solve the problem, maybe you can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The Apple keyboard only has a 'Delete' key, not&nbsp;separate 'Delete' &amp; 'Backspace' keys like a traditional Windows keyboard. It's possible that Windows sees this key as something other than Delete? When I'm writing text in Windows (like now) the key acts
 as a 'Backspace' key, deleting text to the left of the cursor. Maybe the key could be re-mapped when I'm in Visio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) There is something wrong with the Visio installation on my MacBook? I have tried both repairing the installation, and changing options (somewhat re-installing), but neither helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Visio 2010 works differently on Windows 10? Doubtful, but it's something different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions? The 'cut' workaround is OK, but clobbers the paste buffer, and takes two fingers (I'm tired after that :) I have considered upgrading to Visio 2016 Pro, but at the moment would rather focus on working with my drawings rather
 than the inevitable relearning that goes on with a new version, and I don't think it would help this problem. Thanks for your thoughts and ideas.</p>

            <p>Found it! On the Apple Keyboard, Fn+Delete will delete the Visio object (it acts like a Windows 'Delete' key). At least this solves the Paste buffer issue ... but I guess I'll still be tired. :)

<h2>            Any way to collapse multi-subpages instead of the entire group..&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm working in OneNote trying to come up with a better way to manage clients and projects.&nbsp; Right now we've got pages for clients and then sub-pages for multiple projects under a given client, but we're ending up with scattered notes about things everywhere
 and then they're to track down when you need them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've got the following template of pages setup that we'd like to start using...</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsandbox.angelleye.com%2ftemp%2fscreen.jpg" /></p>
<p>So you'll notice we've got the "Client Information", or their name.&nbsp; Then a Project subpage with multiple subpages under the project.&nbsp; Each client could have multiple Project pages with the same set of subs under each.</p>
<p>When that starts to happen we'd like to be able to collapse the Project subs up so only the current project is still viewable.&nbsp; The problem is when we collapse subpages it goes all the way up to the Client Information page (the main page) and doesn't give
 us the option to collapse only up to the "parent" page.</p>
<p>Is there any way around this particular problem?&nbsp; Any information would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>Only the top level of pages can be collapsed in OneNote 2010.&nbsp; The differing sub levels cannot be collapsed.</p>
<p>Might be an interesting suggestion to make over at http://connect.microsoft.com .</p>

                    <p>I have just set up a new email address using a different host (Gmail) but will continue to use Outlook 2011 for Mac as my interface.&nbsp; I have already set up Outlook for my new Gmail account and can currently see emails coming into both old (non-Gmail) and
 new accounts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would now like to move some of my folders and sub-folders from my old account to my new Gmail account so I can continue to work with them and be able search for specific emails in them.&nbsp; Outlook 2011 always runs in the cached mode but does this cache remain
 permanent and is it a single file (.olm?) comprised of emails from both accounts or are there separate caches for each account?&nbsp; And once I am no longer using my old email account can I perpetually view emails from the last available cache for this account?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, will I need to import this file to my new account, and how is that done, or can I, in Outlook, simply drag the folders that I wish to continue using from my old email account over to my new one?</p>

<div>Once moved anyway, you shouldn't have to worry about what's cached in </div>
<div>the old account.</div>
<div>Once you remove an IMAP account from Outlook, the items in the account </div>
<div>essentially disappear from the view.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you want to migrate your identity to a different computer, you can </div>
<div>either let the Migration Assistant do all the work for you and import </div>
<div>all your user data from one computer to the other, or you can manually </div>

</p><p>Thank you for the prompt reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are looking for the other order of the Skype credits to be refunded or cancelled. It is best to continue this with our live chat support so that they would be able to verify the account in which the charge has gotten through and refund it immediately
 for you. I sent you a private message in which the instructions for reaching out to our live chat support is included. You can view the message I sent&nbsp;to your inbox with this link:

<p>Hi PardeepSoba8695,</p>
<p>Based on the screenshot you shared, it seems you are referring to Project Online for Project Service. In this case, I’d suggest you post at our<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/projectserver/en-us/home?category=project&amp;forum=projectprofessional2010general%2Cprojserv2010setup%2Cprojectonline%2Cprojectserver2010general%2Cproject2010custprog&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;searchTerm=adding+task+to+timeline+getting+error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Project Support forum </a>for professional support. Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>However, I have done some research for you and found out if a Timeline view is corrupt, delete and re-create it may help resolve the issue. You can try it to check whether the issue persists. Here is a related thread for your reference:

            <p>Thank you for your answer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens, as I can see, when&nbsp;it starts to make the first installation (Update for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 Junk Email Filter (KB3101557)) and that is not possible nor do I have it installed. After the failure to install it stops the download and don't
 continue the rest of the update. I can see that 15 updates are pending + the Outlook update but it doesn't continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can give you a copy bur it is all in Danish and don't think it will give you a big idea.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see a major update is pending to the OS but never even starts to download it.</p>
<p>

            <p>Sway does not have a way to specify these options.&nbsp; However, we do automatically provide the title and the first bit of text to search engines so that they&nbsp;will show up in web searches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said, I think this would be a great thing to suggest in our suggestion forum:

    <title>Round and Round we go 10240 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edward gentile  say:</h3>
<h2>            Round and Round we go 10240</h2>
                    <p>Having lost activation on all my pc's as the rtm transition accelerated I was forced to start over . My first build was 9941 but the expiration date had passed . I do have X86 10041 dvd and I loaded into an aged HP 550 laptopthat had Visa on it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a test&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installed build 10041 , I activated it with key ending -YKHCF.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did an upgrade to build 10130 ,&nbsp;it activated with&nbsp; key ending-HQRJR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In slow ring and only hours after the 10130 upgrade the TH1 Professional 10240 is auto downloading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have gone through this before. The question is, what happens to the activation when&nbsp; TH1 Professional 10240</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upgrades an activated 10130 ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see that, none of my previews auto activated. I am uneasy about advancing to&nbsp; TH1 Professional 10240</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two times I upgraded my Pro evaluations to TH1 Professional 10240, I wound up with no way to activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you clarify please ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Edward</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why the Build 10130 is showing as activated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the pre Build 10240 product keys have been disabled.</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Will Microsoft publish keys for install the Insider Builds?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
<strong>No, builds from here on will not be prekeyed or include keys. You can install on a PC that had an activated 10240 to activate.</strong></span></span></p>

            <p>You should be activated if 10130 was activated, after your upgrade to 10240.&nbsp; As was said in the announcement, when the pre-release product keys were blocked, you have to upgrade from a qualified OS (Windows 10 Insider Preview, Windows 8 or Windows 7) to
 activate 10240.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/pre-release-product-keys-for-windows-10-insider/97e6cd1f-ee8a-42ea-b76c-46aa4af8e203">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/pre-release-product-keys-for-windows-10-insider/97e6cd1f-ee8a-42ea-b76c-46aa4af8e203</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is no different than our Insider activations of 10240 that took place in mid-July.&nbsp; There is no product key used to activate the free upgrade, which is part of the process that Insiders were testing when we were upgraded.</p>

    <title>Is it possible to set different read receipt rules for incoming email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> halimg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to set different read receipt rules for incoming email based on aliases for an email account on Office 365&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a small business where I am the person reading all emails. &nbsp;My main address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, but I also have aliases such as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of these aliases (such as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) are posted on the company web site, and I receive a lot of spam, with several spam and phishing emails requesting read receipts. I do not want to put stricter junk filtering, since I receive sometimes emails
 in different languages, or from senders who are bona fide potential clients, but whose emails may end up filtered as a false positive for spam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to have the option to choose to accept a read receipt for emails that are sent to my email (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) but want to always refuse read receipts for any email sent to an alias of my account, to avoid sending a receipt by error, and ending
 up with even more spam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on how I should set up my email account to do this (in Outlook on Windows 10, or online in Office 365 - I have full admin access to the account) ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are account aliases the correct way, or should I set up shared mailboxes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Besides what Vasil mentioned above, we’d like to inform you more details when creating the transport rule:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Login to EAC (Exchange admin center) with an Office 365 admin account.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Navigate to
<strong>mail flow</strong> &gt;<strong> rules</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click the add icon and then click
<strong>Create a new rule</strong> to create a rule as the picture shows below:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/809498a1-d659-46b9-be91-51da7e283075" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/809498a1-d659-46b9-be91-51da7e283075" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: 1. Select
<strong>The message type is Read receipt</strong> as the picture shows below:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b23f7e4-b705-463a-8ce2-f9c7f47d511c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b23f7e4-b705-463a-8ce2-f9c7f47d511c" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. When you select the
<strong>The recipient is this person </strong>option, it will prompt a user list for you to choose. However, the aliases won’t be listed in it. Please type the aliases in the
<strong>Check names</strong> box manually and then click the <strong>Check names</strong> button, it will add them to the
<strong>add-&gt;</strong> box automatically. The picture below is for your reference:</span></p>

<h2>            Wav attachments will not play</h2>
                    Wav attachments from our Avaya phone system will not play on Windows 8 Phone.&nbsp; Avaya says they use a standard wav format and the issue is with the mobile device and suggests using another app to play the file or change phones.<br />
<br />
I didn't have this problem with the Windows 7 phone.<br />
<br />
I'm sure MS didn't remove functionality for such a simple file format.&nbsp; What can be done to fix this issue?<br />

<p><span>The Wav file now plays perfectly on my Nokia Lumia 1020. When you will receive the update GRD2 approved by your carrier you will have a fix.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Microsoft has made the GRD2 update available to all Carriers and OEMS. IT is now up to them to decide if they will push this out to their users. If they do, they still have
 first internal testing to do to make sure this update is carrier ready before pushing this out. I'll keep my fingers crossed. Some HTC 8X and 8S owners in Europe have received them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. Yes, I'm using the link that you've provided. I tried it with Edge and Google Chrome, but it didn't help. When I use that article instead and download the Azerbaijan Language Accessory pack for Office, I can't install it on my computer
 as some error pops up. Lastly, I'm not getting any error just the blank screen. Please see below.&nbsp;<br />

</p><p>What about proofing tools download? Did you manage to find the reason of a blank screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have already downloaded proofing tools to my computer because my&nbsp;colleague has an installment file. He downloaded it long ago and saved on his flash drive. So I just took it from him. I'm still wondering why it's not possible from your website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Are you trying to download directly from a web page or via the Language category in the Word Options dialog box?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, keep in mind that you have to choose the 32 bit ("x86") language accessory pack if you are running 32 bit Office. Currently, most Office installations are 32 bit, even on 64 bit Windows.</p>

<h2>            Ruler doesn&#39;t show tabs&#47;indents</h2>
                    <p>Although I have indentation settings in my document, the horizontal ruler in Word 2013 never shows the tabs, as Word 2010 used to.</p>
<p>Here's how my ruler looks like:</p>

            <p>There is an issue causing tab stops and indent indicators to disappear from the ruler in Word 2013. The problem is being investigated by the Office team, and a fix is expected. Meanwhile, the following are workarounds recommended by Microsoft:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start Word first, with a blank document, and then open the document you are going to read or edit.​</li><li>Avoid having a table as the first item in a document (at present it appears that this is the cause of the problem).</li></ul>
<p>While other procedures may clear the problem temporarily, none is a permanent fix, and they do not address the underlying problem issue.</p>

            <p>You are better to enter your Microsoft account in the initial set up of your device as you wont be getting all the features available to windows phone users.</p>
<p>Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 are two separate app stores holding separate apps, to see if an app/game has it on both stores then you will need to search the app/game on the individual stores, although Microsoft have recently said that developers will be
 able to develop apps/games for both windows 8 and windows phone 8 with the same registration.</p>
