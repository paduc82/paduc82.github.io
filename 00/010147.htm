<h2>            N73 turns itself off when using real tone</h2>
                    When i have an incomming call, and have a real tone selected, my phone rings for 3 rings then dumps and turns itself off. It works again when i turn it on but if i call it again it does the same thing. I have tried using a real tone from the phone and
 from the memory card and it does the same thing. This does not happen with a polyphonic tone. Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
thanks

            Perhaps the real tone file you are using has a glitch in ? Try another real tone file.

            thank you for your advice. I have discovered that most tones work, but the odd one is still dumping the phone. I will just use the working ones now.<br />
<br />
thanks again for your advice.<br />

    <title>Inserting DICOM files in Powerpoint 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Inserting DICOM files in Powerpoint 2016</h2>
                    <p>I am looking for a way to insert DICOM files into Powerpoint presentation. I do not want to insert jpegs or convert DICOM to video files and insert them. I am looking for a way I can insert DICOM files and then move all the slices within the presentation.
 Currently the only way i see to do this is to insert a plugin called"radfiler" (www.radfiler.com/dicomppt.htm.)
<span>
<span>
&nbsp;</span>but i want to know if i can do this natively in Powerpoint 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Given up on Build 14986 ever installing</h2>
                    <p>As I posted here in numerous threads&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run out of things to try to get this build to install which appears to be crashing Windows resulting in the rollback being performed in each and every one of my probably 20 attempts. &nbsp;<br />
I have tried the following:<br />
ReagentC /Info<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth<br />
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore<br />
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup<br />
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Windows Update Trouble Shooting version for Windows10 which has renamed the Software Distribution folder countless times.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The two registry changes<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Removing Windows.old folder from the build prior to 14971 to free up disk space which is approximately 32 GB on C:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Disabled all unnecessary non MS services from running on startup<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
I transferred the hard drive to another desktop computer here that had my 14971 Insider build installed on it. Booted up and like the prior machine (both AMD based CPUS w Nvidia video cards) it backed out the upgrade to 14986 just like the probably 2 dozen
 attempts over the past 5 days or so.<br />
<br />
I resorted to creating an bootable USB flash drive by creating an ISO file from the install.esd file and attempted to do an in place upgrade. The same thing happened but this time I actually seen an error message screen.<br />
<br />

<p>Installed via USB installer</p>
<p>BSOD during the installation after formatting the hard drive partion. Error was DPC_WatchDog Violation</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is always the same. The update downloads starts the prep tells me to reboot the computer which I do it goes through the gyrations and then the computer reboots on its own at which time I see a notice that it is recovering from a failed attempt
 and reverting back to the prior version of Windows aka build 14971.<br />
This is a plain jane Windows10 Pro build 14971 installed on a desktop x64 English version.<br />
</p>
<p>The lack of official word from Microsoft is really disheartening to those of us like me who have been installing and testing Fast Ring builds from before Windows 10 was ever released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lack of meaning full error message to the end users has always troubled me regarding Windows10 even in the release versions. Hiding this type of information and repeatedly trying to install the same update over and over again without providing meaningful
 error reporting does not sit well with me. This is why in our office the vast majority of our machines are still at Windows7 and will remain so for the foreseeable future.<br />

<p>If I had that PC, I would create myself a bootable USB using the Media Creation Tool which will update to 14393.4xx, the latest public build.&nbsp; Load the USB from BIOS which is the same as if you had built the PC in the garage.&nbsp; No wonder the PC&nbsp; is confused
 with all the stuff you have tweaked on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fry my Insiders from time to time, my fault.&nbsp; I have a HP paper weight.&nbsp; I can be up and running in the time it takes to install W10 from BIOS.&nbsp; If the public build runs, then Fast Lane takes me to latest Insiders in just a few hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You seem very knowledgeable in PCs.&nbsp; The BIOS install is a piece of cake, it just rolls right through as advertised.&nbsp; You have either a hardware or software issue, why not find out the fastest way.</p>

            <p>I reset this box back to basic 14971 and told it to delete the files and the 14986 still refused to install. It backed out the upgrade without any sort of error messages over the 4 no 5 days I have been battling this box. The 14971 build works fine on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This box has no issues taking Insider Fast Ring builds from day 1 EXCEPT for 14986.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a driver issue within 14986 and AMD/NVIDIA hardware its going to have the same issue upgrading from a stable build.</p>

<p>Try adding it {modify}</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you actually <em>delete</em> the '<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Contents</span>' of the Distribution '<strong>Download'</strong> folder...I don't trust renaming it.</p>
<p>and Restart the Windows services as I posted before....</p>
<p>Also do a 'Disk Cleanup' from This pc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and choose 'Cleanup System files'</p>
<p>Choose if you have 'Temporary Windows Installations'&nbsp; and 'Previous Windows files'.</p>
<p>and restart the computer,.</p>

            <p>I did a totally clean install 14393.479 fully up to date per Windows Update check. I made sure that I was set for Inside Fast Ring builds. Checked about 10 times and was not offered it. Tried installing it from a USB based Fast Ring 14986 installer only
 to encounter DPC_WatchDog BSOD during the upgrade in place.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I guess there is an issue with 14986. Probably will be restoring my backup of 14971 at least then I will be using an Insider build rather than a normal release build.</p>

<p>As I posted here in numerous threads&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run out of things to try to get this build to install which appears to be crashing Windows resulting in the rollback being performed in each and every one of my probably 20 attempts. &nbsp;<br />
I have tried the following:<br />
ReagentC /Info<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth<br />
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore<br />
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup<br />
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Windows Update Trouble Shooting version for Windows10 which has renamed the Software Distribution folder countless times.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The two registry changes<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Removing Windows.old folder from the build prior to 14971 to free up disk space which is approximately 32 GB on C:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Disabled all unnecessary non MS services from running on startup<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I transferred the hard drive to another desktop computer here that had my 14971 Insider build installed on it. Booted up and like the prior machine (both AMD based CPUS w Nvidia video cards) it backed out the upgrade to 14986 just like the probably 2 dozen
 attempts over the past 5 days or so.<br />
<br />
I resorted to creating an bootable USB flash drive by creating an ISO file from the install.esd file and attempted to do an in place upgrade. The same thing happened but this time I actually seen an error message screen.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc619fd0-d44e-4e72-9661-5078358e9ac0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc619fd0-d44e-4e72-9661-5078358e9ac0" /></a><br />

<p>Installed via USB installer</p>
<p>BSOD during the installation after formatting the hard drive partion. Error was DPC_WatchDog Violation</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is always the same. The update downloads starts the prep tells me to reboot the computer which I do it goes through the gyrations and then the computer reboots on its own at which time I see a notice that it is recovering from a failed attempt
 and reverting back to the prior version of Windows aka build 14971.<br />
This is a plain jane Windows10 Pro build 14971 installed on a desktop x64 English version.<br />
</p>
<p>The lack of official word from Microsoft is really disheartening to those of us like me who have been installing and testing Fast Ring builds from before Windows 10 was ever released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lack of meaning full error message to the end users has always troubled me regarding Windows10 even in the release versions. Hiding this type of information and repeatedly trying to install the same update over and over again without providing meaningful
 error reporting does not sit well with me. This is why in our office the vast majority of our machines are still at Windows7 and will remain so for the foreseeable future.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>finally got the build installed. watched 20 attempts to update to 14986 to my utter frustration. finally got pissed off, and went old school on this issue. not that everyone is going to like my solution. If you go with my solution make sure you back up any
 important files to your one drive, or to an external hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>simply put.</p>
<p>1 clean install of windows 7 or 8. ( I used 8), make sure it is activated b4 you go to next step</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 download windows 10 using the media creation tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. install their offering of windows 10. activate through the insider program, or use " I am reinstalling win 10 option", when prompted for activation code</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. once installed, and activated through insider program 12 to 24 hours later you will be able to install 14986 on the fast ring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. FYI 5 hours and the build seems stable. no crashes</p>
<p>
</p><p>good luck to all</p>

            after trying all the other solutions that were offered, I can tell you from what i gathered from the troubleshooter, is that windows update files are corrupted. not surprising considering all the builds that are installed on top of each other, that errors
 will creep in from time to time. my solution was not based on bravery. it was more that when a computer screen tells me I can't do something, i will move heaven and earth to prove i am at least as smart as the computer that is giving me the headache. also
 once in a while it is a good idea to wipe your hard drive, and start fresh. it helps keep your computer free of hidden viruses, and malware. a much better option, as opposed to watching my computer not updating, and wasting valuable time. hope it helped the
 obsessive compulsive people like myself out there.

    <title>Microsoft Security Essentials vs System Center Endpoint Protection vs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lotusisrael  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials vs System Center Endpoint Protection vs Windows Defender</h2>
                    <p>I have got a Dreamspark license of Windows Server 2012. I am not an IT professional or server administrator, but a student who needed a license for a Windows 8 edition, so I used Dreamspark to get it. I tweaked WS 2012 to make as Windows 8 - like as possible.
 I do not use it as a server at all, but as a workstation OS. Windows Defender it is not included on WS2012, no antivirus or antispyware, only firewall. Most free 3rd party solutions refuse to install on a server OS: Microsoft Security Essentials is free for
 home users, free for personal use. From what I am aware of, it is technicly impossible to install MSE on any server OS. But I have found out about System Center Endpoint Protection, that includes a client software, that is, practicly, identical to the free
 MSE, that is fully compatible with WS2012. My question is this: If I download and install this and only this from SCEP, nothing else, on my PC (that, altough it has a server OS, it is not a server, but a workstation), could this be considered a MSE license
 on the workstation. I know that SCEP itself it is not a free software, but I do not want to install all of it, I do not need to on my PC, all the managent tools and the rest. This is a legal question, I know this is technicly possible. For thoose who will
 reply, especially from Microsoft, I state once again: 1) workstation PC, not a server, but one that runs a server OS; 2) I want to know only if I am allowed to install the client software, the equivalent of the free MSE, I mean SCEPInstall from the Ssetup-Client-SCEPInstall,
<em>tha</em>t, I mean <em>only tha</em>t, on a personal <em>workstation PC</em>, as an
<em>equivalent</em> to MSE. I do not even know if this is the right forum for this, I am not an IT specialist, not even an IT student. I am just a student with a workstation PC who wants to stay loyal Microsoft Security Essentials, that was very helpfull during
 the years, and who sees no other way to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was allready asked on a Technet forum, but I think it is relevant to post it here all well.</p>

            <p>No, since SCEP isn't MSE, it's an entirely different client it's not a legal way to get the equivalent of MSE for Windows 2012 server in general.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, since Micrsosoft never considers Windows Server to be a client operating system, you are asking the wrong question.&nbsp; What you really need to know is whether your Dreamspark license allows you to use the&nbsp;SCEP client as well as your Server 2012 license,
 since that's what you're really trying to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Offhand I don't know the answer to this and maybe you do which is why you're asking it in this convoluted manner.&nbsp; But if not, that is what you need to find out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't see any of these other security clients incuded in the normal student subscription, so you'll need to look at the More Software Through Your School tab at the second page below to see if they may have a wider selection of software that you can aquire
 through them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also unaware of which Microsoft Forums are best to discuss these questions, though I'd think those relating to the products themselves such as Windows Server 2012 in this case might be your best path.&nbsp; These forums are really for consumer products and
 questions and your's are focused on development and business products.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the answer. Well, I am on the consumer side, as I said, not on the developement and business ones. My University does not seem to have Dreamspark Premium for my department. I have asked on Technet forums as well, like a said, but I am asking here
 the same thing because, in the end, this is a consumer related issue. I was hoping someone from Microsoft could give a clear, straight answer. I know somebody asked something similar on Technet forums, but the Microsoft engineer did not understood and replied
 regarding the whole SCEP suite, nu just the client antivirus, the equivalent of MSE, and that did not clarified the issue. So, I am hoping someone from Microsoft will give me a clear answer, in here and/or on Technet forums.</p>

            <p>I know it's confusing, but the Dreamspark product is not a consumer product suite, it is part of a developer training effort, since all of the products except the clients are only used by developers or business.&nbsp; Since the clients are now the same for both,
 there is overlap in that particular segment, but that's still just semantics since the Dreamspark initiative is focused on education and development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You apparently tried the appropriate thing when posting in the TechNet forums, since that's where much of the educational content is found.&nbsp; Another place might be MSDN, since those forums are intended for developers as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you have identified a common problem with Dreamspark as it exists for students, since there's really no clear path to support that I've seen which is why I tried to help guide you even though these are obviously the least approriate forums for you
 to post these questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Answers forums are only for consumer products, which Windows Server 2012 is not, nor is SCEP.&nbsp; Also Answers is primarily manned by volunteer users like myself, with only occassional backup by first level Microsoft support personnel who often have very
 little knowledge of other product areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I provided what answer I could, since I at least have some knowledge of servers from my own business use.</p>

            I am just a student who need a license for Windows. I have little to nothing in commun with IT professionals. Tweaked this server OS to make as close to the consumer counterpart, with the help of a dedicated website, on my own I would have been completly
 lost. It would make sense to be able to get a free antivirus. SCEP is free on Dreamspark Premium, but that is not for my major I am studing for. I would make sense that Microsoft would allow for thoose in my situation to use for free the SCEP client that it
 is virtually identical to MSE as a replacement for MSE, that and only that from the whole SCEP suite. Practicly, not allowing me to use it forces me to turn to a 3rd party solution. This means I can not use the integrated security of the Windows 6.2 platform,
 that starts with Early Launch Antimalware, that is fully functional in Windows 8 and Windows RT (Isn`t it?).

            <p>No, you have this completely backwards.&nbsp; What would make sense is for you to use the Windows 8 client that is designed for personal and consumer use rather than a server, since you are obviously not understanding that a server and client are nothing alike.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the client and server operating systems are created from the same base code, their configuration and operation are entirely different and can never be made anywhere near the same.&nbsp; Using a Windows Server as a client has always been a bad idea and
 never recommended or even suggested by Microsoft.&nbsp; It is only done by hacks with no true understanding of the purposes and differences at a fundamental level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why you are having such an obvious set of problems, since you are trying to do something that though not illegal as such is basically foolish and unsupported, so this brings with it such additional costs as you attempt to create this support yourself.</p>

</p><p>I've encountered the problem that if I forward all of the email to one email address it will then not forward emails using the inbox rules (as we only want certain emails forwarded to certain accounts). So I've had to create a rule to forward all of the
 emails to the first email address, but this then automatically adds the FW: header that means you can not see the email address of the sender, as it' lost in the mail below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I set up outook so that I can autoforward and have rules and remove the FW: header from the emails forwarded?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>David&nbsp;</p>

<p>@ Ian Sal,</p>
<p>Your reply is actually way off-topic!</p>
<p>The Topic starter is talking about a Lumia 950XL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@MelanieG:</p>
<p>That is a Known issue/bug with Windows 10 mobile. this is as you mentioned actually the&nbsp;Gestures &amp; Touch app</p>
<p>There a few apps (internal things like the Gadgets app,Gestures &amp; Touch app,&nbsp; Groove etc etc) that can cause these cryptic description under the notification settings.</p>
<p>It's does show on my 950's and 950XLs running production and insider builds also.</p>

            You can only use Outlook Web Access if you are using a corporate mail server that uses Microsoft Exchange. OWA is an Exchange application, not an Outlook applcation. If you are using an Internet based mail account (like an Internet Service would provide
 or hotmail), then you would need to use whatever provisions that provider has for web access. If you want to access&nbsp;the account&nbsp;with Outlook on another computer you would have to install and configure another installation of Outlook.

<h2>            Outlook web app keeps redirecting when I try to sign in&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have academic email addresses with two different institutions. Both use Outlook for their systems, and to access them online there are university log-ins. However, in the past couple of days, when I've tried to log in to one, it's redirected me straight
 to the log in page for the other institution. Logging in on the second institution works fine, but I can't access my emails for the first email address because I can't log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem? How can I fix it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I'm aware, I've not fiddled around with settings on anything recently.</p>

    <title>Print to OneNote issue. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terrencequinn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print to OneNote issue.</h2>
                    I am using OneNote 2013 on a Surface 4 running Windows 10.&nbsp; Overall good tool, but I get an odd issue.&nbsp; If I do multiple "Print to One Note"... from Acrobat, Word etc to an entry.... (I am sending multiple drawing images from PDF files) the "prints" will
 go into the OneNote in front of the previous Print to OneNote 'prints' that I sent.&nbsp; &nbsp;So to be clear.&nbsp; I create an entry about a part. I write some notes about it.&nbsp; &nbsp; I then send "print ABC" from Acrobat to this entry.&nbsp; &nbsp;It goes after the text I wrote.&nbsp; So
 far so good.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I then open up another Acrobat file (print DEF) and send this to OneNote to this entry, it will be inserted BEFORE print ABC that I previously added.&nbsp; &nbsp;This did not happen in previous versions of OneNote that I have used.&nbsp; &nbsp;It does not seem
 to matter where I place the cursor.&nbsp; And of course it is maddening since I am just a bit OCD.

<p>Anthony,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for your answer.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think maybe I wasn't clear.&nbsp; The "Print to OneNote" feature works.&nbsp; But it works in an odd way.&nbsp; Regardless of the program I am doing "Print to OneNote" the prints are inserted into the entry AHEAD of the previous "Print
 to OneNote" print.&nbsp; &nbsp;It happens with Adobe, Word, Excel, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;So if I print a Word Document to a OneNote It will go to the entry I direct it to.&nbsp; If I print another Word Document (or PDF, or EXCEL) into the same entry,&nbsp; it will go AHEAD of the first Word
 Document.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I print a third document into the entry, it will go AHEAD of the 2nd one.&nbsp; &nbsp;So if Print Documents "1" "2" and "3" into my OneNote entry, in that order, they will end up in my document as "3" "2" "1".&nbsp; &nbsp;It happens with all programs using the
 "Print to One Note" feature.&nbsp; Regradless of where I have the active cursor.&nbsp; &nbsp; So I wonder if its something in the "Print to OneNote" driver in OneNote 2013.&nbsp; (It did not happen in the previous version of OneNote I used).&nbsp; &nbsp;By the way, if I import pictures...
 this doesn't happen.... just when I use the "Print to OneNote" function.&nbsp; In any case, thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender&#58; &#34;the app has been turned off&#34; cannot turn back on</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just uninstalled Avast Security and want to reactivate Windows Defender, but it is surprisingly hard to do so. Can anyone help me out? Every time I click on the file a message pops up that says the app has been turned off (with no option to simply turn
 it back on). Under that it says if you are using another service check 'security and maintenance' to check that program's status. Well I am not, anymore, having deleted and uninstalled Avast. I search 'security and maintenance' yet that's not even a location.
 Windows Firewall seems to be on, but how do I turn Windows Defender on? I even have a 'Solve PC issue' notification, and it says 'activate antivirus software' yet when I click on it it just pops up that Windows Defender 'this app is not activated' pop-up again...
 any help would be much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

I use Office Mac 2011 (the latest) but none of the instructions on the page refer to Office Mac and the instructions for other versions of Office do not work in Office Mac.

            The conversation Rick linked to pertains to the exact same issue. The new implementation described therein was rolled out on a Regional basis, At the time the site you mention had not been&nbsp; updated. It since has been, so the link now provides the same
 directions as the US link as well as most others.<br />
<br />
Use the Bing search method suggested on that site as described in the other thread or use the web app approach. The 1st described on that page is available only to users of Office 2013. Even users of other Windows versions of Office don't have that option,
 but the other 2 are usable by all.<br />
<br />
More Clip Art is now available than ever before -- regardless of Mac or PC -- but it has been made more difficult to get to. My expectation is that its former availability was being accessed too easily by too many freeloaders :-)<br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can switch the VBE window by pressing ALT + F11.</p>
<p>Or access it if you activate the Developer tab on the normal excel ribbon via File/options/Customsie the Ribbon&nbsp; where ic can be selected. Then on the developper tab, the first group (Code) has a "Visual Basic command.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9c5fd64-0310-4939-8b20-c41fab39250b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9c5fd64-0310-4939-8b20-c41fab39250b" /></a></p>
<p>Via the menu insert, add a "Code module. It will then appear in the Project explorer (top left list) below the other "Microsoft Excel Objects".</p>
<p>In this module, copy and paste the code you created so far. </p>
<p>The code must be started and ended correctly </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Sub "your_code_name" (and without space in the name</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">'the code here</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">End Sub</p>
<p>The pasted lines, if correct, will be in black, comments (text preceded by a single&nbsp; quote ') will be in green and incorrect lines in red. That is a start. we can start correcting here or help</p>
<p>IF all ok or corrected so far, you can then run the code line by line via the menu Debug/Step into ( or press just F8. This make the code to run line by line and an error message will be trigered if something else doesnt work for any executed line of code.</p>
<p>Report the incorrect line of code (where its stops) and the erro message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH</p>
<p>

<h2>            how to change the windows updates settings in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded windows 10. The auto update could not be turned off on my latop. When is is going to be able to be turned off?I have unlimited internet when I'm at home but not on the road. When I'm on the road My Data is limited. I need to set the
 downloads for when I'm at home. Is this going to be possible or do I need to stay away from windows 10? I had to go back to 8.1 to stop the downloads</p>

            Check the Message Centre Number - see if there's anything there, and check with your operator to make sure it's correct.<br />
<br />
It'll be under the settings somewhere like:<br />
<br />
Menu - Messaging - Options - Settings - Text Message Settings - Message Centre Number<br />
<br />
something like that... not got a phone handy so can't quite remember lol

            I tried that and instead of saying a number all it said was SUNDAY, I got the correct message centre number from the UK Vodafone website and tried to change it to that and now it says that the Messaging Apps is closed and there is no option to change anything
 to open it up again.<br />
I think the phone has locked itself up somewhere so I will have to return it, I bought this from Hong Kong, would that have any effect on the settings? it did say that it was fully unlocked.

            It shouldn't do... but then I've never bought a phone from there.<br />
Buying a phone from most countries abroad unfortunately means the warranty is not valid here in the UK though, so your best bet is either to try to get a refund/replacement from Hong Kong, or to try to take it to your nearest Nokia Service Centre (<a href="http://www.nokia.com/repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokia.com/repair</a>)
 and see if they can do anything for you, but prepare to be charged lol

            I am having a similar problem.&nbsp; I am unable to open Messaging at all.&nbsp; Whether it's to make a new message or to just open the application to look at settings, when I click it it briefly appears and then just exits back to the main menu.&nbsp; Any suggestion
 would be great.

            Try doing a reset just in case you have changed a setting by mistake. I guess sending it back to HK is not an option right? Even firmware upgrades might be tricky.

            <p>Match will give you the corresponding row of your selection, not the overall row. So if you are matching against A3:A11, a match in A3 will return a value of 1, and a match in A11 will return a value of 9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you then put that in your index, you get the corresponding value, but I note that your index is using D4:D11 and not D3:D11. That means that if your Match returns a 1 (match found in A3), your index will pull the first value in the index range, which
 is D4 instead of D3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I try to always keep my data aligned so that my match and index use the same row ranges, to avoid pulling back the wrong row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>note: I would expect that if your match was in A11 and returned a value of 9, then your index would likely return an error value, because your index only has 8 cells.</p>

            If it's spoofing, your account is in no danger because your account didn't send it.&nbsp; Check your Sent folder.&nbsp; If you see the outgoing message matching the message the other person received, then definitely your account was hacked.&nbsp; If you don't see it,
 that's not proof you're safe, but the likelihood is you are.&nbsp; If you have access to all of the headers, including the Received headers, you should be able to trace the origin of the message.
