<h2>            Windows 8 Refresh problems - cannot find &#34;removed apps&#34; folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a problem with Windows 8 refresh. Update from Windows 8 to 8.1 was not so successfull and my laptop was slowing down terribly, so I decided to do Windows refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a warning about removing apps which I installed but there was a message that I will find a list of my removed apps on Desktop. And... there is nothing. It is not on the desktop and nowhere in computer folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BR</p>
<p>

<p><span><span>Bluescrren errors typically mean hardware or driver issues (though it could also be software).&nbsp; Read the posts and follow
 the procedures set forth by Spirit MVP in the following thread regarding the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp; They should help you resolve your problem.</span></span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/8cd8362e-7d06-46fb-afd7-84d54b6a8ea7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/8cd8362e-7d06-46fb-afd7-84d54b6a8ea7</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
 lot of that is duplicated below but it also offers some other oprtions and explanatons of bluescreen errors.&nbsp; What we really need now is the EXACT and ENTIRE text of the bluescreen message - just copy it down and post it in a reply.&nbsp; If the system shuts down
 too fast to copy the message, to to Start / Control Panel / System / Advanced System Settings / Advanced / Startup and Recover / and uncheck the box to Automatically Restart.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also check the box to Write an Event to the System Log and
 select Complete Memory Dump and check Overwrite any existing file.<span>&nbsp;</span>This will freeze the program on the bluescreen so you have time to copy the information.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also want to try the Driver Verifier Manager to see if you can identify the driver or device responsible:</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also use Skydrive</span></span><a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;to
 upload dump and text files related to the error which may help us identify the problem.&nbsp; Just post back the link to where they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shutdown (Start / Control
 Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To
 fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for
 the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going tostart / search box and type device
 manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details
 and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should get any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you
 should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can stll boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

            <p>Hi Colonel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the below questions for better understanding of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Where exactly do you get the error message?</p>
<p>2. Are you able to reach the lock or the log in screen in your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error means that that the requested page of kernel data from the paging file could not be read into memory. Which means that the while starting and loading Windows 10, some critical files could not be loaded which thereby resulted in the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to us with the necessary details so that we can resolve your issue at the earliest.</p>

            <p>Sorry, but your message is very hard to understand. Please answer all<br />the questions below and clarify the other things that I say are not<br />possible.</p><blockquote><p>Got a virus, computer had to be wiped out because of lost data.</p></blockquote><p>What virus did you have? How did you know you had it? What made you<br />think you should "wipe the computer"? Wiping the computer when you<br />have a virus is almost always way overkill. Almost all viruses can be<br />removed fairly easily by a good anti-virus program.</p><p>And what do you mean by "had to be wiped out because of lost data"?<br />Wiping the computer doesn't fix lost data. It itself <strong>loses</strong> all data,<br />and everything else on the computer.</p><blockquote><p>Everything was reloaded except Window 7 home premium( word, excel, cloud for editing pictures, etc)</p></blockquote><p>Exactly what was the "everything" that was reloaded?

<p>Hi&nbsp;AstralSpirit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yes, Skype collates those data and store them on your local storage. If you wanted to delete those, you may try these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to your Android phone Settings.</p>
<p>2. Tap <strong>Apps</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Look for Skype and tap it, then tap <strong>CLEAR CACHE </strong>and <strong>
CLEAR DATA.</strong></p>
<p>4. Restart your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will delete all the Skype history conversation, pictures and shared files that is stored on your Android device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>

            It means that the sgtray.exe which belongs to the Sonic Update Manager isn't working. There is no reason to have the Update Manager and sgtray.exe running with Windows. Change the update settings for the Manager in the Software Update applet in Control
 Panel. Remove the reference to sgtray.exe from Startup.<br />
<br />
<span>Start&gt;Run&gt;msconfig [enter]<br />
<br />
This brings up the System Configuration Utility. Look on the Startup tab and find the probable culprit. Uncheck the box next to its name, Apply and OK out. You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used
 the Utility. Just tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />
<br />
Important - Do not use the System Configuration Utility to stop processes. Instead, use Start&gt;Run&gt;services.msc [enter]
</span><span>and do not stop any services unless you really, really know what you're doing.</span>

            Because it is intentionally not supported. If you want spell check, you will need to purchase Microsoft Word or download and install the free Libre Office and use that to spell check your text documents. 
<br />
<br />Google Docs is another option.

            Hi Olympiaman,
<br />
<br />Wordpad is a very basic word processor and sadly does not support spell checking!
<br />
<br />To gain that functionality, you can purchase a subscription to MS Office or a very good alternative is Open Office, which is free and fully compatible with MS Office
<br />

<h2>            Trouble with Linksys WUSB54GC v3 adapter</h2>
                    
<p>Am working on a windows 7 64 bit, have spent several days trying to install and use a linksys wusb54gc adapter, with no luck. Windows compatablity catalog says that it is compatable, requires a download from cisco site. When I go to the link&nbsp;provided&nbsp;the
 device is not even listed there. Have gone to linksys and downloaded latest drivers, vista 64 bit,&nbsp;which make no difference.&nbsp;Have connected with cable to download windows updates.&nbsp;Have tried to install in compatablity mode, update drivers from device manager,
 which says the device is working properly. What am I missing? Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I had the same problem. Linksys/Cisco's driver for the WUSB54GC, ver3 never did load correctly on my PC. Additionally, the updated drivers that they provided via their support site never "took" on Win7. In my frustration&nbsp;after 3 days of searching the web
 for answers and dealing with this, I finally decided to bail on the Linksys/Cisco WUSB54GC, ver3 adapter. I then searched for a "good" adapter that stated specifically that it was compatible with Win7 (not just Vista, like the WUSB54GC, ver3). After searching
 the web, the best solution I found was the Belkin Play Hi-Performance Dual-Band Networking N+N 300 adapter, v1000. I bought that adapetr and uninstalled everything related to the Linksys/Cisco adapter and WOW!!!!,,,,Unbelieveable!!! Everything is performing
 the way I expected it to and the speeds are blazing. After that, I am a believer in Win7 and IE8. What an amazing difference and all because of a stupid device/driver issue.</p>
<p>My recommendation to anyone reading this. Stop trying to get the WUSB54GC, ver3 to work with Win7 and IE8. Even if Linksys/Cisco or anyone else claims their devices are Win7 and IE8 compatible (i.e. - "just load the Vista driver"....ARGH!!!!). Unless the
 device SPECIFICALLY states it works with Win7, then don't bother. I know you may be out a couple of bucks but please believe me, after three days of messing with trying to get the adapter (which I bought less than a year ago) to try and&nbsp;work on my new PC,
 I am a satisfied beyong belief with the new adapter (I just wish I had done this two days ago). Do the math....what would you say 3 days of your life is worth with no resolution after searching for a solution at every site imaginable and loading and reloading
 drivers and the software to control the problem adapter, over and over and over??? Save yourself the hassle and frustration, spend another $50 for an updated adapter and the 15 minutes it takes to install it. If you really are worried about the cash, sell
 the old Linksys/Cisco POS (sorry....adapter) to someone with an older PC who can actually use it.</p>
<p>Finally at peace......</p>

            This is normally something wrong with your .NET framework.
<br />Try this ...
<br />
<br />This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />If that does not work then try reinstalling .NET.
<br />See link.

<h3> sewnsew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer stops working when I try to access a drive mapped to my FTP server on the internet.</h2>
                    I was editing some web pages (using Crimson editor) and instead of saving the files to my harddrive I just left them open and "hibernated" my machine at night.&nbsp; After 3 days of having an FTP connection (opened through a mapped drive) and turning on my
 computer from hibernation mode, I accidentally hit Shut Down and I lost all my work ARGH!!! (Yes, I know, I should have&nbsp;known better). Anyway, Now when I open My Computer and click on the FTP mapped drives I get the message that Windows Explorer has stopped
 working.&nbsp; And if I go to Internet explorer (7) and type "ftp://mysite.com it brings me to an&nbsp;FTP Root&nbsp;page where it tells me :&nbsp;To view this FTP site in Windows Explorer, click
<strong>Page</strong>, and then click <strong>Open FTP Site in Windows Explorer</strong>. I do that and it brings up a windows explorer window momentarily and then I get the message. Windows Explorer has stopped working.&nbsp; Any ideas?
 I certainly hope I don't have to reinstall the OS.&nbsp; I did a system restore to 4 days ago. It did not work.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi SewNSew,</span></p>
<p><span>To narrow down the issue, I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Put the computer in clean boot and try to access the drive
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow
<strong>Step 1 </strong>in the link below,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software
 you can consider uninstalling </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> - Remember to put
 the computer back to normal startup <strong>follow step 7</strong> in the link</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>The
<strong>system file checker (SFC) utility</strong> allows administrators to perform a scan of all protected resources to verify that they are the correct version. If SFC should find any incorrect versions in any of these protected resources, SFC will
 replace them with the correct versions.</span></p>
<p><span>You can always run a SFC scan on the windows vista computer. To run a SFC scan follow the steps below:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on start and in the start search bar type cmd, right click on the command prompt icon in the programs area and then click on run as administrator.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the command prompt type
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and then press enter. </span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the issue persists, </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Turn off user account control (UAC) and check, to do this, follow the steps below:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety (or clicking User Accounts, if you are
 connected to a network domain), and then clicking User Accounts. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Turn User Account Control on or off.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer clear the check box to turn off UAC, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:
</span></strong><span>It is not recommended to turn off user account control; we are just trying to narrow down the issue. Please, turn on UAC after the test is done. See the link below:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off</span></a>

                    <p>Try to reboot using the same USB drive and select "repare" and cannot make this recovered.</p>
<p>So I use the Media Creation Tool create the USB installation media again, install again, and get the same issue.</p>

<h3> medinadon  say:</h3>
<h2>            High ping speeds Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Cannot find reason an&nbsp;accurate way to test ping speed(latency) in my xbox one. My xbox one network settings. show 95ms consistently on. NAT2(open). My PS 4 is 36ms consistently on NAT2(open) using same wired router and modem. All pings I thought were&nbsp;through nearby servers. Usually Cleveland. &nbsp;I see in other posts that Xbox pings are only through Seattle. I would prefer local servers that I usually use so ping tests are meaningful. What are you seeing???&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Screen resolution has changed in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ilyazeld  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen resolution has changed in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Three days ago, I upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10. For two first&nbsp;days, the text, images and everything else were fine. However, today, after I reboot my computer, the resolution changed to 1024x768, the lowest, and everything is distorted: the circles look
 like ovals, the images and the windows&nbsp;are stretched. When I try to change resolution, I get message that it's out or range. This message stays in the middle of the screen and would not go away until I return back to the lowest resolution.</p>
<p>I tried all&nbsp;suggestions published so far in this forum, nothing helps. My ATI Radeon HD 3200 card shows the latest driver and would not update. But running troubleshooter for 3 .msi files in video driver package show that they are not compatible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Why for two days the resolution was normal and what changed it? What can be done to restore correct resolution?</p>

<h3> grapeman1965  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I get WMM6 into Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    Is it possible to re-install WMM6 onto Windows 7? We've tried the new WLMM, and can't stand it. It's lack of a proper timeline is a real drawback. We'd like to re-install WMM6, which we used very successfully for making small training videos. Your help
 would be appreciated.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>&nbsp;Hi Sam, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and posting your query on Microsoft community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
From your issue description, I understand that ad-hoc network is unable to detect by other devices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
To resolve this issue I need a little more information so please answer the following questions.</div>
<div><br />
1. How are you connected to ad-hoc network?<br />
2. What is the security software installed on the computer?<br />
3. What is the make and model of the Network adapter?</div>
<div>4. Are you on a domain computer?<br />
5. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can’t create an ad hoc network in Windows 8 and Windows RT, but you can connect to an ad hoc network if one is in range (unless your PC is running Windows RT). There are third-party tools for creating ad hoc networks, if you need to do this.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now let’s try some steps for resolving this issue such as Internet Explorer troubleshooter, which I have described as methods given below.
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Run the network troubleshooter and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to run the Network troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span> </span></span></span>Press <b>Windows key + C</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span>Type <b>Troubleshooting</b> and click<b>Troubleshooting</b> under
<b>Settings</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span>Now type <b>Network Troubleshooter</b> in the<b>search</b> option.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span> </span></span></span>Click on <b>Network</b> <b>troubleshooter</b> to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<div>I suggest you disable the firewall of the third party security software installed on the computer and check.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> You should not turn off Firewall unless you have another firewall enabled. Turning off Firewall might make your computer (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.</div>
<div>You can also follow this link.</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/whats-new-in-networking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/whats-new-in-networking</a></div>
<div>
<div>I also suggest you to check if there are any interference between the computer and network such as cordless phone or any other devices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue persists then,&nbsp;I suggest you post the same question on TechNet forums and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer to the link.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this information helps you. If you need any further assistance or information about Windows, I will be glad to help you.<br />

<p>You can change it at any time, but you will have to pay for it. It is not possible to get a free change. Forced gamertag changes only happen when the enforcement team have determined that your gamertag violates the code of conduct and you are then given
 a randomly generated tag that you must pay to change if you want something else.</p>
<p>If you're being harrassed, you need to file complaints and block communications with those people.</p>

            Hey there, yunwa 
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. 
<br />
<br />Please can you answer the following:
<br />-What is your make and model of your device?
<br />-Is it a 32 bit or 64 bit?
<br />-How old is the device?
<br />
<br />Please can you run sfc /scannow in command prompt. To open Command Prompt, please right click onto Start and select Command Prompt Admin from the list. 
<br />
<br />Alternatively search for Command prompt using Cortana and right click and select run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />Please let me know the results,

<br />
<br />Would like to look at Rollback logs.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.

<p>Hi Nathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I'm trying to update my Asus VivoTab 8 (M81C).</p>
<p>- It's currently running Windows 10 Home 32-bit, but the processor should be capable of 64-bit, if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p>- I can't exactly remember when I bought the device, but it was around that time when Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 could be freely upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently running that command, but it's taking quite long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for helping me,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong>&nbsp;It says here:</p>
Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some<br />
of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For<br />
example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not<br />
supported in offline servicing scenarios.

<br />Thanks for the reply. 
<br />
<br />I see. It was just one of the errors found may be due to controlled updates. It seems to me, and I could be mistaken, that something was missing within the Windows update. Please can you try installing the update through this website and hopefully this may hep:
<br />
<br />Please follow this link to the Microsoft Download page for this update: <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=821363" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=821363</a> 
<br />
<br />Meanwhile I will look further into the logs provided. Hope this helps,

            I already tried both the update assistant and the media creation tool, but neither have worked so far. I can try again, but I don't think I'll have success.

            <p>hey,<br />
As windows 10 is an upgrade, you do not need to install anything again.Your all files and settings will be preserved.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
