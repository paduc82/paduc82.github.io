<p>Is there a utility that will enable me to backup an entire Windows Mobile 6.5 Professional Phone (The HP IPAQ Glisten) and restore it after a factory reset? &nbsp;I have Windows Vista 64-bit on my desktop with Windows Mobile Device Center as the Active Sync agent.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The phone's applications are stored in flash that is write protected (like ROM).&nbsp; So you can perform a hard reset and it will bring it back to the factory defaults.&nbsp; See<a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;taskId=120&amp;prodSeriesId=4077163&amp;prodTypeId=215348&amp;objectID=c01924107" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;taskId=120&amp;prodSeriesId=4077163&amp;prodTypeId=215348&amp;objectID=c01924107</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Press <strong>Start</strong> .</div>
</li><li>
<div>Tap <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt;<strong>Factory Restore</strong> . Follow the instructions on the screen to perform a factory restore. The iPAQ restarts and turns on. If the factory restore is successful
 you will see the words<span>Factory Restore is done</span> when the HP logo appears.</div>

            I can't reproduce that behavior, nor have I seen a post from anyone else with the same problem. Please take screen shots of the same equation in both Linear and Professional forms and post them here. (To do so, you have to save the screen shots as graphic
 files on your drive, and use the Insert Image button in the row above the forum editor to upload the file into your post.)

            <p>Hello World,</p>
<p>This bug is not that easy to reproduce. Note: There is no need to go from "linear" to "professional" to produce the bug. Here is how to do it. (The following instructions pertain to Word 2016):
</p>
<p>In Equation editor, enter the following string: x1x2...xN, where 1,2,...N are all subscripts.
<br />
The "dots'' represent three periods, and must be entered&nbsp;exactly as shown when entering the equation. Once entered, save the equation as ''New Equation''. Give it some name, say "Test". You will then be asked&nbsp;to enter some data pertaining to "Test".&nbsp;The first
 item is called "Gallery" There you will see "Equations" already filled in as the default. Leave it as is. The next line is called ''Category". There you will see "General'' already filled in. Use the drop-down menu and change "General'' to ''Built-In". Skip
 down to the last line called "Options" Use the drop-down and select "Insert Content Only". Hit "OK" to exit. Once you are back in 'Word", you will now see that&nbsp;"Test" is listed among all the&nbsp;built-in equations, showing&nbsp;that the&nbsp; string&nbsp;"x1x2...xN" is the associated
 equation.&nbsp; Now, use Equation Editor to&nbsp;enter the string 'Test' into the equation box. Once entered, use the drop down menu and click on the "Professional" option. All of a sudden, subscripts become superscripts! Interestingly, I found that if the string is
 entered directly into Equation Editor (rather than first saving it as a built-in equation), subscripts are not changed to superscripts. It seems to occur only when saved and then entered. Removing the three "periods'' seems also seems to avoid the bug.
<br />
Let me know&nbsp;if you are able to reproduce this strange phenomenon, ...Ron</p>

            <p>Sorry, I'm still not seeing it. Possibly I'm not following exactly the steps you did.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first step of creating the expression, if I enter the 1, 2, and N as subscripts (either by using the appropriate template from the Scripts button on the ribbon, or by preceding each one with an underscore and pressing the spacebar after each), then
 the equation is already in Professional format before I add it to the Equation gallery. It also appears in Professional format in the gallery, and upon inserting it into an equation box on the document it is again in Professional format. Using the dropdown
 and clicking Professional doesn't change anything.</li><li>Having inserted the equation from the gallery, I can switch it back and forth between Professional and Linear as often as I like; I never get any superscripts.</li><li>If I enter the 1, 2, and N as ordinary characters rather than subscripts, then the rest of the procedure doesn't change them to subscripts or to superscripts.</li></ul>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Hi Jeroen,</p>
<p>To look into the problem, can you perform the steps &nbsp;below and let us know the outcome?</p>
<p>1. Make sure you have the content organizer enabled in both the source site as well as the destination site.</p>
<p>2. Check the content organizer settings in the source site and make sure you have checked the
<b>'Allow rules to specify another site as target location</b>' option from the resource site -&gt; Site Settings -&gt; Content organizer setting.</p>
<p>3. Create a Send to connection to the destination site as the following article and see if you can select the destination site as a targeted location when creating rules:</p>

You can try this. Change you profile information from UK to US and try again. I have the similar problem when signed up a new account. At first I changed my browser language. It always worked but this time not. Then I updated my profile information and got
 it. <br />
And use a proxy maybe better.<br />

            <p>Hi debhansen57.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me do my best to help you with your concern about unblocking your accounts in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allow me to clarify some things. When you mentioned you want to unblock, are you referrring to the option we have in "People" to unblock a contacts or does it mean you have added those contacts to your block senders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the options you have when clicking the "More mail settings"? For us to have that option, make sure you are on your mailbox in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if you are referring that you have blocked those contacts from your "People" page in Outlook here's what we are going to do. Go the
<a href="https://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://people.live.com</a> then choose the contact you have blocked before click on the elipses (three dots next to Add to favorites) then select unblock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how things turn out!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi kp21,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. From what I understand, you want to be able to receive email messages again from the subscribed website that was blocked before. Am I correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, we advise you to add the domain address of this sender to your safe senders list if you could no longer see the domain address in your blocked senders list to make sure that emails from this sender will be moved to your Inbox folder. To do this, follow
 the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. In your Outlook.com Inbox, click the cog icon beside your Profile name.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Click
</span><b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">More mail settings</span></b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Under
<font><i>Preventing junk email</i>, click <b>Safe and blocked senders</b>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Click
<font><b>Safe Senders</b>. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. In the text box, type in the email address or domain you’d like to always receive email from,
 and then click <font><b>Add to list &gt;&gt;</b>.</font></span></p>

<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. This thread is all unblocking certain contacts in the People page. Since your concern is somewhat not related to the post of the original poster, could you provide us a more detailed description of the issue you are encountering?
 Better yet,&nbsp;you may opt to create a thread of your own stating the issue you are having, so that a moderator will be able to address it in a timely manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

At one time I was considering changing to G mail. After I moved my contacts to gmail, I decided against it and closed the gmail account<br />

It is since then that I have had the trouble.<br />

Can you help<br />

            <p>Hi Ernie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I understand, you're unable to properly manage your contact list and among the actions you cannot perform are deleting or changing email addresses. Allow me to assist you on this issue though I would like to ask for more details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you made any recent changes on your account prior to the issue aside from what you have mentioned on your post?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you happen to receive any error message when you try changing email addresses or deleting them? If so, please post the complete message on your next reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also mentioned of moving your contacts to Gmail which I supposed you are referring to your Microsoft account contacts to your Gmail account. I would like to verify how exactly did you perform this activity? What are the steps you took?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue, <span><font color="#000000"><font>please optimize your browser to ensure its full performance and this&nbsp;will also help us isolate for a possible browser issue. To do this, you may refer to the link I posted below:</font></font></span></p>

<h2>            How do you edit query properties in Access 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have the property sheet of a query open and it has a bunch of query properties listed, but I cannot edit them, nor see what the settings are. With 2010, I could change a query to snapshot, dynaset, or set unique values to true/false, etc. This is a select
 query, and it is my database where I have full permissions. How do I change them?</p>

            You should be able to grab the left border and drag it to the left to widen the properties sheet. That should expose the right column where the settings live.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last 5 years I have been using a different "reply to" address when sending email from my Outlook account (it happens to be my Gmail work email).&nbsp; Recently I have noticed that all of my sent&nbsp;emails are going from my Outlook account without&nbsp; Gmail
 being my reply to address.&nbsp; I tried to change it in the settings, however, I no longer see this option.&nbsp; Is there a way to change the reply to address baack to my Gmail account?&nbsp; If not, I will have to give up my Outlook account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Plans for peer to peer wireless projection</h2>
                    Are there plans to integrate miracast-like or&nbsp;Wi-Fi Direct&nbsp;functions so a Win 10 machine can do peer to peer screencasting?&nbsp; We spend a lot of time installing products that make tablet projection capable through a desktop and it would behoove Microsoft
 to do this for school and office uses and make it work across any device or platform.&nbsp; I know there are hardware requirements, but this is a must for Win10 to keep any foothold in the classroom.&nbsp;

                    <p>I have a report that comes into my database from an outside source.&nbsp; There are several time columns on the report.&nbsp; Unfortuantely, one of the columns is not correctly formatted so Access sees it as text.&nbsp; It shows 0950 instead of 09:50.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to convert it using </p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE Table1 SET Table1.StartTime = Left(Table1.[StartTime],2) &amp; ":" &amp; Right(Table1.[StartTime],2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes it look right however, it doesn't behave right.&nbsp; I need to use this field to calculate elapsed time and as it isn't a time field that calculation doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way using code that I can change the format of the column?&nbsp; I don't want to have to go in and do it manually each time I import the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be gratefully received.</p>

            Updating the StartTime field doesn't turn it into a date/time field - it's still a text field. I'd create a new field called RealStartTime or so, and update that from the StartTime field.

            <p>In Addition to Hans advice. You also need to use the TimeSerial function to update the new field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another point to consider is whether there is a date portion to this data. If the start and end times overlap midnight, you will not get accurate data in calculating elapsed time.&nbsp;</p>

            As Hans points out you need to update a separate column of date/time data type.&nbsp; Update this to:<br />
<br />
CDate(Format([StartTime],"00:00"))<br />
<br />
If Scott's point about start and end times spanning midnight is an issue see TimeSheet.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />

If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />

            <p>Times will span midnight on occasion. There is a date column. I was planning to convert StartTime to a time field then concatenate with the date field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>use my my previosly mentioned formula to turn 0950 into 09:50</p>
<p>

            <p>Why go through multiple steps when you only have to do one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no such thing as a Time datatype. There is one datatype for date and time. It is actuall a Double precision type where the Integer portion is the number of days since 12/30/1899 and the time portion a fraction of a day (i.e 6AM= .25). That's why
 if periods span midnight you need both together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So run ONE update query</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE table SET fieldname = datefield+TimeValue(...);</p>
<p>
</p><p>You probably should add the date to all the other time fields.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I showed you how to do that earlier:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CDate(Format([StartTime],"00:00"))<br />
<br />
More importantly, however, if you currently have one column with the date and other columns with the times, then simply adding the date to each of the times will give you incorrect values.&nbsp; If you have a date of 2015-08-14 and a start time of 18:00 and an end
 time of 02:00, i.e. 2:00 AM the following day, then adding the single date to each would give you a start value of 2015-08-14 18:00:00 and end value of 2015-08-14 02:00:00, i.e. the shift ended 16 hours before it started.&nbsp; The elapsed duration would consequently
 be a negative value.&nbsp; To add the date and times like this it would be necessary to take account of both times, so that 1 would be added the end value to place it in the following day.<br />
<br />
My demo, to which I referred you earlier does exactly as you are doing, having a single date for the day on which a shift starts and separate start and end times, which, under the skin, are implemented as 64 bit numbers with a zero integer element.&nbsp; The functions
 in my demo cater for this and return the correct duration, e.g.<br />
<br />
? TimeDurationAsDate(#18:00#,#02:00#)<br />
08:00:00<br />
<br />
whereas a simple subtraction would return a negative value:<br />
<br />
? #02:00# - #18:00#<br />
-0.666666666666667 <br />
<br />
In the latter case the sign would be removed if the return value is formatted as time, but the result would be incorrect:<br />
<br />
? Format(#2015-08-14 02:00# - #2015-08-14 18:00#,"hh:nn")<br />
16:00<br />

            <p>Yes.&nbsp;Place&nbsp;the insertion point in the header or footer you want to unlink from the one in the previous section. The contextual
<strong>Header &amp; Footer Tools | Design</strong> tab of the Ribbon will be displayed. In the
<strong>Navigation</strong> group, click <strong>Link to Previous</strong> to turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each section can have up to three different headers/footers (if you have enabled
<strong>Different First Page</strong> and/or <strong>Different Odd and Even</strong>). Each of these--primary or Odd&nbsp;Header/Footer, First Page Header/Footer, and Even Header/Footer--must/may be unlinked from its counterpart in a previous section (you can link
 or unlink any one of them independently of all the rest).</li><li>It may not be necessary to unlink the header/footer if the different content you want reflects content in the document, such as a chapter title: you can use a StyleRef field to pick up the current content of a particular style (such as Heading 1) in the
 header/footer. If you want to leave a given header/footer blank, however, you do have to unlink it.</li></ol>

 OneNote, I am now seeing notebooks that I had no intention of sharing with my business partner, stored in the Office 365 version of OneNote. &nbsp;QUestions:</p>

            OneNote for Mac only allows you to save notebook in OneDrive. not locally. If I understand it looks like your partner is sharing an account with you? If so I do not think you can keep him/her from seeing your notebooks. Its pretty easy to get a OneDrive
 account, why don't you open one of your own and you will be able to share whatever notebooks you want and not share those you don't.

            Hi Julie
<div><br />
<div>The Mac version of Office does not have language packs and the ability to change the user interface as the PC versions do. You'd have to buy the other language version.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can edit in other languages and it's part of the spellcheck and grammar functions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Query your help function to get more info on that feature.</div>

<h3> psjoholm  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop Skype from changing my online status to active automatically&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It is frustrating with Skype that, if I set myself as invisible, all of a sudden Skype makes me active again. I haven't been able to figure out what is the cause of this change. What controls this change? how come it doesn't remember my status?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Skype installed on 2 PCs, Windows 10. On each PC I set myself as invisible. I'll check it again the next day and all of sudden I am active again? My PCs stay on most of the day, but do go into sleep occasionally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish to stay invisible at all times, unless I manually change myself active. How do I accomplish this please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!!</p>

<p>Hi Julie. Version 12.10.572.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will attempt the reinstall today and keep you posted. I definitely think it has something to do with the 2 Skype's running simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turn one invisible and the other one does not switch to invisible. I then switch the other one invisible, come back to the first one, and it's once again back online. It's like they don't talk to each other and one overwrites the other. Basically, the
 issue comes down to the push notification not working correctly. When I change one to invisible, it should push a notification to the other to go invisible. Instead, eventually that other one pushes a notification back and sets me back visible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue is that closing Skype does not actually close Skype. It continues to run in the background. So, even if I attempt to close one of them, it's still interfering with the active status in the background. How do I actually quit Skype?</p>

<p>This does not work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on the icon, in the taskbar, only gives options for:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Close Window (does not actually quit Skype. It still runs in the background, which can be seen from the Task Manager running background processes )</li><li>Unpin from taskbar (obviously not quit)</li><li>The Skype logo with the word Skype next to it (opens the Skype window)
<ol>
<li>Right clicking the Skype logo gives option for Open, which opens the Skype window.&nbsp;</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p>Your steps used to work, a few updates back, but no longer a valid set of steps.</p>

<p>It is painful to watch all these MS topics on the issue and see copy/paste attempts to solve a long time known problem that was never resolved like this. Can you guys use a search engine and see how many people complain about it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a problem in the software, Microsoft, have your developers fix it, instead of wasting people's time with with all the unnecessary investigations/re-installs/resets or whatever you can think of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter on how many devices one is logged in. An option, like the online status, should be synced across them.</p>

<p>Agreed. I am a veteran IT administrator, who understands that most people don't know these steps, but there's definitely an issue with the software and it's become very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter what I do, I somehow always end up online....reboots, re-installs, resets (which a reinstall should already address), only using 1 PC to access Skype, it doesn't matter...I am now always online when I don't want to be...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider this a security issue with Skype, there should be no reason the software places me online when I have explicitly placed myself invisible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I completely agree. Please try and google it. This is ridiculous and this issue has been around for years now and MS is apparently either not able or willing to put in the necessary effort to solve it. Extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>I have skype running on two devices (windows 10 laptop and Android phone) and since skype forced itself to upgrade on my Android phone this problem came back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to have a MS 950XL phone and it used to have the same problem back then as well. Never solved.</p>
<p>I tried reinstalling and all other options mentioned here. Same issue still exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be a simple fix so all us suffering from this issue do not have to waste time on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.s.</p>
<p>And please stop any bloody updates before you have thoroughly tested them first. Every time the windows 10 skype updates come there is an issue. Aaarrrggghhhhh</p>

<p>EXACTLY. I AM NOT AN IT ADMIN BUT HAVE CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE ACQUIRED OVER THE YEARS AS WELL AS AN ENGINEERING BACKGROUND. THIS IS A SKYPE SECURITY ISSUE. FIX IT INSTEAD HAVING US GO THROUGH ALL THESE SENSELESS TRIALS AND ERRORS.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 Doesn&#39;t Download</h2>
                    <p>My old computer had Microsoft Home and Student pre-installed on it.&nbsp; I bought OEM license key for Home and Student 2007 awhile ago for that computer.&nbsp; Now, that computer has died (motherboard problems).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to install Home and Student 2007 on my new computer with my OEM license (which is supposedly still valid for a second computer).&nbsp; I've been trying to download Home and Student 2007 from http://www.microsoft.com/office/downloads/hs/default.aspx, but
 the download interrupts when it gets to 67%.&nbsp; I've used both Firefox and Explorer at two different locations on two different computers (thus eliminating this as a local network or computer issue).&nbsp; Unfortunately, I have the same result no matter how I try
 to download this link, and I've tried downloading this several times over several days' time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to download Home and Student 2007 from https://www20.downloadoffice2010.microsoft.com/o12/registerkey.aspx?ref=o12&amp;culture=en-GB, however, the site doesn't accept my license key.&nbsp; I can only assume that this is because I'm using an OEM
 license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any useful way for me to download this program?</p>

            <p>Sorry, but you are mistaken.&nbsp; The OEM license terms are different than the Retail license terms which you are referring to.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Retail license allows install on up to 2 computers at the same time. The OEM license may only be installed on the factory computer
 (and cannot be transferred to other computers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>These license term restrictions are part of the reason that the OEM license is cheaper to buy than the equivalent retail license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a snip of the relevant section of the MS License Terms in the OEM section of the document</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.&nbsp; </strong>The software license is permanently
<br />
assigned to the device with which you acquired the software.&nbsp; That device <br />
is the “licensed device.”&nbsp; A hardware partition or blade is considered to <br />
be a separate device.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
a.&nbsp; Licensed Device.&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">You may install and use one copy of the software
</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">on the licensed device. </span></strong></p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see the license terms for yourself.&nbsp; In any Office 2007 Application click on the Office button (upper left corner of the ribbon) &gt; Word Options button &gt; Resources option &gt; About button. Click on the "View Microsoft Software License Terms" hyperlink.&nbsp;
 You'll have to scroll down to find the OEM section of the document.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've&nbsp;reviewed several posts in regard to similar issues, but I haven't seen an answer that solves this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it a browser issue with Chrome? Please provide a solution. </p>

<p>Hello Morgan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to post here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, we'd like to narrow down this issue from the two side:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On your side, please make sure you are using the latest Skype for Business client. And then confirm if the issue persists in the below scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>You share a screen with your colleagues in/out office with the Skype for Business client.</span></li><li><span>You share a screen with your colleagues in/out office, but your colleagues use the Chrome browser. If possible, use the Chrome
 for Mac browser to test.</span></li></ol>
<p>As we can check if the issue is caused by the unstable network or the Skype for Business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On your client side, please try clearing the Browser cache and then run the browser in private mode to try again. Note: Please disable the A/V software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to your update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rudy</p>
        </p>

<p>Good Morning and thank you for the follow up. Yesterday I did a test with my client and it did not work.&nbsp; He cleared his&nbsp;browser, open Chrome for MAC in a private browser; he got the same results blank screen. In addition, I spoke to the IT team here at
 work about the issue. Given the company do not provide or support MAC computers&nbsp;he could not advise unless the laptop was here on site. My client is in another state.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more recommendations? Thank you for the follow up. </p>

<p><span>Hi Morgan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am sorry for late update with you. As you said your client just see a black screen when he join skype meeting in chrome for mac, to narrow down this issue, you can suggest your client trying some test as below:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If convenient, please advise your client change another Mac machine to check if he can see your screen sharing on Chrome to isolate if this issue cause by some drivers or other applications on his own mac.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you said he can not see your screen sharing on the skype meeting, what about other people( his other friends or colleagues )share screen in the skype meeting to him? Does he can see it on his own Mac machine?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the issue persists on the skype online meeting( web side ), I recommend your client can try to use skype for business desktop app &nbsp;to check if he can see your screen sharing normally.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Oliver</span></p>

<h2>            Cannot search PDF file created from Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have recently upgraded from Word 2007 to Word 2016 (Office365).&nbsp; Previously when saving Word documents as PDFs, the PDF files were searchable in Acrobat Reader.&nbsp; Since upgrading to Word 2016, large square blocks are returned when attempting to search
 using Acrobat.&nbsp; Works ok in other PDF readers such as Drawboard PDF and Foxit Reader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to only affect Word files with macros and fields.&nbsp; If we uncheck the "Document structure tags for accessibility" when saving as PDF, the&nbsp;search function in Acrobat is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this with Adobe Acrobat Reader ver 9, ver 11 and Acrobat Reader DC 2017, all with the same search behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anybody able to explain what has changed between Word 2017 and Word 2016?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phill</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did resolve this issue for anyone else who may run into this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, I had been opening old ".doc" files and saving them as ".docx".&nbsp; I had assumed that this would "convert" the file to the latest format before saving as a pdf.&nbsp; This does not happen and the document remains unconverted and therefore continues
 to experience the pdf search issue described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The simple resolution is to open the ".doc" file,&nbsp; "convert"&nbsp; the file (File&gt;Info) and then save as .pdf.&nbsp; This will give you a correctly formatted and accessible pdf file that can be searched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
        </p>
