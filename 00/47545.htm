<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply to the question:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which operating system are you using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us try the following steps and see if they help:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Install the software. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Use the USB cable to transfer the photos from your cell phone to your computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The kit will include a data cable as well as the software (if necessary) to transfer your photos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Follow your phone's specific instructions to activate its storage drive.
</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Drag and drop the pictures off your phone into the photo file on your computer. Disconnect your phone according to its instruction to avoid damaging your memory card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OR, you may also try:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Use your removable memory card. If your phone is equipped with a removable memory card you will find it very easy to just remove the card and use it to move the photos from your cell phone to your computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>To use this option you may need to purchase a memory card reader. Just make sure to purchase the correct type of reader for your memory card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Remove the memory card from your phone per its specific instructions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Insert the memory card into the reader/adapter.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Plug the reader into an available port on your computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Open the memory card's drive and transfer the photos from your phone to your computer.</p>

    <title>My Skype account has been hacked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darko nikolovski  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Skype account has been hacked</h2>
                    <p>Hello to all Skype users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I discovered that my Skype account has been hacked. When I enter my password, it says that the old password is no longer valid. When I try to recover the account or change the password it tells me where should I be contacted. My original contact
 information is no longer there but an email from Russia (yu.....*** Email address is removed for privacy ***).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have tried all methods offered by Skype and still it does not allow me. The account was subscribed to a Skype Number today @ $ 6.50 a month.
</p>
<p>What can I do, how I can get this account suspended</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b079ad57-061c-46a0-b51b-61eb68967d27" title="Darko Nikolovski">
<p>
</p><p>If you have learned that your Skype account was hacked, you will need to recover it first before you can proceed deleting it. Since deleting an account can only be done on the account's owner end. Please open this link to fill out the verification form &gt;
<strong><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Verification Form</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For additional information, here are some tips that might help improve your chances of successfully using the Account Recovery form to regain access to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer you previously used to access the account.
</li><li>Also it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.</li><li>Even if your original information has changed, be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally.</li><li>You don't need to fill out the whole form; just the fields that you know apply to your account. Note: While most responses will come within a few minutes, it can take up to 24 hours for a response to be received.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We, at Skype, no longer have an option to delete accounts. Microsoft aimed to bring convenience on your end and that means you do not need to contact us to process the cancellation. You may click this link for the step by step process in deleting your account:&nbsp;
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account?q=close+accoun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I close my Skype account?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To set your expectation, if you proceed to delete your Skype account, the associated Microsoft account will be closed as well. This is due to the full migration of Skype to Microsoft and one credentials to all Microsoft Products. If you are using other email
 domains such as Yahoo, Gmail, etc., you can still use the email for signing in to any other email account but can no longer be used to sign in to any Microsoft Products.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your account will be closed after 60 days, but you if you change your mind anytime during the 60 day period. All you have to do is sign in to your account again to cancel the closure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 60-day waiting period helps keep hackers from changing an account’s security info as a way to completely take over that account. This waiting period gives the real account owner enough time to be alerted of the change and to cancel it in case they didn’t
 start it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I understand that. You can fill out the form 3 times a day, so you can try to recover your Skype account until you pass the verification form. You can also consider creating a new Skype account if there's an urgent need to use Skype.

<h2>            Changing preferred DNS Server IP address not taking any effects. Its using another server that i have no idea about it</h2>
                    <p>The problem began when i couldn't access some URLs (on the internet) and the error tells the server refuses connection (or not responding).</p>
<p>The problem gives me a headache for accessing these addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested them in other Laptops and they working just fine but in my Laptop they are not working.</p>
<p>I pinged the domains and after a long time about thinking on the problem, i found out that all of ping requests on different domains is going to a same IP address (10.10.34.35).</p>
<p>I thought the DNS is not working properly and i set a public (and tested) DNS server in the Preferred DNS Server field in related network interface configuration, and then tried again after clearing arp table using `arp -d *` but that domain address resolved
 to the same IP (10.10.34.35)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally i edited the `%systemroot%/system32/drivers/etc/hosts` file and added IP address for one of the domains in this `hosts` file (i got the IP address of domain using another laptop) accessing to the domain worked just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT THE PROBLEM IS STILL THERE</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked because i added the known IP address to local hosts file MANUALY.</p>
<p>What should i do now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OS: Windows 10 - Version 1803 (build 17134.254)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's take care of your concern. Windows.old is safe to delete, but keep in mind that after removing the folder you will no longer be able to roll back or downgrade to the previous version of Windows 10, as it contains the files for recovery/rollback.</p>
<p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>The next step to follow is to install the ActiveX add on which is prompted to check for a genuine version of Windows.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Continue option triggers that ActiveX Control to be installed on the local computer to check if the computer which is trying to access the Microsoft download center is a legitimate copy or not.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Just look out for a information bar below the address bar(Internet Explorer 8), or at the bottom of the page (Internet Explorer 9).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once the validation is complete then the download page will automatically show up and the Continue option will be replaced with the Download option, However if the page does not show up automatically then simply use the back option in the browser to move
 tothe original Download screen.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are a few reference links for more information.</div>

</p><p>I am going to do a clean install of Seven. My question is, how do I find out the W10 activation key? I have an HP Touchscreen PC, I have the recovery partition for Seven and its own key so I should be able to install that OK. But if in future I try to downgrade
 to Ten I presume I will need its key - how to find it before reformatting?</p>

<p>I did a clean reformat/install back to Seven and all is well. A pain reinstalling all my programs but well worth it, apart from the wretched constant invitation to get Ten.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will continue with 7 until support ends and then have to make a choice, Ten, Apple with Windows&nbsp; or Linux with Windows. What a choice!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Of all the W10 annoyances I think the worst by far is the way that updates are pushed whether you want them or not.</p>
<p>I accept that they are a fact of life with Windows, but everything that M$ does is based on American rules. Millions of us don't have fast broadband - my "broadband" gives an average of 1.3MBs. When an update comes in it basically made my computer unusable
 - but there's no indication of why, it just got glacial. Back in Seven I can at least organise my updates when I like.</p>

            <p>Update!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently purchased a HP Spectre laptop which unfortunately has Ten as the OS. Many of the same random problems affect that as well as the desktop that I changed back to Seven (and have subsequently gone back, against my better judgement, to Ten)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is brand new, so no excuses! It will not do the November update - the record shows 26 -twenty six - failed updates of 1511 10586.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there no-one in Microsoft who understands that yes, we do want updates, but this pushing them at any time, with no indication whatever that the computer is in the process of doing it, is absolutely appalling?</p>

</p><p>You cannot just leave a laptop running 24/7 just in case - the battery will run down and in any case it's not a good idea to leave one on charge indefinitely.</p>

    <title>NTLDR is missing__Windows XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopherx  say:</h3>
<h2>            NTLDR is missing__Windows XP</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I am running a Compaq Presario SR 1811nx Desktop.&nbsp; I believe it was running Windows XP Home as its operating system.</p>
<p>A while ago it stopped being able to boot up.&nbsp; When it is turned on it will give the NTLDR is missing:&nbsp; Ctrl + Alt + Del to restart.</p>
<p>When I perform this function I am taken to the Compaq screen.&nbsp; If I do nothing and wait I am returned to this prompt;&nbsp; I have also tried F10 which takes me to the Bootable Portion though its regular menu is gone and it instead notes that there is problems
 with the portion.&nbsp; I go through the okays and then it takes me to the load menu where I would usually go through the process to restore my desktop to factory condition but during the load bar it asks for my Recovery CD #2.&nbsp; I have my system recovery disks
 and put them in.&nbsp; Unfortunately it just freezes at this point.&nbsp; So this avenue is a dead one it seems.</p>
<p>Microsoft notes to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/320397?p=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
(http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/320397?p=1</a>)</p>
<p>obtain the Bcupdate2.exe utility as well as make a "boot disk".</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/305595/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/305595/</a></p>
<p>I have never done this before and I find the instructiosn a tad confusing.&nbsp; For instance;&nbsp; Do I put the Bcupdate2.exe on the same disk as I am putting Ntldr and the Ntdetect.com files?&nbsp; For the</p>
<p>[boot loader]<br />
timeout=30<br />
Default= multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\windows<br />
[operating systems]<br />
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\windows="&lt;var&gt;&lt;OperatingSystem&gt;&lt;/var&gt;"</p>
<p>would I just put Microsoft Windows XP or Microsoft Windows XP Home?</p>
<p>etc. etc.</p>
<p>Also when I start the computer should I put this cd in or put it in before I start it?&nbsp; Also what is suppose to happen when this is done, does the "Ntldr is missing" screen dissapear and something else happens?</p>
<p>In general my computer knowledge is not advanced, and I would really appreciate someone to help me just make a checklist of things to do to try this avenue out.</p>
<p>I am not the wealthiest person and buying a new computer is at this time not an option I have.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for the help, and I hope you all have a great day.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the very detailed post. I am happy to give you the usual fix for "NTLDR is missing" but you will need a real XP CD, not a recovery disc, to do them. However, the information you gave about your computer freezing when you put in the recovery
 discs leads me to suspect that a software fix (the NTLDR fix) will not work because you have hardware failure.</p>
<p>I would start troubleshooting by testing the hard drive, which may have failed.</p>
<p>Test the hard drive with a diagnostic utility downloaded from the drive mftr.'s website or use Seagate's SeaTools For DOS. You will create a bootable CD with the file you download. You will need third-party burning software to do this such as Roxio, Nero,
 or the free ImgBurn. Burn as an image, not as data.<br />

<br />
Boot with the CD you made and do a thorough test of the drive. If it fails any physical tests, replace it. Let me know the results of this test before we go further. If you have any questions about how to perform the hard drive test, please let me know.</p>

            You can use the keyboard to tab to the next field. It's awkward but can be done. Or you can try with another mouse. Make sure USB legacy devices are enabled in your BIOS, too.

<p>You shouldn't hate to ask - I'm here because I want to help. Each motherboard mftr. gets you into the BIOS slightly differently. When you first turn on the machine there will be a message that says something like "Press Esc" or "Press DEL" or "Press F11"
 to enter Setup. That will get you into the BIOS. Look for an entry for USB legacy devices, usually under the integrated peripherals category. You'll have to look around because each BIOS is different.</p>
<p>When you are in the drive utility (it sounds like you chose SeaTools), there is a menu where you can choose basic tests. I usually do the short test first because if it fails that one there isn't any point in doing the long test. If it passes the short test
 (90 seconds) I will usually do the long test just to be sure. At the end of the test you will get the results. If the drive fails any physical tests (as opposed to file system corruption), it needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>Of course, other components might be bad in your case. It was my opinion that you should start testing with the hard drive.</p>

<p>Even though I set Windows Update to only install those updates I choose it continually installs updates that it doesn't tell me about. It also continually tries to have me install updates that I don't need and/or am not interested in, even though I tell
 it to hide these updates. This happens even with updates that always fail to install, it seemingly does no good to hide these updates.</p>

            You can only share games one console at a time, the Home console. So in order to share across 3 consoles, you would need at least 2 copies. You would set 1 of the kid's consoles as your Home so they can access your games there while you sign in and use
 your games on your console. Then the 2nd kid would purchase the games on their account and use the 3rd console.&nbsp;

<h2>            Busy Cursor won&#39;t go away</h2>
                    I upgraded my laptop from xp to Vista.....Seems to work fine....A Problem just started....The rotating busy icon will not go away from the desk top.&nbsp;&nbsp; It won't allow me to select something from my desk top.&nbsp; I can go to my browser and also restart and
 refresh my laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously it also allowed me to go to help so i can ask the question for this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a way to find out what it is trying to do?

            Hi tailored,<br />
<br />
How long ago did you upgrade?&nbsp; Is your hard drive also working (to the beat of the "busy cursor")? After an upgrade there is a fair amount of "housekeeping" that your computer will do to complete the upgrade and get everything in order. This should dissipate
 after a few hours (days?) though. Are you having difficulty selecting just certain applications or everything in general? Remember too that Vista uses more RAM than XP and if you have less than 1Gb, you might want to consider adding more. To get an idea of
 your pc's performance, you can go into Control Panel - System and Maintenance and click on Performance&nbsp;Information and Tools.<br />

                    <p>I think it would be handy if Microsoft created an app for Xbox Ambassadors to use. It could include access to all the activities and you would be able to view your missions and profile at the ease of pressing on a different tab.</p>

<p>I completely agree. Just a simple tools app for Ambassadors would be a useful sidekick so you would be able to easily get notifications and post in a handheld device while able you XBOX or PC. I am new to the ambassador system and while it dosnt seem to
 be a flawed system by any means, it would be a great convenience to newcomers and experienced users alike.</p>

<h2>            What is the difference between Backup &#38; Restore &#40;Win7&#41;, File History &#38; Windows Image&#63;</h2>
                    <ul>
<li>Backup &amp; Restore (Win7)</li><li>File History </li><li>Windows Image</li><li>Recovery Disk</li></ul>
<p>I know what these items do, but not sure if I should be doing them all, or just 1 or 2. I have no Win7 backups, other than what was saved in Windows.old,&nbsp;when I installed 10 over 7, but I now have 3 different archives, along with the original Win10 ISO file.
 Do I also need a 'Recovery' USB with all these backup files? I am eating up a terabyte of drive space with various backups&nbsp; on different drives and I don't wish to have them all if they are redundant. What do I NEED, and what not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Backup and Restore (Windows7) is just for Windows 7, why does it still run on Windows 10, yet still creates File Histories and System Images? Also, My Win 10 ISO is the original&nbsp;build used to install Win 10. Is it possible (or necessary) to create a new
 Win10 ISO with the current build?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what about 'Recovery' disks? Do they have to be on USB? Can they not be created on a DVD or an SD card? Do I need it at all with all the other backups? I have more backup data than I have operational files and apps!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are lots of tutorials and threads describing what they all do, just not what is actually necessary or how they differ in actual function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone clear this up for me so I can possibly retrieve some of my disk space?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Doug, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Backup and restore is the technology used in Windows 7 or earlier machines to do a backup. With the advent of Windows 8 File History and Windows image came into existence. Although they do the same job but File History is more effective than backup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have made backups using backup and restore in Windows 7, and if you want to restore it in Windows 10 then it will need backup and restore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also make recovery disks in SD card, provided it has ample space. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please revert if you face any issues with Windows in future. </p>
<p />

            Try installing it manually by downloading from the Microsoft Update Catalog:

<br />
<br />If you still experience problems installing it.
<br />
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

    <title>Reusing Windows license on a new PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rogeh marbi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reusing Windows license on a new PC</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon everyone..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a dead laptop (dead, as in "the motherboard split in half") with Windows 10 Pro installed on it (it was upgraded from a Windows 8 Pro installation). I'm wondering if it's possible for me to install Windows 8 Pro using the same license that was used
 on that laptop, <strong>on a new PC</strong>. It's a retail (boxed disc) copy I bought back when Windows 8 was all the rage. I've heard about the "de-authorization" process involving deactivating the license on the old PC using CMD before installing it on
 the new one, but considering the unbootable state of my dead laptop, is it still possible to install Windows 8 on a new PC without deactivating the license first??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I've read here : </p>
<p>(https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/stolen-laptop-license-re-use/3f0febbe-7dc5-4778-8bb9-e3f8e1c8b43f)</p>
<p>
</p><p>that it is possible, as long as the copy is installed on only one PC at a time. Well, technically my copy of Windows is installed only on one PC (the dead laptop), if I install it on the new PC it would be still installed on one PC, the new one (granted,

            Hi Rogeh.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />As long as the underlying license is retail, then you can transfer it or WIndows 10 upgrade of it (which inherits the same transfer rights) to new hardware.
<br />

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>If it is a retail license, it can be installed on the new system.</p>

            Hi Rogeh,
<br />
<br />Since that was a retail copy of Windows 8 Pro then yes, it does carry transfer rights to a new PC . . .
<br />
<br />Once you have completed the installation of Windows 10, have the product key at hand and contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you activate your Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Choose a local Phone Number:

            Hi, Rogeh,
<br />unfortunately  free upgrade from previous version does not give you rights to use it on new PC.
<br />At <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-nz/help/12435/windows-10-upgrade-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-nz/help/12435/...</a> Microsoft says:
<br />After you upgrade to Windows 10, you can reinstall or do a clean installation on the same device. 
<br />So you have to buy a new licencse.
<br />You may or may not use Windows 8 on new computer, it depends of what is a license.

            hi Rogeh, another user suggested your initial enquiry meant that the Windows 8 Pro was an upgrade, is that so or was my reading of your question correct that your Windows 8 Pro product key was retail?

                    Im getting tired of this. Whenever I click "Start game" on Mario forever, the game goes to the red curtain screen and a message pops up saying "Mario Forever has stopped working". It did pass the red curtain once, but then I pressed the wrong button and
