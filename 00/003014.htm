<p>I s there anyway I can play music through the ck-100 from my iphone as it says player connected and i can play music through it but phone call works okay by turning off the radio when a call is received or made. It would be nice if i could get the message

<p>Thanking you for your help in advance.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CK-100 is designed as a fully integrated kit for music. Only calls should come through the mono speaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There would most likely have been an ISO connection cable in the box with the kit (unless it was a speaker only variant).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the ISO cable adaptor, the calls and music are routed through the vehicle's own speakers. It may be necessary to use a vehicle specific plug which must be purchased separately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CK-100 is a professional install product, so should be installed by someone with adequate training and insurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both ck-100 kits were installed professionally through independent communications in tamworth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But they said it was not possible to route music only phone calls. Hence the reason I am asking for help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS Both kits also use Bury system 9 cradles and aerials.</p>

<p>Hi Matthew</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information the installer has given you is incorrect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CK-100 is designed and sold as a calls &amp; music product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By utilising the ISO method of installation, both music and calls can be routed through the vehicle speakers. This requires the Nokia supplied ISO cable with 24-way multiplug in order to connect to all speakers. Volume can then be controlled by the blue
 button. The kit can also be connected to an aux in on the head unit if available as the kit also has a low level stereo output.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact I would say over 90% of installations (in the UK) are done using one of the above methods. The small external speaker is now very rarely used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to message me if you need more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

            If the vibrate setting is on in the profile and it still doesn't vibrate then it most likely has a hardware or software failure.<br />

<h2>            OneNote - OCR not maintaining page layout &#40;white space between words&#47;lines&#41; when copying text</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
How can I set One Note to maintain the white spaces or page layout between different columns of a document I am placing in One Note to extract text from. eg, when scanning a bank statement, or spreadsheet type of document.<br />
<br />
In this case when scanning a bank statement, although characters are recognized, different columns and lines are jumbled up and all placed on the left. If OneNote could be told to include all the white space separating words and numbers then it would be easy
 to get the right layout when pasting to Excel (or anywhere else).<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
From Mike<br />

I don't think you can influence the OCR process in OneNote. For the kind of things that you are talking about, I suggest you use dedicated OCR software.</p>

<h2>            Maps on belle fp2&#59; sometimes don&#39;t close after use, and keeps data connection on.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I'm using a pureview 808 latest firmware (1507) and latest maps and I'm having some troubles with nokia maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes the maps app won't close and release resources completely after use. Sometimes it does so it's not consistent. It almost never close when using drive navigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I opened Drive, choose drive home and quit Drive navigation just a moment before reaching my location. Maps looked as if it had quit but something was keeping a data connection live, for several minutes after closing everything on my phone (using normal
 task manager built in). When checking what app was keeping data connection, it turned out to be maps.</p>
<p>I closed the data connection, but still noticed the phone was a tiny bit warmer than usual. Checking running processes with an app called Switcher (from app store) I see a process called MainThread running with 3-6% cpu usage. I checked with nokia energy
 profiler to see how much power my phone uses, and it was 0.03W higher than normal during idle. Normal is 0.03-0.05W for me with occacional spikes at 0.32W, but it was running between 0.06 and 0.09W. After killing the maps app the MainThread process went back
 to normal cpu time, and power consumption went back to normal lowest 0.02-0.03W and the usual 0.32W spikes every now and then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summary: Something is keeping maps alive, not releasing data connection and also keeping some code running more than necessary. Maybe the MainThread process has nothing to do with maps but it wasn't until I killed maps that it stoped using "lots of" cpu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can do to find the cause of this? .. except reflashing my phone, because that has not helped :P Is it maybe a known bug that will be fixed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>bye! :smileyhappy:</p>

<p>I use Maps v3.09 12wk09 b05 on Nokia 808 (firmware 1507) almost always in offline mode. Maps were taken from the Ovi store as the part of Nokia Mas suite 2.0.</p>
<p>I've also noticed that upon Maps application closure several processess (syncshareserver.exe, mapsbackground and s2gvariantserv.exe) remain in the memory and very often (not always though) phone standby power drain doubles - 0.06W against normal 0.03W. I
 found "mapsbackground" process to be the culprit, killing it reverts phone's power drain to normal figure without visible negative effect (save that the next Maps launching takes a bit more&nbsp;time).</p>
<p>Knowing&nbsp;that there's more recent Maps version&nbsp;(v3.09 12 wk20 b01)&nbsp;I've been looking for the way to upgrade but without result as i found neither proper .sis file nor appropriate Maps suite. It seems that to date Maps v3.09 12 wk20 b01 available as the part
 of firmware packages&nbsp;(firmware 1508 for example)&nbsp;only. Two days ago i made an experiment: using Nokia cooker i extracted Nokia maps executables from 1508 firmware and repaced existing in my phone ones with them. Following this risky venture i don't notice
 power drain increase anymore although&nbsp;3 mentioned processess still stay in the memory.</p>

            I need a new way to wipe the DVD disk. It will NOT let me use a reformatted disk.<br />
I tried that when I made my First disk?<br />
<br />
How can I wipe a disk so it thinks it is a blank un-used disk?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>I haven't used a CD or DVD to create the WDO media -- I've used the USB flash drive. If the Wizard wants a fresh disc, I don't know that there's a way to erase an RW disc to make it look like it is a fresh disc. If your PC can be booted from a flash drive,
 a cheap USB flash drive is your best option. Alternatively, you'll be needing a fresh blank disc each time.

<p>WDO is meant to be a specialized scanner to deal with infections that are impossible to remove when running Windows. Running a full scan with your installed antivirus program or a scanner such as the Microsoft Safety Scanner should be adequate for most purposes.</p>

I made a new DVD disc.&nbsp; I think what happen was when I erase the disk it put a new file on the disk.<br />
This time I try to format with a different set parameters and it worked.<br />
whatever I probably screw up somewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
No problems now<br />
I just wanted to be ready when I need it<br />
Thanks<br />

<h2>            Flags and Check Marks in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>I was previously using 2007 and was able to either flag an email for follow-up or check mark it to acknowledge that no further action was needed.&nbsp; I am now using 2010 and can only seem to flag my emails.&nbsp; The flags do not turn to check marks when complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a setting where I can change this? It was helpful for me to check emails off or flag in the past and I would really like to use this feature again.</p>

    <title>Windows Phone starting to die&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamiepattison  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone starting to die&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've had a Windows phone for a number of years. Under the impression it would become popular with more apps becoming available it seems to have taken a U-turn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, some apps are not available on WP which are on other platforms, recently i noticed some car manufacturers dont support WP but have created apps for other platforms. Today i realised Paypal is no longer supporting WP and using their app just
 refers you to their website. Amazon have also taken the approach of expiring their WP app as of August 15 2016. Some other apps i generally use have stopped working and contacting the developers is useless as either you get no reply or the app stops working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently i came across a few updates and noticed my phone occasionally switches off for no reason (albeit the latest updates seems to have improved this). WP 8.1. had better predictive text, WP 10 (with latest updates) is very poor compared to it, i could
 have texts been read out on WP 8.1 but on WP 10 i cant as i dont want to use Cortana therefore it wont read texts - seems to be going backwards in many many ways IMO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any reason for this? OR is it that WP is starting to die? I havent read any other news to give WP a better outlook but considering you spend a lot of money on phones the last thing anyone wants is a phone in 2016 that has the same functionality
 as the phones back in 2000.</p>

            Depending on which phone you have W10M just cannot run properly on legacy hardware no matter what anyone tells you. The Amazon and most likely the Paypal app will come back soon as universal W10 apps., so it's actually the users still on WP8.1 which will
 ultimately lose out.&nbsp; I personally have moved on from WP a long time ago and only have a few handsets still lying around mainly for nostalgic reasons, but I cannot imagine myself using a Windows handset as my main daily driver again.

Considering you're a moderator and if i understood you correctly, are you saying you have ditched Windows Phone and gone to a competitor phone?

            <p>I would add to the conversation&nbsp;by defining that windows phone for consumers is/has been dead...those of us still hanging on are pretty much just loyal no matter what. The apps we do get are just a bonus from the UWP, which not everyone is going to conform
 to. Everyone else has moved on and will probably never come back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, windows phones for enterprises are just beginning...once the HP Elite is out among the rumored surface phone in 2017, don't be shocked if your company makes you use a windows phone for work instead of iPhone or android...I'm assuming around
 this point, certain apps will be moderated by your company so I would only expect business apps to be allowed. If you are app crazy (like pokemon go or whatever the next hype will be), I would jump ship now.</p>

            Actually, the dominos app is only being abandoned in the UK...I'm guessing dominos isn't doing well across the pond.

<h2>            Excel &#40;Office 365&#41;&#58; Program works, but splash screen won&#39;t disappear</h2>
                    Recently, I noticed that when I open Excel for Office 365, the program opens and runs fine, but the splash screen doesn't disappear. It remains in the background once the program starts. Other windows open on top of it, it's just annoying that it won't
 go away. I can minimize and and move it around, but that's it. I unchecked the box next to "Show the start screen when this application starts", but it still shows up. Updating Office also didn't help. It only seems to be a problem with Excel as neither Word
 nor PowerPoint has this issue.

<p>
</p><p>This&nbsp;issue was occurring if you had disabled the "Show start screen" (to show a new blank workbook in Excel on boot) and had any add-in enabled.</p>

</p><p>We have addressed this issue in the latest release of Excel which is now available through Update.</p>

<p>Hello HansV MVP&nbsp;</p>
<p>First i would like to <strong>Thank You&nbsp;</strong>for taking the time to help me.</p>
<p>I have downloaded your file &amp; tried it.</p>
<p>Has it is if i <strong>manually</strong> delete the "True" in Column H1 then Column A1 to G1 unlocks so i can enter data into them &amp; when i
<strong>manually</strong> enter "True" back into Column H1 it locks A1 to G1 ok. (it works in all 9 Rows on your sheet)</p>
<p>I have set up a "tick box" &amp; Cell Linked it to H1 when i tick the box it says "<strong>True"</strong> in H1 or if i untick it &amp; it then says "<strong>False</strong>" in H1. I won't to put a Tick box on each Row.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But even when it says "<strong>false</strong>"&nbsp; in H1 it will not unlock&nbsp; A1 to G1 i have to
<strong>manually</strong> delete the "True"&nbsp;<strong> is there away around this so i can use the tick box to work the lock please.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The idea of this code is to put it in my working sheet so data is entered &amp; when the data is completed in each row (row = Months) on my sheet&nbsp; i would like to tick the box &amp; then it locks the data so it cannot be changed without unticking the tick box. i
 would hide the Column H so all i would see is the tick box. This was my plan if it worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again Thank you&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>OK, you can remove the code from the worksheet module. We need a macro in a standard module instead and assign this macro to the check boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub CheckBoxClick()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim shp As Shape<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Unprotect Password:="Secret"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set shp = ActiveSheet.Shapes(Application.Caller)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With shp.TopLeftCell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Offset(ColumnOffset:=-8).Resize(ColumnSize:=7).Locked = (shp.ControlFormat.Value = 1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Protect Password:="Secret"<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>

<h2>            printing is not black but grey when printing a word document Microsoft office 2010</h2>
                    <p>When I print a document using Microsoft Office 2010 the print is grey instead of the required black.&nbsp; On close scrutiny of the print under a magnifying glass,&nbsp;&nbsp; I see the letters are made up of alternate bands of black and white.&nbsp; There is obviously nothing
 wrong with the printer because when I access printing on My Pictures any printing comes out in pure black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can get a darker print (for all intents and purposes "black") by clicking on to "high quality".&nbsp; How can I make this my default setting?</p>

<p>Greetings beckysbubba!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Total Access forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, are the messages being deleted all of the emails that are over a certain age (over 12hours, or over 5 days, etc)?
</p>
<p>Have you tried performing a soft-reset of your device lately?</p>

            It looks like that SmartArt design was not created correctly. You can work around this by first entering as much text as you can for the graphics, then selecting the SmartArt container (the large shape holding all the smaller elements) and choosing
<strong>FORMAT&gt;Group&gt;Ungroup</strong>. This turns the SmartArt into normal text boxes and you can copy and paste one of the secondary boxes into the shapes that are missing them.

<h2>            Access 2016 Task Bar Icons Behave Differently on Windows 10 - Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I work with several Access 2016 apps that are open all the time; these are ACCDE files with their own custom icons assigned</p>
<p>
</p><p>until last week, I was working in Windows 7 64 Pro; each app's custom icon displayed correctly on the task bar, made it easy to select the correct app to work with</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro last week; now the task bar icon is always a single generic Access icon and I have to hover mouse over it to get the pop ups to select from [or use the Task View tool]</p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas why this task bar icon behavior has changed in Win 10? &nbsp;any way to get it to behave like it did in Win 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see any way within Access Options to control this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            <p>You can make changes to the taskbar's Grouping methods like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Control Panel &gt;&gt; Appearance and Personalization &gt;&gt; Taskbar and Navigation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Taskbar tab, select one of the options in "Taskbar Buttons". I've got mine set to "Combing when Taskbar is Full", which makes the most sense for my environment.</p>
<p>Note that if you have multiple displays and have selected to show taskbars on all displays, you can also set the same options in the 'Multiple Displays &gt;&gt; Buttons on other taskbars" for the taskbars showing on the non-primary displays.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I realize that indicates Vista, but I'm running Win10 and have those options as well.</p>

            I suspect that the part your are trying to highlight is not recognized as a "part" by Word. It sounds like you are trying to edit an image (scanned?) or a protected portion of a document. Image means that you have a picture of a sentence rather than a
 sentence. Imagine for the moment that you have a picture of a car. You can't drive the picture, you can't open the door and get in. You can look at it. A picture of a sentence is much the same. You can look at it, but you can't get into it.<br />
<br />
If it is an image, you need to change it into text using an OCR program.<br />

<h2>            Multiwindow no longer supported in the OneNote for Android&#63;</h2>
                    I have been using OneNote on my Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition and one of the most useful feature is the support for multwindow mode, which allows me to open side-by-side app to take notes and reference other app at the same time. However since the latest
 update (I guess it was July?) I have noticed that OneNote no longer shows up in the multiwindow app list. Is Microsoft dropping this supported feature from OneNote or is this a bug?I have been searching around the internet but could not find any answer. Any
 help would be highly appreciated.

<p>
</p><p>I joined the beta program but it needs some time for the play store to deliver the beta update, so in addition I installed the apk manually and everything works fine :)</p>

<p>Hi Jose,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, you cannot sign into OWA(Outlook Web App), please try to clear browser cache and check again, You can also try other browsers to see if there is any update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, I want to confirm that whether the OWA is enabled in the Exchange admin center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further assistance, could you please provide more details to us?</p>
<ol>
<li>Please let us know whether you could sign into OWA in the past.&nbsp;</li><li>Could you please provide a screenshot of the error message?&nbsp;</li><li>Please check whether other users have the same issue in your organization.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>

            <p>Hi <span>Gr8ness23</span>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the forum entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately the info you have provide makes it difficult to see what steps to provide you.</p>
<p>please try the following related to your error message. </p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2793339?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2793339?wa=wsignin1.0</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the step did not solve the issue </p>
<p>please back up as much as possible and do a reset. (on the Phone settings then about and reset phone )</p>
<p>Start the Phone and when asked to sign in then skip that part.</p>
<p>Set up <span>
wi-fi</span> and then have a look if you can update then. </p>
<p>if that fails as well contact the mobile operator to get the device inspected.
</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint VBA Macro - Works Fine But After Saving And Re-Opening The Macro Does Not Work Properly</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using PowerPoint 2010.&nbsp; I have created VBA code saved in Module1.&nbsp; It functions properly and everything runs fine.&nbsp; If I save the PowerPoint (pptm), close it and then re-open the code no longer works.&nbsp; It appears to stall and not pass the
 password through to the Excel file.&nbsp; If I comment out most of the code, then run it piece by piece it starts working again.&nbsp; However, if I save and re-open the file it stops working again.&nbsp; I am refreshing the presentation using a write password protected
 excel workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am saving it as a macro enabled presentation.&nbsp; All of my settings are set to enable macros, trust the VBA model etc.&nbsp; I did see posts on other sites about people having this problem with Excel 2010 and not with 2013.&nbsp; Is there a fix for this in PowerPoint?&nbsp;
 Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

</p><p>Here is the code that I am using.</p>
