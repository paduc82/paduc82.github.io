<h2>            I would like to change the alternate email address that&#39; associated with my account</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Hotmail problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two hotmail email addresses, one of them is old and I was not using it but it is still on my other account as a recovery email address. This old email has been hacked and I cannot log on to it. The hotmail email that I use got blocked because of the
 hacking and when I try to reactivate it and go through security I am told that an email will be sent to my old hotmail account (as it is the recovery email), but it is no good for me to have anything sent to that address as I cannot access it, only the hacker
 has access because they changed the password. Is there any way I can get the recovery email address changed to a safe one? Or can I get the accounts deleted. I am annoyed that Microsoft do not have a phone number so that I can speak to somebody to get this
 sorted. I have contacted support by email but I have not really got anywhere! The latest email I received was a link to here.

<h2>            Word - Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I have been happily working on a document, but now find I cannot add comments (<em><strong>right&gt;new comment</strong></em>)</p>
<p>It tells me that "you can't make this change the section is locked"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone to <em><strong>Ribbon &gt;Protect&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></em>and icon shows a lock for protect Icon</p>
<p>
</p><p>All searches I have found say go to this (or via File&lt;info&gt; protect document&gt;restrict editing) and press button to cease protection - there in&nbsp; no such option.&nbsp; In fact even the tick boxes for
<em><strong>'editing restrictions' </strong></em>or <em><strong>'formatting restrictions'
</strong></em>are not ticked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other parts of the document I can still insert comments ...... so it seems the fact it says
<em><strong>'section&nbsp; </strong></em>locked is key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How do I 'unlock' for editing ............ pretty urgent so hope someone know the fix.</p>

<h2>            Web Application Opens Blank Page</h2>
                    <p>Hello. Would like to seek your advise on this issue being encountered when users are logging in to Web applications. When users are logging in to Web application, after entering the log on credentials, 3 windows are opening. When the users right click on
 the Home page and click refresh, a new Security and Blank page windows open, thus refreshing the Home page several times will open so many Security and Blank pages.</p>
<p>The correct response of our application is that only 2 windows will open: one for home page and the other one is security page window.

            <p>Thanks Vijin for your time. See below further details on this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Is the issue confined with any particular website?
</span></p>
<p><span>- We are connected to a secured network, thus uses secured websites. We have applications installed in Citrix servers, but&nbsp;applications are presented&nbsp;online through a separate website. We&nbsp;are accessing the applications&nbsp;via that website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before, when we are accesing the&nbsp;web application on that website, there were two separate windows pops up (one for the Home page of the application, and one for the Security page window; this is normal), but now&nbsp;we are prompting with 3 windows (the
 two mentioned above and another blank window which does not show any error message or details).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- thus answering your question above, yes it is confined in a particular website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>-no. we don't have any change in the apllication server and citrix servers, other than it was the Internet Explorer version was recently (November 10)&nbsp;upgraded in Citrix Servers to version 8.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For supporting details:</span></p>
<p><span>our Citrix servers has OS version of Windows 2008, 64-bit, Internet Explorer 8.</span></p>
<p><span>Should you need further details, just let me know. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks in advance.</span></p>

    <title>Visio Online in SharePoint is not working on an iPad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ellie b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio Online in SharePoint is not working on an iPad</h2>
                    <p>So I have an iPad Mini 2 installed with iOS 11 on which I am trying to access a SharePoint site that includes Visio Online content that contains hyperlinks to other Visio Online content&nbsp;which leads to&nbsp;a Visio Document that contains hyperlinks to web pages.
 I have both the SharePoint and Visio Viewer apps installed on the iPad. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when I use the SharePoint app to access the site, and go to the Visio Online document, it begins to load and I can see the file, but then the screen goes to a blank white and nothing further happens. I can access the SharePoint site from Safari, and
 get through the Visio Online documents, but then when I get to the Visio Document, which opens in Visio Viewer,&nbsp;I cannot click on the hyperlinks to the web pages. There might be two separate issues there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also add that I have none of these issues when working on PC, everything works like a dream.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>Hi ymeillier,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in the community.<br />
<br />
The first step is to ensure your SharePoint, OneDrive &amp; Visio Viewer is on the latest version. Check them via App Store.<br />
<br />
Per my test, when navigating to the library in SharePoint App, it pops up OneDrive for viewing the library. And when pressing on the Visio file, it will open Visio Viewer to view the Visio Document.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Besides, for the behavior that hyperlink is not clickable, I do see the same during my test. You can submit the feedback via
<a href="https://visio.uservoice.com/forums/368202-visio-on-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Uservoice</a> to share your requirements with related team who are responsible for that feature area.<br />

1.Your OS version and current Visio Viewer version.(Settings&gt;General&gt;About; Settings&gt;General&gt;iPad Storage)<br />
2.Please capture a screenshot of the blank screen.<br />
3.What's the file type of that file? .vsdx, vsd or other type?<br />
4.Please confirm whether the issue occurs with all the files. Please create a new Visio file and upload it to your OneDrive for business. Then, open Visio Viewer to test whether you can open it.<br />
5.Please launch Visio Viewer, click Open&gt; Add a place to find and open that file directly rather than using SharePoint app. (If you have opened that file in browser, it may list in Recent.)<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Ellie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding to the behavior that hyperlink is not clickable, as Ryan mentioned, we kindly suggest you submit the feedback via&nbsp;<a href="https://visio.uservoice.com/forums/368202-visio-on-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Uservoice</span></a>.
 This is best method to help us improve our products. We would like to focus on the issue that you can't open Visio file in SharePoint in this thread.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>According to your description, my understanding is that the Visio files saved in SharePoint can be opened in Visio Viewer while they cannot be opened in SharePoint App. If so, it should be related to the SharePoint App. Please
 test and provide the information below one by one for us to narrow down it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your SharePoint version.</li><li>Please confirm whether the issue occurs with the Visio file saved in another site collection.</li><li>Since OneDrive app will be opened when we navigate to the library in SharePoint App, did you open Visio files via clicking Sites&gt;select the site&gt;select the Visio file listing under Activity or Recent files? If not, please share your detailed repro steps.</li><li>Please change another network environment to test.</li><li>If the issue occurs with other files saved in another site collection, please uninstall SharePoint app and reinstall it to see whether it's helpful.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above suggestions don't work, please confirm whether other users in your organization encountered the same issue. Meanwhile, please contact your IT department and provide your tenant info via

<p>1. The SharePoint version is 3.14.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I don't have any other sites that are set up like this one, but if I go to the documents library, either on my site or another one, and click on the document, it does open up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The way that the site is set up is such that the original Visio file is hyperlinked to a phrase on the home page for the site. That is supposed to open in SharePoint, and then can be clicked through, but whenever I try to access a file via a&nbsp;hyperlink,
 that seems to be where the issue is. </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Unfortunately, I can't change to another network environment as this is a work device that must stay in the building.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I uninstalled and re-downloaded the SharePoint app and it did not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I tried to insert a link in the home page of the site but I can open that Visio file via clicking the link in SharePoint App. The following are my steps to insert the link:</p>

<li><span>Navigate to the Visio file in Document Library. Right-click the file&gt;Copy link&gt;Copy.</span></li><li><span>Navigate to the home page of the site.

<h2>            A dynamic header variable - is it possible.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is possible to do with Word, if anyone can show me how to do the following I would be exceedingly grateful...</p>
<p>I am writing a historical&nbsp;novel which spans 200 years; sometimes skipping many years within each chapter. To orient the reader I would like to have the year I am writing about in the header of each page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where possible I would like to embed within the document, a non-printed incrementer that would make the header variable display the correct year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that I am still writing, often inserting sections or deleting others all throughout the document, it makes each page year number often shift.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much appreciated for any assistance.</p>

            <p>Doug Robbins has the idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <strong>new style</strong> that will be applied to the hidden year. The font color can be set to white, to be invisible against the page background, or the font can be hidden, which means it doesn't take up a line space in your final document.</li><li>Enter the date for the chapter, then apply the hidden year style. To keep track of it, it would make sense to place this just below the chapter title.</li><li>Open the header and click on the position where the year will be entered, then choose
<strong>Insert&gt;Field...</strong> from the OS X Word menu at the top of your screen.</li><li>In the <strong>Categories</strong> list, choose <strong>Links and References</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Field names</strong> list, choose <strong>StyleRef</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Options</strong> button, then on the <strong>Styles</strong> pane.</li><li>Select the style you created earlier, then click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Now when you type a year, then apply the hidden year style, the year will automatically appear in the header where you placed the StyleRef field.</p>

            Check your Access Point settings. Check whether a suitable and working Access Point has been selected for the said apps.

<h2>            Nokia C2-01 No Maps or valid certificates after updating to V11.40</h2>
                    <p>I need some help!</p>
<p>After updating my C2-01 I cannot get the maps to work.</p>
<p>I have tried Nokia Suite but that says It cannot connect to the map server.</p>
<p>Also the email app doesn't work either.</p>
<p>Also when trying to install some apps I get a message saying certificates are out of date or not valid.</p>
<p>All I can use the phone for is calling and texts.</p>
<p>I have tried many things but nothing works.</p>
<p>Nokia C2-01</p>
<p>Product code 059D690</p>
<p>RM 721</p>
<p>V.11,40.</p>
<p>HELP PLEASE.?</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3ed0782e-1c67-465a-ad61-b02e137d2397" title="anthony thompsonXU">anthony thompsonXU</a>. This may be an old thread but we would still like to extend some help with your concern. Let us address them
 one by one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Maps on your C2-01. When you say that it is not working, what exactly is happening to the app when you try to access it? Does it prompt you for any error code? If you cannot start the app, this may be the possible explanation for that:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA135564" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA135564</a>.
 BTW, do you still have an error with Nokia Suite in terms of accessing the map server?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Email app. The feature to access your emails using the Nokia Messaging app on the phone has been discontinued. However, you can still check your mails when you use your phone's browser and connect to the mail server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. For the certificates, did the software update fix it? Make sure that the date and time settings of the device is correctly configured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

            <p>the map application opens but the maps are not there just a white square.</p>
<p>The phone was updated but not the. Certificates, the time was correct when updated.</p>
<p>I also cannot connect to the server on Nokia suite.</p>

When you close an account the data is immediately purged.&nbsp;&nbsp; So even if you were able to get that email account back it would be empty.<br />

Are you looking for the data or the email address?<br />

<p><strong><span>I would like to copy a series of custom animations from one slide to the next. Is that possible?<br />
<br />
Specifically, I've got a graph that shrinks and moves to the upper left corner of the slide while a new graph appear in the lower 3/4 of the slide. I'd like to do this with several different slides as the graphs are a result of the same test with different
 datasets. Thus, the format is the same for each graph but because I am pasting a new graph onto the slide I have to apply the same actions over and over again to animate each new set of graphs.</span></strong></p>

<p>You don't mention the version you use (always a good idea)</p>
<p>Ther animation painter (only in 2010) will do this for you in previous versions there are third party addin (eg Animation carbon)</p>
<p>An alternative approach is copy the first animated graph, paste to other slides and alter the data.</p>

<p>DawnMB,</p>
<p>Copying animations is only possible in PPT 2010. Previous versions do not have this functionality. If you have PPT 2003 maybe you can copy the slide, leave the graph in place, edit it to replace with the new dataset.</p>

<h2>            how to save a video &#40;shared by bluetooth&#41; in nokia lumia 520</h2>
                    I am using &nbsp;Nokia Lumia 520(windows 8). I got a video which was shared by bluetooth from a friend's handset but i am not able to save or watch the video. there was a notification saying you need to install an app for this and when i tapped yes, it said
 there is no such app in windows store. I am not even able to see the location of that video in my phone. It is happening every time in case of videos shared by bluetooth. please help me if you know the procedure to save the video shared by bluetooth.

            <p>Hi Bilal Dalvi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have a question on how to see your movies downloaded from UC browser in the Music+Video folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to know if the movie file is compatible to the Windows Phone. <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/music/music-and-videos-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/music/music-and-videos-faq</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the video doesn't have DRM rights it won't play on the phone. There are also some type of files that won't show on your Windows Phone, like flv for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<p>bonjour,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>jai acheté un Lumia 800 White et j'ai eu une mauvaise surprise&nbsp; en constatant que la coque de protection de mon Lumia 800 était noire et non assortie à l'appareil.</p>
<p>Comment obtenir une coque blanche, soit par échange ou envoi d'une seconde coque?</p>
<p>merci par avance</p>

    <title>showing only certain characters from a field in access query - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            showing only certain characters from a field in access query</h2>
                    My field contains values like this:<br />
<br />
32000=7.94|<br />
39000=10.99|<br />
32000=5.95|<br />
<br />
The value between = and | is a price that I'm trying to see. If I use&nbsp; (Right([group_prices],6))<br />
<br />
Then my out put is like this. <br />
=7.94|<br />
10.99|<br />
=5.95|<br />
<br />
Ideally I would want to show only the digits between = and |<br />
<br />
The group number is always going to be 5 digits so if there was a way to strip 6 leading characters and then strip the last character that would be exactly what I need.<br />
<br />

            I lied... My field has 3 values, member group code, qty and price<br />
<br />
32000=12=7.94|<br />
39000=8=10.99|<br />
32000=48=5.95|<br />
<br />
Sorry, I wasn't copying and pasting from my table when I typed the answer so I was missing the qty<br />
<br />
So you're answer would have been perfect but unfortunately the qty variable throws a wrench in the problem because that can be 1 or 2 digits or even null.<br />

            <p>Try using the string parsing functions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mid([Group_Prices], InStrRev([Group_Prices], "=") + 1, InStrRev([Group_Prices], "|") - 1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>InStr finds a substring in a string; InStrRev does the same but starts at the end working back, rather than at the start. So this will find the LAST occurance of = in the field, and the last occurance of |, and return the characters in between.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have some real trouble if there are NULL values or ill-formatted ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a really good example of why fields should be "atomic"; in your final database you really should have three fields for these three values, and you should feel free to whack whoever put this together originally with a wet noodle!</p>

            The groups and qty are separated but the pricing is calculated via a different query where multiple product lists are joined together in a query we use to update our website.<br />
<br />
So I could eventually done this but I would have had to write write several more independent queries. This isn't the most elegant way maybe but it did save me time.<br />
<br />
I pasted that exactly but the pipe character is still at the end<br />

            The following function should do it for both quantity and price where both are present:<br />
<br />
Public Function GetListItems(strItemList As String, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strDelimiter As String, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intStart As Integer, _<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim intSubStart As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim intSubEnd As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim n As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strItemList = strItemList &amp; strDelimiter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intDelimLength = Len(strDelimiter)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intSubStart = 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' get start of substring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If intStart &gt; 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For n = 1 To intStart - 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intSubStart = InStr(intSubStart, strItemList, strDelimiter) + Len(strDelimiter)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If intSubStart &gt; Len(strItemList) Then Exit For<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next n<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intSubEnd = intSubStart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' get position immediately after end of substring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For n = 1 To intNumber<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If InStr(intSubEnd + 1, strItemList, strDelimiter) &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intSubEnd = InStr(intSubEnd + 1, strItemList, strDelimiter)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next n<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' return value is substring starting at intSubStart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' and of length intSubEnd - intSubStart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetListItems = Mid(strItemList, intSubStart, intSubEnd - intSubStart)<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
e.g. in the debug window:<br />
? GetListItems("32000=12=7.94|","=",2,1)<br />
12<br />
? GetListItems("32000=12=7.94|","=",3,1)<br />
7.94|<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about your Null quantities, though.&nbsp; If they are shown like this it will work for the price:<br />
? GetListItems("32000==7.94|","=",2,1)<br />
=7.94|<br />
but not for the quantity:<br />
? GetListItems("32000==7.94|","=",2,1)<br />
=7.94|<br />
<br />
If like this then not for either:<br />
? GetListItems("32000=7.94|","=",2,1)<br />
7.94|<br />
? GetListItems("32000=7.94|","=",3,1)<br />
<br />
If you only want the price then this should work, assuming no price greater than 99.99:<br />
? Replace(Left(Right("32000=12=7.94|",6),5),"=","")<br />
7.94<br />
? Replace(Left(Right("39000=8=10.99|",6),5),"=","")<br />
10.99<br />

i created a Macro on QlikView in order to export my dashboard to PowerPoinT charts.</p>

Everything worked with Office 2010. Once i updated to Office 2013 the macro stops on the highlighted commands with the error "OBJECT REQUIRED". If i comment it everything works (but i'm not able to position the images in the right way).</p>

</p><p>Lorenbo: &nbsp;try commenting out everything after Shapes.Paste then look at the presentation, select the pasted shape and try to ungroup it. &nbsp;If you can ungroup it, its' not an image, so .ScaleHeight etc won't work and will throw errors.</p>

<p>It seems that the John's solution is the only working one..</p>
<p>I don't understand why everything worked before migration from Office 2010 to Office 2013, but i hope that now i have solved the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone!!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>There's a bug in 2013 whereby in <strong>some instances</strong> pasting with code loses the reference to the pasted shape giving rise to the OBJECT REQUIRED error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pasted shape is always the top shape so </p>
<p><strong>Set oshp = ppslide.Shapes(ppslide.Shapes.Count)</strong></p>
<p>remakes the reference.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is being caused by a third-party program or a browser add-on. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There's a security program, Constant Guard, part of a security package provided by Comcast that
</p>
<p>causes a somewhat similar problem. Is Constant Guard installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Start Internet Explorer without add-ons from Start&gt; Programs&gt; Accessories&gt; System tools&gt; Internet Explorer (no add-ons)<br />
or</p>
<p>from Start&gt; Run (or Windows logo key + r) type in <em>iexplore.exe -extoff </em>
</p>
<p><em>(iexplore.exe&lt;space&gt;-extoff)</em> then hit Enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem goes away,&nbsp;an add-on is causing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine which add-on is causing the problem see:</p>

<strong>to</strong> <strong>stay</strong> <strong>logged</strong> <strong>into</strong>
<strong>the</strong> <strong>Insider</strong> <strong>Forum</strong>. It only works if used in Private Mode but this also logs out when the browser is closed. Firefox and Google Chrome do not have this issue. Feedback and Twitter messages were filed and sent

<p><strong>Bug/Issue:</strong> Edge's constant "hesitations"</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong> Especially when first starting up, but not just at that time, Edge can hesitate for up to a minute while loading a Web page. Sometimes, it doesn't come back at all and has to be restarted. This issue dates back to 17134. I've about
 had enough, I'm looking at new browsers.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac default browser issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got my default browser on my mac set as chrome. However when i click on certain links from an email received on outlook 2016 it will automatically open in Safari. Not for all links though, some still open in Chrome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked safari and chrome settings and they indicate chrome is set as my default browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to general settings the default browser dropdown just shows a checkbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on how to fix this? I'd like links to only open in Chrome.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Rajat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. Generally, if you want a browser as default web browser in Mac, please go to Apple menu and choose “System Preference”, then go to “General”, choose the Default web browser you want:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efc1bb90-25b5-44b2-b631-041094dcee75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efc1bb90-25b5-44b2-b631-041094dcee75" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook for Mac has no separate setting for default browser. And if you set up a default web browser in your Mac, all application in Mac will use this browser as default web browser. For further help, may I know other app (need open bowser for link) whether
 open safari? if yes, and if you have already set up chrome as default web browser from System preferences, and the application didn’t browser the link for using the default web browser, please contact the Apple support cause this is an Apple system setting
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

Microsoft will have to spend time on this. Does not seem like it is hardware problem. Windows 8.1 was working properly.</p>

<p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting thing posted in another thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Build numbers are almost identical for FAST and SKIPPY, the build strings differ considerably:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>FAST = 16251.0 (rs3_release)</span></p>
<p><span>SKIPPY = 16251.1000 (rs_prerelease)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>And a heads-up CK, my SP3 (i7) got to 75% in normal time, now at 93% a hour and 15 minutes after that..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to say, this was to be expected, but I had not expected it to be that much slower, again....</p>

<h2>            Delete on premise user, but keep O365 mailbox active</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p><br />
In the early days when i was working with dirsync i had found a way to delete the on premise user and keep the O365 mailbox active. We needed to run dirsync. Then the mailbox was getting deleted. Then we recovered it and run a full sync with dirsync and then
 the user mailbox was not getting deleted anymore.</p>
<p>Now we work with AAD sync and this tricks does not seem to work. Is their anyway that we can delete the on premise user, and keep the O365 user active? We would like to create shared mailboxes from the users so that we can archive their mail.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>You can delete the O365 user and recover it from the Recycle bin, this will provision it as disconnector and any subsequent dirsync changes should not affect it. As there is some risk involved, make sure to backup or put the mailbox on hold first, and under
 no circumstances remove the user from the Recycle bin - it will hard delete the mailbox as well.</p>
<p>A more safer, but slower approach is to disable dirsync, clear out the ImmutableID attribute of the O365 and make sure that no soft-match will happen once you turn Dirsync back on (i.e. that is make sure that the PrimarySMTPAddress and the WindowsEmailAddress
 of the on-prem object are different than the O365 one). Or if you prefer, just set up a random ImmutableId that will never match an on-prem object.</p>
<p>None of those methods are supported, so use at your own risk :)</p>

<p>Dear Vasil,</p>
<p>I do not completely understand what you mean. Do you mean i need to delete the user from Office365 first and then from AD? Because that is not possible with the sync in between.</p>
<p>I have already deleted the user in local AD and then sync. When i do this, the o365 user will delete as well. Then i recover the user, but Ad sync will delete it again.</p>
<p>But i think i already find out the answer. I understand that the full sync is needed to update all the correct information. So what i did:</p>
<p>- I deleted the local AD user</p>
<p>- I synced AD sync with Office365</p>
<p>- The user was deleted. I did an Full sync in AD sync (first full import, then full sync and then export)</p>
<p>- I recovered the user in O365</p>
<p>- I run the sync from the local AD again. Because of the full sync, it does not delete the user again, because it have updated all the information. I do see the +1 user at the O365 AD side, but it does not delete or create the user.
</p>
<p>I test this again with some more users to see if this works correctly. Thanks so far!</p>

<p>This worked! I have test it with 3 other accounts and it now keeps the recovered O365 users intact without deleting the users.</p>
