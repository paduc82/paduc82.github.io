<h2>            Can any one do a comparision between Excel 2010 &#38; Excel for Mac 2011 &#63;</h2>
                    I would like to&nbsp; find out what the difference may be between Excel 2010 &amp; Excel for Mac 2001 in terms of features &amp; functionality ?<br />
<br />
Are there many differences&nbsp; or are they the same ?<br />
<br />
Perhaps a table listing the features/functionality would be good<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

    <title>No Access in Office 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christihayden  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Access in Office 2013</h2>
                    <p>When my agency replaced my leased computer, they had Office 2013 pre-installed on it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they did not realize that I also use Access daily (I am the only one in our agency to use it).&nbsp; In order to still be able to use by database, I also installed
 Office 2010 on my new computer.&nbsp; I was hoping to be able to choose to only install Access 2010, however that was not the case.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now whenever I open a word or excel document, I am getting a message asking me to activate Office 2010.&nbsp; The problem is I love Word 2013 and Excel 2013 and prefer to use them in Office 2013.&nbsp; Is there anyway to get around this? &nbsp;i.e. somehow delete everything
 but Access from Office 2010 version?&nbsp; I’ve gone into Add/Remove programs but deleting individual applications does not seem to be possible.</p>

            Hi. I might have to go through the same exercise here shortly but are you saying when you ran the&nbsp;Office 2010 installation there was no option to install only certain applications? I seem to recall having that option before. Just curious...

            <p>While its possible to have multiple versions it is always best to install them in chronological order. So I would uninstall them. then install 2010 and then 2013.</p>
<p>

            I could try the uninstall/reinstall in chronological order to see if that helps. &nbsp;But just curious, what does "install 2010 in a VM" mean? &nbsp;Is that easier, than the whole unistall/reinstall method?

            <p>VM refers to Virtual Machine. Basically you can create a virtual PC on your own PC that is actually separate from the physical PC. I use VirtualBox a freebie from Oracle. But there are several ways to create VMs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use VMs to do a lot of beta testing and test apps under different OS configurations. Currently I have three Win 7 VMS with Office 2007, 2010 and 2013. And 2 Win 10 VMs with 2013 and 2016.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to be an issue with your service provider, I suggest you contact them and see if they made any changes to the network that could have caused this error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Answers</p>

            Hi Jon,
<div><br />
<div>Im beginning to think that this may not be a service provider-specific issue. I have been chatting to my ISP and tried three different accounts each on a different backbone, and each time the same problem occurs. The issue seems to be affecting most if
 not all ISPs in South Africa. Being in support myself, this is too much a coincidence...</div>
<div><br />

            Hi Jon&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I have spoken to Cell C my service provider and they state that they have not made any relevant changes to the network recently that could prevent me from downloading and the fact that I can get on to the net and download on the device using any other
 application but fail with marketplace it seems to be a Markerplace issue rather than my services provider.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I even spoke to Nokia who recommend that I get a reflash by sending my phone to a Nokia repair center.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The must be a better way of sorting this out than a reflash of the device</div>

<div>Please find a solution.</div>

            <p>Hi Sphiwe Mawhayi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a bit more research I have found this thread from last autumn and the issue does seem to be specific to South Africa and how ISPs connect to the marketplace.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp7-wpapps/marketplace-download-error-805a0193-over-wifi/31dd8c5b-3d83-4037-aeb9-1af03133073b?page=3">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp7-wpapps/marketplace-download-error-805a0193-over-wifi/31dd8c5b-3d83-4037-aeb9-1af03133073b?page=3</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people on the thread have found various work arounds and fixes to their issues.&nbsp; It might be worth reading these to see which one fits your particular situation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There does seem to be a common thread related to DNS settings on routers and which Cell Providers use which backbone for thier service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<div>An update from my side. It would seem that whatever the problem was, was fixed last night (24/08). I am able to download apps from the Marketplace on my data connection (Cell C, South Africa) and Wifi (Openweb, South Africa). Also, for the Wifi it is without
 having to using the Google DNS settings but local (default) ones.</div>

    <title>WP8 calendar improvements - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ps8310  say:</h3>
<h2>            WP8 calendar improvements</h2>
                    <p>I REALLY like WP8 on my Nokia Lumia 920, but the WP8 calendar is frustrating and sucks, to say the least!&nbsp; My corporate and private life is pretty much organized by my calendar and we use Exchange at the office, hence I got what I thought was a serious&nbsp;phone
 and mobile platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the WP8 calendar functionality and practicality is extremely disappointing and frustrating as it is SO far behind the desktop/Exchange version of Windows Outlook, and it is much worse than in previous WM versions (even the&nbsp;WM
 6 calendar was much better!).&nbsp; The further frustration is that none of the&nbsp;3rd party calendar apps&nbsp;can&nbsp;properly deal with creating certain appointments, reading appointments marked as private on Exchange, etc. and my opinion is that none of them have the great
 WM8 look and feel.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not the only one in the world needing a serious calendar to run and manage&nbsp;a serious career.&nbsp; Come on Microsoft, the WP8 calendar&nbsp;needs some urgent&nbsp;upgrade work, PLEASE!!!&nbsp; It should have the following amongst others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Week view (in which you can see all appointments for at least the normal working hours, also seeing working/non-working times, current date and time highlighted, different shading/colors for each different status (free/busy/etc.))</li><li>Month view that shows actual appointments, not just some graphic to show on what day a certain date is</li><li>Year view as an ability to get a quick overview of when certain dates are</li><li>Ability in an appointment to click on its location so you can go through to a mapping app to easily navigate to your meeting</li><li>A proper live tile that can be customized (e.g. number of appointments to show, show all-day events or not, etc.)</li><li>Ability to show more than one appointment on the lock screen (also add customization to choose number of events, show all-day events, etc.)</li></ul>
<p>Other great functionality would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to click on a Bluetooth or Wireless or Airplane Mode tile to switch the functionality on or off (without having to first go into a settings menu), and the live tile shows the status (active/not active)</li><li>An intelligent phone keypad to quickly find contacts (such as on Android)</li></ul>

<p>This question is answered many times a day here. Sometimes reading posts before creating another one will pay off. Here is the answer again: This is a problem with your Internet Settings. It is not an Outlook error. You need to reset your internet settings
 in&nbsp; Control panel, Internet options, Advanced tab.<br />

<h2>            Bring back the Online Only Option in One Drive</h2>
                    Please bring back the option to right click a file and make it available online only or offline. The option of syncing certain folders is very limiting and if you decide to sync all folders it will impact massively the amount of storage available on devices
 with limited storage, like the Microsoft Surface Pro/Pro 2/Pro 3.

            <p>See the long discussion of this by Paul Thurrott on his winsupersite dot com site. Basically the "placeholder" functionality in Win 8.1 was too confusing to tech-naïve customers. They thought they had all their files, got on a plane, took off and settled
 down to working on that company report only to find -- horror of horrors -- that the file wasn't actually on the computer, it was inaccessible in the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of that, it seems the functionality was causing major sync conflicts that didn't have an easy technical solution. Bottom line is that for now the placeholders are deprecated. They've said they might be able to put back something a bit like it at a
 future point, but it will be something more like a greyed-out filename rather than the placeholder with thumbnails that we have in Win 8.</p>

<p>

            Yeah, I know, it's inconvenient. Note that you don't have to "share" a folder in order to download its contents onto your local machine, you just have to go into the OneDrive settings (right-click tray icon) and choose the folder(s) you want to download.
 One solution would be to split the OneDrive filespace into two top-level folders, say, Online and Offline. Under Offline, place all the folders and files you want to download to your local machine(s)/devices, and in Online, place all the folders and (presumably
 large) files you don't want to download and want to keep in the cloud only. Then simply select the Offline folder for synchronization. Alternatives to Online and Offline might be Nosync and Sync.

            <p>That wouldn't work well with me as I have a lot of devices and on each I sync different files, some cross all device and others cross only some of the devices. Makes for a lot of useless moving and arranging my files. If I could cherry pick the files I wanted
 to Sync in a folder that would be much better. Or maybe the Store style app to be able to pick those files would put a bit of separation into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other issue is that not many people in Australia have unlimited downloads and so if someone gets a new device, syncs all files without understanding but has a lot of files on their 1TB of OneDrive space and it all comes crashing down at once, those people
 could deplete their internet usage without understanding it!</p>

            This was such a great feature. Perhaps a little consumer education or color the file name "<strong>RED</strong>" would be beneficial. It seems to me that is a very WEAK argument for removing one of the better features of onedrive. I have to believe there
 is more to it, like it was using MUCH MORE space than Microsoft anticipated.<br />

            Maybe also something to do with the overhead on the servers&nbsp;of&nbsp;sending thousands of millions of little bits of metadata out to client software&nbsp;and doing the calculations to keep files in sync? Whatever, MS did say that the were synchronization conflicts
 as well as confusion for users. I do miss this feature too, but I would be happy with a simple placeholder along the lines of the old offline files for network shares.

Yes it is provided by Microsoft but the same principle applies, both the worksheets and the code&nbsp;are protected because whoever at Microsoft wrote it doesn't want you to have access to the code.</p>
<p>You will get all the help you need here but i doubt anyone will tell you how to remove this password</p>

<p>I would hope no one will explain how to hack this.&nbsp; It is password protected for the reason everyone does this, to try and block people from seeing it.</p>
<p>If you ask how to clear controls on a userform, this is a basic task, and as Mike mentions you can get help with this.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>Sub ClearEmOutDano_Click()</p>
<p>Dim ctl As Control<br />
For Each ctl In Me.Controls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If TypeOf ctl Is MSForms.TextBox Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Controls(ctl.Name).Text = ""<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If TypeOf ctl Is MSForms.CheckBox Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Controls(ctl.Name).Value = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
Next<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Tests each control, and if it is a TextBox, "clears" it - makes it ""; and if it is a CheckBox it sets its Value to be False (unchecked).&nbsp; There are other ways to go about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask.</p>

<p>Thanks Gerry.&nbsp; So, I tried the code and it isn't working but I think the problem is that when I say I am creating a "form", it's not a Form Control, it's just an excel spreadsheet that has merged cells for people to fill in information and some checkboxes.&nbsp;
 I'm assuming your code is for information that is in a Form Control?</p>

<p>The "form" I HAVE CREATED, is just a bunch of merged cells for people to input information like the date, their name, what tests they want done, etc.&nbsp; And, it has some check boxes.&nbsp; I refer to the DHL EMail Ship form because it is similar in that we want
 to have people enter specific data and click certain check boxes and then I want the form to be sent via e-mail.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is&nbsp;not anything fancy, just a spreadsheet that one of my co-workers created - we are NOT programmers (we work in the FOOD business).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ummm, yes.&nbsp; The code was for a userform.&nbsp; This is the unfortunate result of the vague and fuzzy word "form".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Doug mentions, you will have to describe in detail what you actually have on the spreadsheet itself.&nbsp; For all we know there are NO controls whatsoever, and the CLEAR FORM button simply puts nil values into specific cells.&nbsp; Who knows?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But going back to the template you downloaded, what does the CLEAR FORM do?&nbsp; Never mind the code behind it.&nbsp; What does it do?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Hi, I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Run a full scan with the most powerful on-demand free scanner Malwarebytes: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean.
<br />
<br />Then check for damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />If it cannot repair them see Step 10 here to continue:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you want to keep Malwarebytes as an on-demand scanner then you can disable its Real Time trial version in it's Settings &gt; Accounts tab.  
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />Leave that window open to monitor your system

<p>I have Kaspersky Total Security active and it says its clean. I've disabled all startup apps(except Kaspersky ofc). After recording my laptop's performance and when it overheats I don't think has any miners. But I really want to know why sometimes I see
 task manager opens when Windows starts.</p>

    <title>Is it possible to set company wide Skype For Business options settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> berneyvillers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to set company wide Skype For Business options settings that cannot be overridden by users&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We have some users that render the Skype for Business status information useless. The manipulate it by settings themselves away all the time or denying the rest of the organization access to their availability or by appearing available almost all the time
 even when they aren't by setting an extremely high value for the 'Show me as inactive when the computer has been idle for x minutes' option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, knowledge of peer availability is an extremely valuable feature that improves organizational efficiency. We use it to facilitate customer support rep conversations with product engineering staff, etc.. If the customer support rep is duped
 into wasting time on 3 engineers that fake their availability, the customer suffers longer time to the support case resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use Office 365. I see very few company wide options in the Admin center for Skype Biz. How can I enforce such a policy and regain the value of availability info?</p>

            <p>Hi Berney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my experience, we can usually set up a client policy to disable specific Skype for Business client options for all users inside an Office 365 organization by running the
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg425949.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
New-CsClientPolicy</a> or <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg398300.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set-CsClientPolicy</a> command in the Skype for Business PowerShell. However, it seems that there is no such a parameter to disable the "Status" option in the Skype for Business clients of all users inside an Office 365 organization. Which means it's not feasible
 to set such as policy and regain the value of availability info. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have such kind of requirements, I suggest you submit feedback via the following link:</p>

                    <p>This question <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-oaddacc/how-to-disconnect-my-hotmail-from-my-skype/25aa1a1b-63f8-4f95-b9b3-4af4b48f0a44">
was asked back in 2016</a> and the solution worked back then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I am facing is that I accidentally linked my (very old and only) Skype account to a temporary outlook email address (meant for students) in stead of my personal Outlook account. I am now trying to reconnect the Skype account to my personal Outlook
 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, however, the solution is not valid for me, as the "Unlink" button is not showing.</p>
<p>I saw in the linked question's thread that there were "<span>ongoing changes" in late 2016, but what is the status quo?</span></p>
<p><span>Can I still save my Skype account?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please aid me in this dire situation,</span></p>

<p>I had seen the page you linked but wasn't 100% convinced by it. The fact is, my Skype account was not a Microsoft account when I did the connection (in the sense that it did not have an email address etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal Microsoft account does not have a linked Skype account and still has a default Skype account, so similarly, my school account should be able to exist without my old, linked Skype account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Skype account is listed as an independent,&nbsp;<strong>linked</strong> entity in the Accounts page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Skype account really is in fact a true Microsoft account, then it should be able to exist independently. I doubt that is true, so my presumption is that the Skype account is just irrevocably linked to and part of the Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering my situation, that I have my (only used) Skype account connected to a temporary school Microsoft account and a personal Microsoft account, how would you advise me to resolve this problem?</p>
<p>Please also provide me more (even technical) insight into this if you're able to.</p>

<p>Take note that once an old Skype account is merged to a Microsoft account, there's no more option to unmerge them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, take note that we no longer support merging an old Skype account to an existing Microsoft account. You can only merge an old Skype account to a newly created Microsoft account. The new Microsoft account must be created in the process of merging the
 old Skype to Microsoft. To do this you have to log in to this link: <a href="https://login.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://login.live.com</a> using your old Skype account credentials. You will be asked to add a phone number or email address, instead of adding any of those, select<strong> Create a new email address

 when I first installed MSE and if MSE is always on and therefore checking any new downloads coming on to my PC, how would there be anything on my PC that was not already scanned?&nbsp; The only thing I can think of is that a) there might be a way for a file to
 get onto my PC without MSE being aware or b) a Full Scan allows older files that were already scanned when originally downloaded to be scanned again with a more recent definitions version.&nbsp; Just trying to get an idea of how important it is for me to be running
 full scans.</strong> <br />

<p>The reason for Quick scan is in order to be more assure. For example someone might turn off MSE or you are on travel and you haven't done update and new virus is come into your PC while you don't get update. Normaly user won't get anything during quick scan
 if they make sure MSE is on all the time but if it get something you should think what was wrong.</p>
<p>Doing quick scan is not harm and it give you assurance and recheck that everything is fine. MSE will check every corner when something come into PC.</p>
<p>The reason that we recommend full scan for first time is that we want to make sure PC is clean in first installation . In some case PC already infected and infection keep coming and full scan could reveal the root of infection.</p>
<p>Full scan is also double check that PC is safe , if it show clean you will say oh this good I am safe , normaly user would say this but if something went wrong full scan would detect something and you would said OH and then you should figure up why Malware
 get into PC?</p>
<p>In most case user turn off the MSE or MSE was NOT update that PC get infected while with PC real time protection always on and update running PC is mostly clean without any infection in full scan or quick scan.</p>

<p>A full scan is recommended when first installing MSE or when there has been a malware detection. A quick scan will scan only&nbsp;the files and folders on a computer where malware is most likely to reside. A quick scan is sufficient in most circumstances. Any
 files not scanned in a quick scan or a full scan will be scanned on access ( real time protection ).</p>

            <p><span>Hi Dhiraj,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is not feasible to share a list using an anonymous guest link. For sharing with authenticated external users, you may first share a file, folder, or site to an external user and let them
 login to your SharePoint site, this should make them an authenticated external user. Afterwards, you can invite the external user to access your custom list.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, given the situation, we suggest you submit your idea via
<a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration/suggestions/17468926-allow-sharing-only-by-anonymous-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Can you share a OneNote Notebook in more than one SharePoint location&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to share my notebook on two different SharePoints sites. When I make change/add to the notebook, I want it to sync in both places. Is this possible? The reason I want to do this is because two different teams need access to the information. However,
 the two teams do not have access to a common SharePoint site; they both have their own internal SharePoint sites.</p>

            To help with that scenario, you can create a third sharpoint site that both teams have access to. Or somehow give access to the other team in part of one of the sites.

    <title>Difficulty with viewing calendars with multiple email accounts in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> texas bobd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Difficulty with viewing calendars with multiple email accounts in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Outlook for years and never have had a problem showing multiple calendars from multiple email addresses in the same view with overlapping calendars.&nbsp; However, just got a new computer with Windows 10 and installed Outlook 2016 from my Microsoft
 365 subscription and can't get this to work anymore.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have two IMAP email accounts and one Outlook.com Exchange account.&nbsp; The only&nbsp;information that I can show when I click on the Calendar button in Outlook is my Outlook.com calendars (calendar, holidays and birthday).&nbsp; I want to be able to add in the calendars
 associated with the other email addresses here but those only show in the mail list for those individual email accounts.</p>
<p>As most of my appointments are from one of these IMAP accounts, I need to find a way to see all of my appointments in one view.&nbsp; I hope that this is clear and someone can help.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your very prompt reply, but unfortunately, neither of these solves the problem and it appears that the second link is not for Outlook 2016.&nbsp; But, in reviewing the first link, I think the problem that I am having might be stated a bit simpler.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the calendar icon, I only see under My Calendars, the option for Calendar, US Holidays, and Birthdays.&nbsp; The Calendar here is the one in my Outlook.com Exchange Account.&nbsp; While "Other Calendars" is an option, I have not found any way to display
 the calendar from the IMAP email account in that view.&nbsp; The only way that I have found to see that specific calendar is to open the calendar folder under that email inbox (I actually copied this to my&nbsp;favorites to find it a bit easier) but this doesn't allow&nbsp;me
 to look at all of my calendars side by side which is what that&nbsp;first article is all about.&nbsp; Again, have done&nbsp;this in previous versions of Outlook using&nbsp;Windows 8 and earlier.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note - the specific IMAP account is my default email account and when I hover over the calendar icon on the bottom of outlook,&nbsp;it does show&nbsp;any calendar entries for that IMAP account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is a simpler explanation but maybe not.&nbsp; </p>

 clue how this got resolved but hopefully it will stay that way.

            Hi AJ.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we do solve problems by having them uninstalled.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.

<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Ajdpony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Norton and Windows Defender will work side by side, if you set the Periodic</p>
<p>Scanning button to "ON". This causes Windows Defender to become <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
passive</span>.</p>
<p>Meaning it can be used for "scans" only. Norton will supply the Real-Time</p>
<p>protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Periodic Scanning button can be found at the bottom of the "Virus &amp; Threat</p>
<p>Protection" screen, in Windows Defender. It is only present when WD senses a </p>
<p>third party security program, and automatically deactivates itself. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Offline</span> can be used to&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">supplement</span> your Norton program.</p>
<p>WDO has the added advantage of running while the Operating System is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span></p>

<p>Hello Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're Outlook live tile isn't updating. Let's try to address this. We'd like to know what's the current OS build installed on your phone. To check this information, go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> &gt; <strong>
More</strong> <strong>info</strong>. When did you start to experience this? Have you tried checking for any pending software or app updates? Is the Mail app allowed to run in the background by going to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Privacy</strong> &gt; <strong>Background</strong>
<strong>Apps</strong>? Does re-pinning the Outlook tile make a difference? <br />
<br />
For now, you can do a soft reset on your device to refresh it and check if the issue persist. Also, make sure that the date and time is set correctly according to your region. To do this, press and hold
<strong>Volume</strong> <strong>Down+Power</strong> button until it vibrates and restarts.</p>

<h2>            Nokia N8-00 processor</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I have read on the internet that our beloved Nokia N8 has 772 Mhz processor (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Wikipedia - Nokia N8</a>). Is this real? With the upgrade to Symbian Belle suppose that the current speed of 680 MHz
 is very little.<br />
<br />
Other less advanced equipment such as the Nokia 500 are 1 GHz processor, so it's really stupid to think that the Nokia N8 brings only 680 MHz speed. : /<br />
<br />
Nokia have something is hidden under the frame of the N8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don't believe everything you read on wikipedia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, Nokia's design might very well use a lower clockspeed than what the processor architecture allows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't necessarily mean that it is "downclocked", or that the hardware allows it to be "overclocked" (Nokia's chips aren't always - or they rarely are, or have been - off-the-shelf chips or chipsets, but usually custom components made to their specifications).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, with phone design, the hardware selection and tuning it is always a compromise between battery consumption and speed. Running a device at a higher clock speed than required means that you could be wasting battery power, thus reducing talk time/standby
 time, too.</p>

            Don't go by processing speed of N8....symbian^3 is pretty much resource friendly OS and 680MHz is fast enough to run current Anna os and of course up coming Belle os smoothly

            Chances are most likely zero as there is no proof that the N8's processor is under clocked.<br />
