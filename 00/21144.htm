<h2>            OUTLOOK 2016 JUNK MAIL</h2>
                    <p>I am using outlook 2016 on windows 10 and the junk mail filter is no longer doing anything.</p>
<p>It was previously working and now does not stop anything even when the address has been added to the junk mail list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>all of the windows updates are installed, outlook updates are installed, the junk mail filter options are set to high.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get junk mail from all sorts of places, from how to grow 3" taller in a week, to woodworking projects and shopping lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help solve this</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Dean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it may appear that the junk email filter in Outlook is not working because the sender of these emails uses a new email address which is slightly different to the one added to your blocked senders list. For example, the email you blocked is
<strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong>, then the sender of the email uses <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</strong>(where the <strong>L</strong> in <strong>example </strong>is actually a capital
<strong>i</strong>). The system won't recognize it as a spam and this email will directly go to your Inbox. If this is not your case, let us isolate the issue more so we can provide the most effective troubleshooting steps. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any changes made on your computer settings prior to this issue?</li><li>What is your email protocol?<br />
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>What is your email domain?</li><li>Is the issue present on your email domain online (via browser)?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hello Angela,</p>
<p>thank you for your reply, the blocked email address are the same however i have tested this also by blocking an alternative email address of mine and then sending to myself from another computer. &nbsp;It did not block it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been no changes to my computer settings that i know of</p>
<p>my email is POP3 account</p>
<p>domain is australianshaftdrilling.com</p>
<p>I don use browser emails</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are lots of emails coming through which are obviously scam emails, &nbsp;lots of 'woodworking plans' for instance which are from different email address all of the time. I have blocked these also but i would expect outlook to block these as obvious scams
 which is does not. &nbsp;this is only one example and there are lots of examples. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The junk email box does not have anything in it at all now unless i direct an email to it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dean</p>

<p>So I took my computer to a local fellow and explained the problem to him,&nbsp; he was baffled and did lots of tests, updated windows, office until there were not more updates.&nbsp; Then sent mail to me from his computer, and added his email address as a blocked.&nbsp;
 This did not work and subsequent emails from him did not go into the junk mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He then ran scans on my computer to see if it had any virus or Trojans which proved negative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally after 2 hours of mucking around he thought he would try and change the junk mail settings from "High" to "No automatic filtering".&nbsp; For some reason this fixed the problem,&nbsp; now all blocked senders go to junk mail and all obvious junk mail goes to
 junk mail.&nbsp; I don't know what the logical explanation is but I am just glad it works.</p>

            <p>Others can't be deleted, there are 3 areas which a user can remove temporary files,
<p>
</p><p>Here is an earlier <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdw10phone/low-storage-while-updating-win-10/a386e306-3dde-4479-8f43-b1a22090696c">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Additionally Others on a SD card could contain <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>Music, Photo &nbsp;&amp; Video</strong></span> if the SD card were from another device.</p>
<p>Storage Sense was not the "gatekeeper" at the time it allocates everything to Other so Music, Photo &nbsp;&amp; Video show NIL</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW Android has a File Manager, so <em>Others </em>on an Android phone these would be ITEMISED by the Apps and App data per app, however on Windows these collectively measured as one item "Others", so files with strange extension are found here</p>
<p>"<strong>Other. Files that don't fall under another category and file types your phone doesn't recognize</strong>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you could clear it or having said that on Android phone did clear these files you would certainly break something.</p>
<p>Apps could be deleted and reinstalled but you may lose the Apps HISTORY do that</p>

    <title>Linked Tables &#38; Real Time Updates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Linked Tables &#38; Real Time Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi There</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a simple question I hope. IF I have a Linked Table opened (or a form with the recordset based on that table) in a Front-End database, it will not reflect/show newly added records in that table while I'm viewing it, unless/until I refresh the screen.
 Is there a way to have a table or a form based on a table, get refreshed automatically? I always thought Access worked in a Real Time environment but if an opened linked table will not show/display record changes (add/Edit/deletes) then I really never see
 accurate up-to-the-second information. How can I solve this. I need either a form based on a table or the table itself to show record changes instantly while its is opened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            An Access form does not refresh on its own. You could use the Timer event to refresh.
<div><br />
<div>Set the Timer Interval to whatever you want, but don't make it refresh too often or it will drive your users crazy. I'd go with something like 5000 milliseconds.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Put this in the Timer event:</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>Private Sub Form_Timer()</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Me.Refresh</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>Keep in mind this might mess with data entry or edit. You might want to use this method only if the form is read-only.</div>

    <title>Nokia C6-00 Unlock code after hard reset - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia C6-00 Unlock code after hard reset</h2>
                    <p>After hard resetting (resetting it to factory settings) my old Nokia C6-00 it is asking for a lock pin, I have tried the one that should be default, code wrong, I have tried 1234, didn't accept it, I have even tried 1111 and 0000 and nothing. I have even
 tried 11111 and 00000 and it still didn't work. Is there a way to bypass this and set it up or did I just brick the phone by doing the hard reset? Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS:</p>
<p>The hard reset method I used was to leave the battery out for a minute and it is still asking for the pin code. The one that I setup on it isn't working, not are the proper default ones. Is it possible that it is asking for a PUK code instead of the pin
 code? If so, I may have to call bell for that PUK code, but I doubt that is the case because the default code to enter after a hard reset is 12345... But it must have been asking for a PUK code as after taking the sim card out, it worked... No longer need
 help.</p>

                    I have win. 10 and Exp. 11.&nbsp; Most Favorites work normally but some sites I looked up on Bing and saved to the Fav. Bar cannot be deleted.&nbsp; I delete several ways and they go away but pop right back up.&nbsp; They are like the 'Sites That Wouldn't Die'.&nbsp; Ideas?&nbsp;

            <p>I explored your ideas.&nbsp; I would very much want to delete individual items from the Favorites Bar rather then all the favorites including those&nbsp;I want to keep (sort of throwing the baby out with the bath water).&nbsp; I really would like to avoid having to rebuild
 saved passwords and all that with a complete delete of browsing history.&nbsp; I've gone at this three or four different ways and am always able to get the items deleted from the bar but in every case they pop right back up.&nbsp; This is within the last ten days or
 so.&nbsp; Problem with an update?&nbsp; Also, again, the three sites on my Favorites Bar I cannot get rid of were all found by my default search, Bing.&nbsp; I am totally in the MS loop (outlook.com, one drive, even windows phone).&nbsp; Is a glitch in that system causing the
 constant return of these saved (as favorites)&nbsp;search results?&nbsp; Does it tell us anything if I go off line and try again?&nbsp; What if that works until I go on line again?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your help is a blessing!&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Karma for all.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>The reason why this isn't working is because you are not committing the record immediately after generating the number. Until you commit the record, the table hasn't been updated so the DMax can pull the same number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can shorten your code to the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If IsNull(Me.counter) Then</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp; Me.Counter = Nz(DMax("[Counter]", "file_details", "GRP='" &amp; [Forms]![umara]![GRP] &amp; "'"),0) + 1</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp; Me.Dirty = False</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">End If</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You don't need the requery or the GoTo Last.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The Nz function returns a 0 if there are no matching records, The Me.Dirty = False commits the record.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Ken's demo, has additional code that further helps ensure that the counter isn't duplicated. If you have an active database where records are&nbsp;being&nbsp;created constantly, that may be more appropriate.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">One last point. Autonumber is a specific datatype in Access which generates a unique ID. What you are doing is sequential numbering not a custom autonumber.</span></span></p>

Doing so gives such participants access to an early preview of a product still in development and the possibility to help shape its release with early feedback. Over the years, the methodologies available to do pre-release testing of Microsoft code has opened the door to a new set of early adopters who are more willing to take such products for a early spin without hesitation. Microsoft has responded to the rapid changes since the early days of Windows 95 and in more recent times Windows XP which were only available to a select technical group of private testers.

</p><p>Ok I found a work around, and here is what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a dual boot with Windows 7 and Windows 10. Booted into Windows 7 and did a search for e1i63x64.sys and did not find it. So I downloaded the driver from intel and installed it into windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver was similar in name but the numbers were different. e1q62x64.sys to be exact. I simply renamed it to e1i63x64.sys and installed it in all three places where windows 10&nbsp;put it. I had to take ownership of the&nbsp;3 directories to be able to modify the
 files. system32/drivers and system32/Driver Store and last but not least Windows/WinSxS/ once I replaced the renamed file into those three directories and rebooted here I am on windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have posted a complete work around for this issue on another thread. Click <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-hardware/windows-10-build-9926-after-installation-driver/c8346675-13a8-4c7e-b2fe-bd71a516b48e">

            <p>That's all fine and all but if you keep crashing on the verification screen (logging into your account) it's not that ok, which was frankly happening to me. I threw the W10TP of my drive since after trying to do it for like 10-15 times I just got fed up
 with it =/</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know when this issue occurs is that Microsoft is still using an old version on the Intel driver.</p>
<p>As I do not know which one they use in their setup it still doesn't change the fact that they won't use a stable version for the latter of testing a TP. I know that a quite a few version of the Intel Lan drivers where crashing PC's late (v18's to early v19's
 if memory serves) since I had these crashes on W7 too.</p>
<p>All I can hope for is that they will implement stable drivers at the install package in the near future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I have to credit Microsoft to finally to include more of these important drivers into their install package unlike my W7 installation DVD (have to use either MB disk or my Storage HDD with latest drivers).</p>

                    Just added McAfee to a PC that had been running without virus protection. &nbsp;Problem is all the junk that got on before the wall and scanning went up. &nbsp;The computer is really slow and bogged down with pop-ups. &nbsp;I am hesitant to load any third party software
 to clean it up, when it was probably third party software that caused the problem in the first place. &nbsp;This is not my computer. &nbsp;I am trying to help a computer-hesitant friend (hence the virus protection gap). &nbsp;Any suggestions?

    <title>Is it possible to get a shared calendar from Outlook to sync with the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tjderitis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to get a shared calendar from Outlook to sync with the calendar on my Windows HTC One&#63;</h2>
                    I have two calendars in Outlook. My original "My Calendar" and with it I have a communal "Truck Schedule" calendar that everybody in the office uses, synced with it. So when I view my personal calendar all truck schedule appointments are viewed on the
 same calendar with it. I just have them separated by color but again, they all appear on the same calendar. When I linked my Outlook email to my Windows HTC One the only calendar I'm able to view is my personal calendar. The truck schedule is nowhere to be
 found and I'm given no option to import it. Seems like it should be a very simple option to complete but I'm having trouble figuring it out. So basically, how do I view shared calendars from my Outlook email on my HTC One?

            <p>T. J., were you able to solve your issue? If I understand you correctly, you are not about Google Android but Windows Phone 8.1. Correct? Or did you install ‘Windows 10 Mobile’ already via the app&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=ed2b1421-6414-4544-bd8d-06d58ee402a5">Windows

In that case, that shared calendar must be added to the webpage&nbsp;<a href="http://people.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">People</a>&nbsp;first.

    <title>e72 message centre problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> astrosnaps  say:</h3>
<h2>            e72 message centre problem</h2>
                    
<div>I have just upgraded my phone to a Nokia E72. I am loving this phone but unfortunately due to my ignorance am unable to send text messages. The rest of the phone works fine, calls, emails and receiving text messages.<br />
<br />
The chief reason I am unable to send text messages is that I somehow have changed the message centre name and number to that of one of my contacts and the phone will not allow me to change it back. I think this happened because I tried to send a text message
 before saving the configeration emails. When asked the name and number of the message centre, I entered the name and number of the contact I wished to send a text to.<br />
<br />
When I now check the message centre number and attempt to change it, I get a message "Unable to change setting. Value read from SIM card." However, when I put the SIM card in my old phone the message centre details are correct??</div>
<div>I am being sent a new SIM card but strongly suspect this will not work.<br />
<br />
Is there any way of resetting the phone to it's original settings? I have done the factory reset option but that didn't change the Message Centre number.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway of doing a hard reset?<br />
<br />
Many thanks for any help.</div>

<p>You can attempt to block the use of your phone by reporting it stole to the police and the network. It is up to your network what they do with that information. At most, they will be able to block it on their own network and a few supporting networks. No
 option to erase it at this stage. If you registered for Find my phone, you could try using that to locate your phone but I wouldn't get my hopes up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The options given above will only work ik you had your phone protected with a security code to unlock preventing anyone to reset the phone. If it was reset and registered with another Microsoft account the FInd My Phone service will no longer work for you.</p>

            If you still have the box it came in give the IMEI number to your network provider and they should be able to block the IMEI so that it cannot be used with another SIM card.<br />
<br />
Change the password of your Windows Live account all e-mail accounts and social networking accounts which you used on the phone and every password protected website which you accessed on the phone.

    <title>Publishing public folder calendar from Outlook 2013 fails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenlongwi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publishing public folder calendar from Outlook 2013 fails</h2>
                    <p>Hello... We have a calendar in a public folder that we publish to a WebDAV server and this was working well until we upgraded to Outlook 2013.&nbsp; (Outlook 2013 (32 bit) on Windows 7, Exchange 2010 - hosted.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Outlook 2013, the initial publishing process works fine - the .ics file is created, the calendar is accessible from the WebDAV folder, the calendar is listed as a Published Calendar under Account Settings, I am able to right-click on the public folder
 and the "Remove from Server" option is a choice.&nbsp; All is well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting Outlook&nbsp;the published calendar cannot be updated.&nbsp; It is still listed as a Published Calendar under Account Settings, but its Size is &lt;unknown&gt; and its Last Updated On is &lt;pending&gt;.&nbsp; If I right-click on the public folder the "Remove from
 Server" option is no longer a choice under Share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I publish my primary calendar from my Exchange account to the same WebDAV folder it publishes and updates successfully.&nbsp; This problem is affecting the public folder calendar publishing only.</p>

            <p>Hello Mohan, thanks for the advice, but I disagree. Publishing a calendar to a WebDAV server is a function of the Outlook client, not the Exchange server. &nbsp;And in this case the problem occurred because of a change to the Outlook client, upgrading to Outlook
 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked reliably in Outlook 2010, but fails with Outlook 2013.</p>

<h3> nicholasericson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word won&#39;t print from rear tray for some documents</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a weird issue with Word 2007. &nbsp;I have some templates prepared for various things I print occasionally at the office, but I'm getting a weird issue where Word will not print -one- of them from the rear tray.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a <del>letter </del>envelope template saved for a company we send mail to periodically and it will print from the rear tray with no fuss, at all. &nbsp;I have it set to automati<span>cally decide which tray to use and it just works. &nbsp;My printer (a Canon
 MX882) automatically knows to use the rear tray for this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, when I try to print mailing labels from the rear tray, it does not automatically print from there and, even when I manually tell it to print from the rear tray in the Print Properties menu, it refuses to print from the rear tray. &nbsp;I have tried
 printing directly, I've tried going through the "Envelopes and Labels" menu, and I've even tried creating a new file (in case the old one was corrupted or something) and it doesn't work at all.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Just to see if it would work, I printed a regular letter and told it to print from the rear tray and it worked beautifully. &nbsp;I don't know what is going on that Word won't print labels from &nbsp;the rear tray, but I'm about at my wit's end.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any help I can get is appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks in advance!</span></p>

 lists and click OK. Save the document. Now try printing the labels.</p>

</p><p>Unlike the settings in the Print Properties dialog, these are saved in the document file, so they shouldn't need to be reselected for each print run.</p>

<h2>            Unable to sign in to ovi store and download apps</h2>
                    
<p>I received two download links from the Nokia website upon request.&nbsp; Clicking on the link gets me to the download site and it asks&nbsp;me to sign in or register if&nbsp;I don't have a Nokia account.&nbsp; Whoever designed this was either on drugs or intoxicated, because
 without a nokia account they don't send you a download link in the first place.&nbsp; Since I do post this message here, I obviously did register and have an account.&nbsp; The problem is, my username and Password is not being recognized and it sends me into a never
 ending loop, with other words I am unable to sign in and download the application.</p>
<p>i am at my wits ends and I am fuming at Nokia for giving me such a hard time to download a simple mobile app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My phone model is the E71x and both apps I received the link for are supposed to be compatible with this model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anybody ever had a similar problem? &nbsp; Please enlighten me if you know the solution.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I think I got the solution!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I was so fed up with it, spending from 09:00 till 22:00 trying to fix this, but finally it works on my Nokia E72.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed that every time I filled in my username, it first showed me alternative names and texts. When I chose the right one, it put an extra space behind it. Then I found that this auto tekst thing was messing **bleep** up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open a new text message ( SMS ), fill in a receiver, and subject and then go to the message text field. Than hit the 'options' button.&nbsp; Scroll down, until you find an option like text options. ( I have a Dutch version here ). Because I hate my computer/phone
 to interfere with thing I type I de-selected all options and voila.... it works.</p>

    <title>Lumia 1020 keeps powering off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dinah_b---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 1020 keeps powering off</h2>
                    
<p>I've about had it with my Lumia 1020, which keeps randomly turning off. I have to do a soft reset to get it to turn back on, every single time.&nbsp; The battery level is not the culprit, sometimes it turns off even right after it's finished charging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought the phone in April, it worked fine for the first few weeks, but in early May began shutting down.&nbsp; That was on WP 8.0 / Lumia Black.&nbsp; I'd tried a factory reset, the phone was okay for a few days, but then started turning off again. I tried disabling
 background tasks, still no luck.&nbsp; My phone updated to 8.1 / Cyan a couple of weeks ago, and the problem still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I've tried blocking apps from using background tasks, even put the phone into battery saver mode always, but no luck.&nbsp; It turns off whether it's connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data, whether the battery is charged or not.&nbsp; I always back out of apps,
 so nothing is left running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other options available? This is really frustrating, especially when I'm missing calls and messages because I haven't realized the phone has shut down.</p>

<p>The last DIY solution you can try is a complete firmware reinstall using the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Software Recovery Tool</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, you should submit the handset to Nokia Care for check/repair.</p>

<p>Did you try without the SIM or with another SIM ( from a friend or relative)? A worn out / badly cut SIM may create such problem. If the problem gets resolved with this, get your SIM replaced with a ready Micro SIM and not with one cut from a mini SIM.</p>

<p>Yes, as points out, there isn't much more to do apart from letting Nokia handle it. In some very few cases a faulty sim card can cause weird behavior such as turning the device off, but as you have to reset it to boot after a sudde shut down, thats likely
 not cause. Probably a hardware failure with the device it self.<br />

<p>Let Nokia care handle it.</p>

<p>Do you mean that it is a modified or a cut SIM when you say "not a Micro SIM"? Have you tried the troubleshooting steps provided by the other users in this thread? Looking forward to your reply. BTW, welcome to the Microsoft Mobile Community!</p>

</p><p>I see that you're having problems deleting a folder. We'll help you on this.</p>

</p><p>You've mentioned that these folders comes from IMAP server. If you're using IMAP settings, this means you are possibly using a mail client or have added your account to another one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you to provide the correct resolution, could you please further clarify how to do you access your account? Are you using a mail client like MS Office Outlook or Windows Live Mail?</p>

<p>Sorry, my joke died. Porta-loos are portable toilets. Yes Star Trek was shown here from 1 year after its start in the US. All of the series right up to and including the Star Trek Discovery on Netflix. Quatloos were on Triskelion. But if you search for them
 you get some strange results.</p>

<h2>            How can I select multiple images &#40;in order to group them into one&#41; in Word for Mac &#40;v. 15&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have inserted two images in a word document, which I'd like to merge into one, so as to add only one caption. &nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I multiple select them (in order to select the group menu item) using Word for Mac in my MacBook Pro 2015 model?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried selecting the first image and then using Command key and clicking the adjacent one, using the Shift key and trying selecting both and cannot select the 2nd one in either of these attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

            If the pictures are in-line with text (the default), you cannot group them, since Word is treating them as text. Right-click on each picture and choose
<strong>Size and Position</strong>. Click on the <strong>Text Wrapping</strong> tab and make each one
<strong>In front of text</strong> (or <strong>Behind text</strong>, that works too). Now select by holding down the
<strong>Shift</strong> key and clicking on each one, then <strong>Group</strong>.

            You don't need an add-on; it can be done with VBA.&nbsp; You'll find an example in InvoicePDF.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file includes an option for generating multiple invoices either as a single PDF file or, as you want to do, as multiple PDF files.&nbsp; In my case each report is restricted on the invoice number by referencing a hidden text box in a dialogue form
 as a parameter in the report's RecordSource query.&nbsp; Each invoice number is consecutively inserted into the text box at each iteration of a loop through the ItemsSelected collection of a multi-select list box in which the invoices are selected.&nbsp; In your case
 the VendorID or similar would be the parameter.<br />
