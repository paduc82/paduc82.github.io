<p>Hi Victor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Viewing a created appointment in Outlook depends on which version of Outlook you are using. For us to know more about your concern, we would like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using Outlook on the web or Outlook app? If you're using Outlook app, which version of Outlook app?</li><li>Have you tried checking the Calendar view on Outlook?</li><li>If possible, can you send us a screenshot?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your reply.</p>
        </p>

<p>Thank you for the screenshot that you've provided. If you can't remember the date of the appointment that you've created, we suggest changing the calendar view of the application to find the appointment easily. Check the screenshot below on how to change
 the calendar view:</p>

<h2>            missing email after outlook.com migration &#43; bouncing emails</h2>
                    hi
<div>Since microsoft changed my emails from hotmail to outlook, my emails are bouncing back as folks try to email me on hotmail.com</div>
<div>Also when i logged in, all my emails were missing</div>
<div>I am finding it impossible to connect with anyone in Microsoft to solve this issue for me. Hopefully, someone can guide me as to how to reach microsoft and figure out why they have messed up my account?</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><font>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </font>
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><font>I understand that your emails are missing. Let me try to help you find your missing emails or get them back. We need to gather additional information from you for us to be able to identify the root cause of the
 issue. Please provide the answers to the following questions:<br />
<br />
- Did you rename your account? If so, please provide the old and new account name with the estimated date and time you renamed it. If you are unsure if you indeed renamed your account or just added an alias, you can refer to these links:<br />
<br />
Renaming Your Primary Alias<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/rename-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/rename-account</a><br />
<br />
Adding an Alias to your Account<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/add-alias-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/add-alias-account</a><br />
<br />
- Did you try to close/deactivate the account before the issue occurred?<br />
- When was the last time you logged into your account?<br />
- Did the data loss occur right after Outlook.com upgrade or was the data still there for a brief time?<br />
- Are you seeing the missing mails on a mobile device or the web UI, or a mail client program?<br />
- What is the account that you‚Äôre having issues with?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, here are the possible reasons why emails got lost in your account:<br />
<br />
A. Messages were manually deleted either due to accidental deletion or they were moved to a folder. Please check if emails are being moved to a POP folder, and/or other personal folders that can be due to your Email rules.<br />
<br />
It is also possible that they were deleted due to your account filter settings. Kindly check if Schedule Cleanup is set to automatically delete emails. You may refer to the link below for more information about the feature:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/conquergraymail/automate-your-inbox/scheduled-cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/conquergraymail/automate-your-inbox/scheduled-cleanup</a><br />
<br />
B. Messages can also be deleted if you are using a mail client or a third party spam filtering software to access your account. This often happens when using the Pop3 protocol to retrieve your mail and the option Always leave a copy of the message on the server
 is not selected.<br />
<br />
C. Account has been hacked or compromised.<br />
You may lose emails if your account was hacked and the hacker had already deleted emails in your account.<br />
<br />
D. Conversation threading is enabled.<br />
If the feature Conversation threading is turned on wherein all emails with the same subject line are grouped together. You can visit the link below to know more about this feature:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/auto-upgrade-outlook-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/auto-upgrade-outlook-faq</a></font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><font>E. <span>Emails got deleted due to Inactivity.<br />
When users don't sign in for more than 365 days or within the first 10 days after signing up for an account, the system will flag it as Inactive. After an account becomes inactive, all messages, folders, and contacts are deleted. Incoming messages will be sent
 back to the sender as undeliverable.<br />
<br />
Also, if you were accessing your emails on a mail client such as Windows Live Mail or through your mobile device, but didn‚Äôt log into your web account for over 365 days, you may lose emails due to inactivity in web account.</span></font></font></span></p>
<p><br />
Please be informed that you can use the recover deleted or lost emails feature in Outlook.com to bring back your lost emails. However, when Outlook.com recovers missing or deleted emails, our system restores as many emails as it could regardless of its dates.
 There is also no guarantee that the messages that you are looking for will all be recovered. You can refer to the Solution Article below for the steps to retrieve your lost or deleted emails:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/how-recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/how-recover-deleted-messages</a><br />
<br />
Note: Please copy the URL and paste it in your browser's address bar. Regarding the self-recovery feature, the system can recover messages but not the folder itself. Recovered messages will be presented in your Deleted folder. Also, emails will not be recovered
 via recovery link if they were deleted from email clients like Windows Live Mail, Microsoft Office Outlook, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font>Lastly,</font></span><span> you may provide us the affected email address through the private message for investigation purposes. You may refer to the private message area or you need to click the notification that states ‚ÄúYou have a private
 reply to this message. Click here to read it on our secure private messages section.", be sure that you are signed in to view my message.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due <span>to the sensitivity of the information needed to address your concern, we'll be locking up this thread.</span>This will ensure that we'd be able to address your concern without having to discuss private information over public forums.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
 understand that you are seeing a different profile picture linked to your account. Let me help you with your concern.</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, Outlook.com will display the profile picture that you have set up on your Profile. You can delete or manage the profile picture showing on your account&nbsp;by going to this&nbsp;<a href="https://profile.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try to connect any third party service on your account? If yes, I would advice that you check the settings for third party connected service on Outlook.com. Kindly follow the instructions below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to&nbsp;<a href="https://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.live.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.com</a>.</li><li>Click the&nbsp;<strong>options icon</strong>&nbsp;located at the upper right part of the screen.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>More mail settings</strong>.</li><li>Under ‚Äú<strong>Reading email</strong>‚Äù, click&nbsp;<strong>Content from third-party networks</strong>.</li><li>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Don't show public content from third-party networks</strong>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>&nbsp;to confirm changes.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If in case the steps did not work, and you still see the stranger's picture, try to remove the connection of any third party service on your account. See the instructions below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to remove the connected services</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Permissions</strong>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Manage other accounts</strong>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong>&nbsp;under the connected service that you want to remove your Microsoft account from. Ex. Facebook.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Remove this connection completely</strong>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Remove</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope this will help you with your concern and feel free to post back.</span></p>

    <title>No phonebook transfer to my cars handsfree - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronaldb---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            No phonebook transfer to my cars handsfree</h2>
                    
<p>I've had quite a few phones the last few years (old Windows mobile, Sony Ericsson K750, two androids, at least) and all of them work great in my car regarding handsfree. But the Lumia 800 only works half way. I can pair it and make calls and receive them,
 but the phonebook is not transferred. Quite the traffic hazard to have to pick up the phone to find the numbers or dial them manually on the navigation unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a setup I can not see, or is this a bug?!? If this is not solveable QUICKLY, the phone is going straight back to the shop!!</p>

<p>This is probably a compatibility issue with your cars handsfree. In my car (Citro√´n C5 2009, MyWay system) it worked OK but only after&nbsp;I installed the latest firmware for my cars handsfree it works great.</p>
<p>So perhaps you should update your cars handsfree firmware, if possible.</p>

<p>Hi ronaldb, I have the same problem with NISSAN and MAZDA handsfree.</p>
<p>And I don't care if LUMIA is PBAP or RSAP. I just want to send complete phone book from phone to handsfree over Bluetooth. It was possible with other phones I used to have. But in this **bleep** phone there is no option to transfer phone-book! I found some
 "application" to transfer contacts from LUMIA to other phone, but it works only with phone, no handsfree, and can transfer only 15 contact at once. I have to find some idiot to give him my LUMIA and buy another phone...</p>

<h2>            Issues with using &#34;TEXTJOIN&#34; function and whole numbers.</h2>
                    Does anyone know of a way to use the "TEXTJOIN" function and be able to bring over whole numbers from a cell in Excel that is formatted to display the whole number with zeros after the decimal point. &nbsp;Example: &nbsp;I have a cell that has the whole number "30.00"
 in it, but when I use the "TEXTJOIN" function with a delimiter of "," &nbsp; and read that cell along with others in the column it will only place the whole number without the decimal point and trailing zeros in the destination cell where the function string is
 located. &nbsp;For example if I read a group of cell that have the numbers: " 24.3 &nbsp;45.678 &nbsp;30.00 &nbsp;55.78" (one number in each cell) &nbsp;it will give me an output, with comma delimited "," in that function, at that function location that looks like : &nbsp;" 24.3,45.678,30,55.78".
 &nbsp; &nbsp;I have the formatting at that cell where the function is, set to "number" with 2 places after the decimal point, the same as I have set in the group of cells I

            <p>Hi TrentQueen,<br />
<br />
From my personal experience, the reason that the affected emails were quarantined may be that the SCL(Spam Confidence Level) values of the affected emails are high. Exchange Online marks emails as spam or not according to the SCL value. As a result, please
 refer to the following steps to create a transport rule to bypass the affected sender and see if it helps(Note: You need an administrator account for the steps).<br />
<br />
1. Log into <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange Admin Center</a>.<br />
2. Navigate to <strong>mail flow</strong>&gt;<strong>rules</strong>. click <strong>+</strong> to create a new rule.<br />
3. Click <strong>more options</strong>. specify the sender and create a rule as below.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49f2a150-632f-46b0-9e6e-26423bb78345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49f2a150-632f-46b0-9e6e-26423bb78345" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Under <strong>Do the following</strong>, select <strong>Modify the message properties</strong> -&gt;
<strong>set the spam confidence level (SCL) to </strong>-&gt; <strong>0/bypass spam filtering</strong>.<br />
4. <strong>Save.</strong><br />
<br />
Additionally, you can refer to the following articles to find and release quarantined messages as an administrator or an end user.<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200742(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find and release quarantined messages as an administrator</a>.<br />

<br />
If the issue persists, I need to collect some information for investigation:<br />
<br />
1. Navigate to mail flow&gt;rules in Exchange Admin Center and check if there is any transport rule (with an action redirect to quarantine or modify the scl) which move the specific messages to quarantine?<br />
2. The message header of a quarantined email.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d2bb019-308b-4b62-b3a8-6f8d285c1162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d2bb019-308b-4b62-b3a8-6f8d285c1162" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Please run message trace to search the email delivery status and provide a screenshot of the result. here are the steps:<br />
Sign in to exchange admin center (outlook.office365.com/ecp) with an admin account.<br />
Navigate to mail flow‚Äîmessage trace, specify the time, sender and recipient. click search.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a772c37-a417-47ca-b3eb-8bb11c162d3b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a772c37-a417-47ca-b3eb-8bb11c162d3b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For privacy concern, I have sent you a private message to collect the mail header of a quarantined email and screenshot of the message trace result. You can click the following link to access the PM.<br />

 answer or leave. How can we fix this? (note: IMs work no matter what.)

    <title>Clickable &#34;rich text content control&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oliverrubli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clickable &#34;rich text content control&#34;</h2>
                    I would like to recreate a template like "Cover Letter (blue)" template in the latest version of Word. I would like have RTCC fields that are clickable in order to input text. This is done in the above template for the "recipient address" and the&nbsp;"recipient
 name". In the properties options I can only find an option called "Show as: bounding box" that is used for the "your name" field in the above template. I can not figure out how I can create a clickable field. When I take a closer look to the mentioned template
 I found than all the clickable fields have the option "Show as: none". When I try that the RTCC functionality is not available any more. Does anybody have an idea. Thank you.

            So I figured out - my mistake was that I inserted a text first and then put RTCC on top of it. It is the opposite you have to put first the RTCC and then you can change the placeholder text. Like that the RTCC is clickable even without a box. This should
 be mentioned in the help...!

            By using the same Style for each list.
<div><br />
<div>I always recommend customising the List Bullet style to your needs, because it is built for the purpose. &nbsp;But you can use any style that meets your needs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The margins and indents are stored in the style. &nbsp;If the bullets don't line up, that's because they have used the same style for several different things: non-bullets, bullets, and a different kind of&nbsp;bullets.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To get consistency throughout the document, use styles. &nbsp;It's also at least ten times quicker to format with styles.</div>

<p>Right... So I'm facing a few problem with my N9...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I can't sign in to the Ovi store... Everytime I try it says 'Unkown Error. Check time and date settings' ... I've tried hard reset, cleared the device too, updated to PR1.1... But the problem doesnt seem to go away..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, whenever I use my Facebook app, all activity time is noted as 'A moment ago' instead of the actual time.. I have a feeling the two problems might be linked...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be much, much appreciated.. I love this phone... But this is giving me a real heartache..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh and no 3G here in my country.. only Edge...&nbsp;</p>

<h3> atcomment  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive Long Path issue</h2>
                    
<div>I was trying to upload files using CloudBerry and OneDrive for business stops uploading files because the path is too long</div>

<div>I checked the folder name and currently it is 86 characters long (OneDrive - Name of the Organisation - 86 characters), after I renamed the organisation in Office 365, the folder name didn't change</div>

<div>I've trying to stop syncing the folder and re-sync it again (application has crashed several times), reinstalled OneDrive, cleared the cache but nothing worked (the folder name doesn't update)</div>

<div>I was wondering if you could help us to resolve the issue, if you could please rename the folder&nbsp;</div>

<p>hi atcomment,</p>
<p>given the description, i would like to confirm more details for further troubleshooting.<br />
1. as you mentioned the folder path is too long, is there an error message popped up about the folder name problem when syncing? if so, please share with us a screenshot about it.<br />
to upload screenshots, you can click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> at the bottom and then click the icon of
<strong>insert media</strong>. <br />
2. how long has it been you changed the organization name in office 365? it takes some time to take effect.<br />
3. could you try to remove all the credentials under <strong>web credentials</strong> and
<strong>windows credentials</strong> by going to <strong>control panel\user accounts\credential manager</strong>?
<strong>note:</strong> exit onedrive for business client and close all the browsers first<br />
4. have you triggered the resync process from the browser? if not, could you try that by clicking the
<strong>sync</strong> button as below?„ÄÅ</p>

<h3> navar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t move some emails from PST back to Inbox</h2>
                    <p>We turned on archiving for my Exchange 2013 account.&nbsp; Bad idea.</p>
<p>Now i want to move all of my online archive items backing into their matching folders in my mailbox.</p>
<p>From the Exchange server created a PST of my archive with no errors.</p>
<p>Copied the PST to my Windows 10 (up to date with patches) and running Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>I can browse the PST structure and open emails.&nbsp; Business as normal.</p>
<p>Until I try to move emails from the PST back to the my mailbox.</p>
<p>What makes it really strange is some move and some give "Cannot move the items. The item cannot be moved.&nbsp; It was either already moved or deleted or access was denied"</p>
<p>I can open these emails, i can reply to these emails, but just can't move it.</p>
<p>The some of emails are only 5 weeks old so it was part of the Exchange archive process.&nbsp; It was in my Outlook inbox at one time.</p>
<p>I tried the scanPST but that only broke the PST.</p>
<p>I tried the move on a windows 10 running Outlook 2013.&nbsp; Some move some don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea on how to move these emails back into Outlook inbox?</p>

<p>I first move about 500 emails and that was when the cant move message showed.</p>
<p>I then try to move a single email and got the message.</p>
<p>The PST is in my document and on the other PC in a folder with everyone full permissions.

            If you're using Exchange, there should be no PST. Are you talking about usin ghtr Archive button on the ribbon or the AutoArchive feature in Outlook? They're different.

<p>You are correct.&nbsp; But Exchange archiving had been turned on for my account and within Outlook i had an archive folder produced by Exchange.</p>
<p>I could not move emails back to my inbox and sub-folders as they would just be moved back when the Exchange archive process ran next.&nbsp; Got alot of emails.</p>
<p>So from Exchange we created a PST from my archive folder.</p>
<p>Then i copied that archive PST to my PC.</p>
<p>Then I disabled Exchange archiving for my account.</p>
<p>Then the can't move emails problem started.</p>

<p>After digging around on the web I found out what issue is or at least part of it.</p>
<p>This is a known bug with Outlook/Exchange as in it daily function of processing emails it creates duplicates and you normally only notice this when you create PST/Archive files and try to move emails around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I have done to get my PST emails back into my mailbox.&nbsp; Well most of them.</p>
<p>Make a copy of your PST file.</p>
<p>For me all my emails i need to move are in the Inbox with sub-folders and Sent Items.</p>
<p>Ran clean up Conversations.&nbsp; You may not want to run this as you must take a leap of faith with microsoft.</p>
<p>Ran clean up Folder and sub-folders.</p>
<p>Then turned off the Reading Pane for easier viewing.</p>
<p>Then sorted all the emails by Icon.</p>
<p>Then deleted all the calendar items.</p>
<p>From here I could probably moved my emails back to my inbox but i decided to run Stellar Duplicate Remover against the PST file.&nbsp; You can download a demo version of Stellar Outlook Toolkit.&nbsp; This toolkit does a far better job at cleaning up and fixing PST
 file than the microsoft ones.</p>
<p>I would recommended that you sort the email by Received and move emails by month or year so if some thing errors you know what you were trying to move.&nbsp; I did the right click select move.&nbsp; I would avoid drag and drop as you might drop in the wrong location.</p>
<p>For me I started with the oldest and did 6 moths at a time.</p>
<p>I did create a folder called InboxAR as to make it easier to keep track of which emails moved and which ones didn't.</p>
<p>Once i was done I then moved the emails out of InboxAR and into the Inbox folder.</p>
<p>I did still have some emails that would not move.</p>
<p>
What I have learned is avoid using PST files and microsoft Archiving.&nbsp; Bad they are.</p>

    <title>Can I install Access 2007 with Office 2010 pre-installed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidlewin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I install Access 2007 with Office 2010 pre-installed &#40;Starter&#41;</h2>
                    Can you please help - or guide me?<br />
<br />
I needed to upgrade my PC which has come with Win10 - Starter<br />
<br />
I have Office Professional 2007 on CD's from my previous machines.<br />
<br />
I very occasionally need to use Access which is in the Office 2007 bundle<br />
<br />
Clearly it makes sense for me to move up to Office 10&nbsp; but as a home user I simply cannot afford the $499.99&nbsp; for the top level package you sell just for the pleasure of having Access2010 ( I want the software on my Laptop as well, so $349.99
<br />
For 1 user <br />
1 PC only<br />
<br />
Can I install Access2007 into the Office10 ??&nbsp; After all, I have bought a license to use Access with that 2007 software - and yet now I seem to have to throw it all away?<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />
<br />

            <p>If your version of Office 2007 is a retail version, and you have the Office Key, you would be advised to uninstall Office Starter, including any Click To Run or Office trial versions that might have been installed with Office Starter, reboot, install Office
 2007</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively you can if you wish, haveing uninstalled any Office trial versions, insert the Office 2007 cd, select custom install and make all options unavailable, excepting Access</p>

    <title>How to get a Vlookup to return multiple results - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shanson71  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get a Vlookup to return multiple results</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I am looking to do a Vlookup for different names on a spreadsheet. I would like it to show all results for this specific name if it appears more than once. When I type the name I would like to find into the blue cell, this occurs:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/590ed2a0-3d21-4710-9686-4ef48a3560a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/590ed2a0-3d21-4710-9686-4ef48a3560a2" /></a></p>
<p>I would like to pull data from the data tab:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f475c09-d7dd-491b-95ad-237627fc2873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f475c09-d7dd-491b-95ad-237627fc2873" /></a></p>
<p>Despite there being two separate maintenance charges, it returns the same maintenance charge multiple times. The vlookup formula increases by the cell (i.e cell c2=<span>=</span><span>VLOOKUP</span><span>(</span><span style="color: rgba(247, 152, 29, 1)">$A$2</span><span>,</span><span style="color: rgba(126, 55, 148, 1)">Data!2:620</span><span>,</span><span style="color: rgba(17, 85, 204, 1)">1</span><span>,</span><span style="color: rgba(17, 85, 204, 1)">false</span><span>),
 cell c3=</span><span>VLOOKUP</span><span>(</span><span style="color: rgba(247, 152, 29, 1)">$A$2</span><span>,</span><span style="color: rgba(126, 55, 148, 1)">Data!2:621</span><span>,</span><span style="color: rgba(17, 85, 204, 1)">1</span><span>,</span><span style="color: rgba(17, 85, 204, 1)">false</span><span>),
 cell d2=</span><span>VLOOKUP</span><span>(</span><span style="color: rgba(247, 152, 29, 1)">$A$2</span><span>,</span><span style="color: rgba(126, 55, 148, 1)">Data!2:620</span><span>,</span><span style="color: rgba(17, 85, 204, 1)">2</span><span>,</span><span style="color: rgba(17, 85, 204, 1)">false</span><span>)
 etc.) </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Does anyone know how I can get the vlookup to return the
 two separate maintenance charges and have them appear once each?</span></p>
