</p><p>I also have Office 2016 for Mac. &nbsp;I have always been able to record macros within Excel, but this version does not seem to work properly. &nbsp;I have a spreadsheet with many sheets within it. &nbsp;I have always been able to "record" a macro to print certain sheets
 within this file, but once I record the macro -- nothing happens.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your observation is correct. Excel 2011 recorded printer actions, but 2016 does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many code examples on the web that you can use:</p>

 download the Trial Version of Microsoft Access 2010, but it is not working well due to some features are being blocked in trial version. So can you please kindly advise that what is the thing i need to do in order to download the version with full features
 to try out before we purchase? Please kindly to reply me asap. Thanks.<br />

            First this is a public forum. Answers here are provided by volunteers and some Microsoft employees. So there is no reason and its not a good idea to include personal info like your full name, e-mail address or phone #.
<div><br />
<div>Second, As far as I'm aware there are no limitations on the trial version, other than time. So, if you want help with dealing with issues about possible&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;problems between A2003 and A2010, please detail what problems you are having, error messages,
 code &nbsp;involved etc. and we will try to help.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Go to Start, then select the Settings gear &gt; Privacy &gt; then select either Camera or Microphone. Under both, make sure that Skype is toggled On. Restart Skype and go to your Skype Audio &amp; Video Settings to verify the correct device is selected within Skype.
<br />
<br />Please refer to this and give a try to all those suggestions.

            Hi Dennis,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused. 
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Camera
<br />
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />Still not working? Try uninstall then reinstall Skype:
<br />
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:

<h2>            Can&#39;t read an old email that was typed in Thai sent in 2006</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently tried to access an email sent to me in 2006 and it was in Thai. &nbsp;I put it in my saved message folder and forgot about it. &nbsp;Well recently something happened with this friend and I wanted to access my email for sentimental reasons. &nbsp;Now when I open
 the mail it is in gibberish. &nbsp;I am sure the coding has changed and maybe so has the font since 2006 but I would like to know if there is any way I can find the old font so I can be able to read this email again. &nbsp;Thanks for any suggestions.</p>

<p>Hi Danny,<br />
<br />
There are several reasons why the email shows in gibberish. In some of our customers, it has something to do with the Mail settings in the Outlook app. We recommend that you change the message format to Plain Text or Rich Text to see if you can be able to read
 the email. To do that, kindly perform the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Outlook.com</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the gear icon &gt; <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Layout</strong> &gt; <strong>Message format</strong>.</li><li>Change the <strong>HTML</strong> to <strong>Plain Text</strong> or <strong>Rich text</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Outlook App</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Mail</strong> &gt; <strong>Compose Messages</strong>.</li><li>Change the <strong>HTML</strong> to <strong>Plain Text</strong> or <strong>Rich text</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if that works for you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried what was suggested above. I have gone through the settings in both computer and phone but there is nothing i can see that would affect the font. I tried loading old fonts and cooy and pasting to microsoft word to use the old fonts to no avail.
 I tried forwarding it to other email services but it still comes up in gibberish. I am fresh out if ideas. I am even willing to forward you one of the emails with a problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not all emails written in Thai before 2006 has a problem only a select few. And then problem seems to be isolated to 2006 and before.</p>

    <title>Interleaving tables in query - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael feher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Interleaving tables in query</h2>
                    Greetings,<br />
<br />
One last one (for now): I have two tables, Table A and Table B.&nbsp; There is a relationship where just about every record in Table B has a parent record in Table A.&nbsp; (The few "orphans" I have are not a problem right now.)&nbsp; That is, any record in A has 1 (0) ...
 N associated records in B, linked by indexed ids.<br />
<br />
What I would like to do is "interleave" the data from Table A and Table B in such a way that the first record in A is the first record in the resulting query or table, then that record's children (related records in B), then the next record in A and its children
 from B, etc. all the way until I'm through all records in both tables.<br />
<br />
What kind of query am I looking to do?&nbsp; The answer seems like it should be simple, but it's not coming to me.&nbsp; I'm assuming there'll be some kind of "Group By" clause in the query because I will ultimately want to display each parent with its children beneath
 it, then the next parent and its children, and so on.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading,<br />
Mike<br />

            <p>A Table or a Query must be "homogenous" - all records must have the same number of fields of matching datatypes. You can't interleave disparate types of records in the way you describe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, however, your purpose is to display the data on screen or on paper, you can use the capabilities of the Access Report to do this. Just create a query joining the two tables, and use the report's Sorting and Grouping dialog to create a report in which
 the Table A data is displayed on the group header, and the Table B data in the report's Detail section.</p>

Actually, I think I might not be correct.&nbsp; I just realized that one field extra in Table B is the pointer (id) back to the "parent" record in Table A.&nbsp; So that probably won't work.<br />
<br />
However, I did just manage to use a simple UNION between the two SQL blocks which give me all the common fields between two.&nbsp; Now how it chose to order/group them...well, that's a bit of a mystery.&nbsp; I think it just grabbed the ids and ran them in numerical
 order, so the first column in the results has duplicates ids, which I expected.<br />
<br />
So, I got all of my records back, but I just need to know how to order/group them.&nbsp; More later...<br />

<br />
Ah, okay.&nbsp; So here's the deal: I've been working on setting up a basic requirements management database.&nbsp; My "schema", if you will, is that there are high-level expressions of desired system requirements (source requirements) and lower-level decomposed (derived)
 requirements which stem from the source requirements.&nbsp; The two sets are stored in two different tables, with the exception that the derived requirements table has an extra numeric field which links back to the ids in the source requirements table, in effect,
 giving 1...N derived requirements a parent.<br />
<br />
Previously, we have been doing all of our requirements-management work in Excel spreadsheets, and as you can guess, this has been a nightmare: multiple copies of the files, no way to control them, changing ids with scattershot naming conventions, no enforced
 relationships of any kind, etc.&nbsp; So what people generally do is, after all the source requirements are written, one to a row in the spreadsheet, rows are inserted underneath each source for as many (again, one to a row) derived requirements as have been decomposed
 from the source.<br />
<br />
The desire is ultimately to produce an Excel spreadsheet or even an Access report which looks the same way, but since it's in Access and I've split up the requirements, I need to pull from both the tables and "put them in order" just as they would be in the
 spreadsheet.&nbsp; Right now, I've got all of the fields of interest, except the parent field in the case of the deriveds, but that is a known "issue", in the sense that I obviously can't union different sets of fields from tables of differing structure as you
 mentioned.<br />
<br />
But I know and have used GROUP BY to do a "rollup" in essence of things beneath a topic.&nbsp; For example, if I had a query or report which listed the systems in an aircraft, I might have line items like "propulsion system", "fuel system", and "hydraulic system",
 then under each, I would have things like the items particular to each system (nesting).<br />
<br />
Hopefully this clears things up a bit.<br />

Well, I think my aspiration is first and foremost to learn how to do it, since I've never done it.&nbsp; But secondly, it is to be able to recreate the structure that everyone is familiar with.&nbsp; Few people here, if any, are facile with Access, so we often have to
 work with (and send to the customer) Excel spreadsheets, cleaned up from our development work.&nbsp; So my main goal is to find the cleanest solution to get the whole output to appear as it has been for quite a while now.<br />

<br />
Am I hearing you correctly in the idea that the report could be set up to pull from different tables directly and somehow set up the grouping on the report?&nbsp; The reason I ask is that I generally never go straight from tables to reports, and have never tried
 it in the fashion I think you're suggesting.&nbsp; I usually go through queries to get the raw data I want, then the report is tied right to the query when I create it, so I don't have to futz with or figure out, "Now how do I make this visual element on the page
 attach to the right data?".<br />

            You'll need to base the report on a Query joining the two tables; but yes, the Report's Sorting and Grouping dialog is very powerful indeed (more powerful than creating a Query for tasks like this). You can get multiple levels of grouping, display data
 in headers (above the detail section) or footers (below), lay out the controls in the sections similarly or differently, whatever you need.

<p>Hi Anand,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'd like to explain that&nbsp;the promoted links web part is not supported in SharePoint online modern view.&nbsp;As a workaround, you can add Hero web part in your page. You can display up to five items in the Hero web part and use compelling images, text, and links
 to draw attention to each.</p>

    <title>percent error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nitengaleacct  say:</h3>
<h2>            percent error</h2>
                    <p>I need assistance with a calculation.&nbsp; I have a spreadsheet where I'm looking to get a sales increase or decrease over a prior period.&nbsp; I understand that a normal formula will return a #DIV error because one of the values is 0, but I'd like to see if there
 is a way around that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally what I'd like to get is:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;if the current period is 0, but the prior period had a value, return a value of 100%</p>
<p>-if the prior period had 0 and the current period has a value, return a value of -100%</p>
<p>-if both periods are 0, return a value of 0%</p>
<p>- if anything else, return the percent increase/decrease</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Blu Win HD on Build 10535.1004</h2>
                    Got the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">build 10535.1004 for my Blu Win HD (w510u) the i</span>nstallation was smooth, I have experienced some minor details that disappeared as I did the hard reset and started from
 scratch, the performance is better than with version 8.1 and I got today another Insider update but I see that I can not register again in the fast ring, hopefully consider leaving this device in the next build, I am sure that some colleagues have problems
 but I assure you that if you do the hard reset, start from scratch and do not select any previous settings the Win HD will work much better. I have already done in two devices and the result was the same. I welcome your comments.

<div>We have a Team created for internal and external members, but somehow some guests are not receiving the invite to join it.&nbsp; I have tried several individuals who have different email providers (gmail, outlook, yahoo, etc) and all of them have not received
 an invite.&nbsp; I have also provided the generated link and, unless the person has a Microsoft email account, they cannot access the Team.</div>

    <title>MSE Update Failure Fail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. soda  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSE Update Failure Fail</h2>
                    <p>This title may sound like a typo or bad grammar but it's exactly what I'm experiencing. Occasionally, sometimes only once a week or so; my clean install of MSE will claim to have failed to update it's definitions. The download begins, moves towards installation,
 then right when it's about done I get the following error I'll attach below. However if I close this error &amp; check for definition updates again it says all is fine &amp; that they did in-fact update. It should also be noted that I've been experiencing this for
 a few weeks now, even prior to my clean install of the latest version as I was running a very slightly out-of-date one prior. I've run various other Malware scanners including Malwarebytes plus ESET &amp; Bitdefender's online scanners which all report I'm clean.
<strong>What should I do about this error or is it in Microsoft's hands?</strong></p>

<h2>            Lumia 730 Dual Sim- Hard reset</h2>
                    <p>Hello !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using my Lumia 730 for over an year now. Recently it slipped from my hand and the display was destroyed beyond repair. On inquiry at an authorized reseller I understood that the price for getting a new display is just a few Euros less than that
 for a new phone. So I decided to get a new phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I would like to wipe out all my data from my old phone without getting the display repaired. Is there any possible way I could get this done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all in advance !!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Connecting webcam to Windows phone&#63;</h2>
                    Hello. I want to use webcam with Windows 10 mobile phone which I will modify for astronomy, infrared, ultraviolet imaging and need to keep it portable so hooking webcam to phone is perfect idea. Are there apps that allow to use external camera on Window
 phone such as Lumia 640 and would system support modern 1080p camera's? I do also happen to have USB female to micro USB male adaptor.

<p>
</p><p><span>System File Checker (SFC) is a utility in Microsoft Windows that allows users to scan for and restore corruptions in Windows system files. Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Just intalled build 10162 today and wanted to let you know I have the same problem. I ran the System File Checker and it verified 100%, but I still have the same problem. The notification icon in the task bar indicated I had a new message but I was unable
 to view it. I get the same blurry transparent area when I click on the icon.</p>

<h2>            Word files opened not maximized</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same issue - or probably even worse. I select a word file by right click and clicked on PROPERTIES. Then I selected "Maximized" in the Field "Run:". When I open this particular document it opens Maximized.</p>
<p>If I try this on several other documents I even dont have the Field "Run:" so I can´t select Maximize. Those files open in a very small window and I always have to maximize each one of them - which is annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So is there a solution for that? I also selected "Maximize" for Word itself (by right clicking on the Word Icon) so Word should open ALL files maximized..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Win7 64bit Enterprise PC with Word 2010.</p>
<p><br />
Best regards,</p>
<p>Philip</p>

</span></span></span>Does this happen with only Word 2010 or with all the Office applications?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When you create a new document by opening the

<p>Try opening Word is safe mode and check if it opens in maximized mode. Follow the steps to open Word in safe mod:</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Start</b> -&gt;
<b>All Programs</b>.</p>
<p>

</span></span></span>Type <b>WinWord /safe</b> (<b>Leave a space after WinWord</b>) -&gt; Click
<b>OK.</b></p>
<p>If Word in safe mode opens in maximized mode, then run the

<h2>            Google can now be added to Edge - UK too</h2>
                    <p>Finally Google can now be added to Edge to search in the toolbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the Google homepage - <a href="http://www.google.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.google.co.uk</a> in my case - and add it to favourites - click on the star in Edge, and add to favourites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next go to the 3 dots ... at the top right of the Edge window, and click on settings. Scroll down, click on Advanced Settings, scroll down to the "Search in the address bar" option, click on "Add new" and Google will appear there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently Google have added whatever MS have wanted to their search engine and it now can be added to replace the default of bing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally Edge may be usable now we're not forced to used the less than adequate bing app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is useful.</p>

<h2>            Office 2011 14.5.4 update won&#39;t complete</h2>
                    I have updated Office 2011 for years with no problem. &nbsp;But the 14.5.4 update just hangs at "Running package scripts..." and shows "Install time remaining: About a minute". But it hangs at this for hours. &nbsp;I have a 2010 15" Macbook Pro running 10.10.5.
 &nbsp;I trashed my office installation and reinstalled Office 2011 from Microsoft's digital download site but it still hangs in autoupdate with 14.5.4. &nbsp;It looks like other updates are included in the Office 2011 download package now but 14.5.4 is so recent auto
 update tries to install it. &nbsp;What should I do?

<p>I created a new user but the Office 2011 14.5.4 update wouldn't install there either, just would hang like before. &nbsp;I think Apple's 10.10.5 Yosemite update that was released two days ago is causing a problem for Office's auto update.</p>

            Windows 10 build 1511 and Microsoft Office (the products you mentioned) have one thing in common: they are both made by Microsoft.&nbsp; Beyond that - their Product Keys are separate things - just because you have one doesn't give you rights to the other.

<h3> grifftapher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t find autosaved Word 2013 file</h2>
                    <p>I'm so sodding frustrated right now. I've been working on some university work for about a month and when I came to submit it today my computer hasn't got the recent file. It only has the first version from the 1st April. I've gone through the whole autosave
 recovery and nothing is there. This is just crippling to be honest, I need to find this document. I've looked for previous versions and nothing is there, recent versions; nout. I seriously need help to find it. Here is a list of things I have done to try and
 find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Searched the computer (putting document name) Just gives me the original version.</p>
<p>- Opened Word 2013 and looked for most recent documents ^ same applies.</p>
<p>- Opened Word 2013 and clicked autosaved documents and unsaved documents. Nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be seriously appreciated. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance. </p>
<p>Chris.</p>

            <p>This exact same thing happened to me... I opened the file yesterday (Tuesday), wrote 800 words, saving regularly along the way and then came back to it today and it only had Monday's edits. Utterly frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edited to add - I just restarted my pc out of desperation and when I opened the file this time it was the correct version (I have the file pinned to my recent docs). Being sensible I saved a dated version to my hard drive, then saved it again to my sky drive.
 I then closed Word and reopened the original file and the backup to check they were okay. &nbsp;My hard drive copy was fine, but the original version now had the same issue as before and brought up a message that the file couldn't be uploaded to the server. To
 anyone using Skydrive (or OneDrive, neither my Outlook nor pc can decide which name to use) make sure you're saving a copy to your hard drive after each session.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have had Word 2013 do the same to me. Autosave is switched on for autosaving every 10 minutes. I have also been saving the document regularly, as I go. However, MS automatic updates forced my PC to reboot overnight killing all running applications, not
 just word, but XL too. The XL documents all appeared in auto recover as expected and all data was recovered. however, Word auto recover is showing the document as it was over a week ago! This is not an isolated incident either, with Word 2013 auto recover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even checked the autosave location on my PC and could see two auto save folders for the document. One dated 30/06 and the other dated yesterday. However, Word appeared to be ignoring the later auto saved state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this is yet another clear example of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) software development!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software industry is currently focussed too much on getting product to market at the expense of releasing good quality, reliable products. This is fair enough for apps like Facebook and other novelty/social media apps, where crashes don't really do any
 harm. However, when we're talking days of work being lost for people using Word auto recover failing to auto recover, this is unforgiveable. This kind of data loss is very costly for your clients Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pick your game up!</p>

            <p>Recover a lost autosaved document that is not in the File Management section of previous saved versions.</p>
<p>I have tried a number of suggested methods to find a document that has no autosave copy and you are faced with what you began with when you started working on it. This is the only way I have ever been able to reinstate an autosave that appears not to exist
 when you click on the document Management option to see what saved versions are available, only to find there are none. So:</p>
<p>Open up any <strong>Word </strong>document, it doesn’t matter which one.</p>
<p>Click on far left <strong>File </strong>tab at the top of the ribbon</p>
<p>Click <strong>Options </strong>from the list on the left</p>
<p>Click <strong>Save </strong>from the list on the left of the opened box</p>
<p>Copy the location of where saved files are kept (<strong>AutoRecover file location</strong>) to your cursor - likely
<strong>C:\Users\your name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\</strong></p>
<p>Close the whole box</p>
<p>Go back to the <strong>Word </strong>document, go to <strong>File</strong> again</p>
<p>Click <strong>Open</strong></p>

<p>Make sure ‘<strong>*all types</strong>’ is selected to the right of the blank box that appears</p>
<p>Right click on the empty box and then left click <strong>Paste</strong> that will appear in the dropdown menu. However, when you click
<strong>paste,</strong> all saved files will appear in a new dropdown menu under the blank box (you will not get the option to paste the coped location, which is right). You may need to expand the dropdown to see the full file names (left click and drag on
 bottom right corner of dropdown). The auto saved documents usually have an <strong>

<p>Highlight the file you want to recover by right clicking on it and it will go into the box.</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Open</strong> and it will open the document in <strong>Word format</strong></p>
<p>The document will have an <strong>AutoRecover save</strong> prefix but will be in Word format.</p>
<p>When you try to save the document, a box will appear. From the left side options choose where you want to save the file to – likely click on ‘<strong>Documents</strong>’ and then on the specific document folder you want to open it. Save the document to there.</p>
<p>Job done.</p>

            <p>1) To all the posts above: "Should have saved your work": &nbsp;NOT HELPFUL. Have autobackups set. Have MSWord autosave set. Sometimes stuff happens anyway.</p>
<p>2) To Filoudog: Thank you.</p>
<p>3) A couple addenda to Filoudog's post:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1. Word 2013: After going to open, you will need to select "computer" to see the "browse" option mentioned</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2. The files you see are NOT (of course) in any specific order. You may have to go through the files and open them and pick something you know you recently changed to find the latest.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">3. Windows may open the Users&gt;YOURNAME&gt;AppData&gt;Roaming&gt;Microsoft&gt;Word folder. (or you can open it yourself). &nbsp;(Or it may open the comparable folder via Filoudog's method).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">4. Once in that folder, use the file view "details" and click "date modified.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">5. This will sort the temporary files and show you the most recent.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Yes the 45 minutes I just spent finding my file using Filoudog's method was frustrating. &nbsp;But it was sure a lot less frustrating than losing the 52 pages of writing I did in the last 3 days which, for some reason, Word had deleted from its recovered files
 menu.</p>

            <p>You should always keep backups, since Office or Windows won't do it automatically for you. That is still useful advice, although it obviously won't help someone who has lost a document before setting up backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can search File Explorer (Windows Explorer) for AutoRecover files (*.asd) left behind, but there is no guarantee that you will find any. Especially in older versions of Word, these files&nbsp;were preserved only if Word crashed.</p>

<p>Hi Laura,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to explain that .xls file format is supported by Excel for Mac. To check if this issue is related to Office cache, I'd like to suggest you
<a href="https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT201262&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cfcd35c80ba9d4cb5437508d65b49da9c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636796770091613751&amp;sdata=uDbK%2B3XNW22nbzt4e6UYRbWMQfa%2F3zHP3VW9p4gP1rY%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reboot your Mac in safe mode</a> to check if you can open your files normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Disclaimer: </em></strong><em>Microsoft provides no assurances and/or warranties, implied or otherwise, and is not responsible for the information you receive from the third-party linked sites or any

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you still can't open your .xls files, please launch Excel directly and create a new workbook then save it as .xls format and reopen it to see the outcome. If you can open it normally, that means the new Excel
 cannot open your existing .xls files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To troubleshoot this issue, I'd like to suggest you change one issue related file's extension name from .xls into .xlsx to check if you can open it. You can do that via right click the file&gt;select Get info and change
 it under &nbsp;"Name &amp; Extension" field. Please have a try and share with me your result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, please also share with me more info as below to let me narrow down the root cause of this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Screenshot of the error message if you meet any.</li><li>Can you open your files normally before? What have you changed before this issue happens?(e.g. update OS/Office)</li><li>How do you open your issue related files?</li><li>In which version of Excel that you create your .xls files?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Neo</p>

    <title>Excel text wrapping question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcmu99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel text wrapping question</h2>
                    <p>Hello, just trying to understand what setting might be in place that would cause an excel file to NOT expand the size of the row even if text wrapping is enabled. In the first screenshot below you see a cell that I have clicked in to edit it---excel expands
 the cell while I edit. As soon as I&nbsp;click outside of the cell, excel collapses the cell and&nbsp;what I get is what you see in the second screenshot&nbsp;which is the text in the cell truncated along the border of the cell below it. So in that area highlighted in red
 you see the truncated text hiding because the row wont autofit it. The third screenshot is of a plain old excel file with text wrapped in a cell---and it DOES expand the row to accommodate the text wrapping. What setting could be&nbsp;different between the 2 files?</p>

            <p>Every cell in a column has the same width.&nbsp; Every cell in a row has the same height.&nbsp; If you see a cell that seems to violate this rule, it is sized to encompass multiple cells, then it is probably merged.&nbsp; If you have gridlines turned off there would probably
 be not visible indication.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you created the workbook and you did not merge any cells or copy and paste into the workbook from an external source, then I would expect there would be&nbsp;no cells&nbsp;that are merged.&nbsp;

            Hi Jcmu99,<br />
<br />
If all wrapped text is not visible, it may be because the row is set to a specific height or that the text is in a range of cells that has been merged. Please try the steps below to check the outcome:<br />
1.On the Home tab, in the Cells group, click Format.<br />
2.Under Cell Size, do one of the following (TIP:&nbsp; You can also drag the bottom border of the row to the height that shows all wrapped text.):<br />
&nbsp; 1)To automatically adjust the row height, click AutoFit Row Height.<br />
&nbsp; 2)To specify a row height, click Row Height, and then type the row height that you want in the Row height box.<br />
<br />

Wrap text in a cell.</a><br />
