<h2>            Error 0x80070032 after kumulativ updates e.g. KB4501375, KB4507453</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried still a lot of things right now to fix this problem for example to rename the folder C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution also tried to manual install the updates but still all running into the error code 0x80070032. Also disabled the backup on a external
 hard drive because I've read that this can cause this problem. But nothing till now still works. Also when I run the MS troubleshooting software no problem is found.</p>
<p>That drives me insane and it can't be that when such kind of problems occur I have to reinstall my complete computer.</p>
<p>Maybe here someone has an idea how to fix this problem.</p>
<p>Right now I'm running windows 1903:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aeff15b9-ffd9-434b-b130-0c90c1d48ad9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aeff15b9-ffd9-434b-b130-0c90c1d48ad9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is exactly what I get after each kumulativ update:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c680ee26-d568-4f22-b25a-66ae899a5bdf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c680ee26-d568-4f22-b25a-66ae899a5bdf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can hide the updates but that don't solve my problem. Other updates like today the KB4502584 was completed without any problems.</p>
<p>My Problem started with KB4501375 and still ongoing KB4507453.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other updates working fine and will be installed e.g. Windows defender updates, Office updates etc. Only the kumulative updates running in the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also report each time a KB update runs in that error seems not to solve my problem.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for the help.</p>

            Hi Hans
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I want to be reasonable with my response, but not because a cumulative update is release means it is a must have installed. 
<br />
<br />Remember, the system was working before it was published to Windows Update.
<br />
<br />Some cumulative updates can introduce problems or do not work as intended. 
<br />
<br />If the update is not installing or making your system unstable, I would heed that as a sign not to try and force the installation.
<br />
<br />What you should do instead is file a bug report in the Feedback Hub so the engineers are aware of it and can do further testing. This could potentially lead to revisions of the cumulative update or a replacement that does actually install. 
<br />
<br />My recommendation is to block it for the time being, when a subsequent update is released, it will include the fixes. 
<br />
<br />Report it:
<br />
<br />I would also recommend you submit a feature request; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that updates not installing never is a good idea. I also reported it the problem mostly is only that you never get a feedback like in a bugtracker (what also bugs me) so that you can see if you are the only one or more people having the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with this problem is right now that also the next kumulative update don't fix the problem it shows the same symthomes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here the link to my request I already made before: <a href="https://aka.ms/AA5hglb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://aka.ms/AA5hglb</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I only thought there would be maybe a workaround to get this updates installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 chewed up my disk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vigorosomold717  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 chewed up my disk</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;was putting in a disk (LEGO Avengers)&nbsp;to play, and I&nbsp;was at the home screen when I heard a strange sound coming from my console. It sounded like it was grinding something up in there, but it stopped after about 10 seconds. So i continued to start the game when an error came up saying the disk was unreadable. Upon further inspection&nbsp;of the disk, I&nbsp;found a large and very deep scratch going along the disk in a circle. The disk was not like that before I put it in, and I always store them in their proper cases. This has not happened to any other games after that incident. I am very upset about it because I&nbsp;have spent a lot of time playing that game and I'm worried about the same thing happening to future games. I would be very happy if I&nbsp;could get some help. Thank you for your time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Carol,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A compatibility issue is one of the potential reasons why the games which are working in the previous operating system may or may not work on Windows 10. To help you resolve this concern, we suggest that you install the latest version of the games that are
 not working, and check if it's compatible&nbsp; with Windows 10&nbsp; by installing the said games.

                    Hi.<br />
<br />
I am trying to manually create a system restore point on my Windows 8 machine. <br />
<br />
<span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Here is the error I'm experiencing when trying to manually create a restore point: "The restore point could not be created for the following reason: The writer experienced a non-transient error. If the backup process is

 retried, the error is likely to reoccur. (0x800423f4) Please try again."</span></span></span><br />
<br />
I have looked up this error on the internet and the only reference I found that applies when creating manual system restore points is a link to an archived file on the technet site that says: "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This error is caused by a bug in
 the driver for Intel ICH5R chipset that results in critical disk 0 not being marked as fixed hard disk. There is no workaround because.&nbsp; According to Intel, this version is not Windows Vista compatible:&nbsp;

<br />
I'm not running Vista. I'm running Windows 8 (not 8.1). <br />
<br />
I have looked in my restore points folder and there are some restore points that have been created automatically. The last one was created 12 days ago.<br />
<br />
Here are my computer specifications:<br />
<br />
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3110 CPU @ 2.40GHz 2.40GHz<br />

Please help me resolve this issue.<br />

            Thank you for your assistance. You gave me 90% of the solution.<br />
<br />
First, my system is set to automatically install Windows updates so there were no updates available. This raises another question: Why have I not been upgraded to Windows 8.1? Is that something extra that I have to download from Microsoft?<br />
<br />
But anyway, here is the solution that worked for me.<br />
<br />
I did what you said but my Volume Shadow Copy was turned off. I turned it on and set it to automatic (manual is default) then tried to create a restore point which resulted in the same error I was getting before. Turning the service off again and turning it
 back on again made no difference. I still received the same error. <br />
<br />
It's possible if I had set it to manual it would have worked but I don't want to have to turn on the service every time I want to create a restore point.<br />
<br />
So I decided to restart the computer and see if that would change things. That succeeded. I am now able to manually create system restore points.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Battery Jumps from 100&#37; to 93&#37;</h2>
                    Have an HP Notebook from December. Wiped the drive and reinstalled Windows 10 only. So completely stock Windows. Noticed the battery started draining from 100% right to 93% after 10 minutes of use every time I charge the laptop. I swapped the battery with
 the one from my sister's laptop and it does the exact same thing. I don't think both batteries are deteriorated that equally and after a month? Is this a Windows 10 issue? I've already tried calibrating the battery as well.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If it shows up in Disk Management you can assign a drive letter. Windows Key<br />
+ X - Disk Management (or Right Click the Start Button).<br />
<br />
If not there then you will need to check with the maker's support and on-line<br />
documentation (and any forums) for the portable media device.&nbsp; Some may<br />
have a special utility to help.<br />
<br />
For some portable players you will need to set it to MTP for syncing with WMP<br />
(and some other media players) or MSC for assignment of a drive letter so you</p>
<p>can copy or delete files to or on the device.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<p>
</p><p>Apparently Microsoft's&nbsp;"solution" is either:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 1. Pay for third party software such as MTPDrive, which I have not used and cannot verify, or</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 2. Buy a Mac</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one time Windows XP&nbsp;handled this&nbsp;seamlessly and automatically, i.e. assigned a drive letter to iPhone. Windows 10 does not do this, at least not on my brand new HP laptop. This is apparently what Microsoft and HP call "progress."

<p>You can not undo a Recovery to Factory Settings Process.</p>

If&nbsp;you have done a clean install back to Factory Settings, you have normally wiped your Hard Drive clean&nbsp;during the Process.<br />

<br />
Recuva is a file undeletion tool that enables you to scan your hard drive(s) or media cards for files that have been deleted or formatted. It presents you with a list of files that were found, along with an assessment of their recovery potential, a preview
 option and a hex viewer to inspect the content. You can limit your search to files of a certain type (e.g images, audio etc.) and choose between a fast and a deep scan approach. The program also includes a secure deletion option that allows you to permanently
 delete files that were found during the scan, in order to prevent any future recoveries.<br />
<br />

Look for a windows.old folder, as we do not know exactly&nbsp;how you installed.<br />

            I'm experiencing this same problem. &nbsp;My wireless network shows up with limited access.
<div>If I right click on it and select Profile I get the following Error Saving Wireless Profile:</div>
<div>"Windows has encountered an error saving the wireless profile.</div>
<div>Specific Error: The data is invalid.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My Hp Advisor Control Panel indicates that the device manager has turned off the wireless device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In trying to open the system device manager I get the following error message:</div>

    <title>How do I adjust the sensitivity on the Natural Wireless Laser Mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerryashley  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I adjust the sensitivity on the Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 7000&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased the Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000,&nbsp;and I downloaded the&nbsp;Mouse and Keyboard Center from the Microsoft Hardware Support Website.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;checked the Basic Settings and changed&nbsp;the ones I wanted.&nbsp; However, when I started using the mouse, I&nbsp;discovered that the sensitivity was set way to low.&nbsp; I've spent&nbsp;a lot of time trying to figure out how to change the sensitivity, but haven't had any
 luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called the hardware support line for assistance.&nbsp; The support technician recorded the PID of the mouse and assigned&nbsp;control number 1191826472.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really like the mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;if there's no way to change the mouse sensitivity I return it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate your assistance in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jerry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You can't change the sensitivity in the Mouse and Keyboard Center. Go to Devices and Printers, right-click on the mouse, and select 'Mouse settings'. You can change the speed under the Pointer Options tab. Change the settings to the way you like, then click
 Apply, OK, and you're done.</p>

</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do

    <title>Achievements not unlocking on Life is Strange - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fivewizz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Achievements not unlocking on Life is Strange</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I was wondering if a forum admin would be able to clarify if I will receive a response regarding the survey in the sticked posts about achievements not unlocking. The Live support chat said I would definitely get a response but just noticed that in the
 survey it says there will be no follow ups. Have been completely unable to unlock any achievements since yesterday. And they are not "Done! Unlocking" either they are just completely locked. Weird. Thanks.</p>

<p>You probably need to change your personal picture, to do this you have to be on your console.</p>
<ol>
<li>On the dashboard hit the home button and move over to the settings tab </li><li>Select the profile option </li><li>Select "Edit Profile" </li><li>Select "Gamer Picture" </li><li>Select "Change Personal Picture" </li><li>From there you can change your Gamer Picture </li></ol>
<p>Hopefully this is the issue and the fix you need, reply back if this helps or not.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>Try and remove your account from your Windows 8 computer then re-download it to your xbox 360 console (delete profile first from console if its on it) then re-download it, change your gamerpic to something new (private and public) save it, sign out from
 xbox live, then sign in again to see if your gamer picture has changed on the xbox.</p>
<p>If your picture still remains on your xbox console, sign out. Then on your Windows 8 try and re-download your gamer profile, hope this helps in some way shape or form.</p>

<p>Hey there Jack! Just to clarify, on the console and our website, your pic shows just fine, correct? Your issue is on the Rewards site and on your Windows Phone. For the phone, you can try backing up, removing the account, and setting it back up again. This
 should force it to pull down the latest information.<br />
<br />
As for the Rewards site, you may want to get in touch with them on their forums (<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_rewards_support/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../default.aspx</a>) to see if this is something they
 can fix there. Please let us know how that goes, thanks!</p>

            Hi Larry
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model of the printer?
<br />
<br />Please try the steps recommended below to uninstall printer software 
<br />
<br />Option 1: Run the Printer Troubleshooter - <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_printer10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_printer10</a>
<br />
<br />If you are using an HP Printer, use the HP Print and Scan Doctor:
<br />HP Print and Scan Doctor - HP Support
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/ph-en/document/c02073861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/ph-en/document/c02073861</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2: Uninstall and Reinstall the Printer
<br />A. Uninstall the Printer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features / Programs and Features
<br />Select your printer.
<br />Select Uninstall.
<br />
<br />Windows key+R, type control, hit Enter
<br />Open Devices and Printers.
<br />In the Devices and Printers window look for your Printer. If you see it listed, right-click on it and choose Delete or Remove Device
<br />
<br />Windows Key+R, type Cmd, hit Enter
<br />Type printui.exe /s &gt; OK.
<br />Click on Drivers tab.
<br />Look for Printer driver. If you see it click on it and click Remove at the bottom.
<br />Select OK.
<br />Select Apply and OK on the Print Server Properties windows.
<br />Close Devices and Printers.
<br />
<br />B. Install the Driver
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers
<br />Reinstall the Printer driver
<br />Reboot the computer 
<br />
<br />Also, perform the following steps to see if it helps. 
<br />
<br />        Open the Services window (Windows key + R, type services.msc, press enter).
<br />        Select Print Spooler and click the Stop icon, if it is not stopped already.
<br />        Navigate to C:\Windows\system32\spool\PRINTERS and open this file. You may need to show hidden files or enter an administrator's password.
<br />        Delete all contents inside the folder. Do not delete the PRINTERS folder itself. Note that this will remove all current print jobs, so make sure no one on your network is using the printer.
<br />        Return to the Services window, select Print Spooler, and click Start.

<h2>            Email address  for communication between MIcrosoft Answer Desk Help and customers.   All addresses I have tried failed, all are NO REPLY.</h2>
                    <p>I am dealing with a technical problem hard to be solved.&nbsp; Refers to the successful installation of the latest version of Windows 10 which we customers are being told it is a must.&nbsp; Two of your agents have kindly tried to help me in two consecutive online
 rescue sessions that I am permitted to have as I do have a subscription to ASSURE which is valid.&nbsp; I have prepared a report that will be complementary of the CASE NO. that Microsoft Agents prepared. The case No is 1412911756.&nbsp; The report that I tried to hand
 over to your Agents Ber Anthony and Praven R as said above describe the work I have done alone, based on instructions prepared by them and mailed to an email address.&nbsp; I need to inform them the final result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) I managed to carry on the installation of Windows 10 latest version, that requires 18 hours for its total installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) At the end of the 18 hours the screen went off and I did not know if was again one more failure. Yet the message Installation Completed was there, bu me I do not know which is the next step.&nbsp; All I know is that it seems from what I read on the instruction
 sent to me via my Hotmail address is that the full installation requires the installation of drivers and of application which are part of the systems of the updated version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>c) At present I managed to make a SYSTEM RESTORE and went back in time to a moment before attempting to download the Updated version of Windows 10,&nbsp; at a time I knew my PC was working OK.&nbsp; This is what I am using now, hoping I can still keep it working until
 your experts come back to the issue of moving into the Windows 10 latest versions, something they keep notifying me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, please let me know, as I believe we are online now, could you tell me if it is possible for me to copy and paste on a second feedback the report I have prepared than I believe will help your agents to finally solve the problem.</p>

    <title>Dolby Atmos for Home Cinema - Option greyed out - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dolby Atmos for Home Cinema - Option greyed out</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm trying to setup Dolby Atmos for home cinema using my Laptop and my Onkyo AV receiver which is definitely Dolby Atmos enabled. Laptop is connected to AV receiver by HDMI cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used the Dolby access app to try and set it up, the app tells me to select 'Dolby Atmos for Home cinema' from the dropdown menu in the spatial sound tab of audio properties but the option isn't there, only 'Dolby atmos for headphones' or ' Windows sonic
 for headphones'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also you can try updating your sound drivers.&nbsp; Right click <strong>Start</strong> -&gt;
<strong>Device Manager</strong> -&gt; <strong>Sound controllers</strong> -&gt; right click sound driver and
<strong>update driver</strong>.&nbsp; I have the Dolby Atmos for home theater option so I think maybe it's a driver issue.</p>

<p>Yes, i have the Dolby access app installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking its a driver issue too. I've got an older laptop which shows the Dolby Atmos for Home Theatre' option but that used a proper AMD driver for the HDMI audio output rather than a generic Microsoft 'High Definition Audio Device'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't seem to get Windows 10 to accept a different driver, it keeps insisting that the best driver is already installed, which it obviously isn't!</p>

            You can try uninstalling the driver and then install a different one.

<p>Do you have the HDMI device selected (not speakers) in the Playback devices?&nbsp; You don't want

<p><strong>Speakers</strong> turns Spatial Sound OFF for me and the <strong>Dolby Atmos for home theater</strong> option is not present.

<p>Hi Alexa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Some possible reasons why you cannot download or install apps from Windows Store can be due to incorrect date and time on your PC, your Windows Firewall is disabled or there is a problem with your internet connection. To help resolve the issue, kindly follow
 these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;If the Store is unable to connect to the Internet</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Check for connectivity in Internet Explorer. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Check the proxy configuration in Internet Options, Connections, LAN settings. If there is a proxy configured, try disabling the proxy connection.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 2: Check the Date, Time and Time Zone configured for the PC</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a . For a reference, go to Bing.com on your PC and search for “time”. The results page should show the current time and time zone.</span><br />
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 3: Check the Microsoft Account</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Go to Microsoft Store, Account and click&nbsp;Sign Out.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Sign in with the Microsoft Account. Do this even if the correct user is displayed as this will ensure that your account is working correctly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 4: Run the Windows Update troubleshooter included with Windows</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 5: Reset Store after collecting log files</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25.1pt"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A. Run&nbsp;WSCollect.exe&nbsp;to collect and save logs<br />

            I'm not the original poster, but I'm having the same problem, and I appreciate the response.&nbsp; I tried the above things, with the exception of number 4 (the windows update troubleshooter, which I'm not finding for 8.1), and the problem persists.

            I've just started getting the same problem, where I can't download anything from the Windows Store. I've done just about everything I can find online and on this website but I'm still getting the error code 0xc03f300d, if that helps identify the problem
 at all. Is this a very recent problem? All the resources I'm able to find are dated today (4/9/2018) or yesterday (4/8/2018).

            I am having the same problem. This has been happening since Friday April 6th or Saturday April 7th 2018. The games that are affected for me are as follows- Uno &amp; Friends, Microsoft Solitaire Collection, and Microsoft Majong. I have been unable to sign
 in and play and I tried to uninstall and then reinstall and when I went to reinstall nothing is happening and I am getting the same as everyone else is- Error Code 0xc03f300d. What is the problem and is it going to be fixed soon? Contact me at *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 if need be.

            This just happened to me today also.&nbsp; Same error code and message.&nbsp; It started when I realized Xbox would not sign me in when I was ready to play Microsoft Solitaire Collection games.&nbsp; I have Windows 8.1 PC.&nbsp; So I made a mistake by uninstalling my games.&nbsp;
 Now it will not let me re-install them.&nbsp; I have done all that has been suggested.&nbsp; My account has correct information and payment info and date and time and zone.&nbsp; I have tons of space on my hard drive.&nbsp; Must be a new issue?&nbsp; Do you think Microsoft will let
 us know when this has been corrected?

            Well I hope Microsoft will correct the problem, I also did all that has been suggested, it is not a problem of my firewall or of my PC, other apps so as weather and others, work right. When I see all the answers of the community from today, I see that
 it is a new problems for a lot of people. Support of Microsoft has always the answer I should try troubleshooting. But that doesn't help also.

            Nobody has gotten back in touch with me and problem is still occur. I was going to live chat for problem but there were about 35 people ahead of me. If problem is still going on Tuesday evening I am going to email to microsoft support and hope to get a
 reply that way. At first I was worried it was my computer having problems but knowing so many others are having same problem we know it has to be on mircrosofts end of things and I hope they get it fixed soon.

            No one has responded to me either.&nbsp; Still same problems....I hope they are working on this because all of us cannot be having the same issues if the problem is at our end.&nbsp; It must definitely be a Microsoft issue.&nbsp; I tried contacting them under chat and
 it never would put me in que.&nbsp; My shortcut (tile) stopped letting me in the store completely, but I got into store by selecting from my apps list.&nbsp; This means they have upgraded something that has messed up Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I wonder if it messed up 10 as well?&nbsp;
 Today, I'm still getting 0xc03f300d error message "Something happened and your purchase can't be completed."
