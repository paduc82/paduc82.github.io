<h2>            Windows Update &#40;FixIt&#41; fails to fix... Win 7 Starter version &#40;Acer eeePC&#41;</h2>
                    G'Day.
<div>I've tried fixing Windows Update multiple times now, but it has failed to fix anything.</div>
<div>Fixit SAYS it is fixed, but when I try to update again, it still doesn't work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I go to START / Control Panel / System &amp; Security / Windows update and get...</div>
<div>A red shield with an X in it. I press the Check for updates button, and get...</div>
<div>A dialog box telling me:</div>
<div>Windows Update cannot currently check for updates because the service is not running.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I open Windows Services, scroll down to Windows Update, right click, and choose RESTART.</div>
<div>I try the update again, and it still tells me the service is not running (even though it is).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Further to this, I have just examined the updates log, and nothing has been updated since 12-12-2012, which seems like an odd date to have stopped.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I use Windows Security Essentials as my AV program - up to date as of today, 15 Aug 2013.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas please anyone ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks, Greg</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            G'Day Babu.
<div>Thanks for the tip renaming the SoftwareDistribution folder. It seems to have done the trick - I restarted the wuauserv service, and it is now downloading updates.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again.</div>

<p>When you bluetoothed your Windows 10 PC to your Smart TV did the display worked? If yes, you can simply play a video on your computer then it will appear on the Smart TV. If no, you will have to buy an HDMI cable or a PC to TV adapter. Depending on your&nbsp;Smart
 TV's inputs.&nbsp;That one used in monitors. If you are using a desktop.. connect CPU to Smart TV.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 is only creating ONE BACKUP PERIOD&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gleam2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 is only creating ONE BACKUP PERIOD&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span>On my Windows 7 PC, backup has only one back up period: from 10<sup>th</sup> Feb 2015 to 31 Aug 2015.</span></p>
<p><span>I have a separate hard drive that I back up to one night a week. I connect the hard drive before the start time. The PC is running with a non admin account.
 As soon as the hard drive is inserted, I am asked if I want to run a manual backup. I usually say Yes to this, and I am then asked to enter an admin password and it normally runs well. Just over a week ago I did this and the backup failed due to lack of space.
 I looked for a suggested solution and found that there should be several back up periods. There is only one.</span></p>
<p><span>For the latest back up I tried leaving it for the scheduled back up, but this failed due to lack of space. So then I tried a manual back up and it worked. (Before
 both of the latest backups I had deleted a lot of files.)</span></p>
<p><span>On the backup hard drive I have the following Space usage summary:</span></p>
<p><span>Data file backup<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>319.72 GB<br />
System image<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>343.63 GB<br />
Other files<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>3.33 GB<br />
Free space<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>264.83 GB<br />
Total size<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>931.51 GB</span></p>
<p><span>If I look at Manage Windows Backup disk space and Select how Windows retains older system images, “Let Windows manage the space used for backup history (maximum
 279.45GB)” is selected. <span>&nbsp;</span>Note the system image is 64.18 GB bigger than the declared maximum.</span></p>
<p><span>Space used on my C drive is 335GB. This is the only hard drive that is being backed up.</span></p>
<p><span>It appears that this problem has been around for over 5 years but I cannot find a solution which addresses my problem.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-7-backup-has-only-one-period/5d44c8bd-8624-45b6-ab30-c207d8f1da0d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-7-backup-has-only-one-period/5d44c8bd-8624-45b6-ab30-c207d8f1da0d</a>

<p><span>Hope someone can help.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>By default, Windows automatically saves as many system images as it has space for without taking up more than 30 percent of space on the backup disk. Once the disk starts running out of room, Windows deletes older system images. You can set Windows to retain
 as many system images as it has space for on the backup disk or to only keep the most recent system image. You should always keep the most recent system image. If you are saving your system image on a network location, you can only keep the most recent system
 image.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>To view and manage your backup disk space</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Backup and Restore by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Backup and Restore.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Manage space. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note<br />
If you haven't set up backup, you won't see Manage space.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change the amount of space that is used by file backups, under Data file backup, click View backups.<br />
You can then select and delete older file backups.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change the amount of space that is used by system image backups, under System image, click Change settings.<br />
You can then choose to have Windows save older system image backups or just the most recent system image backup.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. However I have tried to make it plain that there is only one back up period, and so if I delete this I will loose all my backups, and just have to hope that the next one works OK.</p>
<p>The fist link you cite says:</p>
<p>"Periodically, Windows creates a new, full backup. Each full backup is known as a backup period. When you view your file backups, you see all of the backup periods labeled with date ranges. If you decide to delete file backups, you should always keep the
 most recent file backup. "</p>
<p>Periodically is a vague term, but if the disc is full and it has about 3 times the capacity of the data it is being used to back up, and it covers more than 6 months, I would suggest that it is not working very well. Also if there is only one period, I cannot
 follow the instruction to always keep the most recent backup period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way round this problem that I can see is to obtain another hard drive and back up to that one and when that is full, delete the backups on the first hard drive and start using that one. Another way of course would be for Microsoft to come up with
 a software mod or for someone to explain what I am doing incorrectly.</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this limited information it's difficult to guess at what the problem might be but I would start by resetting the router.
<br />
<br />
It helps to have a router configuration file to get all the routers settings back to where they were, otherwise you would have to do it manually.&nbsp; Refer to the methods if the issue is still not resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="font-weight: bold">Method 1:</span> You may try to reset the TCP/IP stack go to this article and either click on "<span style="font-weight: bold">Fix it for me"</span></font> or follow the instructions to fix it yourself:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Temporarily disable security software and firewall settings and check if the Internet Connection drops.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disable antivirus software</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</font></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Turn Windows Firewall on or off</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</font></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note:</font></span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to
 install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Method 3:</font></span> </p>

    <title>Microsoft Surface Go&#58; CPU usage limited to 25&#37; when plugged in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Go&#58; CPU usage limited to 25&#37; when plugged in &#40;must unplug for PC to be usable&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>For a few days now I've noticed that my PC (Microsoft Surface Go) was sometimes very very slow and sometimes fine...</p>
<p>&nbsp; Today it was so absurdly slow that I actually investigated and my CPU usage was limited to 25%...!?? (each core/thread can only do 25%).</p>
<p>&nbsp; What's worse is... it only happens when plugged in! On battery I can get the full power of all 4 threads....</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I only have a balanced power plan which gives me no performance options (only sleep timers, etc) and I tried to create a custom power plan, but it's just the exact same options available.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I tried to change the performance via single-click on battery icon which made it possible for me to come and write this here (still extremely slow and threads are still capped at 25% but somehow it's actually running less grind-to-a-halt slow).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Basically, I'm low on battery, but if I want to get things done, I have to unplug, quickly click/type and interact what I need and then plug it in while I'm reading or something... I found a few people posting on some forums similar problems, but didn't
 find any solution :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Missing Xbox 360 Game on Xbox One.</h2>
                    
<p>Wasn't sure where this thread goes but this kinda fits here... If not sorry mods.</p>

<p>So I got a problem. I heard saints row the third became BC but it never appeared in my download queue... what's up with that?</p>
<p>I checked my purchase history on the website and it said that I had it purchased back in 2013... so I don't know what's going on.</p>
<p>I got like every other game that I bought on the 360 to appear on my Xbox One but this game is missing and after checking the game page it says I have to buy it... What should I do?</p>

            <p>You are talking about text size of windows elements.</p>
<p>But question was about SIZE OF INTERNET EXPLORER ADDRESS BAR SIZE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is very hard to use address bar now when it 12-15% of IE width.</p>
<p>To&nbsp;change it:right-click on bar beside tabs; in dropdown menue - select "Show tabs in a separate row"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what question was about, imho.</p>

            You can, but not selectively to the Internet Explorer address bar. &nbsp;You can increase the size of all font elements equally though. &nbsp;Give this a try and see if you like it (you can always turn it back off if you don't like the change)
<div><br />
<div>1 - Click Start, then type the word&nbsp;<b>text&nbsp;</b>into the Search box at the bottom. &nbsp;Some options will appear.</div>
<div>2 - Click the option for <i>Make text and other items larger or smaller</i></div>
<div>3 - Choose a larger size, then click Apply.</div>
<div>4 - Repeat if you want to try a different size.</div>

    <title>Strict NAT type - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Strict NAT type</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a used router and factory reset it and set it up to work with my internet. It works and is faster then my previous router, just my NAT type is on strict. I tested my internet speed which was at 50mbps download speed and about 8-10 mbps upload speed. I can join parties and play games and even host multiplayer game lobbies but my NAT type is still strict as well as my game NAT type. If anyone has any ideas on what I should try that would be much appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello!<br />
</p>
<p>The most common cause of having a strict NAT type is that you have secondary router doing NAT that is connected to a modem/router from your service provider that is doing NAT. If that is what is causing the problem the only options are to disable NAT on
 the device from your service provider, or remove the second Router.</p>

            Put your Xbox in the DMZ on your router. I had the same issue, my NAT stays open now. A Google search will show you how, if you don't already know. Good luck.&nbsp;

<h3> tonyeroberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alt-Tab in Windows 8.1 is extremely slow with multiple monitors and HighDPI scaling</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Precision M3800 laptop with a screen resolution of 3200x1800. With no external monitors connected, everything works fine. However, when I connect an external monitor with a resolution of 1920 x 1080, Alt-Tab becomes nearly unusable. Holding
 down Alt and hitting Tab, it takes about 1-3 seconds for the list of opened windows to appear. This also affects a quick Alt-Tab to just go to the previous app. That doesn't work at all now. The problem gets worse if I connect an additional 1920x1080 monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried this in a couple configurations. One configuration uses one external monitor connected through the laptop's HDMI port. The other configuration has 2 external monitors connected through a port replicator. The port replicator is connected to the
 laptop via USB and the monitors connect to the port replicator through DVI. I see this same behavior with both configurations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that Windows is trying to generate the icons for the list of open apps and the scaling is causing some type of delay. If I could disable the icon generation, that might fix the problem but I haven't figured out how to do that. I've also noticed
 that if there are no open applications on the 4k laptop screen (or they are minimized) then the Alt-Tab is super quick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated all the drivers on the laptop to the latest versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tony Roberts</p>

            <p>I really don't understand this response. It should be obvious I know how to setup multiple monitors as the whole problem is when multiple monitors are installed. And I gave details of the different configurations I've tried for those external monitors. I
 also stated in the original post that all the drivers are up to date. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure this is a bug and there's nothing I can do about it except to purchase external monitors that can run the same resolution as the laptop monitor. I was hopeful there might be a way to turn off the preview icons for the Alt-Tab window using
 a registry hack. </p>

                    I have paired my&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;7 PC&nbsp;with my Bose SoundLink III Bluetooth Speaker AND Bose AE2w Bluetooth Headset. Both are showing&nbsp;in the Devices and Printers --&gt;&gt;Bluetooth Devices.&nbsp;The problem is they can not connect to my PC due to device driver error. I have
 tried to search for the drivers but&nbsp;didn't found&nbsp;even at Bose website. Are these 2 devices really compatible with Windows 7 PC?&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hello Natz, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p><span>To help you suggest further steps to resolve this issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you able to connect other Bluetooth devices to your Windows 7 computer?
</span></li><li><span>Were any significant changes made to the computer prior to this issue? </span>
</li><li><span>What is the make and model of your computer? </span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could be due to the incorrect or corrupted Bluetooth drivers on your Windows 7 computer. Now, let’s try the following methods and check if that resolves the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the Hardware Troubleshooter </span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Hardware Troubleshooter is an automated tool which checks the hardware connected to the computer for any known issues and provides the details on how to fix them. Please click on this link and follow the steps given in it to run this troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/open-the-hardware-and-devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please check the troubleshooting report and let’s know the details. You may also try the suggestions given by the troubleshooter and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Uninstall and Reinstall the latest Bluetooth drivers on the Computer</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow these steps and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press “<strong>Windows Logo” + “R”</strong> keys on&nbsp;the keyboard, type “<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>” in the “<strong>Run</strong>” Command box and press “<strong>Enter</strong>”.
</span></li><li><span>Search for the Bluetooth from the device&nbsp;list, right click on it and then select “<strong>Uninstall</strong>”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<strong>Delete the driver&nbsp;software for this device</strong>” you may select that
 and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer. </span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions to&nbsp;complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.
</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After the restart, connect the Bluetooth device back to the computer and then open the
<strong>Device Manager</strong> again. Now, click on the “<strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong>” button and check if Windows 7 detects the headset/ speaker and installs an appropriate driver automatically.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Refer: Connect to Bluetooth and other wireless or network devices</span></strong></p>

    <title>Install a printer driver locally for a remote printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnbig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install a printer driver locally for a remote printer</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I have two XP PCs on local network, both shared - file-sharing works perfect, print-sharing with minor bug.<br />
Minolta PagePro printer is attached to computer-1, the default page size is A4 - it works fine on computer-1.<br />
The printer is visible via <span style="font-weight: bold">\\PC1\MINOLTA</span><br />
<br />
When I install this printer to the computer-2 with method-1 (finding \\PC1\MINOLTA printer on network, click on it, Windows ask me to install drivers for local use, done), it forgets the default A4 page size, and try to print everything on Letter paper size
 (this cause a small cut off of the top and bottom site). In preferences, the paper size dialog box is empty, impossible to set anything.<br />
<br />
If I install printer on computer-2 with method-2 (<span style="font-style: italic">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282842 - How to install a printer driver locally for a remote printer in Windows XP</span>) then the paper size setup is correct for A4, but I
 can't print, get a message:<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">This document failed to print</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Document name: ...</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Printer name: ...</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Time sent: ...</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The event log:</span><br />
Document 3, dok.pdf owned by User was printed on MINOLTA via port \\PC1\MINOLTA.&nbsp; Size in bytes: 0; pages printed: 2<br />
<br />
Any idea? Thank for help...<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As I see, the printer&nbsp; is not visible via TCP/IP, it is attached via USB to computer-1<br />
I can access it from computer-2 by <span style="font-weight: bold">\\192.168.2.101\minolta</span> (and if printer is not yet installed, Windows immediately ask me to install drivers for the printer - after that I can use printer with Letter paper size)<br />
<br />
If I try to add TPC port 192.168.2.101 as you suggested, I get a message&nbsp; "the device could not be identified..." and ask me to specify the device, I enter

            When did this start? Do you even see the Surface logo when it boots up?
<br />Can you try a two button reset?
<br />
<br />Step 1:	Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.
<br />	
<br />Step 2:	Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both. 
<br />	
<br />	The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.
<br />	
<br />Step 3:	After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.
<br />	
<br />Step 4:	Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.

<p>I have recently been suspended from my xbox live account for inappropriate content on my bio. Because of this I am not able to log into my account and write&nbsp;on forums on&nbsp;here either, this is my friends account that I am using to&nbsp;post this. "My" gamertag
 is The1WhoKilledMe, the inappropriate content was written without me knowing by another friend who thought it was funny. I have not been on for a few days i have left my little brother play but&nbsp;that would have been thet only time that i was online,&nbsp;and I never
 noticed it was changed, no one had informed me. I was looking to see if there is any way that I can have my suspension lifted. if someone could hale me it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span><span>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Are you using the new Skype for Android? If so, make sure that your notifications setting is turn on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From the <strong>Chats </strong>screen, tap your <strong>profile picture</strong>.</li><li>Tap the <strong>Settings <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2ffa300xx%2ffa34755_1.png" />&nbsp;</strong>button&nbsp;and scroll to
<strong>Notifications</strong>.</li><li>Toggle the listed notification types on or off.</li><li>Alternatively, you can turn your <strong>Notifications for conversations</strong> off&nbsp;to stop all chat notifications in the new Skype. From the
<strong>Chats </strong>screen, tap your <strong>profile picture</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Notifications for conversations</strong>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2ffa300xx%2ffa34746_1a.png" />&nbsp;button
 &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Turn Off</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, there could be a few reasons why you might not be receiving notifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notifications will stop when you sign out of the app. Make sure you are signed in.</li><li>Make sure your <strong>Notifications for conversations</strong>&nbsp;mode is on. From the
<strong>Chats </strong>screen, tap your <strong>profile picture</strong>, if <strong>
Notifications for conversations</strong> is off&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2ffa300xx%2ffa34746_2a.png" />, tap it and tap
<strong>Turn On</strong>.</li><li>Verify that you haven't turned Skype notifications off from your device settings. Settings are managed differently depending on the device. If you’re not sure how to check your device settings, you may need to check the manufacturer’s website.</li><li>Make sure you haven't turned notifications off for a specific conversation.</li><li>Make sure you're using the <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have replied to several of these threads. My Skyoe notifications on the S7 were working fine until Sunday and then they just stopped. Now, no light, vibration, or sound. I am signed into Skyoe, i have verified all settings on Skype and on my phone, I have
 cleared the cache, I signed out and back in, I shut my phone off and turned it back on, I have ensured I am using the latest versions of Skype and Android, ive even toggled all the message notifications off, turned everything off, and the restarted everyrhing
 again. No luck. I am so frustrated because I need to receive notifications of messages right away instead of having to check every few minutes. Please advise.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If the above suggestions didn't work, try this:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<span>Try to install the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andqlimax.pushfixer.noroot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
<span>Uninstall and reinstall Skype once again.</span></li><li>
<span>Launch the Hangouts app, press the Menu Button, and sign out of all of your accounts (tap the account, scroll down and select Sign out). Then re-launch Hangouts and sign back in to your account(s).</span></li><li>
<span>If you are usually connected to Wi-Fi, check your Wi-Fi sleep policy (Settings &gt; Wi-Fi&gt; Menu Button &gt; Advanced &gt; Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep) and make sure it is set to "Always".</span></li><li>
<span>For Android OS 4.4 and above, make sure that Wi-Fi optimization is unchecked (Settings &gt; Wi-Fi &gt; Menu Button &gt; Advanced &gt; Wi-Fi optimization).</span></li><li>
<span>For HTC devices, try turning off fast boot in Device Settings &gt; Power &gt; Fast Boot (make sure it is unchecked). You can also try turning off Power Saver, Extreme Power Saving Mode and Sleep Mode..&nbsp;
 Reboot your device afterwards to make sure the changed are applied.</span></li><li>
<span>Uninstall any task killers you might be running, they block messages when you are not in the app.&nbsp; If you have no idea what a task killer is, then you probably don’t have one.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you have any additional questions or concerns.

<p>Hi Mick Carey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to this issue, Please try to update drivers, especially the graphic driver. Refer to the following steps to clear caches:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>In Windows, open file explorer, type %AppData% and navigate to
<strong>C:\</strong><strong><span>Users</span>\&lt;</strong><em>user_name&gt;</em><strong>\AppData\</strong><strong><span>Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync</span></strong>, delete *** Email address is removed for privacy *** folder.</li><li>Navigate to<span>&nbsp;<strong>C:\Users</strong></span><strong>&lt;</strong><em>user_name&gt;</em><strong>\</strong><strong><span>AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync\Tracing</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>delete
 all files in Tracing folder (don’t delete the folder itself).</li><li>Restart Skype for Business client to check on both sides to see if issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the meantime, Update Skype for Business desktop client.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists, I’d like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Your account is homed online and using domain network? If convenient, switch to a different network for checking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Please provide a screenshot of issue symptom, is it shows black screen, or blank screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. As the issue occurs on joining a call, you can try to leave the call and let presenter re-add you again to see if issue exists. Whether issue occurs when you joining a meetings?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Skype for Business client full version numbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>
