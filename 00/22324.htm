<h2>            Receive &#34;Delivery Status Notification &#40;Failure&#41;&#8207;&#34; while sending to email in the same domain</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set up my domain with "Windows Live Admin Center" to use Microsoft mail service. Thanks to MS, it's a great service :).</p>
<p>But we still have an&nbsp;issue while using our domain email with outlook: We can't send email to each other in the same domain. Our domain is: ella-cementiles.com, then I cannot send email using mine -
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** to
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;for example. Yesterday, we can't receive email, with no notification. However, today we get an "Delivery Status Notification (Failure)" email when we tried to send an email again
 for testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I got from "View message source" of notification email:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Emails being sent but not received - incoming emails working normally</h2>
                    <p>We use outlook within our small business and last week noticed that emails were being logged to the sent file but not received by the recipient. Incoming emails are&nbsp;working as normal and when you send an internal email to another co-worker these arrive on
 most occasions. However, the main concern is the emails being sent to customers/ suppliers which are not being received. We have been advised that checks show this is not going into spam or any other filter at the customer received end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our service provider&nbsp;has run checks and confirmed emails are being sent and we have checked our BT line and they say it is the server at fault. There is no log sheet&nbsp;to give error codes as when you send an email the email sends and records on the list but
 not received by the intended recipient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use Windows 8.1, Office 2013, &nbsp;and have Avast security. I check updates and there was none recorded for the day the issue started. Looking for any support to return the system to normal. We are having to by-pass by using personal email and this is working
 OK but not the business email. This issue is affecting the 3 members of staff and not isolated to one email address. Help and support would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your questions I can confirm as follows;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. We are on a network which uses outlook as the main email response. In our main office this goes to a router and I assume to our domain server. Our field based employee has&nbsp;the same where emails are being sent to his server provider (ie BT) and I assume
 via the domain server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It is happening to many users, not just one.&nbsp;All emails being sent under the business email address are showing as sent but not received by the recipient. We are currently using personal email addresses to communicate with suppliers/ customers and all
 working as it should though the router and&nbsp;external BT line (for outbased staff).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The file are IMAP and this is what we use for our Windows mobile phones&nbsp;as well as desktop settings. When you receive a message from the phone it states 'sent by Outlook'&nbsp;within the email. The mobile phones are also not sending emails to recipients using
 the business email addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please could you offer guidance in which forum to follow for best solution,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            <p>An outlook business version in conjunction with an exchange mail account has the ability to provide logs of mail sent, where as the type of account you are using does not, if as appears to be the case that the problem only occurs with your BT mail account,
 then you need to escalate the matter with BT, as its their server where mail is 'vanishing'
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If you send a test mail (via the business a/c) to yourself is this received?</p>

                    Hi Folks,<br />
<br />
In developing a report I'm testing if a network file is open.&nbsp; I don't care who has it open, I just need to know if it's open.&nbsp; If it is open I'd like to force it closed.&nbsp; I'm starting with Chip Pearsons' 'Wait for file close' function which works well but
 I'm stuck in trying to modify it to close the file after wating it's predetermined period of time.&nbsp; Here's what I've been messing with so far...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FName = "R:\folder A\folder B\File.xls"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IsClosed = WaitForFileClose(FileName:=FName, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TestIntervalMilliseconds:=500, TimeOutMilliseconds:=10000)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IsClosed = True Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' The file was closed before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' the time out expired.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set destWB = Workbooks.Open("R:\folder A\folder B\File.xls")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Workbooks.Open FName<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Set destWB = FName<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' The procedure timed out.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "The file will now be forced closed and reopen for exclusive access."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workbooks("R:\folder A\folder B\File.xls").Close False<br />

            AFAIK this is not possible. The only thing I know is the <strong>net file</strong> [<em>ID</em> [<strong>/close</strong>]] command, but I never used it.<br />
<br />
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490702.aspx<br />
<br />
But you said you develop a report, that means to me that only you create\modify this file and anybody else just view this file. If so, we can use a feature:<br />
<br />
- Create the report local on your PC.<br />
- Add this code to the code module "ThisWorkBook":<br />
<br />
Option Explicit<br />
<br />
Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)<br />
&nbsp; With ThisWorkbook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If .ReadOnly Then .Saved = True<br />
&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Private Sub Workbook_SheetChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp; Static MsgHasShown As Boolean<br />
&nbsp; If Not MsgHasShown And ThisWorkbook.ReadOnly Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "This file is write protected and you cannot saved any changes!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgHasShown = True<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
- Save and close the file<br />
- Open the windows explorer, right the file, select properties and write protect the file.<br />
- Copy the file to the network<br />
<br />
Now it doesn't matter if somebody opens the file, create the next report same way and overwrite the file on the network.<br />
<br />
And if you want you can add a feature to the file: Read the file date in Workbook_Open and Workbook_BeforeClose (maybe Selection_Change or inside a periodic OnTime sub) and compare it.
<span><span>And</span>
<span>if</span> <span>they are different, </span></span>show a message to the user that the file has changed.<br />

            Sorry. Most of the time the mobile versions are designed to work around features they don't support.  I guess this feature just can't be used on your mobile system.

            <p>Hi John Christopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can add this VBA code to your Normal template and it will adjust the Zoom automatically. I use it on my systems. I've also included below a screen clip of where you should add the code... it goes into the ThisDocument class of the Normal template. To
 open the VBE (Visual Basic Editor) press Alt+F11. Depending on your keyboard you might have to add the Fn (Function) key... Alt+Fn+F11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps (the code begins with "Option Explicit")</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<br />
'These are VBA subroutines for you to add to the "ThisDocument" Class of Microsoft Word's<br />
'Normal.dotm template. They automatically establish the Word preference settings for a<br />
'professional writing environment. They function with Word 2011 and 2016 on the Mac<br />
'and Word 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016 on the PC.<br />
<br />
'On a PC they work 100% of the time and on a Mac about 99% of the time. The one situation<br />
'on a Mac where they do not work is if Word is open but no documents are open. In this<br />
'scenario if you click on the Word icon in your dock, a new blank document is created by<br />
'Word but the AutoNew, AutoOpen, and AutoExec routines do not execute. I don't know why<br />
'and assume it is a shortcoming in the Word 2011 and 2016 Mac versions. If you use Word's<br />
'menu bar instead and choose File &gt; New, the AutoNew routine does execute and your<br />
'special writing environment settings will be properly established.<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Second: after finding the relevant invoice (sheet), find the word "Subtotal" in column D in the relevant invoice, then reflect the amount in column E.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reckon I have to use indirect() and INDEX(MATCH()) but I do not know how to combine the 2 into 1 formula. Or is there another easier way?</p>

    <title>Hidden text in cells when opening Word file with table in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hidden text in cells when opening Word file with table in Windows created in earlier version of Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with a Word document. A table was inserted and in that table there is text in certain cells that remains hidden in printout mode (see first image below). However, when I view the document in "Draft", the text becomes visible (see second
 image below). I think the issue is that this document was created in Windows 7 (or earlier) and when opened in Windows 10's Word, the text becomes hidden. Is there a way to make the text appear?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Wim</p>

                    <p>I have Excel 365 Home running on a Windows 7 laptop.&nbsp; I also have an Excel file that is encrypted with a password. I've worked on this file in various revisions on this particular PC. Starting last month, when I try to open the file, Excel not only doesn't
 open the file, it crashes and closes Excel with no message on the screen. If I copy and then rename the file it opens normally.&nbsp; I can also open the original file from my office PC (running Windows 10 and Office 365 Business) and I can open it on my iPad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi BornABruin2,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<br />
For “<em>files (excel and word so far) are only opening up as read only</em>”, I’d like to confirm whether these files are stored in the local synced OneDrive for Business folder (OneDrive-organization name).
<br />
<br />
If so, to troubleshoot the issue, you&nbsp; can try the following steps:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Check if these files are under <strong>Protect </strong><strong>Document</strong>.<br />
Go to <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Info </strong>&gt; <strong>Protect </strong><strong>Document
</strong>&gt; Check if the file is protected. Normally,&nbsp; it will display as below. If it is protected, please remove the protection.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbca9e5d-c8c9-422e-b5f1-ff3f0c197489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbca9e5d-c8c9-422e-b5f1-ff3f0c197489" /></a><br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If the Excel files are <strong>edited </strong><strong>in </strong><strong>browser
</strong>or edited by other users , when we open&nbsp; them in Excel on the desktop, we’ll also get the “Read Only” message. You may close the browsers or check if other users are editing&nbsp; them.<br />
<br />
If that&nbsp; doesn’t help, please confirm the following information to clarify the scenario:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Had you performed any settings for your computer (e.g. update OS) before this issue happened?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does the issue happen to all the files in your OneDrive for Business library? You may create a new file in your OneDrive for Business library and open it in the Office client to check the outcome.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Could you please give us the copy of the document and&nbsp; screenshots of&nbsp; issue symptoms by PM via the following link:

            <p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a One Drive business account. This does not happen with all files, right now only two (one word and one excel file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the screenshot of the protection </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd9e3aa0-e5be-4bc8-8f1b-c17728fe0fc1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd9e3aa0-e5be-4bc8-8f1b-c17728fe0fc1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not send the file as it contains HIPAA information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one else has access to this file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes (that I know of) were made on this computer prior to this happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I am not using a browser to open either of the two files rather am using word and excel specifically.</p>

    <title>New powershell Export-StartLayout broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            New powershell Export-StartLayout broken</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>I have playing with the new PowerShell cmdlet (Export-StartLayout)&nbsp;in W10 10130. It works differently from versions in W8.1 as it only exports xml and not bin. However, I note that the structure of file that it exports is broken as the column and row references
 get duplicated. If you then rename the exported file LayoutModifications.xml and place it in C:\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Shell it will attempt to build the modified Start screen for new users but because of the duplicated Tile references
 it breaks. If you manually edit the exported file and correct the column and row references it works as it should.</p>
<p>Hopes this helps with&nbsp;IT people&nbsp;trying to build customized Start screens.</p>
<p>Pete</p>
<p>
</p><p>This looks to be fixed in 10147.</p>
<p>Pete</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;AlexanderMachado1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!<br />
</p>
<p>Apparently, there's no option to change from monthly to a yearly plan. As a workaround, you will need to cancel your current plan and then, manually purchase a yearly plan. You may follow the steps provided on this link:&nbsp;https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1881/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reply!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;AlexanderMachado1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing to worry, once you've cancelled your Skype number, it will be pre-saved on your Skype account for 90 days. So, once cancelled, you can always reactivate it and can choose a yearly plan.</p>

            I've only checked part of my library to be synced. my entire library is over 160GB so I don't want to sync that. I've chosen about 1000 songs to be synced to my phone and it syncs those songs every time. Its not like they are erased from my phone but the
 app seems to think there is nothing at all on my phone...Also the app seems to take a rediculous amount of RAM as well as making my CPU run at 90%. As soon as I closed the app my cpu went back down to like 15%

<h2>            Someone using my email account&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I occasionally receive emails at my address for a person who is not me.&nbsp; I've received emails such as iTunes order receipts and various others for a person who appears to have the same last name as me.&nbsp; My email address has my last name in it, but when I
 created my outlook.com address the email address was available and I didn't get any error messages warning me that the address was already taken.&nbsp; I don't know if this person is accessing my account, or if he/she is unknowingly entering my email address?&nbsp;
 This whole thing is quite confusing to me.&nbsp; As long as I've been alive, I haven't come across two of the same email addresses.&nbsp; I thought that it was not possible.&nbsp; Am I right or am I wrong?&nbsp; Does anyone know of anything I can do to try to get to the bottom
 of this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            Hi Mike,<br />
<br />
We're sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. Yes, you are correct it is impossible for two people to have exactly the same e-mail address.<br />
<br />
It is possible that the e-mail address is owned by someone in the past. Then that e-mail address became inactive, got deleted from the server and later became available for sign up. It happened that you've signed up using exactly the same e-mail address. So

    <title>Report - expression too long - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacquesriopel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Report - expression too long</h2>
                    <p>In a report, I had a field expression like so: (VraiFaux is French for IIf)</p>
<p>=VraiFaux(Somme([Nombre_Km]*54)/100+Somme([Montant_fixe]*54/47)+Somme([Montant_stationnement_etc])&lt;15 AND Somme([Nombre_Km]*54)/100+Somme([Montant_fixe]*54/47)+Somme([Montant_stationnement_etc])&gt;0<br />
,15,Somme([Nombre_Km]*54/100)+Somme([Montant_fixe]*54/47)+Somme([Montant_stationnement_etc]))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, if the calculated value was less than 15, then make it 15, else put in the calculated value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked fine, until I realized that I didn't want 0 to be rounded up to 15.&nbsp; When I tried to correct for this by changing the expression to
</p>
<p>=VraiFaux(Somme([Nombre_Km]*54)/100+Somme([Montant_fixe]*54/47)+Somme([Montant_stationnement_etc])&lt;15 AND Somme([Nombre_Km]*54)/100+Somme([Montant_fixe]*54/47)+Somme([Montant_stationnement_etc])&gt;0<br />
,15,Somme([Nombre_Km]*54/100)+Somme([Montant_fixe]*54/47)+Somme([Montant_stationnement_etc]))</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got an error about how this was too long.&nbsp; I am not an Access expert, this is in the report field property sheet.&nbsp; I am not sure how to change my report so this does what I want.&nbsp; There is a bit of code in my project.</p>

            A User Defined Functions works exactly as any built in Function. You use it in expressions the same way you would use a built in function. You can use them within a calculated column in a query or in the Controlsource of a control on a form or report.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for those thoughts, Duane. &nbsp;When I was young, I remember writing FORTRAN code that would call functions or subroutines, passing parameters. &nbsp;I expect we are talking about the same concept here, where I would write a function called "myfunction", say,
 and define it as having some parameters, then in my report field code, replace parts of what I have there with the function name and parameter values. &nbsp;Am I close?</p>

</p><p>In the VBE (which is the window that opens when you choose View Code) you would use Insert Module icon (second from the Left on the Icon bar) and select to insert a Procedure. Make it a Function and it will place the stub (first and last lines) in the Module.
 Then you put your code in. And yes that's how you would use it in the report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>oohh!! &nbsp;this is getting exciting! &nbsp;I followed your instructions, ending up with the below:</p>
<p>Option Compare Database<br />
Public Function FudgeFor15(NombreKm, Montantfixe, MontantStationementEtc)<br />
Dim NombreKm As Long<br />
Dim Montantfixe As Long<br />
Dim MontantStationementEtc As Long<br />
FudgeFor15 = IIf(Sum([NombreKm] * 54) / 100 + Sum([Montantfixe] * 54 / 47) + Sum([Montantstationnementetc]) &lt; 15, 15, Sum(Round([NombreKm] * 54 / 100, 2)) + Sum(Round([Montantfixe] * 54 / 47, 2)) + Sum([Montantstationnementetc]))<br />
End Function</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid to try it!</p>

    <title>Lower level directory access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lower level directory access</h2>
                    I stored a file in a lower level directory.&nbsp; I can use file explorer to find it, click it, and open it.&nbsp; But I can't use Excel or Word to find the directory.&nbsp; For example, in the path /my documents/dir1/dir2, I can only see dir 1.&nbsp; Dir 2 does not show
 up in word or excell.&nbsp; Is there a parameter somewhere I can tweek to get this drill down access?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>Not possible as is but in fact I lke storing in sub-folders for organization and end up using File Explorer to open the folders.&nbsp; It is a little extra work but for me it is easier in the final analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would be a great tweak for <a href="http://www.tweaks2k2.com/portal/staticpages/index.php?page=20050224182009983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TWEAKS2K2</a>.&nbsp; You should drop CTitanic a note asking for the tweak.</p>

<p>You don't need to change anything ... I understood you clearly.&nbsp; You had an excellent description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure if CTitanic can or will make a tweak lkike that but suggestions is how he decides what is next to add.&nbsp; He has an awesome program with so many tweaks that have made peoples lives a lot easier.&nbsp; Who knows, your suggestion just might
 be the next "tweak".</p>

<h2>            Locked out of email Account I use for my small business</h2>
                    <p>I've been locked out my email account, as I forgot my password, I can't get a code sent to my phone as it's a old number, I need to get back into it as It's my business account.</p>
<p>Ive filled in the account verification form over and over but get the same reply of not enough relevant information has been delivered,</p>
<p>i desperately need to access it again as all my work correspondence is stored there, I can't seem to speak to a person it's like Microsoft don't care and no matter how many times I fill in the form it keeps saying the same thing and I'm going around in circles.</p>
<p>Fed up of the lack of help available from Microsoft and my business will be affected if I'm unable to get back in.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me please?</p>
