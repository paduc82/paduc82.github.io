    <title>Unable to interlink multiple Excel files, when 10-30 excel files are - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to interlink multiple Excel files, when 10-30 excel files are opened together at the same time.</h2>
                    <p>well i believe that's what work needs to be done in most of the huge offices.</p>
<p>our staffs needs to open excel files interlinked with formulas. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And to fix this, we have to open up the 1st file, wait for it to open before opening the 2nd file, and wait for the 2nd file to open before opening the 3rd, and wait for the 3rd file to open before opening the 4th file, and so forth. so each of the files
 can be interlinked, and formulas can be link, AND sheets to be copied and moved to the maybe 27th excel file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try to select all of the files in the folder e.g 10 files. The excel will open up 10 files and its all independent, where non of them are able to interlink each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has a fix for this, will be great help.</p>
<p>Saving hundreds of hours opening the excel files one by one.</p>

    <title>GPS problem - Nokia N95 8GB - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            GPS problem - Nokia N95 8GB</h2>
                    Hi everybody!<br />
I bought some days ago a Nokia N95 8GB but it seems that the phone doesn't manage to connect to the satellites to retrieve my position. It happens both with Nokia Maps and with Garmin MobileXT.<br />
The maximum number of satellites which my N95 8GB connected to has been 4 and it took about 20 minutes to find them. Unfortunately, then it lost their signal.<br />
The firmware version is 15.0.015 (11-12-07) and it is the last version for the brand TIM N95 8GB which I own.<br />
Does anyone know how can I solve this problem? Is it due to the firmware version of my phone?<br />
Thanks in advance.

            Hi cavajuolo<br />
<br />
Yo don't say whether network connection in Nokia Maps application is set to "As needed" rather than "Never" which allows Assisted GPS feature to work for a faster positional fix.<br />
<br />
As the antenna for the internal GPS is situated under the "#" key reception can be poor if AGPS feature cannot be utilized.

            Network connecion is set to "Never". Do you think I should set it to "As needed"?<br />
What I don't understand is... which network? The GMS one? I would like to know if it is something to pay or not...

            Hi cavajuolo<br />
<br />
The defined access point needs to be a GPRS connection to access "supl.nokia.com" for AGPS feature although a WLAN connection would suffice to download greater map detail.<br />
Yes as 2-5kb of data would be downloaded for a positional fix there is a cost element in cents.

            I'll try to create an ad hoc wi-fi connecion with my notebook to let the phone access to the Internet and then I'll post the result..<br />
Anyway, I can't always connect to the Internet (for example when I'm not at home), so I can't however solve the problem in that way!<br />
<br />
Edit: I really don'w know... When I select the wi-fi connection, after writing the WPA key the phone restart itself...<br />

            Well I managed to connect through a WLAN (but using no WPA key) and the phone connected to the satellites in a pair of minutes!<br />
So the problem is due to a lack of Internet connection?<br />
It is clear, however, that I cannot always allow an Internet connection because, when I'm not at home, I should use the WAP/GPRS connection which costs a lot.. Don't you think?<br />
However, what's the volume of the data downloaded by Nokia Maps? Is it really only 2-5kb?

            Hi cavajuolo<br />
<br />
The figure 2-5kb refers <b>only</b> to establishing a positional fix <b>not</b> of course to downloaded greater map detail. My apologies if I gave you this impression.

            Don't worry scoobyman! Even better, thanks for your help...<br />
Let's see whether I have understood or not :P<br />
I have downloaded the maps using Nokia Map Loader, so I do not need to download them while using Nokia Maps. In this case I need only to download the 2-5kb of the positional fix?

<br />
If you need to search for an address then <b>more</b> detail may need to be downloaded, but you could also use WLAN if available instead of Network connection as active connection to carry out "search" and avoid download data GPRS costs.

    <title>Cannot activate Office Professional Plus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elijah quinn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot activate Office Professional Plus</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I purchased a digital version of Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student from evaluesoftware.com (it was on sale, and all I needed was Word and Powerpoint), as the one-month trial that came with my laptop was about to expire. I received an email back from them saying
 that they were out of stock of Home &amp; Student and instead said "...please accept Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus at no additional cost." I entered the product key included, and it seemed to reinstall Office, and the notification went away (this was
 about January 17-18th of this year).</p>
<p>Just a few hours ago, today, I restarted my computer and opened Windows to find that my subscription was apparently expiring March 7th. I reentered my product key in the renewal box, but nothing happens. syncing with my Microsoft account does nothing, and
 somehow it seems to have not registered my key, only giving me a few-week trial.</p>
<p>Is there any way around this? Do I need to uninstall Office and reinstall it, using the 64-bit version instead of the 32 (my laptop is 64-bit)? I cannot figure it out. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

                    All mail folders except Inbox are left empty using hotmail connector on Windows Mobile 6.5! Is there a way to fix this?

            It's not a problem with Hotmail Connector but ActiveSync which is synchronize only Inbox folder. It's not even sync. subfolders. It's a big pain for lot of users.<br />
<br />
Only way it's to use a 3rd party applications to do it like: <a href="http://www.chapura.com/pocketcopy.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>I tried to run the Stand Alone System Sweeper on a Windows XP Pro system.&nbsp; When it boot it tells me the definitions are out of date even though I created the disk on the same day.&nbsp; When I tried to download the defnitions, the download fails without reason.&nbsp;
 When I tried to install the definitions on the CD I get an error code: 0x8050800c.&nbsp; I tried the Windows Defender solution for this problem but all the S5 entries in the profiles already have ProfileImagePath entries.</p>
<p>Any one know what else might be going on here?</p>

            I've been playing with this in a couple of virtual machines for the last couple of days.&nbsp; What I'm seeing is that this error, 0x8050800c, has been showing up when I am out of memory in the virtual machine.<br />
<br />
The MSSS tool requires 768 MB of RAM on the machine.&nbsp; Where my virtual machine is configured for only 512 MB, the tool initially fails to load definitions (may get this error on startup), or shows a definitions date of 2006 and fails to update from Internet
 or local files with this error code.<br />
<br />
First suggestion, if you only have 512 MB of RAM, get more.&nbsp; While 512 is certainly acceptable for Windows XP, the MSSS tool actually includes &amp; boots from Windows PE, a stripped-down version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Second suggestion, if you are really intent on doing this, is to read up on WinPE, esp. WinPEShl.ini and wpeutil.exe.&nbsp; I've found that through the combination of replacing MSSS's default shell with a command prompt, on a low-memory system I can boot, then enable
 a pagefile pointed to the local hard drive, then run MSSS (sometimes needing to run it twice to get the pagefile written), then I can get the system scanned.&nbsp; I've tried this down to 512 MB but haven't tried with any less RAM than that.<br />
<br />
Be aware, that after booting the .WIM file that hosts MSSS's WinPE, the tool will scan to find the definitions file and a filelistxx.dll file from _outside_ of the WIM.&nbsp; If you get into more advanced setup, like multiple WinPE images on a single thumb drive,
 be aware you'll need to grab these files from outside of the WIM and store those on the root of the flash drive, or MSSS will crash on startup.

            I was seeing this on a couple older machines, I upgraded the ram in them, and boom! The scanner was off and running with no problem.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the great information!<br />

    <title>Missing text box labels on Motorola Q9M - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Missing text box labels on Motorola Q9M</h2>
                    
<p>I am on my second Q9M from VerizonWireless in as many weeks. The problem I'm having is that most setup menus contain text boxes, or check boxes that have no corresponding labels. So I have no idea what text I'm supposed
 to place in the box. Verizon tech support suggested a master reset when I called the first time, which did work, but only momentarily. Anybody else experiencing the same problem?</p>

<p>I'm sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but I wasn't notified that someone had replied. Anyway, through the process of elimination I was able to figure out what the problem was. On my mini SD card I had stored
 the Microsoft background named "America" which I used on my previous WM5 Treo. When I got the Q9m, I used it, and it worked fine. So, last night I changed it to one of the preloaded backgrounds that came with the Q9m, and all of the text box labels returned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never imagined that a WM5 theme would have such a profound effect on a WM6 device, particularly since it&nbsp;never&nbsp;warned that the file was not compatible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do appreciate your interest in helping me find a resolution to my problem, especially since you were the only person on the forum that responded.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Need help with getting pictures from my camera to the computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp; I am totally confused and not Tech savy at all. I have spent the last three hours trying to figure how to get my photos from an older camera Canon PowerShot SX150<em> IS</em> camera.&nbsp; I do not have a smart phone and my grandchildren are young, but probably
 could figure this out for me.&nbsp; I am guessing I need to ask a teen to help me, but I would like to do tonight and take advantage of an offer for inexpensive photos.&nbsp; Guess I will have to drive to the store's machines that have no problem with my camera card.</p>
<p>Thanks if you can help me with this.</p>

<h2>            Sharing Contacts between Tenants</h2>

<p>
</p><p>I have referred to post on calendar sharing which can be altered under the O365 Admin -&gt; Organizational settings. However, is there a possibility to share the GAL between tenants?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We currently have O365 BP License with tenant for each domains. As they are limited (300 units for each domain), we have segregated the tenants and now looking into see if we can inter-connect each other to share its GAL's. is this feasible?</p>

 save and be available to me forever (or until I delete it?)

            <p>The Developer tab is not displayed by default.&nbsp; You must enable it as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Word 2007: Office Button | Word Options | Popular: Check the box for "Show Developer tab in the Ribbon."
</li><li>Word 2010: File | Options | Customize Ribbon: Check the box for the Developer tab in the list on the right.</li></ul>
<p>While it is always best to figure out what add-in is preventing the Normal template from being saved, until you do (or if the add-in is one that cannot conveniently be removed), there is a quick workaround to ensure that changes are saved: you can make the
 changes directly in Normal.dotm, as follows:</p>
<p>In Word, press Alt+F11; the Visual Basic Editor opens. Press Ctrl+G to activate the Immediate window. In that window, type<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NormalTemplate.OpenAsDocument<br />
<br />
and press Enter. Normal opens, but note that it may not be on top of all windows. You can close the Visual Basic Editor. Make the desired changes to the Normal file, and then save and close it. If the changes you have made have not been recognized as changes
 (the Undo button is not activated), press Spacebar, then Backspace to "dirty" the file, thus ensuring that the template will actually be saved.

            It depends on where you are saving the AutoText. Documents cannot hold AudoText. AFAIK Word won't let you even try to save in a document.<br />
<br />
The default save location is normal.dotm.<br />
<br />
After you save your AutoText are you closing the document or closing Word? If the latter, when you save the changes to normal.dotm, your AutoText should be saved. This tels me that perhaps you are not being allowed to save normal.dotm.<br />
<br />
You can see other threads on that problem by looking for "save defaults."<br />
<br />
If you have been closing Word, try just closing your document (under the File tab). Then see if in another document in that Word session your AT is available. If it is, the problem is with saving changes to normal.dotm. If this is the problem you probably also
 can't save changes to your default font or styles.<br />
<br />
The usual block for that is a poorly written Add-In. Try disabling all of your Add-Ins using the two buttons on the
<span><a href="http://addbalance.com/word/developertab.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Developer Tab</a></span>.The Add-In that seems to have been causing the most trouble lately has been one to assist with Blue-Tooth. If you find that disabling all of your Add-ins lets
 you save your AutoText, then go through disabling them one at a time until you find the one that is causing this. Once you do, decide whether you really need it; if you do need it, contact whoever wrote it and complain.<br />

<h2>            Latest Skype Mac still not working on High Sierra 10.13.6</h2>
                    I have gone through many older posts and the same issue is still happening.<br />
<br />
<strong>"After clicking Skype app, the app icon will bounce for a few seconds on dock and then nothing happens."</strong><br />
<br />
Please give a hand on this since the classic Skype will be discontinued soon and Skype Devs should really work on this.<br />
<br />
For now, the classic Skype is the only way that I can access. Is there any solution for the above issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Hello Yeong. I am a fellow Community member here to help. I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this difficulty. I know it is very frustrating.<br /><br />As you well know, the new Skype is lacking many of the features and functionality of classic Skype and is full of bugs.<br /><br />While there is not yet in ETA, it is expected that in the near future Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for Skype that will add features and functionality and address any known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. This has made it so that users such as yourself no longer have a deadline of September 1st to begin using the new Skype. You are free to continue using the classic Skype for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />I hope this information helps you. Please let me know if I can offer any further assistance, I'm happy to help in any way that I can.

            I would just stick with Skype Classic for the time being since there are some issues with it at the moment. 
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />If you still want to try Skype 8 again, do the following:
<br />
<br />Delete Shared and Config xml files:
<br />
<br />    Press Command+Shift+G at the same time and the Go to the folder will show.
<br />    Type ~/Library/Application Support
<br />    Open the Skype folder
<br />    Look for shared.xml then drag it to the trash
<br />    Open the folder with your Skype Name and drag config.xml to the trash as well.
<br />
<br /> Rename Skype Folder:
<br />
<br />    Press Command+Shift+G at the same time and the
<br />    Go to the folder will show.
<br />    Type ~/Library/Application Support
<br />    Search for Skype and rename it to SkypeOld
<br />
<br />Open the Finder &gt; Applications
<br />Right click Skype
<br />Click Move to Trash
<br />
<br />Restart your Mac again.
<br />Log on to <a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.skype.com</a>
<br />Click on Downloads
<br />Click on the dropdown from the blue button:
<br />
<br />Install Skype then check if its working again.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I will help you to stop getting the Outlook 2003 updates.</p>
<p>But first, can I know which Office suite are you using or Outlook 2003 is installed as a standalone product?</p>
<p>Also do you use any other Office application apart from Outlook?</p>
<p>If Outlook is part of Office 2003 installation then, you may have to remove Outlook component from Office installation in order to stop receiving the update.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span> The steps all applies to Office 2003 and Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Outlook 2003 is installed as a standalone program then, you may right click on it and uninstall it from Programs and Features.</p>

<p>Reply with results to help you better.</p>

<h2>            Manual order of mail folders reset to alphabetical after restart of Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Dear all, </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>in Outlook in Office 365 I can sort my mail folders as I like (see: http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2012/12/05/reorder-your-folders-any-way-you-like-em.aspx). Unfortunately, my manual ordering is reset to alphabetical order when I restart
 Outlook. That is, all my manual folder sorting labour is destroyed when I close Outlook. Does anyone else have this problem? Is there a fix? My mail accounts are IMAP-accounts.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sebastian</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hello Sebastian,<br />
<br />
From your description, I understand that mail folder sorting is not retained when Outlook is closed.
<br />
<br />
I will assist you to resolve this issue. Provide more information for better assistance:<br />
<br />
1) How many email accounts are configured in Outlook? If multiple, is sorting not retained for all the accounts?<br />
2) How did you sort the folders? Is it selecting the folder and click on <b>Move Up</b> or
<b>Move Down</b>?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Try the following methods and verify the result:<br />
<b><br />
Method 1<br />
</b><br />
Start Outlook through the following command and verify the result:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">* Hold
<b>Windows key</b> + <b>R</b>.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the <b>Open</b> box, and then press Enter:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Outlook.exe /resetnavpane<br />
<br />
Note: There is space between Outlook and /</span></p>
<p>
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2<br />
<br />
</span></b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If issue still persists, create new profile, sort the mail folders and verify the result:
<br />
Follow below mentioned instructions to create new profile:<br />
<br />
Go to <b>Control Panel</b> and click on <b>Mail </b>icon as specified above.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click <b>Add </b>
and inn the <b>Profile Name box</b>, type the name that you want to use for the new email profile, and then click
<b>OK</b>.</span></li><li><span>Click <b>Next</b> after Outlook finds your account information.<br />
Note: You may also select <b>Manually configure server settings or additional server types</b> to manually configure the email account.</span></li><li><span>After Outlook finishes the setup for your account.</span></li><li><span>Click <b>Finish</b> to finish the setup for your email account.</span></li><li><span>Open <b>Control Panel</b>, and then open the
<b>Mail</b> item for Outlook 2013.</span></li><li><span>Click <b>Always use this profile</b>, select the new profile that you created and then click<b> OK</b> and then try starting Outlook and verify the result.</span></li></ul>
<p>

Thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            Macro to Encrypt multiple word documents using specific passwords per file</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to do a mail merge that will:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) Create individual letters per person (from a template),&nbsp;</div>
<div>2) Save these letters as individual word documents</div>
<div>3) Encrypt these documents with passwords (different per individual letter) saved in same source file as mail merge data source</div>
<div>4) Attach this to an email together with another attachment which is the exact same for each person/email.</div>
<div>5) Send out these emails to each specific member.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My source file (.xlsx) contains all the required data i.e:</div>
<div>Firstname</div>
<div>Surname</div>
<div>Letter Fields</div>
<div>Encrypt Key</div>
<div>Email Address</div>
<div><br />

<p>I have the same issue...&nbsp; Outlook 2010 shows the text in every column truncated by one character when I search using the Advanced Find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is consistent and always occurs when I do an Advanced Search of&nbsp;folders in a personal mail folder.&nbsp; The folders are fairly large with subfolders.</p>
<p>Typically the search is only restricted to those mailitems sent in, say, the last week.</p>
<p>Also, often&nbsp;the search results are not restricted to the folders selected and the results return items from all folders, including the deleted items folder.</p>
<p>I have installed Windows Search 4 - maybe this is a problem?</p>
<p>Any answer to fix this would be great!</p>

Only thanks to DCG in that thread was I able to resolve the issue!!!</p>
<p>In short...</p>
<p>If using Outlook 2010, create new PST files and then drag and drop the top level folders from the old PST file to the new PST file. Then remove the old PST (right click pst folder name... select Close)<br />
Allow Outlook time to index the new PST file items and then perform Search options using ALL... Should see that there are no more missing last characters!!!<br />
<br />
Amazing... ALL these threads and blogs to find out that it's all just a COMPATIBILITY issue!!!</p>
<p>Out with the old!</p>
<p>In with the new!</p>

            No. Napster uses Windows Media Audio (Or WMA) files with Windows Media Digital Rights Management protection (Otherwise known as DRM protection). WMA files are supported by the phone but not the DRM protection so the music files will likely not work.<br />

            Hi yes you can use Napter with your N95. I do, but you must make sure when you plug the USB lead in you set the phone to Media Player mode. I've got Napster To Go, you need this so you don,t keep paying for tracks, and a 2GB card, so I just keep filling
 it up with music.

            My N95 has stopped allowing the transfer of To Go tracks from Napster to the phone for some reason. Napster are their usual unhelpful selves and say that the device is not suported - when I know very well that it is/was.<br />

<p>I think I must be in the New Skype version now, as a panel came up to ask if I wanted to update, but I think I was on the Windows 10 one anyway from since I started using Windows 10, as Skype all changed then with the look of the panel opened and everything.
 There is only my eldest son shown in my Contacts list now who is in SA. My sister in UK used to be showing but she's disappeared now. There is the Test person there of course. I haven't used Skype for a long while, so don't even know how my camera etc works
 with it now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected for it to Use My Address Book but it put the ones from my Hotmail which I don't really use, only check it. And, as I said, they are greyed out. I want to remove those but there's nothing there to do it. I changed it back to Don't Use My Address
 Book but it didn't make any difference, so I altered it back again. I had two or three friends in the list before who are on Face Book, one is in the UK. These are people that I have met. They have disappeared for some reason and they even had photos at the
 side of their name. I put my sister's name into the Search and it brought a few but when I clicked to View Profile it's not her and it said these people weren't on my contact list, which they wouldn't be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I clicked on Classic version it was giving me a video about how to move round but it didn't bear any relation to what I wanted to know. Same thing when I clicked on the New Skype except no video. Can't understand the info as things aren't always in
 the place that they say. I'd like to have the old one back, as most people would just from reading on forums. Not many people like the new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't even know where to go now to show my status, as you used to right-click on the icon on the Task Bar I think and it brought the list up. I did manage to accidentally find it once but can't remember how.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Try clearing all paired devices from your parrot, it will only allow 5 paired devices and will not allow any more untill you delete previous phones. Trying resetting your phone by removing the battery, then try pairing again, this phone should work ok with
 the software version 4.20</p>

<h2>            Nokia C3-01 for dummies</h2>
                    
<p>I need help, I've tried several times to deactivate any kind of internet connection (gprs and WAP) of that phone..&nbsp; But anytime it connect to the web and I have to pay.</p>
<p>I want to use the phone ONLY with wlan connection, how can I be sure that it will not use sim connection?</p>
<p>Around forums I read something about background process of facebook or mail, what are them? How can I deactivate everything?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need a dummies guide for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank u</p>

<p>LOL! what you (&amp; I) need is a FULL comprehensive instruction book like you always got with a new phone!</p>
<p>Ive been playing about with mine &amp; have had a lot of help from folk here ( although they are keeping quiet about how THEY know!) Anyway I have managed to connect by wifi ( Im assuming thats just another word for wlan?) without even a sim card in the phone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Just open your internet connection ( mine is called orange world but that may be different if you aint with orange!) &amp; it should ask you how you want to connect..</p>
<p>&nbsp;Are you deffo within a wifi enabled zone?</p>
