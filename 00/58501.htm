                    <p>I have just tried to upgrade my windows 7 home to windows 10 home for the fourth time.&nbsp; Each time it gets to what I assume is it's 1st reboot, at which time my computer starts to reboot and then proceeds to just stop.&nbsp; I get the nice windows 10 boot screen,
 but the little dots stop moving, and my computer just freezes.&nbsp; After I finally get my computer restarted it needs to restore windows 7, and then tells me that my update for windows 10 failed.&nbsp; It gives me error code C1900101-30017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This last try it also gave me information that it failed during the "FIRST_BOOT" phase with an error during BOOT operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be welcome.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to restore a Lost or deleted program&#63;</h2>
                    Can anyone help me solve my problem? I have lost one of my programs I need somewhere in my one computer folder that I have deleted. When I try to redownload this program , I cant access the new program.&nbsp; What can I do to get rid of or find my origional
 program.

<p>If all you did was delete a folder (and you didn't actually uninstall the program), it may be possible to recover.</p>
<p>First, check the Recycle Bin to see if it is there - if so restore it and the problem is solved.</p>
<div>
<p><span>If you have Vista Business, Vista Ultimate, or Vista Enterprise you may be in luck.&nbsp; They have what is known as Shadow
 Copies which are saves of deleted or modified files which can be retrieved in case the changes/deletions were done in error.&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with

<br />
If you have Vista Basic or Vista Premium, Shadow Copies is not available; however, there's an alternative that's free and mirrors the functionality of Shadow Copies called Shadow Explorer.</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Though it won't help you this time, it could very well save you in case this happens again.<br />
<br />
In case this doesn't work (not all files are available through Shadow Copies - it occurs periodically), here are some additional free recovery programs which might help:<br />
<br />
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/system/fwdatarecovery.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/system/fwdatarecovery.html</span></span></a><span>(try
 Recuva ONLY - do not purchase any products that aren’t free – here or in any of the other links – I’m just suggesting the FREE options and have had problems with some of the commercial ones)</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/diskdigger.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/diskdigger.html</span></span></a><span>(try
 this second - if it doesn’t work either chances of recovery are very slim but you can try the other options if you wish)<br />

<p><span>Files aren't actually deleted until they are overwritten (though they're no longer available through conventional methods).&nbsp; If you decide to try these recovery
 programs, you should stop using your hard drive <strong>immediately</strong> so you don't overwrite the data you are trying to recover.&nbsp; Slave it to another PC and run the recovery from that PC.&nbsp; Even now you may have permanently lost some of them if you're
 using that same PC.&nbsp; If you can't do that (slave to another PC), you run the risk of overwriting the data with every action you do on the PC (but you still may be able to recover some or most or even all of the files - it's a matter of luck).<br />
<br />
Only you can decide if the data is important enough to take the PC to a data recovery expert to recover the files (they will have better programs and equipment to do so than any of us do and than I provided above).&nbsp; Do NOT go to Geek Squad or any of those big
 store centers - they mostly don't know what they're doing - take it to a data recovery expert.&nbsp; It will cost quite a bit and they usually offer no guarantees.&nbsp; The decision is yours.</span></p>
<p><span>==============================================================================================================================</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then we need to refocus on getting rid of the original program (whatever of it still remains).&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>Try using Revo</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/revo-uninstaller/revouninstaller.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/revo-uninstaller/revouninstaller.html</span></a><span>
 to do the uninstallation instead of using Vista’s uninstall function.<span>&nbsp;</span>This often works when Vista doesn’t (and even does a better job).</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>Error 577 for BattlEye anti-cheat - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> synyst3r1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 577 for BattlEye anti-cheat</h2>
                    <p>BattlEye anti-cheat works on first boot of Windows 10 install or update. If you restart after the update it has the 577 error again. What changes from first boot to a restart? Error 577 is usually to do with a file being unsigned, but if you enable test
 signing BattlEye has a different error saying test signing isn't supported because people use that for hacks. I have the most recent insider build of Windows 10 14361 and I just built this PC yesterday. The game works on my old PC with the same version of
 windows. I've tried sfc scan, dism, running as admin, replacing BattlEye files from my other pc and links from people online, I've tried updating all drivers, reinstalling windows, everything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted here to see if anyone has any other way of troubleshooting this issue. I've asked on the game forums and it's always the same answer that doesn't work. It seems to be a hardware or driver issue because my other computer works, but idk what to do
 to troubleshoot and find the issue. I'm having small issues with other games like CSGO takes a long time to launch it stays on a black screen for over a minute.</p>

<h2>            May I change the 0 drive to 1 and the 1 drive to 0&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using Windows 7 Home Premium I have the 0 drive as a data drive and the 1 drive contains the OS. On a normal boot I get a flash message (upper left corner) that states "Boot from CD".&nbsp;Also, when I do Set Up the drive on top of the list is the data drive.
 If I select the second drive from the top of the list (the 1 drive) the flash message is gone.&nbsp;Is there some way to make the 1 drive move to the top of this list? This should make the flash message go away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not a major problem&nbsp;at this time so I am reluctant to make any changes that I can not reverse.</p>

            <p>Yes, power down the computer, remove the SATA cable from the 1st drive, then remove the other SATA cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next connect the cable&nbsp;you removed from 1st drive and connect it&nbsp;to the 2nd drive. Then connect the remaining SATA cable.</p>

                    in XP, there is a way to check for bad disk blocks using the GUI.<br />
not so in windows 8.<br />
workaround is to create a shortcut to c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe which runs as administrator, and you have to run
<br />
chkdsk c: /f /r<br />
(tell it y)<br />
shutdown -f -r -t 0<br />
(to restart forced)<br />

            <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure you know you can automate your suggestion - but just in case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy/paste all commands in Notepad and save the file with a .bat extension</li><li>Create a shortcut to that batch file</li><li>Edit&nbsp;the properties of the shortcut and using the Advanced button check&nbsp;the Run As Admin option</li></ul>
<p>An alternative is CheckDiskGUI than you can download from <a href="http://www.wieldraaijer.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.wieldraaijer.nl/</a>&nbsp;(never installed nor used).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

            is there some special way of accessing other than through bringing up windows explorer and right clicking on c: and picking properties and then clicking on tools tab, check now, and then you are supposed to turn on the missing checkbox "scan for and attempt
 recovery of bad sectors"? because that is where I went.<br />
<br />
I did say using the GUI. not commands. there was nothing related to scanning for and attempting recovery of bad sectors like there was in XP. it's missing in windows 8.
<br />
<br />
I did look in a cmd shell to see if there was a CheckDiskGUI.exe like you talked about, but it does not exist. what exactly are you talking about? is CheckDiskGUI some sort of variable name or window class name in the microsoft windows code base? it looks like
 a variable name or function name without the perens, so I am left guessing as a windows application developer.<br />
<br />

<p>I did understand what you were looking for and that you didn't want to go manually through all&nbsp;the steps (Explorer / Right-click on C: / Properties / Tools tab...) to get access to the Windows&nbsp;Error checking functionnality.<br />
</p>
<p>I am not sure there is a way to create a kind of shortcut to do this on your behalf. Hence my suggestion for you to download the CheckDiskGUI utility developped by Emiel - again I've never used it. CheckDiskGUI is&nbsp;available&nbsp;for download
<a href="http://www.wieldraaijer.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;as I wrote in my first reply.</p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure what you exactly mean with "fixing bad disk blocks" but I would encourage you to read the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/05/09/redesigning-chkdsk-and-the-new-ntfs-health-model.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MSDN Blog / Redesigning chkdsk and the new NTFS health model</a> and <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/6221-chkdsk-check-drive-errors-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EigthForums / CHKDSK - Check a Drive for Errors in Windows 8</a> articles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows 8 disk utilities (Error Checking and ChkDsk) are designed to identify and fix disk errors. Chkdsk /R&nbsp;would for example locate bad sectors and recovers readable information - why would it do that without marking those sectors as bad?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you believe there is a bug in those utilities or they're missing some functionnalities feel free to contact Microsoft support as there is nothing this community of users can do with regard to product fix or improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            the point is, there *used* to be a way to do the equivalent of chkdsk /r in the GUI of windows XP, but in windows 8 this GUI method was taken away. I am trying with this bug report to bring it back. telling me to do it with chkdsk /r I know about isn't
 helping the problem.<br />
<br />
average joe is going to assume that this new insufficient GUI method is going to fix all their problems.<br />
<br />
so which is better, fixing the root of the problem, or getting a thousand support engineers to tell people to use chkdsk /r when people are scared to use the command shell? and by the way, they don't even know how to make an elevated cmd shell because from
 what I have seen, one isn't built into windows or it's near impossible to get to.<br />
<br />
it's easier on the users to simply fix the problem. I hope microsoft is out there for their customers.&nbsp; bit rot is a nasty problem that happens to 99.9999% of us, and it forces us to reinstall windows. would be MUCH nicer if I could get this through to a microsoft
 software developer to fix the problem. this is what I was aiming for. this *is* the official bug reporting area for windows 8 that last time I checked.<br />

<h2>            HDMI port not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I installed an update this morning and now my HDMI port doesn't appear to be working. I've used the VGA connection to the monitor so it's not the monitor, but I can't eliminate that it's not the HDMI cord, but I doubt it is.</p>
<p>Can you please advise how I reverse the Windows Update - I need the monitor to do my work.</p>
<p>

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />If what you want is uninstall the update refer to this article.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/235474/how-to-roll-back-builds-and-uninstall-updates-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/235474/how-to-roll-ba...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Windows Updates are automatic, maybe in some point you're gonna need to face the HDMI problem and find out what's causing it, maybe reinstalling your video drivers from device manager could work.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            <p>Hi Margaret,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.<br />
We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the method below and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Download latest drivers</strong></p>
<p>Since the driver you currently have is not compatible with Windows 10 OS, I suggest you to download the driver which will be compatible for Windows 10 from the manufacturer’s website and check if it is Compatible with Windows 10 from the link below</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upgrade your device drivers and check </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t get the driver that is compatible for Windows 10, you can download the driver that is compatible with Windows 8.1 OS and can make it run in Windows 10 OS with Compatibility mode.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Compatibility mode</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please read through the suggestion by <strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> from the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/graphics-card-not-compatible-with-windows-10/5e3fcc1a-9654-42ac-8bd8-28c3749f94eb?auth=1"><strong>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/graphics-card-not-compatible-with-windows-10/5e3fcc1a-9654-42ac-8bd8-28c3749f94eb?auth=1</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Right-click on the game setup file and click on
<strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Click on the <strong>‘compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box
<strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows 10 operating system from the drop down menu.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span> Click on <strong>‘Apply’</strong> and click
<strong>‘OK’</strong> and run the file to install it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <p>I have 2 Toshiba Sattellites and it seems my Windows 8 is gone from both around the same time. I have the key codes but not the disks. One is black screen saying recovery media failed and this one I am using, but it keeps doing hundreds of updates and restarting
 and doing it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way I can fix this without paying for another windows disk for both computers? Thanks if anyone can help</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are not able to boot the computer to the desktop. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur if the Windows&nbsp;system file corruption. Let’s work together to get this problem resolved.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would </span><span>suggest you to login to any other working computer and
<strong><span>create a new Windows 8 installation disk</span></strong>. Using that disk you can perform the troubleshooting methods given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the link to&nbsp;create the installation disk:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>After creating the Windows installation disk, I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong><span>Notes: </span></strong></em></p>
<p><em><span>1. Disconnect all the external devices.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>2. To&nbsp;boot the computer through&nbsp;Windows 8 installation disc, the computer must be configured to start from the DVD drive. For more information about how to configure the computer to start from the DVD drive, see the documentation that is included
 with the computer or contact the computer manufacturer.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. <em><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;
</span></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the laptop which shows an error: "<strong>Recovery Media failed</strong>" try the following
<strong>methods </strong><strong>1 &amp; 2</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the laptop which shows&nbsp;an error: "<strong>Installing Updates</strong>" try&nbsp;<strong>methods
</strong><strong>1 &amp; 3</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Perform an Automatic Repair</span></strong><span> through bootable Windows 8 installation disc.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so,&nbsp;follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Insert the Windows 8 installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b. After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong><span>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</span></strong>". Press any key.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d. Click<strong><span>on Repair your computer </span></strong>in the lower left corner.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>e. Select <strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong> from Choose an option screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>f. Click on <strong><span>Advanced options </span></strong>in Troubleshoot screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>g. Click <strong><span>Automatic Repair </span></strong>from Advanced Options screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>h. Next, choose the operating system by clicking on its button.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>i. Windows 8 will then look for problems on hard drive(s) and verify that all required files are intact.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I</span><span>f the issue still persist, then try method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the automatic repair doesn’t work, then&nbsp;try to <strong><span>rebuild the Windows boot sector</span></strong> from the Windows RE command prompt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so, follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Boot the computer using Windows 10 installation media.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. In the “<strong><span>Windows Setup</span></strong>” dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click “Next”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Click on “<strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong>” from the lower left corner.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. From the “Choose an option screen”, click on “<strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong>”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. In the “<strong><span>Advanced Options” screen</span></strong>, select “<strong><span>Command Prompt</span></strong>”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6. Now type the following commands at the Windows RE command prompt and press
<strong>E</strong><strong><span>nter </span></strong>after each command:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup</span></strong></p>

</p><p><strong><span>ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>bootrec /RebuildBcd</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>7. Restart the computer and&nbsp;check if you are able to boot the computer successfully.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 3:</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the automatic repair doesn’t work, then&nbsp;<strong>perform </strong>

<h2>            how can i set the drive for vss to use for the shadow copy &#34;index&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>VSS is being used by Acronis Backup software to backup&nbsp;the data files folder on the&nbsp;C Drive to the E Drive (external hard drive).</p>
<p>VSS is also used by the Concensus (Cloud) Backup software to backup the same data files folder on the C Drive to the "Cloud".</p>
<p>The backups occur at different times in the night.</p>
<p>If the external drive E is connected via USB the VSS stores its "index" file on the E Drive which creates timing errors because the external drive is much slower than the C drive.</p>
<p><strong><u>How can I tell VSS to disregard the E drive?&nbsp; Or, is there a setup of VSS to make the C drive the only drive that it can use?</u></strong></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Account&#58; How to change the Primary Account Alias&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear all, how to change the primary alias of my Microsoft Account? Supposedly, there is a button for this under [1] but regrettably this is not the case for me. See picture pasted below. As I need to change the primary alias to the other email address for
 some program benefits to work it is really important (and by now also time critical) for the alias to be changed. If someone from MS is reading this: yes, it is about the account I am posting from. And, yes, I want the address with ...@L... to be my primary
 account alias. Feel free to change :-)</p>

<h2>            Surface Book, system unstable since last update, restart not possible.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, is anybody else encountering stability issues on Surface Book? I think this annoying behavior occurs since the last major update. Internet via my access point (iPhone) is getting stuck. Then I try to restart as nothing else helps. Restarting then freezes,
 Windows returns a stop error.</p>

</p><p>Since you mentioned that you have issues with Bluetooth and system stability, here are the other options to troubleshoot your device:<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> Fix Bluetooth issue with Bluetooth troubleshooter<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *If you’re already running Windows 10 with Creators Update (Version 1703), use the Bluetooth troubleshooter to try to fix Bluetooth problems. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Step 1:</strong> Select the <strong>Start</strong> button, then select
<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp; &gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong>&nbsp; &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Step 2:</strong> Under <strong>Find and fix other problems</strong>, select
<strong>Bluetooth</strong> &gt; <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> To improve system stability, we suggest that you run the System File Checker (SFC) tool.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You can click this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> on how to fix certain errors using System File Checker (SFC) tool. <br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> In case that the file checker tool did not detect any errors, you can proceed on
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
how to use the DISM or System Update Readiness tool</a>. <br />
<br />
To know more about using the SFC and the DISM, you can check ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP)'s post

here</a>. <br />
<br />
After running the SFC and DISM, you may restart your device.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.<br />

<p>
</p><p>My sound icon says the sound is muted, but I did not mute it, when I try to unmute it it says; "Both the Windows Audio and the Windows Audio End Point Builder services must be running for audio to work correctly. Atleast one of these services isn't running"
 I have tried myself to fix the problem without any luck and also anytime I try to open the control panel the computer freezes.

<p>Thank you for posting back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Undoing the tweak might resolve this issue. The settings you have applied might have been affected by the recent Fornite update that causes the game to run erratically. I would also suggest checking for the latest graphics driver update from your hardware
 manufacturer website.</p>
