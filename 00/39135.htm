It may be worth a try to navigate to the folder where WLPG <br />

            <p>Hi Francis,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We&nbsp;realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with&nbsp;</span></span>Error 1603 when attempting to install CS4 Photoshop<span><span>.&nbsp;We will certainly help you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sticky notes from the previous version might be available on Windows.old folder. However, kindly understand that their may be a few applications which may not get installed along with the new upgrade therefore, you have to reinstall all those applications.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is always recommended to keep a back up of all&nbsp;your important&nbsp;files and folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, follow the steps below and see if it helps:</p>
<p>1. Press the <strong>File Explorer icon </strong>from the taskbar and click on
<strong>View </strong>tab.</p>
<p>2. Check the box for <strong>Hidden Items.</strong></p>
<p>3. Now, click on <strong>this PC </strong>and navigate the path: <strong>C:\Windows.old\Users\USERNAME\Local\Microsoft\Sticky Notes.</strong></p>
<p>4. The file should like <strong>stickyNotes.snt</strong>.</p>
<p>5. If it is not available in&nbsp;Windows.old folder. Then, there is no way to retrieve it. You may have to create new notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To search if your system has Sticky note and Snipping tool application, type Sticky notes or Snipping Tool in the search window and check if it displays the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results. We will be happy to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Runtime Error when using explorer.exe &#40;Windows Explorer&#41; on windows vista.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I have Windows Vista installed on an Acer Aspiere 5570Z, and often when browsing through files, copying or moving files or folders, I get a Runtime error message and all Windows Explorer (explorer.exe) windows close. It does not seem as if there is a pattern,
 such as an specific action that triggers this, although it happens most often when moving or copying files, or when during image preview mode, Windows tries to show a video. The full text of the message is the following: "Runtime Error! Program: C:\Windows\explorer.exe.
 This applicatoin has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application's support team for more information."<br />
<br />
So, I am now contacting the support team! Any suggestions! It is very annoying!

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, do a clean boot and see if the problem continues (NOTE: you will have limited functionality under a clean boot so if the problem only occurs occasionally, you may not want to try this option&nbsp;- it it happens every 10 minutes or so then
 give it a try).&nbsp; Here's the procedure: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929135?p=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929135?p=1</a>.&nbsp; Remember to set it back to normal mode when you are done.<br />
<br />
This can also occur with browser add-ons so try running your browser without any add-ons:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pcauthorities.com/how-to/turn-browser-add-ons-on-or-off-in-ie7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcauthorities.com/how-to/turn-browser-add-ons-on-or-off-in-ie7</a>&nbsp;and see
 if that helps.&nbsp; Close all other browser windows except the one with no add-ons&nbsp;and see what happens.&nbsp; It could be caused by an add-on that is corrupt or not functioning properly.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<span><br />
If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;explorer.exe (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

</p><p>Thank you. Thought that would be the response, but wanted to confirm. Your response is appreciated. As I don't expect Dell to ever release updated drivers for this older PC, what is the procedure for changing the reminders that Windows 10 is available and
 the "Get Windows 10" icon in the system tray?</p>

            <p>Yes, I have upgraded a 390 from Window 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>It didn't actually need special Dell drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I had was the NVidia video card was flagged as not compatible with</p>
<p>Windows 10It turns out that&nbsp; Win8 8 NVidia drivers work on Win10.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just installed the "generic" video card driver and Win10 upgrade went fine.</p>
<p>Then installed the Windows 8 video driver, and everything works fine.</p>

</p><p>I also have a Dell Precision 390 running Windows 10, but mine freezes/hangs randomly. The mouse pointer disappears, the screen freezes and the Caps Lock light no longer appears when I toggle the Caps Lock button on the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it is running normally, it is very fast and smooth, but the random hang thing is very, very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What graphics card do you have installed ?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Yashwanth,</p>
<p>in reply to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It does not seem to relate to a specific app although I have the impression that it is more likely to hang while running Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It happens about every second time the machine is booted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Same as 1 above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I have subsequently tried booting in Safe Mode with Networking. The workstation did not hang and after two days I concluded that the problem is not present in this mode. I noticed that in Safe Mode, the display driver is the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an NVIDIA Quadro &nbsp;K600 graphics card and I&nbsp;wondered&nbsp;if it might be related to the NVIDIA device driver. So, I have uninstalled the NVIDIA driver and installed the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter. The workstation has not hung since, which is nearly
 two weeks now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter is not ideal but for my workflow (mostly&nbsp;Visual Studio, Azure, IE)&nbsp;it is adequate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you would like any more information or if you have any comments regarding the display drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back with an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the problem lies with the malfunctioning Graphics card driver. &nbsp;Go to manufacturer website and try to download the latest Windows 10 Graphics card driver for your device and check if the same thing happens. You can search them using your device
 model number. Most probably it will fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case problem still persist, then try to install the legacy drivers (I.e. Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 Graphics card) to see if they make any difference.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Activation Error 0x8007007b still unresolved</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an asus P1801 AIO desktop which crashed months ago due to HDD failure. I bought&nbsp;a new hard disc and reinstalled windows using a borrowed CD installer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night, I had a virus attack which rendered me unable to boot into windows and I formatted the hard disc and reinstalled windows again using the same CD. I was told that the cdkey would be in Bios hence I reinstalled as per normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I tried activating WIndows, I got the error message. I've followed through the instructions almost everywhere online,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even followed from here :</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/windows-8-activation-error-0x8007007b/8fc02158-a7d5-4901-b831-6ea608910c3f</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the CMD prompt and found no integrity violation. I ran the windows genuine check and it came out genuine . I tried the cmd : slui 4 for phone activation but it came out " Cant activate windows by phone. contact your system administrator for info" .
 I ran cmd prompt in Admin mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do help.. Thanks </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />

            <p>Here's where your problem lies. Your computer has (or had since you've replaced the hard drive) a hidden partition used to recover the machine in the event it won't boot anymore. That's accessible by hitting F9 during startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the recovery runs, it's programmed to read the product key which is embedded in the BIOS in an encrypted format.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you've done by replacing the hard drive yourself and then reinstalling Windows using a borrowed CD installer is not going to work simply because the latter isn't programmed to read the BIOS product key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't wish to appear to be sarcastic, but yours is yet another instance where the user didn't read the manual to find out what to do in the event of a hardware failure, or if the machine won't boot. The steps to take are clearly illustrated on page 48
 of the manual here: <a href="http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/DigitalHome/DAV/P1801/E7705_P1801.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/DigitalHome/DAV/P1801/E7705_P1801.pdf</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you didn't create a USB recovery drive which is also programmed to retrieve the product key, then you can try using this tool:
<a href="https://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work though, then your only option will be to contact Asus and obtain a set of recovery discs (if available). Scroll down to the link at the foot of the page where it says "Need help" here:

<br />Personally, I don't recommend you save files to the desktop, since sometimes corrupt can lead to you losing them. You should instead, save the file to your Documents folder then create a shortcut to it on the desktop.

<h3> osomeabeanloadn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Windows 10 on a Mac through Boot Camp. Network Driver is not working properly.</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
So I'm running Windows 10 on my MacBook Pro 15" (2017) with Boot Camp. The connection to Wi-Fi is perfectly fine on the Mac OS, however, when I launch into Windows 10, the Wi-Fi connection barely works if at all (i'm talking 2kb/s download speed at best when
 it's working)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I looked into device manager, and the Network Adapter I'm using is "Broadcom 802.11ac Network Adapter". I cannot roll back to a previous Network Adapter because that option is greyed out. (the only one I have is the one having issues).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
There's definitely something wrong with the Network Adapter i'm using, and i'm wondering if there's a different one I can download and use instead? I can't find any answers elsewhere online. I've already tried using "Broadcom 802.11n" and it didn't work.</p>

<p>1. I'm using the latest version of Windows 10. It was updated as of 11PM PST 8/27/17, and the issue still persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I made no changes to the device, it was like this from the very very beginning. It has never had a good connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Besides Broadcom 802.11ac, there are no other Network Adapters. There is only one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've attempted to update the Network Adapter drivers at least 10 times, and every single time it says that I have the most recent Network Adapter driver. It still does not work. The option to roll back the driver is not available, it is greyed out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will need the $99.00 membership to build and debug games not the free trial, you will also need to connect your Xbox console to your PC (Wireless) while using XNA I would suggest you have some sort of knowledge with writing code before making this $99.00

            <p>Hello Ziyad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I mean is, use some other PC which is connected to a network, for resetting your Microsoft account password. Once you reset the password, try to boot your PC into
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Safe Mode with Networking</a>, then use the new password to access it. While accessing your PC with new password, I suggest you to connect Ethernet cable directly to your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>

    <title>How do I turn off automatic sync on startup of windows live mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> turfdigger  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn off automatic sync on startup of windows live mail</h2>
                    Greetings,<br />
After more than a decade of successful use, I am in the process of finally migrating away from Outlook Express into Windows Live Mail.<br />
<br />
In Outlook Express I have the option of NEVER having the client automatically synchronise the accounts (Send and Receive in Outlook Express terms) - in particular I don't want this to happen at startup - I want it to happen ONLY when I tell the client to perform
 the synchronisation.<br />
<br />
Windows Live Mail appears to always synchronise all accounts on startup - and I cannot find an option corresponding to the equivalent Outlook Express option that turns this off.&nbsp; Does such an option exist and, if it does, could you please help me to locate
 it?<br />
<br />
In summary, I DON'T want to, 'Go offline', I DO want to be able to explicitly, 'Sync All' but I DON'T want Windows Live Mail to EVER automatically Sync.<br />
<br />
TIA<br />

            <p>The polling settings are on the <em>General </em>tab of the program options sheet (Ctrl-Shift-O). POP3 accounts will honour the settings you make there. HTTP and IMAP accounts may not, because their aim is to stay in sync with the server. If you don't want
 this to happen, deselect <em>Include this account when receiving mail or synchronizing
</em>on the <em>General</em> tab of the account's properties sheet (right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties</em>).</p>
<p>You should also deselect <em>Send messages immediately </em>on the <em>Send</em> tab of program options, otherwise, a send/receive will be triggered for the account as soon as you press
<em>Send</em>. With the option disabled, messages won't be sent until you next use
<em>Send/Receive</em>.</p>

    <title>After upgrading to Windows 10 my wireless keyboard stops working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> howard davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            After upgrading to Windows 10 my wireless keyboard stops working periodically</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my high end Dell laptop to Windows 10.&nbsp; After the upgrade everything seemed to be working fine, but then I found that periodically the wireless keyboard I am using will stop working (even though my physical laptop keyboard continues
 to work).&nbsp; I am using the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard which is a wireless keyboard.&nbsp; This problem is happening multiple times per day.<br />
<br />
After a lot of troubleshooting I finally discovered that when the wireless Microsoft keyboard stops working I need to go to the Settings -&gt; Devices -&gt; Connected Devices list and look under the Other Devices section for the entry for "Microsoft Nano Transceiver
 v2.1".&nbsp; When I find this entry it will be showing a message that the "Driver is unavailable".&nbsp; I then click to remove the device. Then I unplug the transceiver from the USB port, wait a few seconds, plug the transceiver back into the USB port and a new device
 will show up called "Microsoft Wireless Transceiver", in addition a second device called "Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard" will also show up.&nbsp; Now my wireless keyboard will work again.&nbsp; This keeps happening over and over throughout the day.<br />
<br />
As long as the "Connected devices" continues to show that the device "Microsoft Wireless Transceiver" is connected my wireless keyboard will work fine.&nbsp; At the point when the keyboard stops working (usually right in the middle of typing a sentence) I hear the
 notification sounds that are usually associated with unplugging a usb device and then plugging in a usb device, and at that moment my keyboard stops working.&nbsp; No physical USB port change actually occurred during this time and I have been unable to determine
 what is triggering Windows 10 to periodically and automatically switch the device and the driver it is using to communicate with the wireless keyboard.&nbsp; Each time when the keyboard stops working I go back to the Connected Devices list and sure enough the entry
 for "Microsoft Wireless Transceiver" has disappeared and it has been replaced with an entry for "Microsoft Nano Transceiver v2.1" along with a message telling me the "Driver is unavailable".<br />
<br />
How can I get Windows 10 to stop periodically switching the Microsoft transceiver device to one that does not work?&nbsp; This has gotten to be extremely frustrating.

            <p>Hi Howard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and appreciate the time and effort that you have invested in to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes to the PC prior to this issue?</p>
<p>2. Do you notice any specific program or app that is running when the keyboard disconnects?</p>
<p>3. Have you installed all the latest updates that is available for your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I suggest that you check if there are any updates that are available for your PC. if so, disconnect all external devices other than keyboard and mouse and install the updates and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above did not help, I suggest that you place your PC in Safe Mode and check if the above occurs in that mode.
<span>Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. To learn how to access the above click on the link below</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not replicate in the above mode, I suggest that you uninstall the current driver that is associated with the keyboard and install the latest available driver from the link below</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/business/sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-for-business/5kv-00001#techspecs-connect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard for Business</a></strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To learn how to perform the above, refer to the article below which outlines the procedure in detail</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows
 10</a></strong>&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the event that the issue persist in Safe Mode, I suggest that you place your PC in Clean Boot to check if the issue is caused by any third party app or service conflict.
</span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.</p>

            <p>This problem with the device driver for the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard is still happening periodically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>1) Yes, I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. &nbsp;The problems started after the upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>2) The problem is not associated with any specific program. &nbsp;The keyboard has stopped working while I am typing in just about every program that I use.</p>
<p>3) Yes, all of the latest updates are installed, and auto update is enabled. &nbsp;I also manually uninstalled and reinstalled the driver for the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard using the link that you provided above. &nbsp;This did not fix the issue and the problem
 is still occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is still periodically removing the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Microsoft Wireless Transceiver" device and driver (which works fine) and replacing it with the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Microsoft

 change. &nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>I just wanted to add that I'm having the same issues after upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10. The keyboard will just stop working whilst I'm in the middle of typing - and it could be in any program but I mostly use Word and Outlook so I'm noticing it
 in there. I have to reboot to get it to restart. Yesterday it happened 3 times. I have a Logitech keyboard and it is not wireless. So I'll be watching this post with interest.</p>

            I am also having the same issue and the resolution is a reboot. &nbsp;I am assuming at this point it is a driver issue as other bluetooth keyboards and devices are not suffering from the same issue.

            <p>I have rebooted my Windows 10 computer many times since I first reported this problem 3 months ago. &nbsp;While a reboot will temporarily get the keyboard working again, it is no better than going to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Settings
 -&gt; Devices -&gt; Connected Devices list and look under the Other Devices section for the entry for "Microsoft Nano Transceiver v2.1" and removing that entry and then unplugging the USB transceiver and then plugging it in again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This problem has been occurring multiple times a day for months now. &nbsp;Microsoft has something messed up with their drivers for&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Microsoft Nano
 Transceiver v2.1" &nbsp;vs&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Microsoft Wireless Transceiver". &nbsp;Until Microsoft fixes their driver detection I expect that the problem will continue to happen multiple times a day.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am living with the issue by constantly going through the step of removing the non-working&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Microsoft Nano Transceiver v2.1" driver and then
 letting it find the device again and use the&nbsp;</span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Microsoft Wireless Transceiver" driver. &nbsp;It is a hassle that takes me a minute or two&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;times every day while I get my Microsoft
 keyboard working again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have to say I am very&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;with Microsoft. &nbsp;Multiple people have reported they are having this same problem and I reported the problem, symptoms, and a temporary work around months
 ago. &nbsp;Still Microsoft has made no progress on getting these drivers working right.</span></span></p>

            It lets you upgrade Windows 8.1 to a better version such as Windows 8.1 Pro or install Windows Media Center. 
<br />
<br />This function is defunct and you won't be able to do it under Windows 8.1 at this time. 
<br />
<br />Its perfectly safe, its called add feature packs.

<h2>            Windows 10 Settings Help&#58; Change between Power Plans in the taskbar Battery Icon&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plugin and unplug my laptop very constantly and I shift through Power Plans constantly as a result. I used to be able to do this on Windows 8.1 through the Battery icon on my task bar. After the upgrade to Windows 10 I tried the same thing, and all I get
 are two tiles saying "Battery Saver" and "Brightness". I know you can now Right Click the icon and go "Power Options" and the Control Panel page will show up and you can change your plan there. But that's very annoying for the long term...What happened to
 the option where you can change your Power Plan through that icon on the task bar?? How do you set it?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>P.S. Here's a screenshot:</p>

            <p>The solution provided does nothing.</p>
<p>I dont understand from the phrasing </p>
<p><span>"As per description, you are not getting Power Options&nbsp;in</span> Battery icon on my task bar."</p>
<p>Does that mean that this is the windows default and you cant change it no matter what or it indicates that normally this issue shouldn't exist and it's a user's fault?</p>

            I agree, Absolutely useless response. I would also like a fix to easily changing power plans on the taskbar.

            <p>If by now we still want the old interface back guys, I've found a solution through a 3rd Party Tweak!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download WinAero tweaker and in its settings and follow the screenshot:</p>
<p>1. Download winaero tweaker&nbsp;http://winaero.com/download.php?view.1796</p>
<p>2. Unzip it and run the program</p>
<p>3. On its left hand side, find "Battery Flyout" (should be under Appearance settings)</p>
<p>4. Uncheck "Use new Battery flyout"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it should be all fixed!</p>

<p>I wonder if you ever resolved it within the native Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I recently was baffled because I couldn't find the Power Plans after updating to Windows 10, version 1709. The "Energy Options" setup screen only showed the Balanced Power plan and didn't offer the other plans (Power Saver and High Performance).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kept pressing the right mouse button to see the contextual menu options, but I finally used the left mouse button and found that the pop-up window shows now a slider bar for the energy usage, instead of the list power plans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I guess this means that the latest update addresses your issue.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Speakers muted&#34;, still have sound, volume changes randomly</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Windows 10, Skype version&nbsp;8.48.0.51, application version&nbsp;14.48.51.0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had the text "Speakers muted" at the bottom of my screen for at least a month now, but I still have sound.
</p>
<p>I can't "unmute", and when I try to increase the volume in Settings &gt; Audio &amp; Video &gt; Speakers, the bar moves and stays there for as long as I have the Settings window open. There's no difference in actual sound volume, though. Only on the bar on the screen.
</p>
<p>When I close the Settings window and open it again, however, the volume is down to 0 again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual volume through my speakers fluctuates dramatically, from so quiet that I can't hear the other person, to so loud it hurts my ears. I keep having to adjust the volume manually all the time to hear what's being said without becoming deaf 20 seconds
 later. This has become a serious problem the last week or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a "fix" just now that I found online, involving&nbsp;%appdata%, changing the name of the Skype folder to Skype.old, and deleting config files. It didn't solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also: I don't know if this is related, but for several months now, the "do nothing" setting in the Windows communication settings hasn't worked. Instead, Skype mutes other sounds by approximately 80%. I've used Skype since 2005, used the "do nothing" setting
 since 2010, and I've never had this issue before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I don't know whether it's related is, I tried to use my table microphone yesterday (which has worked perfectly well for more than a year), and while available as a microphone device in Skype, no sound came through when I spoke. I tried both
 the front and rear mic ports and could not make the table mic work. Instead, I have to rely&nbsp;on the USB webcam's built-in microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried both front and rear ports for speakers, too. No difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have the one speaker system to choose from, apart from my monitors, which are less than ideal.&nbsp;The correct sound system is selected&nbsp;both in Skype and in Windows sound settings. Drivers for sound card and speakers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've uninstalled and reinstalled Skype twice the last month, and today I did a "reset" through the Windows App settings. Nothing has helped.<br />

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9c7fb836-2332-4f38-957c-f4bcdf8dbf76" title="TonjeLM">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you mentioned that you already tried deleting the appdata from your Skype for Windows 10 app but the same issue persist, I would like to suggest on using the standalone version of the Skype app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before doing so, try uninstalling the Skype for Windows 10 using the Microsoft Store app and download the standalone version of Skype using this link:
<a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This would help us determine if the issue would still come up using the standalone version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your updates. All the best!</p>

    <title>Ddumd.dll APPCRASH - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fergus martin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ddumd.dll APPCRASH</h2>
                    When I attempt to run the Evil within, the game doesn't load. instead it provides me with an error message saying the exe has stopped, due to 'ddumd.dll'. I've tried to look into this, yet the internet has failed me. I've asked peers and no-one has any
 advice that helps. the game has been re-installed, all drivers updated, verity checked ect. MY computer passes the minimum requirements, yet it wont allow me to play. I think it has something to do with my System32 file. can anyone provide me with any advice?
 it would be greatly appricated.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then try play the game.</p>
<span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. This
 article describes how to troubleshoot problems in Windows Vista or in Windows 7 by performing a clean boot.</span>
