    <title>outlook 2011 export single folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            outlook 2011 export single folder</h2>
                    My outlook 2011 is closing due to a database error. &nbsp;I verified permissions, try to rebuild and/or repair database but with no luck! &nbsp;As i use IMAP, I therefore created a new identity and started my oatmeal which now works. &nbsp; I now need to access my archived
 files, but don't know how to access each email folder individually and when I try to export mail in one go, outlook presents the error message and forces me to quit the application. &nbsp; I tried working offline but to no avail. &nbsp;Does anyone know how to export
 only smaller mail folders and/or subfolders? &nbsp;OR does anyone have any other solution to my problem please?<br />

    <title>My PC its still on Build 17025 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My PC its still on Build 17025</h2>
                    <p>I just reinstalled my pc, since I just simply wanted to do a fresh install because it was not updating to the latest preview build&nbsp;(now 17046). I am currently at preview 17025 and every time&nbsp;I check for a new update it just simply says that&nbsp; I am up to date.
 Something that has been bothering me also is that on the top of the Windows Update tab, it shows in red: "Some settings are managed by your organization." When I click on details it says that the administrator has Automatic Updates set up as a group policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not set up any group&nbsp;policy and just in case I already&nbsp;reset&nbsp;them, I am also&nbsp;logged in with my normal outlook account, and I have it linked to fast windows preview builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would really appreciate your help guys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below there is a screenshot that reflects my issue.</p>

<p>If you read the forum there were a large number that were getting errors hen trying to go to 17046.&nbsp; I had a problom going from 17025&nbsp; to 17035 with volsnap.sys on a couple of my laptops and had to use the media Creation Tool and go back to the public release
 and the was able to get 17046 without the problems that the others were having.</p>

<h2>            Will the final Windows 10 still have the keylogger&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Will the final Windows 10 still have the&nbsp;keylogger? Because if it does, I will not buy it! And I will eventually go to linux! I am a gamer mostly! So I do not really browse the Internet much unless I am updating a game, or looking up specs on old WWII fighter
 planes. But I still do not like the fact that I will be watched! Why does anyone have to know I like P-40's and P-38's and P-51's and 109s and 190s and so on? It is nobody's business but mine! And I am sick of people saying well if you got nothing to hide
 then do not worry! That is not what this is about! There is a reason people do not live in glass houses! Because people like privacy! And everyone has a right to privacy! And everyone has a right not be treated like criminals! And Microsoft is really stupid
 to expect customers to pay money for a product that treats them like criminals! And a product that spies on them! I mean really? This is not going to work microsoft! That is not exactly good customer service! That is the same as going to McDonalds and being
 interrogated before you buy a burger! If they think Windows 8.1 was a flop! Then Windows 10 will really be a flop if they keep this keylogger in it! This is why people buy antimalware software! To keep keyloggers and malware from stealing personal information!
 This keylogger will also give hackers a golden key to the crapper too! Microsoft Windows will become a thing of the past if they try this bull! And Linux will come out smelling like a rose taking all the market shares.&nbsp;

            So not one person from Microsoft can answer this? You can't answer a simple question of will I be spied on by the keylogger in the final release or not? It is a simple yes or no question!&nbsp;

            <p>The answer is not just a yes or no. &nbsp;The telemetry in the Preview, which includes a keylogger, will not be in the final version, but Microsoft will continue to gather information. &nbsp;What information they will continue to gather has not been defined, but they
 will at a minimum look at what you're doing so that they can target advertising at you. &nbsp;It won't be a keylogger per-se, but it will including looking at everything you search for on your computer, on the internet, which applications you use.</p>

            And yes a simple question of, Are you going to spy on me? That is a simple yes or no question, But if they spy on me then it's time for linux! This is so wrong to do customers like this! To invade privacy is the ultimate betrayal! And I have used Windows

            Well I am still waiting Microsoft! Will the keylogger be in the final release or not? I do not want answers from other people only adding their opinions. I just want a answer from Microsoft! Will the final release still have the keylogger? Because I will
 not buy Windows 10 if it does! And neither will many others! You better think about your customers instead of your own greed!

<p>Without question, all activity that is of importance to MS WILL be logged, recorded, and transferred. It may be called a 'customer experience program' - or 'enhancement' or any other misleading term.</p>
<p>It will still be there</p>
<p>There WILL be options to disable part(s) of it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>a real example - </p>
<p>
</p><p>An example is 'targeted advertising' - use my unique ID for targeted advertising ? - on or off -----</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, on - you get targeted ads - OFF - you get 'best guess' targeted ads !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>YOU STILL GET THE ADS !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rest assured - until the authorities clamp down on MS for this terrible practice - it will continue - the end of this practice will be the end of this OS - as it is the CORE of this OS - (Win 10) - and certainly win 8X to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NO - they are not going to target your bank account - of course not (the hackers will do that with the means MS provide lol :-)) ... but - everything you do is fair game - you will be and are signing your rights away by accepting the fabulous 'free' experience
 - they will 'reach out to you' - and grab you by the ballcocks. !!</p>

<p>it's likely that highly paid-off judges and politicians will either MAKE IT LEGAL or ignore it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(it's no longer the 90's)</p>
<p>
</p><p>back in the 90's, as a reminder, there was anti-trust action regarding the use of UNDOCUMENTED FUNCTIONS in MS Word and other appLICATIONS that needed these [just as the rest of us did] to avoid 'UAE' screens due to random things happening inside windows,
 like a memory handle that was no longer valid for some reason. &nbsp;So you'd call 'GlobalHandleNoRIP' to check before locking it and using the pointer. &nbsp;OS bugs fixed later resolved this, but if having a problem in the OS causes your application to crash, you
 should be able to gracefully recover rather than get a big BLUE screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to wonder if target-ad and spyware within the OS is *enough* for anti-trust. &nbsp;THESE days, anyway, with 'current politics' and I'm referring to the white house and justice department in particular.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting and welcome to the forum. :)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Sorry to learn that you're having difficulty downloading the <span>
WhatsApp</span> application. Given the error message, have you tried to check if you do have an active
<span>internet</span> connection? Were you able to download other application aside from
<span>WhatsApp</span>?&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a workaround, you can try changing your access points by doing the following :&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to<strong> Settings</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Configuration</strong>, and then&nbsp;<strong>Preferred access point</strong>.
</li><li>Choose your operator's access point. </li></ul>
<p>It's also worth asking your operator about the correct access point settings for your device. If this does not work, you can reset the phone by going to&nbsp;<span>Settings, Restore factory sett., and then Settings only. The default security
 code is 12345 unless you've changed it.&nbsp;</span><span>This does not affect documents or files stored on your device.&nbsp;</span><span>After restoring the original settings, your device switches off and then on again.
 This&nbsp;</span><span><span>may take longer than usual. After doing the reset, try to
<span>redownload</span> the <span>WhatsApp</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the outcome.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Even though there was not an alarm set, after a reboot, a notification popped up for&nbsp;an alarm. I hit dismiss and now the start menu has no sound. Problem fixed? I wonder why they would interact like that. Interesting if you did have an alarm toggle<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17cc5d3f-e83c-4c19-961d-56c735644cc5" />&nbsp;at
 the top of the start menu. Maybe it would remind people when they opened the menu and it was going off that they had somewhere to be.&nbsp; hahaha. could work

<h2>            Outlook does not recognise &#34;Groups&#34; in &#39;Contacts&#39; properly.</h2>
                    When sending an email to all the members of a group, Outlook does not respond to the instruction, especially when using bcc, as I do to preserve the recipients privacy and security. &nbsp;Also, impossible to send a message to "All" my contacts for some reason!&nbsp;

            <p>Hi kelvinvann,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would like to ask some questions to help us sort out this issue:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly the steps you made when you use bcc?</li></ul>
<p>I simulated your issue and I did not experience the same. For instrustions on how to send mail using bcc, please see below steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To open BCC (and CC), just click on CC &amp; BCC at the top right of the To box. This opens up CC and BCC boxes. Note that when you do this you will easily see the CC box but that the frequent contacts drop down is covering the BCC box. It is there though. Just
 click outside the CC box (say, just under the frequent contacts list or between the To and CC boxes) and you should see the BCC box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regard to sending messages to all your contacts, you can view all your contacts when sending an email by following this step:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access your full list of contents just click on the word <strong>To</strong> just above the box you enter the email of the person to whom you are sending the email. This should open your contacts. Note that some people say they have to click on
<strong>To</strong> a second time to get the full contact list although&nbsp;it only need one click.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have other concerns, please feel free&nbsp;to post back and we will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

 shows a new email notification whenever it's open; but if it's closed, then nothing happens when&nbsp;I get a new&nbsp;email and it usually takes a long time (10-30 seconds) to&nbsp;sync&nbsp;my folders and show new emails.&nbsp;I don't like this about Outlook because, even though&nbsp;I&nbsp;got
 the discount Office University,&nbsp;I barely ever use&nbsp;my paid mail application because the free one's&nbsp;better (at syncing,&nbsp;I&nbsp;know Outlook has&nbsp;way more features). I'd keep it open 24/7, but&nbsp;I have a Surface Pro and even though I changed the power options to give
 it around an hour&nbsp;extra of estimated battery life, I'd prefer not having any&nbsp;applications open unnecessarily.</li><li>Is there any way that I can set up Outlook 2013 to have a pop-up confirmation that, when&nbsp;I&nbsp;send an email,&nbsp;gives me the option to either&nbsp;send emails or not send it and review it to make sure everything's the way I want? I have the save icon on the Quick
 Access Toolbar right above the big "Send" button so I get all paranoid&nbsp;that I'll accidently send an unfinished email that I'm trying to save.</li></ol>

            1. No.&nbsp; The Windows app is actually running in the background. You can run outlook in the background - right click on the notification icon and set it to hide when minimized.

    <title>6290 A2DP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> micke090  say:</h3>
<h2>            6290 A2DP</h2>
                    I think Nokias announcment of the 6290 was very rude. They say that it will support A2DP, so all retailers says it has A2DP, but sooner or later people found out that no, this phone does NOT have A2DP... **bleep** happened to that!!!? The place i bought
 my phone from have very silently and discretly removed A2DP as a feature for this phone (about a month ago). One of the big "pricefinder" sites here removed it today, about 10 o clock this morning. The way I found out this phone did not support A2DP was when
 i got an A2DP birthday-present (Jambra BT620s), but the sound quality was like listening through an old phone. (But while connected to the computer the quality is impressive)<br />
<br />
<br />
But enough complaining, will Nokia release A2DP support for this phone? And WHEN will that happen? An equal thread like this one was started April 29th, but he has got no answers. Why not? Can't you even admit your mistakes?

            Please note that Nokia does enable A2DP on phones via firmware upgrades sometimes.<br />
<br />
For example, the Nokia 6233 did not have A2DP support until the firmware was updated to V04.91 - the same thing can apply to the 6290.

            It is amazing situation.<br />
<br />
1. I have the stereo phone.<br />
2. I have the stereo headphones.<br />
3. I have advanced 2.0 bluetooth specification.<br />
But<br />
4. It is impossible to connect devices to each over.<br />
<br />
Dear Sirs from the Nokia team, we are waiting for FW update.<br />
<br />
By the way, some times, when I edit one SMS and in the same time receive another - system failure appear and my phone automatically reload.

            I returned my phone and got the money back, i'm going to buy the Nokia 5610 when it comes out here in scandinavia. :) It is much slimer, better camera, included 2.5-3.5mm stereo adapter, A2DP, but no S60, but the new S40 V5, and they say it is closer to
 S60 than ever.

            Hm-m-m... Not good solution I think...<br />
S40 - is the old platform and I afraid some problem with HTML, e-mail, and multitasks...<br />
Whether exists any S60 which support a2dp at all?

    <title>MSE Client Update &#40;KB2754296&#41; broken&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgehaytack  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSE Client Update &#40;KB2754296&#41; broken&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On the 1st October my XP Pro SP3 machine installed the automatic update for the MSE Client KB2754296. Everything seemed fine for the first day. However, on the second day (2nd October) from boot-up the Security Centre kepts showing me a red flag saying the
 MSE was turned off. However, MSE said it was running (and showing in the notification area). Did a full scan, nothing, but still Security Centre says there's a problem.</p>
<p>This machine does not have any other anti-virus/malware/spam software on it (nor has it for a long long time). So, this morning getting fed up with the red flag, I uninstalled MSE, rebooted, then re-installed it from the MSE Download page. Rebooted, MSE
 started fine, downloaded the latest definitions and did a initial scan. No problems. Hooray!</p>
<p>Then, up pops another Security Centre red flag (AGGGGHHHHH!!!!) but this time saying it has detected multiple anti-virus programs on the computer but they are all turned off. Again MSE says different.</p>
<p>So, what have Microsoft broken this time. With previous MSE Client Updates they kept breaking the Windows Genuine Advantage authentication (a real pain in the a**). Now with 4.1.522.0 they seem to have broken Security Centre.</p>
<p>Do they check these things before they push them out????</p>

            <p>No error codes in any of the event logs and no error dialogues - just the red Security Centre shields in the notification area. Then when I go into Security Centre it says about the multiple anti-virus programs but doesn't specify what multiple anti-virus
 programs it "thinks" are there. This particular machine has not had any other anti-virus on it for 3+ years and in all that time neither MSE nor Security Centre have complained about other anti-virus software being present.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it did an automatic definitions update at 5:38pm today, then a scheduled Quick Scan. Mysteriously after that the Security Centre warning disappeared!!! I wonder if there has been a screw up between the new client and definitions database requiring
 a new definitions database to be put out as it had only downloaded the latest this morning after I re-installed MSE.</p>
<p>Definitely looks like another Microsoft screw-up.....</p>

            <p>KB2754296 installed without a problem for me, and it would seem that the new client and the first defintions file just didn't work together - results Security Centre lost the plot....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish Microsoft would spend less time working on new and worthless "features" and more on making what they've alread sold work properly...... We don't "need" Windows 8, Windows 7 does little of use to Businesses that XP doesn't&nbsp;and Vista was just, well,
 XP's exquivalent of Windows ME.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>I'll answer as much as I can now and dig the rest out later :</p>
<p>1a. I chose MSE intentionally</p>
<p>1b/c. Antimalware Client Version: 4.1.522.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engine Version: 1.1.8800.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Antivirus defintion: 1.137.1191.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Antispyware definition: 1.137.1191.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After it updated last night the Security Centre red warning came back, first saying the anti virus software is out of date, then that multiple ones are installed but are all switched off.</p>
<p>2. God that was a long time ago - erm let me see -&nbsp;PC Tools Anti Virus (Free), no subscription and uninstalled prior to MSE being installed (too resource hungry and it's nagging to upgrade to the paid for version became too annoying).</p>
<p>3. Mcfee - Nope, Norton definitely not! If one ever wants to trash a PC, install Norton!</p>
<p>5. I'll dig this out and add it later</p>
<p>6. Java is version 6 update 35</p>
<p>7. Firefox is installed but almost never used (don't like it), Chrome - not a chance as it is rubbish.</p>
<p>8. Never -&nbsp; I'm of the opinion that they do more damage than they claim to fix.</p>
<p>9. This particular machine had a complete rebuild (i,e. wipe the system parition and re-install everything) about 3 years ago.&nbsp;It is due another soon as I'll be moving my data over to another, high spec, machine this week. My other 3 XP Pro machines haven't
 exhibited this problem, but then my laptop was&nbsp;rebuilt just 2&nbsp;months ago (too many install/uninstalls) and the&nbsp;of the other two one is used just as an&nbsp;iTunes jukebox, the other just runs
seti@home.</p>
<p>I'll dig out the info on updates for item 5 later today and probably update Java then</p>
<p>Anything you can come up with would be appreciated.</p>
<p>George</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hmmm....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An interesting development. I have a fourth XP Pro machine which I'd only just done a fresh install onto last week (it used to run Ubuntu) to try out some CAD software. I prefer trying out software&nbsp;that way - keeps my main machine cleaner. Anyway, all it
 has on it is fresh XP Pro SP3, all outstanding updates, IE8, the drivers for the machine (an Asus A7VT based machine) Adobe Reader X and MSE. When I fired it up this morning it was showing the same problem - Security Centre's red flag, multiple anti-virus
 software and all switched off. Anyway, it was a few days behind on upddates and scans so I did an update and scan - and the flag disappeared. So I checked the version of MSE and the only difference that I found was it had a slightly newer version of the definitions
 (1.137.1228.0).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I went back to my main machine, did an update of MSE (it's last one was yesterday evening), and after it had also updated to 1.137.1228.0 the Security Centre problem dissappeared again.</p>
<p>Here we have two machines, one with nothing on it but a fresh install, both showing the same problems and both problems comming and going with different version of the definitions.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weird!</p>

<p>I don't think you know what you are asking for. Build 14393 cannot be directly installed. First you would need to join the Insider Program via a public release version of W10. Then that would need to upgrade to 14393 which might take a couple of days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, the release version will upgrade to the new Anniversary version on 2nd August.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand what you hope to achieve.</p>

<p>&nbsp;You're in the wrong forum.&nbsp; 10586 is not an insider version of Windows.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;As always, you should <strong>NEVER</strong> fail to back up anything you don't want to lose or can't easily recreate.&nbsp; There are so many ways for data to get destroyed or corrupted on a computer, only the most naïve fail to back up.&nbsp; This is true whether
 you make system changes or not, but <strong>especially</strong> before making any kind of system change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Remember the old adage about the ounce of prevention!</p>

<p>Do you get a valid IP-adres? Usually the router sends a non-functioning IP-adres to a phone when it does not understand the request. A very valid situation might be that there is a MAC-adres filter in the router, preventing it from connecting.</p>

    <title>Repeating Table Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neil hiorns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repeating Table Issue</h2>
                    <p>Using InfoPath 2010 I have a repeating table where&nbsp;the first field is a drop-down list containing Product Codes&nbsp;linked from a SharePoint custome table. When you select an Product Code from the drop-down list a rule then populates the second field in the
 repeating table with its corresponding Product Description. </p>
<p>When you select the drop-down list for the Product Code it then initiates a rule that populates the Description field&nbsp; using the "Set a field's value" by using a "Filter Data" where
<u>Product Description - Secondary</u> (<u>Product Code - secondary</u> = <u>Product Code - Main</u>) - obviously in the 'real code' it does not have "Secondary" and "Main", I have just included for explaination.</p>
<p>This seems to work in the repeating table, however, when you 'Insert' more than 4 rows all subsequent Product Descriptions take on the value of the 4th Product Description.</p>

    <title>Some images in Publisher 2016 not displaying - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Some images in Publisher 2016 not displaying</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since yesterday, some images in my Publisher publications DO display correctly as they normally do, but some now do NOT display at all!?! &nbsp;I can see their boundaries, but can't see the images themselves!?! &nbsp;If I resize them to something bigger, they display
 correctly, but when I make them smaller/to their original size, they disappear!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched around and tried a lot of things, but can't seem to find any good answer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The images themselves are all embedded in the file and I repeat, displayed perfectly until I shut down my PC yesterday. &nbsp;When I booted back up and reopened the same file, this problem came up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I reinsert images, they show up correctly!?! &nbsp;I have thousands of images in those files, so cannot resort to reinserting them one by one!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea? &nbsp;Thanks in advance for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S &nbsp;I am running the most current version of Office 365 for business (Office 2016), version 1701 build 7766.2060... did an Office update happen when I booted back up yesterday causing this problem, I do not know because I can't seem to find any update history
 :-(</p>

<h2>            Office 365 &#47; Onedrive through school. Logging in ok through Windows, trouble through Office 2016 for Mac and iOS app</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there, really hoping someone can lend me a hand. I go to Conestoga College in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. We have a license of Office 365 that we can use. Right now, I can log in through any web browser, and connect ok through the web interface and see
 any document. I am using my student email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Mac. I am running Parallels, which lets me run Windows, so I am running Windows 8 through school license and Microsoft Word through school license, and I can log into my Office 365 Onedrive with my student email address and password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also am running the Mac version of Office 2016 for Mac, and the Mac version of Word. Version 15.14 (150911) to be exact. There is an option to log into my Office 365 One drive. I type in my school email addresses, the next screen, my college logo shows
 up (Conestoga College), and asks me for my password. I'm 100% certain I'm typing in the same password, and click enter, and the screen just refreshes, and the password field is blank. If I try a different account (my home, previous Onedrive account), I can
 log in, but when I try the school account (Which I need for group collaboration project), it just refreshes the Window. If I try a different password, it will actually tell me that the username/password is wrong. If I do the right one, it just refreshes with
 a blank password field, and I'm not logged in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am getting the same behaviour with my MS Word for iOS app. I put in my college email address, and I see a window with the Conestoga College logo, and asking me for password. I enter my password, and it just refreshes with empty password field. Different
 password, and it says wrong username/password, so it is recognized my account, just not letting me log in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd really like for this to work, please let me know what might be going on. Something to be setup on Conestoga College end? Something I need to do? Not supported yet? Please help as soon as possible, would really appreciate it!!!</p>

<p>I should add, I found this license info logged in:</p>
<p>Office 365 Education for students</p>

<p>Skype for Business Online (Plan 2)</p>
<p>SharePoint Plan 1 for EDU</p>
<p>Exchange Online (Plan 1)</p>

<p>In the OneDrive settings (logged into Office 365 in settings), I see this as well:</p>
<p>OneDrive</p>
<p>Install OneDrive for Business sync app</p>
<p>Info You can only install OneDrive for Business on a PC.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>I'm guessing the school license, for Onedrive is maybe only for PC?</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>It means OneDrive for Business client which cannot be installed on a Mac. In Word, you should be able to access service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check the issue, I would like to confirm if you are an Office 365 administrator (responsible person). If not, could you please involve your Office 365 administrator in this thread?<br />
Then, I can know the detailed deployment, check some event logs in the server side and do some tests. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>If you are an admin, please move forward.<br />
To troubleshoot the issue, I need to confirm the following information.<br />
1. &nbsp;What’s the version of ADFS server (2.0 or 3.0)?<br />
2. &nbsp;Does the issue occur to all federated users?<br />
3. &nbsp;Does the issue occur on your internal network or external network?<br />
4. &nbsp;When the issue occur, could you find any error in event log of ADFS and IIS log?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Johnny Zhang</p>

<div>Hi Thembelanintshingila,</div>
<div><br />
<div>When you say "<strong>it is still now showing me the warning when sending to someone outside my organization</strong>", do you mean MailTips alerts shows when sending to someone outside your organization?</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, MailTips alerts can be triggered by actions including clicking Reply All to a large recipient list, sending sensitive information to someone outside your organization, or sending a message to someone who is out of office. For your reference:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-MailTips-Options-7839a4ac-e45f-4289-a127-4ce702bedcc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook MailTips Options</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>As an Office 365 admin you can configure the primary MailTip in the Exchange admin center (EAC) or in Exchange Online PowerShell. See
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/mailtips/configure-custom-mailtips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Configure custom MailTips for recipients</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Moreover, if I have misunderstood anything, please correct me and provide us with detailed screenshot about the issue so that we can further assist you.</div>
<div><br />

    <title>PowerPoint 2011 - Unable to move text boxes with arrows, or adjust - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cal krome  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2011 - Unable to move text boxes with arrows, or adjust font size without selecting text</h2>
                    <p>This is a weird glitch, and I saw it first on Monday 6/2 but could not resolve. I have now seen it with 3 other users who are reporting the problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What used to work:</p>
<p>Click on a text box at the edges</p>
<p>Use arrow keys to move the text box.</p>
<p>Use font + or font - buttons to increase the size of all text inside of the box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens now:</p>
<p>Click on a text box at the edges</p>
<p>Arrow keys are automatically in the text box moving the cursor around</p>
<p>Font + and - keys do not work unless you actually select/highlite the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is almost definitely due to the newest update, and will only become more prevalent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you click on the text box at the edges and IMMEDIATELY press arrow keys or Font +/-, they will work as intended for about 1/10th of a second.</p>
<p>This is enough time to move the text box maybe 3 presses of the arrow keys before you are inside the text moving around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The gist of it is, that whenever you work with a text box you are always in text-edit mode, which is not desired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody else seeing this? Or have a fix? I tried uninstalls/re-installs and the problem persisted; but we were doing all updates which I now believe to be causing the problem (will test this weekend).</p>

            <p>Solution here:</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macpowerpoint/cant-delete-text-box-in-powerpoint/ea4e765f-097f-469f-95d2-1e06d53a873a?page=3</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Under system preferences, chose Keyboard, then chose Shortcuts, and then at the bottom under Full Keyboard Access, click the "All controls" radio button.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, the "Text boxes and lists only" radio button was selected.&nbsp; I can recreate the problem by clicking this other radio button, i.e. the fix is fully reversible.&nbsp; I don't think I ever touched either of these buttons before yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this fix completely resolves for me the issues with selecting text boxes in PowerPoint.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that it's very puzzling that a system tabbing option should have anything to do with selecting text boxes in PowerPoint.&nbsp; I expect there is still an underlying bug.&nbsp;

            <p>Most likely Ctrl+F7 got hit accidentally sometime (I use a lot of hotkeys) and then we all got stuck with this issue. Hope there is a way to disable this shortcut key.
</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Thanks so much, Rock888! I don't understand the connection between that particular preference and this particular problem in PowerPoint but the main thing is that it's solved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I noticed in the System Preferences is that you can change the keyboard shortcut preference from "All controls" to "Text boxes and lists only" by pressing Ctrl+F7. &nbsp;Since my PPT worked one day and not the next, I'm guessing maybe I accidentally
 bumped that key combination when trying to do something else.</p>

    <title>If cell equals tuesday, true, false - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennifermeagher  say:</h3>
<h2>            If cell equals tuesday, true, false</h2>
                    We use excel as a shipping schedule. Column A is used as the due date. Most customers require us to ship the business day before, so the cell is left with the date as is. Of course, we have a few that don't and this is where I would like to enter a formula.
<br />
<br />
Customer A only wants us to ship on Tuesdays or Thursdays, but does not schedule in this manner. I would like to create a formula such as -<br />
<br />
if date equals Tuesday or Thursday, show cell, If false, show date of previous Tuesday or Thursday, whichever is closer<br />
<br />
Customer B requires us to ship two business days before the due date. I would like a formula to show -<br />
<br />
Cell equals date minus 2, if Monday through Friday, if Saturday or Sunday, return previous Friday.<br />
<br />
Also, would I be able to create this formula in the cell itself and not reference another cell? This is an ISO doc and I can not add columns.<br />

            Hi,
<br />I strongly recommend to use only one Office version. Although you can check the bellow Microsoft article:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/can-t-find-office-applications-in-windows-10-windows-8-or-windows-7-907ce545-6ae8-459b-8d9d-de6764a635d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/can-t-...</a>
<br />
<br />In addition try to repair online the Office:

<h2>            Excel cell - vertical bisector</h2>
                    How do I obtain a vertical line/bar, which can be of variable width as in Borders, that bisects a cell in Excel? The 'Custom Borders' seems to offer this possibility but, unlike any of the outline options, I cannot get Excel 2013 to do internal lines.

            <blockquote>There is nothing in 'Symbols' or in Insert&gt;Shapes (where there is a vast array of symbols but no vertical bisector). Frustrating.
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Sure there is. In the Insert tab &gt; Illustrations group &gt; Shapes dropdown &gt; Lines group.&nbsp; Select the first line option. It is shown as a diagonal, but you can put it any direction, including vertical or horizontal.&nbsp; Then you click to indicate the start point
 and "drag" down to the end point and release the button.&nbsp; You now have a vertical line in cell.

<h2>            how to disable swipe from right which delete messages and emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have problem with deleting my SMS conversations by accidentally swiping from right.</p>
<p>When I swipe, the entire conversation is deleted. Then a red bar on the bottom of the screen appears with undo option.</p>
<p>Unfortunately when I click anywhere else, i.e. click on any other conversation, it's gone forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a left handed person&nbsp;so swiping from right is natural gesture done with my thumb when I grab a phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to disable this feature? </p>
<p>Can I restore my messages somehow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run windows 10 on Lumia 640</p>

    <title>Dead E63 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjrosaria  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dead E63</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I recently bought an E63 2 days ago. This evening It froze when I was trying to open the messaging app and the only way to resort this was to restart it. So after I restarted my device. It won't turn on anymore. When I hold the power button, the only
 thing that happens is the&nbsp;notification&nbsp;light (the white light in the middle of the d pad) lights up while I'm holding the power button but it doesn't start up. I could not find anything about this anywhere off the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I've noticed within the short days I had my e63 was the fast draining battery life. I charged my e63 7 hrs after the battery drained when I first got it so I did a first charge of 12 hrs. after only I guess around 16 hours I needed to charge the battery
 again. Im sure this is not normal. I send around 15-25 messages a day and use wi-fi for at least 20 minutes a day but I expected it to last at least 2- 3 days or even better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I return the phone?? or is there anyway to resort this and what causes the phone not to start up?? It's really frustrating. I loved the nokia E63 for the first 2 days. The last nokia I've got was like 7 years ago and that was the 3210 it lasted me
 very long and I really loved it. I was expecting the e63 to be the same.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's some bad luck :( Based on the description I'd say that there's a problem in the HW, so please deliver your phone either to the store you bought it from, or to the nearest service center and they'll most probably swap the phone to a new one as you
 have had this phone only for two days.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Did you try pulling the battery for a few minutes, then putting it back in and putting on a charger until you are sure it is fully charged?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, if you carry it in a case or in a pockt/purse and do not lock the keypad first, it will drain like a sieve. Any accidental touching of the keypad could launch something without you being aware of it.</p>

<p>Wow my phone worked again after what you told me to do. The battery life still worries me though. I've read a lot around forums and around the internet that the E63 is praised for its great battery life. Mine just lasts around 24 hours even when I limit
 my use. (5 - 6 minutes wifi tops, 5 messages and 1 phone call) Do you guys still think I should return it??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also for 2 days I have not put my phone in my pocket and I'm pretty sure its not that draining my battery. Thanks for the tip though.</p>

            There could be a couple of reasons for draining the battery. Constant WLAN search, Mail for Exchange, Nokia Messaging. Hold the home screen button for a few seconds to see whitch apps are running.

            My E63 has started to "freeze". If someone calls me, my phone does not ring. The same with messaging.&nbsp; If I restart my phone, it will work for a little bit, then stop again.&nbsp; No idea why it started doing this....help!<br />

            I know that there a lot of factors draining the battery. I've turned off everything, I've turned off Wlan search and I have not installed Nokia messaging (I don't like it, I like the default mail box and I don't really need push email. I just retrieve
 it every night at home at my wifi router) BTW I always quit my apps and I don't have any bg apps running.

            Hi DavidFarrington1,
<br />
<br />I'm Charles, an Independent advisor trying to help.

<p>Hi Charles</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not help. In word 2010 when attempting to insert a number into the filter, the number gallery included page number&nbsp;X of Y. i.e. page 7 of 8.</p>
<p>I am sure it used to appear in word 2016 also.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d9e9c9c-5736-472c-a101-705f43f862c7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d9e9c9c-5736-472c-a101-705f43f862c7?upload=true" /></a></p>

</p><p>Note, you can also insert Page X of Y numbering by typing:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Page page of numpages</strong></p>
<p>
