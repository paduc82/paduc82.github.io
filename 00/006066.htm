<h2>            VBA Code in database has disappeared&#33;</h2>
                    OH NO!<br />
<br />
I opened my database file this evening ... I worked on it last night with no trouble ... and tonight, all the VBA code behind all the forms is just plain GONE!<br />
<br />
Luckily, I do make backups ... however, this one was backed up before I'd done some major work on it last evening. (including new tables and queries and data updates)<br />
<br />
So, I copied all the code from the backup ... form by form. All the forms now work just fine ... except the one I've been tinkering with all week!<br />
<br />
I had posted the code that finally worked in another thread ... so I went there and copied that code back into my form code ... and I get an error.
<br />
<br />
Funny thing is ... in the outdated database, the exact same code (from the same ctrl-v ... really, copied it and pasted it twice, they are the exact same code)&nbsp; ... works just fine!<br />
<br />
So ... um ... help!<br />
<br />
Should I recreate my table and queries in the working but old database ... and try to remember the new data ...<br />
<br />
Or, figure out what the heck is wrong with the database file that doesn't work but it more current?
<br />
<br />
The other forms and queries still work ... just the main opening form ... that's "broken"<br />
<br />
Here's what I have .... again, this exact same code works in the older version of the file (it's 12 hours older)<br />
<br />
There error is "Compile Error, User-defined type not defined" and the line that says third line is highlighted yellow with the little yellow arrow next to it and the fourth line has "db As DAO.database" highlighted in blue-grey ... the same as selecting my
 mouse .... <br />
<br />
What the heck did I do ... how do I prevent it in the future and how do I fix it now???<br />

<h3> grschinon  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 v21.0.016 bug&#40;&#63;&#41; in SIP phone</h2>
                    This one had me stumped for a while...<br />
<br />
My N95 is hooked up to my own <a href="http://www.asterisk.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Asterisk</a> server and, as such, rings whenever someone calls me by VoIP or on any of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Inward_Dialing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DID numbers</a> I have attached to my VoIP account. It's logged in as extension 2002 on my server whose local IP address is 192.168.2.104.<br />
<br />
Or at least it should ring. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn't (past tense because I've figured out a workaround).<br />
<br />
I finally managed to narrow it down to the fact that it didn't like accepting anonymous calls. Indeed, if I followed my Asterisk logs when receiving an a call with no caller ID, I'd see this, and obviously the phone wouldn't ring:<br />
<br />
-- SIP/2002-081f4358 is circuit-busy<br />
[May 8 14:27:03] WARNING[3697]: chan_sip.c:12741 handle_response: Remote host can't match request BYE to call '0250387541e43c934ecdbf044e5cd73f@192.168.2.104'. Giving up.<br />
<br />
I've managed to work around the problem by adding this to my dialplan in extensions.conf:<br />
<br />
<pre><font>...<br />...<br />exten =&gt; _X.,n,Set(CID=${CALLERID(NUM)})<br />exten =&gt; _X.,n,GotoIf($[ "x${CID}" = "x0" ]?change-it)<br />exten =&gt; _X.,n,GotoIf($[ "x${CID}" = "x" ]?change-it)<br />exten =&gt; _X.,n,Goto(call-extn)<br />exten =&gt; _X.,n(change-it),Set(CALLERID(ALL)=Anonymous Coward &lt;2999&gt; )<br />exten =&gt; _X.,n(call-extn),Dial(SIP/2000&amp;SIP/2001&amp;SIP/2002,15,tT)<br />...<br />...</font></pre>
<br />
<br />
While this works, ie. the phone now rings for anonymous calls, is this not a bug in that it should accept them anyway (as it does for GSM calls) and just display "private number calling" or something similar?<br />
<br />
FWIW, I didn't have to do this on firmware v12.0.014, so this is a bit of a regression.

            didn't know if you still had this problem, but were you able to fix it? under phone options, call restriction, then internet call restriction and within that there's an anonym call restriction, which i turned 'off'.

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook app on Android automatically follows the default font size of your device. If you are looking for an option to modify how Outlook app on Android shows your email, that feature is not available but we can consider that as a good ground for a future
 update. We highly recommend that you send your feedback to our development team.</p>

            <p>This is a huge overlook. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of all the email client apps that I have tried, &nbsp;I've never had any of them limit the size of the font without the ability to customize it separately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when you zoom it doesn't auto adjust. &nbsp;You have to scroll "left to right" just to read a complete sentence.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just this feature alone make the app totally useless. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even read my emails anymore when this occurs. &nbsp;In some instances the font is just too small.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just completely unproductive and a big oversight for not getting this right. There are companies out there 1/1000 of your size that have produces better email clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>By the way, &nbsp;adjusting the font size on the device may help this app a little... But by doing this many of your other Apps will have the font sized increased and will mess up those images.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem here is with Outlook Mobile app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's hope they get it right.... &nbsp;There are many complaints going back to almost a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it weren't for the fact that this app client is forced on my device for company use, &nbsp;I would have junked it a longtime ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It lacks customizable features found in many other leading email apps.&nbsp;</p>

            I totally agree with Stephen's post. the app is almost unusable for me. I already have the display font jacked up on my Pixel XL. The problem is when the Outlook app renders the content of the email. I can see it fine at first, and then it re-displays
 in a tiny font. The fact that it does this is completely ridiculous. And for me, it only does it for some emails, not all, so I'm not sure what that's all about. I'm at the point where I'm going to have to switch to a paid application from some other vendor,
 or tell my company that I can't get the email on my phone. <br />

            Why on earth do we need to send this to outlook uservoice? &nbsp;Does anyone on the dev team actually use the app on an Android phone? &nbsp;If so, they would understand that this issue makes the app completely useless. &nbsp;Time to find a new mobile e-mail client....

</p><p>This has been a long time issue going back for more than 1yr +.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is MS taking this issue seriously because all I see is a lot of "customer service" talk about "how we appreciate your business and continue on providing feedback".... And NO action for a resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we have an eta or better understanding as to what can be done?</p>

            <p>Seems to be getting worse. The percentage of emails that convert are automatically converted to an unreadable size has increased. By unreadable I mean can you read font size 6 on a phone?

<p>Completely agree with all of this. &nbsp;Using a pixel xl and love the outlook app, except for when i have to read email. &nbsp;Has been getting worse as nearly all messages resize to fit page and pinch to zoom is nearly completely ineffective. &nbsp;Dont want to go third
 party, but if i cant read messages, what choice is there.</p>

            Finally gave up on waiting for this to be fixed, installed a new e-mail client, which works great. &nbsp;Pretty pathetic that microsoft couldn't/wouldn't get this sorted.

</p><p>1c. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Lenovo; Acer)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1d. Have you ever done a Refresh? ...a Reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1e. Has Windows 10 ever been installed?</p>

                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Nokia Lumia 730 phone is not starting. It is lying dead. What I have done so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Installed Windows Device Recovery Tool on my laptop and have tried to connect my mobile phone with USB. My mobile phone never got detected.</p>
<p>2. I have tried to press the "Down Volume" button and "Power" button for 15+ seconds to restart my mobile. It vibrated "once" but never started.</p>
<p>3. I have tried to press the "Power" button for 15+ seconds to start my mobile.&nbsp;It vibrated "once" but never started.</p>
<p>4. I have removed my battery and plugged in again. It never started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can any one of you please advise on what should be my next step?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI - I have purchased my mobile from India on August 2015 and currently I am based out of London, UK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            I cannot access my outlook email account though I can sign into my windows account.</h2>
                    <p>For the past few days I have been unable&nbsp; to access my Microsoft email account. Usually I use Hotmail.com to access it but every time I try I receive a message that it cannot be accessed at the time and to try again later. This is an old school account but
 is still active. I recently started using windows 8 and have been using the mail app but can no longer access this email from there either. It tries to have me sign in and then requests more information such as a Domain and username which I am not sure of.
 I can still access my other Hotmail account and email account though. I tried going to the Windows website. I can get into my account there and make changes to my profile and settings but am still unable to get to my email. I signed out of that and tried from
 the Hotmail.com page again but received the same message. I then went back to Windows and saw that I had been signed in again. I also tried changing my password but that hasn't helped. This is my primary email address for work and personal communication so
 I need to be able to access it soon. Help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>It's not actually a Hotmail account I'm trying to sign in to.&nbsp; The account ends in @mymail.barry.edu but I have always been able to access it from Hotmail because it is in outlook. To answer your questions, yes the same issue happens when I use a different
 browser and another computer/internet connection. I usually use Internet Explorer but have tried FireFox and a friends computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when I try to sign in I receive this message: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This account can't be used to access Outlook.com </p>

<h3> emerald77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preserving QueryDef Parameter when using DoCmd.OpenQuery</h2>
                    <p>When the following segment of code executes:<br />

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim dbs As DAO.Database<br />

<p>I am prompted for a value for SPRFNum.&nbsp; Apparently, the value contained in strSelectedSPRF, which is passed to the SPRFNum parameter, is not preserved when DoCmd.OpenQuery executes.&nbsp; Is there a way to remedy this?<br />

            <p><span>Hello </span><span>Kay_C</span>...<span> Thank you for your response<span>
</span>I am a little confused; you state<span> </span>
“</span><em><span>Please be informed that by default you can only see 5 flagged emails in your mailbox</span></em><span>”.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However on this particular e-mail address, I have 64 e-mails flagged.<span>
</span>(Above my inbox) .. Or is it, a new feature from Outlook.com that only 5 messages can be flagged up?</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I think there must be a problem with this e-mail<span>
</span>(Hotmail) account.</span></p>
<p><span>I have three different<span>
</span>e- mail (all Hotmail) accounts<span> </span>and the flagging<span>
</span>problem is only with<span> </span>this e-mail address (the one I am
<span>sending this </span>from).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is;- &nbsp;1) No option<span>
</span>to flag<span> </span>as well as<span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span>2) Not even a grey<span>
</span>area showing a flag<span> </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This applies if I sign in via Chrome via Microsoft..Via Outlook; not sure if that is Outlook or Outlook.com.. As well as via Internet Explorer..</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Also what or where is;<strong> “</strong></span><em><span>You need to click on Flagged link to see all your flagged messages.</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>”
 ?<span> </span></span></strong><span>Maybe/perhaps,<span>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Kay, You also recommended that I
</span><span>optimize<span>&nbsp;my account..I am a little reluctant to do this, as I am fearful that I might lose a lot of
</span></span><span><span>infor</span></span><span>mation..Could you tell me please, what I will lose<span>
</span>and keep if I<span> </span></span><span>optimize<span>&nbsp;my account?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I do not have another computer to try this problem on.. Just my (this) laptop</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Corinne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your time coming back to us. Let me further assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding my colleague said about "<em><span>by default you can only see 5 flagged emails in your mailbox</span></em><span>”, that is actually correct. If you enable the option to show up the flagged emails at the top of you inbox,
 it will show up the first 5 flagged emails. To enable it, you can follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Login to Outlook.com.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the gear icon at the upper right and select&nbsp;<strong>Options</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Under <strong>Customizing Outlook.com</strong>, select <strong>
Flagging</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Under <strong>Flagging</strong>, select </span><strong>Show flagged messages at the top of the inbox</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, go back to your Inbox to check if your flagged messages are there. Like what&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e606df94-5608-49ec-8498-b09459053b70" title="Kay_C.">Kay_C.</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;said,
 you can see all your flagged messages by clicking the&nbsp;<strong>Flagged </strong>link below your flagged messages. See the Screen shot below:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cb0ae45-ecc8-4f5c-a39c-6f7abf31f380" /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If ever you can't see the flagged icon to flag your emails, it is possible that your&nbsp;<strong>Instant actions</strong> is disabled. To enable it, please follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Login to Outlook.com.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the gear icon at the upper right and select&nbsp;<strong>Options</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Under&nbsp;</span><strong>Customizing Outlook.com</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">, select&nbsp;<strong>Instant actions</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Select&nbsp;<strong>Show instant actions</strong> and click
<strong>Save</strong> button.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once this option is enabled, you will now see grey flag in the left side of the subject of your emails. Just click on the flag to flagged it. You can also flagged an email by selecting an email by clicking the checkbox at the right side of the email and
 click the ellipsis (<strong>...</strong>) button. Lastly, select&nbsp;<strong>Flag</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question regarding optimizing; what&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e606df94-5608-49ec-8498-b09459053b70" title="Kay_C.">Kay_C.</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;suggested is to&nbsp;</span><span>clear
 browser's cache and temporary internet files for your web browser. Optimizing your web browser will fasten up the processing speed of your web browser and&nbsp;</span>fix many browser problems simply by clearing your cache<span>.
 It will not affect your account and will not lose any information on your account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other concern or question, don't hesitate to inform us and we'll be happy to assist you.</p>

<h2>            How to have some user mails on office 365 with others on GoDaddy Cpanel email</h2>
                    <p>My company has 1000+ users which were created on godaddy cpanel email. We had been using this to receive and send mails until we purchased 100 user license on O365 and migrated them to it. We changed our MX records and TXT records to reflect the O365 parameters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we noticed that the remaining users could not use send and receive mails like before. My question is how do I ensure that the remaining users on cpanel email can send &amp; receive mails while ensuring that O365 users can do the same.</p>

<p>Hello Bayo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, when you purchased Office 365 license, the default domain should be &lt;xx&gt;.onmicorosft.com. And, you needn't change the MX records and TXT records, since under the default onmicrosoft.com
 domain, every setting has been configured. You only need to assign the license to the users.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your case, may I know if you use those Office 365 users' original Cpanel email's domain as a custom domain for them in your organization? Please clarify it in details.&nbsp;<span>Meanwhile,
 how do you migrate these users? IMAP migration? &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Rudy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the default domain was in the format xx.onmicrosoft.com but I added my organization domain using the recommended settings which led to the change of the mx records and txt records. All mails are currently routed to O365. Yes, I used IMAP migration for
 the mail migration.</p>

<p>Hello Bayo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Form your description, it's an normal behavior that the remaining users are affected by the changed DNS records of your original domain .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this situation, we recommend that you restore your DNS records for use by all users. For Office 365 users, you first verify the custom domain in Office365, then forwarding the mails from your
 mail server to the Office 365 EOP, and then distribute the mails to Office 365 users who have the custom domain by setting up the
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj945194%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Internal Relay</a>. Or, let the 100 Office 365 users use the default Office 365 account or use a new custom domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the above information helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Rudy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. </p>
<p>I read through your suggestion and the part I understand is reverting the mx records to the original values and setup mail forwarding from the existing mail server to O365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mail forwarding as regards receiving mails seems understandable but I need clarification on how sending mails would work especially cos its coming from a custom domain and I want it to seem like its coming from the actual user on the main domain i.e
 rather than xx.onmicrosoft.com, it should be in the main domain format.<br />
Kindly describe the other scenarios asides reverting the mx records to previous configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Given this situation, after you revert the MX records, you may let the 100 Office 365 users use the default xx.onmicrosoft.com account or verify a new custom domain as I mentioned above.

            hi mate,<br />
<br />
have you checked via Nokia suite on PC or on the device itself if there are any firmawre updates available? if there is, please update to the latest version offered. failing that, you can try re-installing the current firmware thru Nokia Suite on PC, and if
 that doesn't work, perform a soft reset.

<h3> stevenkegel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sending bulk emails from Pastel</h2>
                    <p>Good Day</p>
<p>
</p><p>Machine details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop with Windows 7 Pro x64</p>
<p>Microsoft Office 2010 Home &amp; Business x86</p>
<p>Email account is on Office 365</p>
<p>Pastel Evolution</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a client that uses Pastel Evolution only on a desktop and sends out Invoices in bulk, normally about 30 to 50 emails at once. I have found that it is definitely not a Pastel issue but an issue in Outlook.<br />
<br />
What she needs to do is change the "From" email address for some of the invoices but not all. So she can't change the default email address in Pastel because she uses multiple email addresses.<br />
<br />
What she normally does is turn on "Working Offline" in Outlook and then the emails sit in the "Outbox" and then she changes the "From" email address for each invoice and then turns off "Working Offline" so they all send at once when she has completed changing
 the email addresses.<br />
<br />
The issue that's happening now is "Working Offline" will be ON and it will show "Working Offline" at the bottom of the window like normal, she will send the bulk invoices from Pastel and they will pour into the "Outbox" and they won't stay. The emails will
 start leaving the "Outbox" even though "Working Offline" is enabled and it will no longer show "Working Offline" but "Connected to Microsoft Exchange".<br />
<br />
How do I fix that? We need the emails to remain in the "Outbox" until each invoice has it's correct email address to send from.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Steven</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Generally, the Microsoft datacenter region is determined by the value of Country or region that you selected when you signed up for Office 365. To know which data center is for your Office 365 account, we at least need to know where your tenant is chosen
 to be created. For the end user, please contact your Office 365 admin to know the place and then refer to this site to have an understanding on O365 datacenters:
<a href="http://o365datacentermap.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Where is my data?</a></p>
<p>For the Office 365 admin, you may visit the link above, and find&nbsp;more information about how Microsoft selects a datacenter here:

<h2>            Files Not Appearing in One Drive online or on Local PC</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 with Office 2016 installed via Office 365. I recently started using OneDrive for Business. I received a Word document as an e-mail attachment. I saved the attachment to a folder in OneDrive via Outlook. I later used File Explorer to
 locate the file I saved and it does not appear. I went back to Outlook to save the file to the same location again and I received a message about overwriting a file. I saved the file again and went back to File Explorer to locate the file but it was still
 not there. I also checked OneDrive Online and the file did not appear. The file I saved appears to be in the OneDrive folder but does not appear in File Explorer or One Drive Online.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have 22 files with Sync Errors. When I go to the file locations in File Explorer, the files to not appear. If I delete the entire folder where the file with the Sync Error is said to exist, the Sync Error still does not go away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I locate the files I have saved as well as locate the files with the Sync Errors so I can correct the issue?</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>File corruption might be a possible reason why you can't access your file. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First, we need to determine if the issue is with OneNote or OneDrive. This way, we can isolate the root cause and provide the most suitable solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you checked if there are any missing files in your OneDrive aside from your OneNote notebooks?</li><li>If there are OneNote notebooks not saved in OneDrive, can you still access them?</li><li>Were there any recent changes made on your device?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response. </p>

<p>Hi Maureen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to provide the best answer to why files are not opening, we'll be needing additional information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you confirm if you were trying to access a OneNote notebook in OneDrive?</li><li>What do you mean by "<strong>My last name changed</strong>"? Was it your user account name or folder name?<br />
</li><li>Did you receive any error messages when trying to access your old name files?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of the error message?</li><li>Were there any significant changes made on your device prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

            It's a new Surface Pro 4, so original settings. I had not set up OneDrive, so it is strictly a OneNote 2016 issue as far as i can tell.
