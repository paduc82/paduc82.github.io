<h2>            Caption is not moving with table.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, <br />
<br />
I made a table the with of the page. As I continued writing the text that was supposed to continue below the table and its caption moved inbetween the table and the caption.<br />
<br />
When I try to cut the misplaced text and paste it below the caption, the text lands in the caption which is very irritating - and makes me want to switch back to LateX...<br />

<p>When you first create the table and caption, both are inline with text. Then you drag the table, that turns it into a floating object. But you haven't changed your caption into a floating object, so it stays with the text where it was created. This is exactly
 what I was referring to in point #2 of my previous reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, please <strong>select both</strong> the table and the caption,<strong> Cut</strong>&nbsp;them, then
<strong>Paste</strong> them into your preferred location. This keeps both items inline with text and together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A more complicated solution would be to cut the caption, paste it into a text box placed below the table, move the text box anchor to be attached to the table and lock it, then set the text box position to be relative to the table. Then you can drag the
 table and the caption will follow it. This method could interfere with the caption appearing in a Table of Tables, if you use that. I can give you complete steps if you don't understand this description.</p>

            As the error message indicates there are policies on the server that your admin wishes to enforce. Many of these are not supported by Nseries devices, so if your admin further makes support for these mandatory, you will not be able to sync.<br />
<br />
Probably your admin wants to enforce a device lock with password.<br />
<br />
Have you been able to contact your admin?<br />

            Strangely enough Roadsync worked first time, so it is obviously a quirk with M4E.

            Roadsync connects differently to MfE though I think, so the settings wouldn't necessarily be the same...<br />
<br />
Definitely sounds like your Administrator/Network Manager is the person to speak to.

            Yes, it is a huge price increase, from US$150 for 3 2010 Home and Student users to 3xUS$140 2013, or US$100 per year for Office 365 (2013).<br />
<br />
There is no definitive word from MS yet. <br />
<br />
My interpretation is opposite to Trip's. From what I've read, the "pre-launch offer" gives you 2013 in addition to your 2010 purchase.&nbsp; You can run both.<br />
<br />
<b>Is the 2010 to 2013 “Pre-launch Offer” an “upgrade” license that replaces the 2010 license, or is it a “free, additional” license you can run in parallel with the 2010 license you used to redeem the 2013 offer?</b>
<p><br />
What I've based my personal interpretation on is all of the articles I've read and the specific terms of the offer
</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/offer/pre-launch-offer-details-and-terms-FX102902434.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/offer/pre-launch-offer-details-and-terms-FX102902434.aspx</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><br />
Get the next version of Office free, when available: When you receive your e-mail from Microsoft, follow the instructions and redeem the Offer at
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/offer/redir/FX102901464.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office.com/offer</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;/snip</p>
<p><b>you get the next version, 2013, free. No mention of replacing existing license.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This image of an MS scree: <a href="http://img3.picload.org/image/arcdpwg/e_you_have_no_ch.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://img3.picload.org/image/arcdpwg/e_you_have_no_ch.png</a> shows that it explicitly says you can keep 2010 Home and Student when you take Office 365 Home Premimum (2013).</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><br />
Offer limitations include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Offer cannot be redeemed after the <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/offer/pre-launch-offer-details-and-terms-FX102902434.aspx#Period" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
redemption end date</a> has passed.</li><li>Limited to one (1) Office product for each corresponding qualifying Office 2010 or Office for Mac 2011 product purchased, up to the maximum allowed.</li><li>Limited to twenty-five (25) Offer redemptions per person or organization. Please note that each Microsoft account e-mail address and password (formerly Windows Live ID) may only redeem a total of five (5) Office 365 Home Premium
 subscriptions. If you would like to purchase more than five (5) qualifying Office products, and redeem more than five (5) Office 365 Home Premium subscriptions, you will need to use additional Microsoft accounts during the redemption process.</li><li>No returns on software downloaded through the site.</li><li>This offer is non-transferable.</li><li>Microsoft reserves the right to reject any redemption request deemed in Microsoft's sole discretion to be false or fraudulent, submission of multiple requests and/or providing false information or redemption requests that are
 otherwise ineligible.</li></ul>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
<b>No mention of not being able to continue using the old version ...</b><br />
<br />
Previously, when you bought an "upgrade" version or were given the "free upgrade" in the equivalent offer it was made clear that the "upgrade" version required proof of a "qualifying" (aka older) version and the terms explicitly said that the new license replaced
 the old one. You could have one or the other installed.<br />
<br />
This "upgrade" point is not made in the Pre-launch Offer terms and conditions nor did I see it in the 2013 RTM MS License Terms document.<br />
<br />
For example, in the 2007 MSLT it explicitly said this:<br />
<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
13.&nbsp; <b>UPGRADE OR CONVERSION.</b>&nbsp; To upgrade or convert software, you must <br />
first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade or <br />
conversion.&nbsp; Upon upgrade or conversion, this agreement takes the place <br />
of the agreement for the software you upgraded or converted from.&nbsp; <b>After <br />
you upgrade or convert, you may no longer use the earlier version of the <br />
software you upgraded or converted from. </b><br />
&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
&lt;snip 2013 MSLT&gt;<br />
<i>What about upgrading or converting the software? If you install the software covered by this agreement as an upgrade or conversion to your existing software, then the upgrade or conversion replaces the original software that you are upgrading or
 converting from. <b>&nbsp;You do not retain any rights to the original software after you have upgraded and you may not continue to use it or transfer it in any way. This agreement governs your rights to use the upgrade software and replaces the agreement for the
 software from which you upgraded.</b><br />
</i>&lt;snip&gt;<br />
<br />
That is a restatement of the terms from the 2007 license. BUT !!! I don't recall seeing the use of the term "Upgrade" anywhere in the "Pre-Launch Offer".&nbsp; In 2007 and earlier "upgrade versions" the product was explicitly and clearly labeled as an upgrade. It
 simply would not install without the qualifying version present.&nbsp; That is not true with 2013, or even 2010.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So my interpretation is that the copy of 2013 you get using the "Pre-launch Offer" is just that, a FREE, ADDITIONAL copy of Office, independent of the 2010 license you used to redeem the offer.&nbsp; I haven't yet seen references from MS to contradict that interpretation.
<br />
<br />
Yes, I agree that changing the "Retail License" terms the way they did was a&nbsp; ********** marketing trick, since the offer is NOT equivalent to the original purchased copy. But since the offer is a "free" copy, they can do what they want.<br />
<br />
Personally, I understand the desire to milk all of the money they can out of the Office brand, but they could have very simply avoided this criticism by not using the label "retail" on this type of license.&nbsp; They already had several other labels for the new
 license terms, or they could have made a new one. I'm talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>OEM - Original Equipment Manufacturer,&nbsp; </li><li>MLK - Medialess Kit, 2007 and earlier)&nbsp; </li><li>PKC - Product Key Card, introduced in 2010</li><li>POSA - Point of Sale Activated</li><li>ESD - Electronic Software Download</li><li>1-computer online download</li></ul>
<p>With all of those options, instead they decided to hide the severely downgraded license terms by reusing the "retail" label.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Hi Deon,<br />
<br />
1. Please check under the Project, you must have some task assigned to yourself, without which you won't be able to see any task for time logging.<br />
2. In case tasks have been assigned to you but still you can't see them, then use your project manager account to check whether you have "Closed tasks for update". If yes then you can't log your time against closed tasks in that project.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, we'd suggest you post the issue to the <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/projectserver/en-US/home?forum=projectonline&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TechNet Project Online forum</a> as they are experts in this field. We appreciate your understanding.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Sheen</p>

            I never update my OS until it's been out for a few months and is debugged. But I've read lots of reports of people having problems with 2011 under Mojave. Printing issues seem fairly common.

                    <p>How do you add multiple users at once to your Class OneNote? Eg. For a teacher to add in all students in her class rather than adding in each individual name, or for a specialist teacher to add 2 or 3 classes at a time, rather than typing in 80 names/email

<h2>            Bookings App Questions</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been trying out the Bookings app and I have a few questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) When clients book an appointment on my website, they are sent to a page where they can cancel or reschedule appointments. Is there a way to remove those buttons? I have a strict cancellation procedure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) I am also having trouble connecting the booking calendar to my staff's personal calendar. I have selected "Events on Office 365 calendar affect availability" under Staff's Availability but it has not made any changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.) I have added a form for "Additional Information" under Booking but am unhappy with the layout. Is there a way to customize it?&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting the queries you encountered in our forum. I did some test and research, and the suggestions as follow:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the question 1, there is no such a setting to remove the buttons Reschedule and Cancel booking in the confirmation message. This confirm button is designed by the system and we can’t modified on our side.
</p>
<p>For the question 2, please help check if the staff can view the calendar under “Other Calendar”. If not, please refer to the following link and give it a shot to see if it helps?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-this-staff-member-s-calendar-can-t-be-synced-4a016269-ff27-4f12-9825-7101128e8124?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-this-staff-member-s-calendar-can-t-be-synced-4a016269-ff27-4f12-9825-7101128e8124?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the question 3, do you mean you are not happy with the user interface of Business information? If yes, the layout can’t be customized now. I suggest submitting your feedback in the user voice for Microsoft Bookings via the following link, the related
 team will review the feedback and consider it. Your understanding will be highly appreciated.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for your response.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This looks like an issue on the operating system, but let us know if you have uninstalled and re-installed Office 2016?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try reinstalling Office 2016 and check if it helps.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, before reinstalling Office 2016, try uninstalling the Arabic language pack for Office 2016 and re-install it. Restart the computer after re-install and check
 if it helps to resolve the issue. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above steps do not help, it would be better for you to just un-install Office 2016 currently installed on your computer using the FIXIT tool (</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</span></span></a><span><span>)
 and after restarting the computer, re-install and re-activate Office 2016 from your My Account page (</span><a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://office.com/myaccount</span></a><span>).
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if the above steps help to resolve the issue.

            <p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c9791814-1fd4-4401-964e-0be43bb31d63" title="MeganMickles">
MeganMickles</a>. I understand how you feel. Did you install those apps on your phone's memory or SD&nbsp;card if there's any?&nbsp;Since you've already performed a factory reset on your phone, you may try disabling some apps that are not needed to run in the background.
 Manage these under the Battery Saver app. Check also if there's an update available from Settings &gt; phone update. In case there's no new update, making sure that all system apps are up to date by going to Settings &gt; applications &gt; store &gt; check for updates
 may also help. For the Wi-Fi issue, try these fixes: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA141362" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Outlook calendar SMS notifications</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Outlook 2010 on Exchange 2013. Due to corporate policy, I'm not permitted to access my calendar on any non-corporate device, so I'm using the calendar SMS notifications to see my daily agenda and be notified of meeting alerts. This is most important
 to me in the morning before I get to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an adequate workaround, until my morning schedule changes after I have received my daily agenda.
<strong>I'd like to set up an alert to notify me immediately&nbsp;if I receive any new or updated meeting invites.
</strong>I can't find any Outlook rule options that would work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions? </p>

<p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We can see here that you want to set up an alert to notify you for meeting invites. We suggest that you check this
<strong><a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/options/calendarreminders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and log in to your account so you can set a reminder for calendar notifications. If you are not permitted to access your calendar
 on any non-corporate device, you can also get in touch with your IT/admin to remove the restriction or atleast change some settings on their end since you are using Outlook 2010 on Exchange 2013.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need clarifications, feel free to message us again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            I tried to install, but it required me to reboot before it begun and that erased the install files...</h2>
                    <p>When it finished downloading the 3GB update and started the install, it ran the Upgrade program that checks if your PC is compatible with the upgrade. The Upgrade program reported that my antivirus software was incompatible and told me to uninstall it, so
 I did. The Antivirus uninstaller required me to reboot the PC to complete the uninstall. I tell the Antivirus uninstaller to finish after manually restarting the PC and then I told the Upgrade program to cancel, this caused it to perform a very long "Clean
 up" phase before saying it was safe to close it.<br />
<br />
I reboot the PC to complete the antivirus uninstall.<br />
<br />
I re-run Windows Update.<br />
<br />
It is now re-downloading the 3GB update AGAIN.<br />
<br />
Time for me to get the ISO, this way the installation media can't be "lost" because of **** software design (I was never informed that cancelling the "compatibility adviser" program, that is not the Windows Setup program, would erase the setup files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still unsure if it can handle Dynamic Disks during the installation because Microsoft continues to never mention compatibility with it anywhere for the installation, I'll report back angrily if Windows (in general) still refuses to detect any partitions
 for installation.</p>

            <p>I am quite surprised, the installation process does support Dynamic Disks. I've tried Windows XP Home, Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows 8.1 Pro in the past and none of them supported it so this was a pretty nice surprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this compatibility remains in the final version of the product and isn't exclusive to high tiers of the product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed a fresh install (Formatted my old install after backing up files) via bootable DVD disc without issue.</p>

<p>I don't think this is a job for Word. There are a range of programs where this is possible but lets assume you have Microsoft Excel on your machine&nbsp;as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a new Excel workbook, go to Insert Shapes &gt; Text Box and drag a big text box onto the page. Type your character in that text box and set its size to 1000pt. Make sure the text box is big enough to show the whole character. Now print that.</p>

            ActiveSync gets disconnected on my computer all the time. I have started disabling my firewall when connected and it has made such a difference.&nbsp; That's the first thing I would try if I were having issues like yours. Then I'd disable my antivirus software
 next if that didn't resolve the issue.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having the same problem trying to upgrade my pocket pc from mobile 5 to 6. Active Sync disconnects after a few seconds. A error no comes up: 260, but it just says disconnection problem. I have tried various times on my vista desktop plus
 once on a neighbours xp, but the same happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you manage to solve it? If so, what did you do please?</p>
        </p>

<p>I have not completely solved it, but I found that switching from the USB port on&nbsp;my laptop&nbsp;docking station to the USB port on the laptop has&nbsp;greatly&nbsp;decreased the frequency.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had considered the antivirus/firewall as potential source but unfortunately this is on my work PC and the firewall settings are locked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may also be related to AvantGo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other ideas are welcome.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.microsoft.com%2fWindowsMobile%2fWebResource.axd%3fd%3dNySzF1eivP_rMoc50GQJzcvS4MHMOEKwYrCIgDtzuzlw7GsNki3H_INlfYaLgkxFdA4ESFRtesEUXj11MHjIL5WMBvm3Pubiu_iWcnqAaGQ1%26amp%3bt%3d633337194230757564" /></p>
