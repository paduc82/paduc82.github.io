    <title>Printing to OneNote Windows 10 app cuts off margins of all documents - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Printing to OneNote Windows 10 app cuts off margins of all documents with no controls to fix&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My users have been suffering with this every day since we were forced to use OneNote Windows 10 after MS ripped it out of the Office 365 installer.&nbsp; We are rolling out Teams and heavily rely on OneNote to "print" documents into the Team Notebooks.&nbsp; I have
 called o365 support, they told me I now have to pay Windows support since our problem is in OneNote Win 10 and not OneNote 2016 so they no longer support OneNote.&nbsp; I have submitted feedback via the OneNote Win 10 app, I've submitted in UserVoice, I've commented
 on other's questions here and also in other's user voice submissions.&nbsp; I've seen no response from anyone on the OneNote team as to why such a fundamentally simple problem ever made it into the wild and why no one will fix this simple problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is probably most frustrating is that if we print to OneNote 2016 this worked perfectly every time.&nbsp; If we print the same document to OneNote Win 10 app, it fails EVERY time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone out there ever print to OneNote Win 10 and see their document cut off on top/bottom left/right margins?&nbsp; Anyone here on the OneNote team, ever use ONeNote and try to print a document to OneNote win 10?</p>

<p>Hi CRogers3,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really sorry for the trouble caused by this issue when printing using OneNote for Windows 10. We could understand the frustration when encountering it and we feel sorry as it affects your
 work. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are willing, you can still install OneNote 2016 by downloading it from this article:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-or-reinstall-onenote-2016-for-windows-c08068d8-b517-4464-9ff2-132cb9c45c08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install or reinstall OneNote 2016 for Windows</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the issue in OneNote for Window 10, I try testing from my side but cannot reproduce the symptom for "document cut off on top/bottom left/right margins".
</p>
<p>I would like to confirm following information, thanks for your time and help:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Before printing documents from OneNote, when you click the 3 dots from upper-right corner&gt;Print&gt;in the "Printing to on" page, does the document display fine in print preview?</p>
<p>Could you please share with us screenshots about the issue symptom?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Have you tried Repair OneNote via Windows Settings&gt;Apps &amp; features&gt;find OneNote, click Advanced options.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note: we suggest you ensure all notes have been synced to OneDrive online before testing, or please backup those unsynced notes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Does this issue occur when you print a specific OneNote page?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.What is the version of your OneNote for Windows 10?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>Tina,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thank you for actually listening and reaching out to me about this problem!&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't think you understand the actual problem we are having.&nbsp; We have a problem when
<strong>printing</strong> from any program <strong>to OneNote</strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">.</span>&nbsp; We are
<strong>not</strong> Printing <strong>from OneNote</strong>.&nbsp; Printing from OneNote has always been a disaster so we avoid this at all costs.&nbsp; Our problem is when we try to print any other documents
<strong>INTO OneNote</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem exists on all 33 of my users and on all computers with OneNote Windows 10.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if they are domain joined, o365, or personal PC's using a MSA account and OneNote Win 10.&nbsp; The common denominator is OneNote Win 10.&nbsp; I feel the problem
 is actually the implementation of the OneNote Print Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached two screenshots illustrating the difference between printing a Word Document to OneNote 2016 vs. printing to OneNote Win 10.&nbsp; I am happy to work with you and provide
<strong>any information</strong> possible to help you learn more about this problem.&nbsp; Just let me know what you need.</p>

<p>I found a few more clues while trying to get screenshots of another type of report we&nbsp; print to OneNote.&nbsp; This report does not offer a print preview so I had to actually finish printing to OneNote 2016 and OneNote.&nbsp; What I noticed was not only do the margins
 look different but the object in OneNote is also completely different.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The object in OneNote Win 10 comes in with a "container" which has its own grey border and the image of the printout can be "saved as" a .png file.&nbsp; The object in OneNote 2016 does not appear to have a container and when you right-click on it the "save-as"
 button is greyed out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has to be another clue that MS can look into to see why the prints are treated differently.&nbsp; See attached pics.</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for my misunderstanding.
</p>
<p>Thank you for clarifying the situation and sharing screenshots for details, this helps us have a better understanding of the issue.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Seems the affected document has header set in it. If it is convenient, could you please share a test document in
</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox"><span>private message</span></a><span>? I will check if I can reproduce and see if there is anything causing the cut off issue or any setting that can be modified
 when printing document to OneNote for Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I'd like to know information below:</p>
<p>1.Your OneDrive for Windows 10 version. (3 dots&gt;Settings&gt;About)</p>
<p>2.In your Word app, please click File&gt;Account, capture a full screenshot of

<p>Thanks for sharing the other information your found when testing. OneNote for Windows 10 and OneNote 2016 are not totally same product, there are features available only in OneNote for Windows
 10 or OneNote 2016, so I assume some behaviors will be different between them.</p>
<p><span>I suggest you refer to this article
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-s-the-difference-between-onenote-and-onenote-2016-a624e692-b78b-4c09-b07f-46181958118f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>What's the difference between OneNote and OneNote 2016?</span></a><span> to

<p><span>In this thread, I would suggest focus on printing with OneNote for Windows 10 cuts off document margins. Your understanding is highly appreciated.</span></p>

<p>It doesn't matter what version of OneNote or Word you are using.&nbsp; EVERY version of OneNote Win 10 exhibits this behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is happening on my work PC using OneNote Version 16001.11629.20028.0.&nbsp; &nbsp; My Word application is at version 1905 (Build 11629.20214 Click-to-Run).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And trying not to be to snarky here, but <strong>every long time user</strong> of OneNote Desktop application (Win32) knows FULL WELL that OneNote Win 10 is not the same version!&nbsp; It is a far inferior product that is missing functionality and has problems
 with other functionality (printing).&nbsp; I could write a book here about all the ways Microsoft has done its customers wrong by forcing us onto this unfinished and far inferior product.&nbsp; I myself have come to live with and actually kind of like the new App but
 I am still upset because Microsoft should never have done this without FIRST getting it
<strong>feature complete</strong> and <strong>equal to</strong> the exisiting OneNote Program.&nbsp; This printing problem is a perfect example.&nbsp; They said "we need to be able to let people Print To OneNote just like OneNote 2016".&nbsp; Someone made a feeble attempt
 to do this and the second they were able to print anything to OneNote Win 10 they called it done.&nbsp; No one bothered to realize it doesn't do this at all similar to OneNote 2016.&nbsp; The image is different, the margins get cut off and the container is completely
 different, so it is in no way done or equal to the old functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until MS finishes making OneNote Win 10 equal to the old OneNote I will never be happy.&nbsp; However, this topic is really just about the margin problem so I will end my rant and get back to the problem at hand.&nbsp; If you are able to help me fix this problem it
 will be one more baby step closer to getting the new OneNote to be as good as the old OneNote!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for looking into this,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all the information you provided, and we appreciate your report about this case. Tina has transferred this thread to me, and I will keep following this case for you.</p>
<p>Based on our test with both your test document and our own created document, we can reproduce this behavior as yours. The only workaround is to put all the content inside the margin range or use OneNote 2016 temporarily. We need to confirm this behavior
 with related team about this case. This may take some days to get response. But we will post back once we get any updates from them.
</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience again.</p>

</p><p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your patience to wait for our updates. After confirming with the related team, it is not recommended to make content exceed the margins. We understand that there are different results among print to PDF/printer/OneNote 2016/OneNote for Windows
 10, but the expected behavior is to keep content within the margins to avoid the cut off issue.

<p>Rena,</p>
<p>&nbsp; This is about the most unhelpful response I've ever received!!&nbsp; We print documents everyday and have done so successfully for the last 10 years.&nbsp; ALL of our documents print correctly to real printers etc.&nbsp; All of the documents we receive from customers
 print correctly to all printers including OneNote 2016.&nbsp; Almost none of these same documents EVER print correctly to OneNote Win 10.&nbsp; If we had a problem shouldn't the margins be cut off everywhere on every printer on every document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestion is almost like telling me to go through every document we have or will ever create in our business and reset the margins such that they will print to the OneNote Win 10 "printer".&nbsp; Imagine me being a Dell printer user and buying a new HP
 LASERJET only to find the new HP cuts off the margins.&nbsp; Imagine I call HP to complain and report the problem and they answer me by suggesting I change all my documents to have margins small enough for the HP to successfully print them without cutting off even
 though all the Dell printers work fine.&nbsp; Ridiculous!&nbsp; Should I call my customers and vendors as well, and ask them to adjust the margins on all documents they send us so that they will successfully print to OneNote Win 10?!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think about what you are asking!&nbsp; The problem only showed up when we started using OneNote Win 10.&nbsp; I believe there is a problem with the OneNote print driver or at the very least, a lack of control options in the driver to allow successful printing.&nbsp; The
 MOST frustrating part of this is that the OneNote 2016 and OneNote Win 10 "printers" give wildly different results.&nbsp; Both of these "printers" were created by Microsoft.&nbsp; Why isn't Microsoft able to look at their own code, and identify why one printer works
 correctly and see what is different about the other "printer" that works incorrectly and totally different?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reconsider throwing my question over the fence to User Voice and take a deeper look at this.&nbsp; I beg of you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2011 is Setting Up Identity after every reboot</h2>
                    I am running OS X 10.8.5 and Outlook 2011 for Mac version 14.3.7. &nbsp;Both are completely up to date according to the App Store and Microsoft Autoupdate. &nbsp;In recent weeks, every time I start Outlook after I boot/reboot the computer or even just log out and
 log back in, the Outlook splash screen reports that it is "Setting up identity," which takes about 10 minutes. &nbsp;I have been Googling solutions and trying them for days, to no avail. &nbsp;After following every step in many "solutions," the problem persists after
 every re-boot. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I expected the following would finally solve the problem, but it did not.
<div>1. I deleted all Identities (all content) within /documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities.</div>
<div>2. In System Preferences, I deleted the two email accounts I use (an Exchange account and a Gmail account).</div>
<div>3. I ran "Repair Disk Permissions" within Disk Utility (both "normally" and after starting the computer in Recovery Mode.</div>
<div>4. After a fresh boot, I set up a new Identity called Main Identity in&nbsp;in Microsoft Database Utility and clicked "Rebuild."</div>
<div>5. I opened Outlook, which opened rapidly since there were no accounts,</div>
<div>6. Under Tools...Accounts...I successfully added my Exchange Account and then my Gmail account.</div>
<div>7. I let Outlook sync/download all content for all folders, watching the Progress window until absolutely everything downloaded. &nbsp;Everything seems to be in order. So long as I don't re-boot, Office opens fast and normally (no Setting up Identity delay).</div>
<div>8. I quit and shutdown and rebooted in Safe Mode.</div>
<div>9. I shift-opened Outlook to start it in it's "safe mode" which was quick and successful. I closed Outlook and shutdown.</div>
<div>10. I booted into Recovery Mode and ran the Repair Disk Permissions in the Disk Utility and ran Repair Disk for good measure. (No problems).</div>
<div>11. I rebooted normally, waited until everything "calmed down" and started Outlook normally. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But, it still took about 10 minutes to Set up identity again after all this!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am out of ideas and suggestions that I can find with Google. It can't be a corrupted Identity after all this, can it? &nbsp;Unless someone can offer a suggestion that works, my next two options that I can think of are to have my organization reinstall Office
 and install all updates and if that doesn't work, the nuclear option of reinstalling OS X and starting from scratch all over. &nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help will be appreciated!</div>

            You have done almost everything.<br />
The things left are a new identity and new user account so try that.<br />
Also what type of an account is configured in outlook.<br />

            Thank you, ArshadKhan19. &nbsp;As per above, I did try creating a new Identity, several times, actually. That alone, or in conjunction with other steps, such as outlined above, never solved the issue of it being rebuilt after every boot up. &nbsp;I haven't yet tried
 creating a new User and I will when I get to work, but I consider that kind if "nuclear" option that I'd rather avoid. &nbsp;It will necessitate setting everything else up all over again and won't I lose my ability to use backups from my Time Machine? &nbsp;I am still
 hoping someone knows about a solution to repair whatever must be corrupted within my existing User profile. &nbsp;I will try creating a new User as a test, however, because if the problem occurs there, then the problem must be at either the Office/Outlook level
 or at the OS X level and maybe an Office reinstall action will be the cure. &nbsp;I haven't tried that option yet either.
<div><br />
<div>The two email accounts I'm using are Gmail and a workplace-provided Exchange account. &nbsp;I have an iMac and MacBook Air set up at home the same way, without this problem, but they do access everything differently since I'm not connecting through my work
 intranet at home.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again!</div>

            It sounds like a corrupted Preference file.&nbsp;
<div>You could test that by using the same identity (or setting up a new one) in a different user account on your Mac.</div>
<div>I would dig in ~/Library/Preferences and delete anything related to Outlook there.</div>
<div>You wouldn't miss much since most account settings are in the identity itself, but the database utility for instance could be acting up because of one of these preference files.</div>

            Thanks, cortig, &nbsp;I have tried that at some point in my several days of trying suggestions I have found online. &nbsp;But, I might not have been "systematic" enough in that perhaps that needs to be done in conjunction with other steps (like creating a new identity,
 and/or making sure the database daemon (whatever that is!) is not running, and so on). &nbsp; If you or anyone can elaborate on exactly which files to delete and any other steps which should be done in coordination with this, I will be grateful and will give it
 a try.

            Same issue here. Permanent rebuilding the database on system startup!! It’s driving me crazy. I am using 3 Exchange accounts in Mac Outlook 14.3.9, MacOS 10.7.5. It’s also happening on MacOS 10.9.2 too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here’s what I did so far<br />
- I deleted all content within /documents/Microsoft User Data/<br />
- I added all exchange accounts and I’ve waited over 24 hours until the Progress window synchronized all items.<br />
- I’ve repaired permissions.&nbsp;<br />
- Next day, Outlook starts rebuilding the identity again!?!?<br />
<br />
<br />
I’ve repeated this process 3x times. Outlook seems to love rebuilding its identity.<br />
<br />
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?<br />
<br />
<br />
Really appreciate your help.

Yes, I’ve followed your comments. Deleting all com.microsoft files didn’t work. As I mentioned it’s not related to one specific computer. This kind of behavior is happening on a brand new macbook running 10.9 too.</p>

<h2>            Why have the Excel linked data types disappeared&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using the linked data types function in Excel for the past few months without any problems and suddenly March 8th or March 9th 2019, those options under "Data" in the ribbon have disappeared and all cells in excel spreadsheets using those data
 types are not working. Nothing new was installed by me, not sure if an update was applied and I have not changed location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Office Home &amp; Student 2016 for PC licence that I purchased and have been using since June of 2017. This replaced an Office 365 subscription that expired in July 2017. Not sure if this is related since I'm not sure if this feature should only be
 working for subscribed members? But if so, why has it been available all this time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi  MarcMelis1 
<br />
<br />thank you for posting your query. I understand you are attempting to have the Excel linked data types 
<br />
<br />At this time, only Excel 2016 for Office 365 subscribers supports the Stocks and Geography data types. Other versions of Excel may eventually support these data types, as we are continually improving Excel. If you open these new data types in a version of Excel that doesn't support them, #VALUE! will appear for those cells. And #NAME? will appear in place of any formulas that reference these data types.
<br />
<br />Note: November 27, 2018. Data types have been released to all Windows Office 365 subscribers, except in a few geopolitical locations (coming soon). If you are an Office 365 subscriber, make sure you have the latest version of Office.
<br />

<p>Hi Cristhian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for the quick reply. My only question now is why did I have access to this feature in the first place? Note that my Office 365 subscription expired almost two years ago and was replaced by the 2016 Home and Student licence. I only started
 using this feature in November/December of 2018. Could it be that there is another reason for this function disappearing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

            Hi  MarcMelis1
<br />
<br />I understand you were using this task for a while when you didn't have any office 365 subscription. It was supposed to be rolled out over several weeks beginning June 1, 2018 but it is probably due old version you could be able to use data types.
<br />
<br />it should be one office version installed.Anyway according to Microsoft official info "Other versions of Excel may eventually support these data types, as we are continually improving Excel"

<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your detailed instructions.&nbsp; When you navigate to the URL you mentioned in your post, this takes you to the new Project Home landing page.&nbsp; This is a feature recently introduced to Project Online.&nbsp; When you click the Create New pick
 list button and select the Project option, this will navigate you to the Create a New Project page in PWA.&nbsp; On this page, this is where you will see the Enterprise Project Types created by your application administrator for Project Online.&nbsp; If you do not see
 anything there, then you have no Enterprise Project Types from which to choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A much better option for you on the Project Home page&nbsp;would be for you to click the Go to Project Web App link at the bottom of the Project Home landing page.&nbsp; This will navigate you directly to the Home page of PWA.&nbsp; On the Home page of PWA, click the Projects
 tile in the Track Your Work carousel.&nbsp; On the Project Center page, click the Projects ribbon to expand the ribbon.&nbsp; Click the New pick list button and select the Enterprise Project option to create a new enterprise project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your other option for creating a new project is to launch Microsoft Project Professional and connect to your Project Online tenant.&nbsp; In MSP, you can click File &gt; New &gt; Blank Project.&nbsp; From there you can do task planning, resource planning, assignment planning,
 baseline your project, and then publish it.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

</p><p>It sounds like your application administrator has made changes to the security permissions in Project Online.&nbsp; I would recommend you show your problem to your application administrator and ask him/her to fix it.&nbsp; Otherwise, there is not much more I can do

</p><p>I am experiencing the same issue in 2 different tenants, links to Delve are not working from Office clients.</p>
<p>No issue with the Online clients or pasting the link directly.</p>

            <p>I have this exact same issue on a customers PC I am troubleshooting at my company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They only have Office 2007 and are running Windows XP.&nbsp;The error is occuring with numerous application names including teh following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excel.exe</p>
<p>IEXPLORER.EXE</p>
<p>Explorer.exe</p>
<p>Notepad.exe</p>
<p>Winlogon.EXE</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than the application path and PID the error message is indentical. to the one decribed above</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Application ("xxxx" ) (PID: yyyy) has failed to complete a COM/RPC call because of an invalid message from server."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been searching the net but havent found any answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Closest thing I found is this which is for a similiar error on Windows Server 2008 R2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I tried the&nbsp;netsh commands described there but they&nbsp;dont work on WinXP. Remote procedure call looks good and I disabled Windows firewall (since we use SEP11 anyway).

<p><span>If you click “yes” and the websites are working, you can probably ignore the error. You can follow the steps below to disable script debugging for Internet Explorer:</span></p>

<h2>            Nokia 5230 internet disconnect</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, how do you disconnect a 5230 from the internet when you have finished browsing but want to keep the phone on??? I've resorted to turning it off&nbsp; which is a pain. There must be a simpler way I can't find a disconnect button in the menus I've been looking
 at. It was simple on my old nokia. :smileysad:</p>

<p>You don't need&nbsp; to disconnect manually.. Did you read the post by jimmyireland ?.. and is the setting as per that ?</p>
<p>Once you exit the browser within a few secs. the Packet Data connection symbol should go OFF...</p>

<p>My 5230 anytime anywhere connects to the net and eats up my credit. I'm really frustrated with this issue/problem/(bug?).</p>
<p>So i have deleted all the access points.</p>
<p>Is there any solution over this? Is it a bug or something else?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi yes I have done that, whenever I go to the net, the wee icon stays by the world icon and each time I go back to connectivity it is connected so is chewing up. I have to turn it off to totally disconnect

            <p>To reset the passcode is a very simple process.&nbsp; You will need to contact Xbox Customer Support&nbsp;at 1-800-4MY-XBOX OR 1-800-469-9269 - you want to choose the Hardware division/department.&nbsp; You will need to be near you console and have a working controller.&nbsp;
 Let the agent know you need help with "resetting a family passcode".&nbsp; From here the agent will need you to give them the console serial number and the agent will then look up your console's unique 4 digits passcode.&nbsp; There are 10 steps on your controller that
 will need to be entered including the 4 digits the agent will lookup. .&nbsp; The agent should be able to assist you with walking through these steps, including finding you console serial number.&nbsp; You MUST contact support to get the unique passcode.&nbsp; This is the
 only way to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp; As always if you have any questions, please contact Xbox Support or visit Xbox.com.

<p>I read on gsmarena some remarks from a person about his reflections regarding Nokia E6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These things are so forgotten....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Just a quick bit of feedback to my use of this phone, me and my GF were out today at dinner at our fav restaurant, and there is this spot where me and my GF's phone could not get internet (SGS2, IPhone4) and guess what, today i tested
 my phone the E6 right next to the iPhone 4 and what do you know - Internet at almost full speed!! Nokia FTMFW!!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree totaly with this.</p>
<p>The sound quality of the E6 is so damn good, and people never talk about these things, but people who experienced problem With Androids and Iphone are very familiar with really bad network receptions and bad talking quality, following by broken calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me these subjects have been lost in every review I have read the last 12-18 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am very very very pleased about many things. Lets se if this little light issue will be solved.</p>

<p>It seemed to be from the guy that tested the E6, and posted the first photos!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said he bought the phone in the end, and he wa's sorry that he didn't use it for a longer time, to notice the little bugs.</p>

<p>-&nbsp; Depends which country/culture you're from, I guess. I dont use notification light, neither do any of my friends,colleagues, clients. We put our phones in our pockets, not on the table, due to thief concerns.</p>
<p>- Battery life is not big issue if one dont need/dont want constant internet connectivity.Data rates on mobile phones is not cheap. At least it's better than Android/Iphone 4, for half/almost half the price</p>
<p>- Vibration, yup, that was only issue for me. That solved by itself when i bought the hard casing for it, which I was going to buy anyway.</p>

<p>- I think the young man in the review is from my country but as working adult, I dont face the sweat, dust issue as he does. No eye strain issue on watching 1 hour videos &amp; I'm at least 10 years older than him, lol.</p>

<p>I agree, E72 owners might have more reasons to "suffer" than others. However,&nbsp; previous E-series owners (like me) typically have the expectation for a newer model to be on par with a predecessor, or better. And this mainly in terms of usability, and not
 so much about "gaming abilities" (I don't know how else to call that). And this is where the E6 misses out at the moment. A faboulous screen doesn't make up for a weaker battery, weak vibration, no notification on mail/sms/calls etc. For me, these features
 are <em>substantial</em>, coming from an E72. I don't see why I have to give up on these convenient features that worked so well on the old phone. And,on top of all come the HW/SW quality issues that I and others have experienced. This is just unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scary thing is, if these "changes" were based upon a change on "product policy" by Nokia, OK, then you can say you either love it or not, and make your choice accordingly. However, the E6 was positioned on the market for exactly the same segments as
 it's predecessors, and the built in failures are simply omissions or mistakes that the design teams made. Any two-days-testrun could have easily identified the issues, before going to market. But no, they didn't check it, or they did and then didn't care.
 This is why I and other users are so disappointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still want to love the E6, because I like the form factor and it's basic concept, and I hope that Nokia will fix the issues in the very near future. But at this moment, I am not happy.</p>

            Knowledge spoken by a true Sage, for the reasons given by gnirkatto I am very hestitant of purchasing this phone. Who wants to spend money to go backwards, the more I read the more I think twice. There needs to be some serious updates or this handset will
 just sit on the shelf and then lead into the discontinum phase......

<p>All I can say is this E6 is positioned for Asia market(maybe Africa, Middle East but I am not familiar with those markets), lesser on Western markets. Same goes for the new batch of models- 500,600,700,701.</p>
<p><br />
How to explain.... if corporate, purely business, they will choose the Black berry for their staff. E6 is for personal purchase, for both work &amp; play. These parts it is sold sim free.<br />
For Nokia, only the full touchscreen types like N8, X7 goes on contract.<br />
<br />
Andrei, the E5 is not popular in my country, I went to so many handphone shops to ask. Main reason they say: no secondary camera, which I dont use but seems many people want. I took a look at one E5 display set, the keys have plastic type feel, E6 no.<br />
<br />
Basically, this time around (for once), Nokia is going with what the non Western market wants. They are also trying to attract a wider range of demographics with the high resolution, I knew this when I looked at the specs.<br />
<br />
On side note: Gnirkatto, I do hope you get a "Made in Finland" model for your replacement E6, cos Made in China is cheaper, I only paid around Euro 280 for mine. I mean, not worth for you to get Made in China.</p>

<p>In another thread, I listed the issues I had with my (so far) three different E6s, coming from Finland, Hungary and then China. Yes, the Chinese was the worst, the Finnish was best. The Chinese even had a non-fitting battery cover. I'm already curious to
 see where the next replacement will come from.</p>
<p>Apparently they ship E6s from all their production plants to all parts of the world - why else would I have gotten 3 of them from three different countries. In my environment (Europe) the QWERTY-bar E-series phones of Nokia's were hugely popular, I would
 consider it a 50:50 split between Blackberry and E71/72 within the community of business users. So maybe they didn't have the Americas in mind when creating the phone, as Symbian only has a very tiny market share there. But it was not only made for Asia, I
 believe.</p>
<p>The other thing that puzzles me is that the Anna Exchange client works way better then the one in S60, even the S^3 implementation, so they clearly invested some work in improving in this field, to please business (and Gmail!) users, and then they f**k it
 up by failing in the other "business related" areas.</p>

    <title>Duplicate SMS on phone after sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keff85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate SMS on phone after sync</h2>
                    I backed my SMS with both MyPhone and Jeyo Companion, upgraded ROM (on Samsung i600), and restored messages with Jeyo Companion.<br />
After first sync with MyPhone, I had every message sent and received (about 3500!)&nbsp;duplicated, with errors in duplicates that came from MyPhone - usually disappeared spaces ('my phone' in original SMS, 'myphone' in dupe), also truncated sender names ('Name
 :))' changed to ':))' in dupe).<br />
<br />
I don't know how to clear my archived SMSs in MyPhone, MyPhone says that by deleting them online, the will be deleted in my handset as well, but I just wan't to 'nuke' the online storage and start all over again - while keeping my handset's content untouched.<br />
Any advice how to do this?

            <p>Something is definitely odd with the PIN option in 10041. It worked perfectly fine before but now when I enter the PIN I need to press return, pretty sure I didn't have to do that before? It also then takes a number of seconds after pressing the return for
 it to actually respond. Whereas beforehand it would go straight into Windows. I assume you have been doing some work in this area which has changed it slightly?</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t add email account in Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jordjb119  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t add email account in Outlook.com</h2>
                    I am signed into my Live Account but when trying to add a pop email account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) I keep getting an error saying that outlook.com could not log onto the server and to check the ID or password. &nbsp;I've been working this for hours and have verified
 the ID and password a dozen times and know they are being typed in correctly. &nbsp;I've checked all of the settings to make sure they are correct too. &nbsp;I can go to my bellsouth.net email account, which is actually managed by yahoo.com for AT&amp;T and I've logged
 on with no problems at all. &nbsp;I can add an account in my "old" Outlook 2013 on my PC with no issues, but not in outlook.com. &nbsp;Given all of the above,it seems like an outlook.com issue, since Outlook 2013 works and adds the account just fine, which tells me
 is unlikely to be the att.yahoo.com server. &nbsp;Please help if you can think of any way to fix this. &nbsp; Thanks. &nbsp;

            Hi - I am also having the same (or very similar) issue. I am adding a POP email account and I cannot use my provider's SMTP server. I have contacted them and they have confirmed that I am using the correct settings, and nothing should be stopping this
 from working. I have set this mailbox up in email clients (Outlook and Thunderbird) and it works.
<br />
<br />
The error simply says "There is a problem connecting to your SMTP server."<br />
<br />
I've seen a couple of other threads with this type of problem, but I've not seen a solution. Is there anything I can do?<br />
<br />

            I downloaded Windows Live Mail and it added the email account automatically - I needed to enter the password, but then it sent and received email from the account successfully.<br />
<br />
I have logged into outlook.com again and it still won't allow me to add the email account - it says there is a problem connecting to my smtp server.<br />

<p>I also wanted to add my msn account to my outlook.com however, I cannot add. I can add as MAPI but not POP I want POP so I can leave a copy of my message on line after I delete off my phone. All setting are correct but still not able to connect as POP. Outlook
 2016 on my PC doesn't give an option to set it up as a POP account. </p>

                    Every day I am parking my car at the airport on a fairly large carpark. Quite often after a long day I have forgotten where I parked my car. I also use my phone's Bluetooth connection with my car. It shouldn't be&nbsp;too difficult for the phone to remember
 where it lost the connection with the car. That&nbsp;would be&nbsp;where I parked my car. Maybe&nbsp;that could be a feature in maps?

<h2>            Office 365 for Linux</h2>
                    <p>Hi there! :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is simple. I just want to know why there isn't linux version, for example on ubuntu, of office 365. There is already version for OS X, Android, iOS as i think.. SO why not linux? There is about 80 milions of linux users and free space in world
 market because any program can be as good as is microsoft office. So, I would be glad, and other linux users for sure too, if microsoft will make a linux version of MSO 365. I think it's possible. What about your opinion? :)</p>

<p>I don't think so, because they already made android app and it's quite similar, i think. As same as they have office for&nbsp;OS X&nbsp;and iOS.. So i don't know, why there is no linux version. :)

</p><p>Btw, they updated skype for linux, so I hope that office will come soon. :)</p>

<p>I second (or third) that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I have an Office365 Plan with OneDrive Premium. Thing is, I recently ported fully into Linux and away from Win10 (nearly all my computers, especially after last 9-month "patchocalypse"), so I see me ditching the subscription plan in the near future
 as I do not wish to start Win10 on VirtualBox every time I wish to use it. Since that, I switched to WPS, but I'd gladly stay on Office 365, provided there is a Linux port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same happened to OneDrive, which I left for DropBox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is easy to be honest, since both Android and OSX are Linux based (OSX being a modified &amp; locked FreeBSD distro).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's hope they'll consider it. If not, then I guess I'll stay without it and go for an enterprise WPS subscription.</p>

<p>One explanation is that Microsoft is afraid of Linux as a competitior (see e.g.
<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/169712/microsoft_admits_linux_threat.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Microsoft Admits Fear of Linux">
this article</a>).&nbsp; Windows' market share was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems#Worldwide_device_shipments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Wikipedia">
less than 12%</a> on newly sold devices in 2015 and has been dropping by about on percent point per year in the previous years.&nbsp; I suppose many companies are run by people who grew up before the internet was introduced, and assume software is something that
 should be purchased - hence they'll buy a pc with Windows preinstalled (and do they have much choice?).&nbsp; What better tactic to employ than to ensure that these Windows users cannot collaborate with users of the competitor you are most afraid of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also clear that Microsoft does not only try to passively ignore the existence of Linux, they're actively trying to block Linux users from using Microsoft cloud services, like
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/5f1vf1/office_365_and_linux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Reddit">
Office 365</a>. Only once you pretend you're using MS Edge, your browser doesn't crash...&nbsp; Of course, the move to Office 365, apart from making it possible to automatically share your documents with the NSA, could be to prevent Windows users from collaborating
 with the other 88% of the world using e.g. LibreOffice.</p>

<p>
</p><p>But, when I clicked on the save ICON located at the very top, left of the monitor screen.&nbsp;it&nbsp;opened the section which shows all of the various FOLDERS&nbsp;and allowed me to select the folder I wanted and then allowed me to save the document.</p>

<h2>            Turning Windows Defender Back On</h2>
                    <p>I had another malware fighter program installed when I made the Windows 7 to Windows 10 upgrade and therefore Windows Defender was turned off. I have since uninstalled the other program and now I cannot turn Windows Defender on to replace it. My question
 is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I turn Windows Defender back on after uninstalling other malware fighter?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Installation</h2>
                    I just installed Windows 10 yesterday and I am impressed. While it took some time, the installation was flawless and it was great not to have to reinstall programs and apps. I like many of the new features including the new file explorer presentation.

<p>Well done. Now just tell us all, have you joined as a Windows Insider with your Microsoft account? It will be worth your effort come 29th July.</p>
<p>Plus what version of Windows did you install or upgrade from; and what build did you upgrade to?</p>

            The error you describe is a sending error and means that you are not properly authenticating to the outgoing server (i.e., you have not checked the "My outgoing server requires authentication" box on the Outgoing Server tab of your account properties)
 but it means you have the server's name correct, at least.&nbsp; If you can't receive messages, then you don't have some settting correct for your incoming server as well.&nbsp; Who is your mail provider and what type of account (i.e., POP, IMAP, etc) are you trying
 to use?

            I can't find a "netfirm".&nbsp; I see a "netfirms", however.&nbsp; Hee are the instructions for POP/SMTP.&nbsp; They mention Outlook Express, but they apply equally to and POP client.&nbsp;

            There's nothing in the instructions I cited that indicate you must use authenticaton on the outgoing server, but I'd enable it and see what happened because that's what the error indicates is the problem
