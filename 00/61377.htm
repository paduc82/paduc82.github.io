            <span>In Windows 7, you can't set the critical battery level below the minimal level set by your computer manufacturer. If you change the On battery level to something lower than
 the minimum value set by the manufacturer, the value will be reset to the minimum.

    <title>Searching in Settings and App Store login doesn&#39;t work after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noyboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Searching in Settings and App Store login doesn&#39;t work after moving Users folder on separate drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys. There's a lot of good info on this site, but unfortunately none of those solutions have worked for me. There is one thing that I can do though that doesn't fix the problem, but alters it. My problem is that searching in the "Settings" page doesn't
 work. Say, when I try to search "partition" in the start menu, it gives the result "create and format hard disk partitions" and when clicked, the window for disk management should be opened. Instead, Settings page opens up saying "Search results aren't quite
 ready yet, but we're working on getting them together. Try back in a few minutes." Searching anything in the Settings window always brings the same result. I can search and bring up installed programs from the start menu normally. Searching in "Control Panel"
 also works fine as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my Settings search seems to be the only thing that seems to be broken. I can make searching in Settings work, but doing so makes my start menu search broken, yielding no results to my start menu searches such as my installed apps. Searching for items
 in the start menu that can also be searched in the Settings windows do show up though. To do this, using the Run command/Windows key + R and typing "services.msc" will bring up the "Services" window. Going down to "Windows Search" and right clicking it and
 to the right of "Startup type:" select "Disabled" and hit ok and exit. Windows search will then be disabled which will produce the details mentioned above. The problem does go away, but it only replaces it with another problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very important detail (at least I think it is), I have changed the settings when doing a clean install of windows 10 on my new computer so that the Users folder will be stored on a separate drive, other than my C drive. So now my Users folder, and all new
 Users that are created, including the AppData folder are stored on a separate drive upon creation. I got my new laptop that came with windows 10, I decided to do a clean install with an SSD as it's primary drive, and the HDD that it came in with as the secondary.
 I wanted to keep all files on the 2nd HDD drive and not on the SSD, so that's why I moved it. But in doing so, searching in Settings doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a maybe related note, I'm not able to sign in to my Microsoft account in the App Store which makes me unable to download and install any apps from the store. What happens when I try to click on the login button is the window doesn't pop up at all, it
 just hangs there and does nothing. I've tried other fixes for this. I tried creating another user and same result. I tried making the user a Microsoft user, signing in my credentials there, but the credentials don't automatically switch over to the store as
 well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering what people are thinking are the fixes for this and why switching the users makes these problems occur. Anyone have any inputs? I have tried everything on this post to no avail:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_cortana/no-settings-or-control-panel-items-in-search/36fa2c3a-9589-4b6a-9a94-030060c87386?page=1">No
 settings or control panel items in search.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Number 3 on Fleperson's post was what fixed it for me, deleting that registry branch.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's very odd as that folder is exactly where the "search forward" from Start menu to Settings app happens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, I'll do some very silly questions because sometimes we are so pissed with a problem that we do silly stuff:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Maybe you got the wrong one as you moved your User to another drive? I think you can't go to the folder using "<em>%LocalAppData%"
</em>as this will probably send you to the older folder on your Drive C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Is this secondary drive (to where you moved the Users folder) allowed to be indexed by the system settings? By default only the C drive is selected to index, you have to manually add other drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e37a2e8a-2f75-48fb-a44c-b0a34f2a2372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e37a2e8a-2f75-48fb-a44c-b0a34f2a2372" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Tried this approach that requires to change some stuff on the register?</p>
<p>https://superuser.com/questions/958006/how-can-i-make-windows-10-search-my-settings-control-panel-items/963621#963621</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Do you have absolute sure that your Windows 10 is up to date and nothing is corrupted? If you have the last Win10 ISO from MS site, try running it via some virtual drive (Virtual CloneDriver works) and run the Win 10 Setup to perform a repair installation
 (not a clean one) so the installer will verify if everything is right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: one last thing: when you apply some of the fixes (re-index, allow this drive etc) the result will take some time, specially if you are not on a SSD. Some people tried some fixes and got the results like 20 or 30 minutes after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>----</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Btw, to people suggesting a Clean Install, please stop. Suggesting that a user has to wipe their entire system and reconfigure and re-install all your software to fix something that is probably something silly (just hard to find) is a terrible advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know your results NoBoy</p>

    <title>Reparse points preventing cloud backups from working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> masher11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reparse points preventing cloud backups from working</h2>
                    <p>I have two cloud-based backup services (Crashplan, which is withdrawing its consumer services) and Acronis (which I have set up as a replacement).&nbsp; My primary aim is to back up my OneDrive files, since OneDrive is not a backup service, only a syching mechanism.<br />
</p>
<p>I have always had the OneDrive "Files on demand" feature turned OFF, to ensure that all my files are physically present on my local drive, thus enabling the backup services to copy them to the cloud. However, both Crashplan and Acronis are exhibiting problems,
 and failing to back some of my documents and pictures folders (especially newly-created folders).&nbsp; Through my contacts with Acronis, and testing with the ‚Äúfsutil reparsepoint query‚Äù command, I have established that the problem is caused by the fact that on
 my C: drive, the folders C:\Users\[Username]\OneDrive\Documents and C:\Users\[Username]\OneDrive\Pictures are classified as "Reparse Points" rather than normal folders.<br />
</p>
<p>Acronis have advised me that their software will not reliably back up a folder which is a Reparse Point, but are unable to help me further.<br />
</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know what a Reparse Point is, and I certainly never created them intentionally.&nbsp; The only reason I can think of for the Reparse Points having been created is that a few years ago I used the ‚ÄúLocation‚Äù tab in File Explorer to redirect my standard
 user folders to OneDrive (so for example my ‚ÄúPictures‚Äù folder in Windows moved from c:\users\[username]\Pictures to c:\users\[username]\OneDrive\Pictures).&nbsp; Could that be the explanation?<br />
</p>
<p>Anyway my question is, how do I stop a folder within OneDrive being a Reparse point, and revert it back to being a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù folder? Are there any dangers in attempting to do so ‚Äì I obviously cannot afford to lose data, and if any of my OneDrive folders are
 deleted or emptied, I fear that the data loss will quickly be replicated to the cloud as well :(<br />

            Try this from Enchantech:
<br />Open the path C:\ProgramData\Acronis\TrueImageHome\OnlineBackup\   You should find your email address and inside that you should see the client.test.crt security certificate file.  If the security certificate file is present you can right click on the file and from the menu choose Install certificate, then try the backup again.

            Thank you for responding so quickly, but the solution you pointed to me to is not relevant to the problems I am having.&nbsp; My Acronis backups are working without any error messages or references to certificate problems.&nbsp; But I can see for myself that the
 backups are incomplete.&nbsp; The Acronis suupport team have told me that it's caused by the presence of Reparse Points within the OneDrive folder structure on my PC, but they are unable to advise me on how to resolve that.<br />

            Try this site, it‚Äôs for Windows backup but may help in finding the problematic file/folder:

<p>Maybe this will help...<br />
Right click on an open space of the desktop &gt; View &gt; Classic Icons.</p>
<p>If that does not help, please do a system restore. Pick the date when you did not have this problem as your restore point. In case you don't know how to, here is the link to the tutorial :<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Remesis has the right idea, but I think it's an &lt;alt&gt; key, not a &lt;ctrl&gt; key that is stuck. Try rapping on both of them to loosen them up. You may find that you will need to replace the keyboard to fully correct the issue.

<div>Well, that sounds like the CTRL key is stuck.<br />
<br />
CTRL+T = New Tab<br />
CTRL+P = Print<br />
<br />
I bet if you press N, a new window will open as CTRL+N = New Browser Window.<br />
<br />
Normally when that happens, you should press both CTRL keys on your keyboard a few times each and that usually solves the problem. Just press the CTRL key(s) on your keyboard a few times and see if that solves the problem.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div>

<h2>            Skype Insider Preview &#47;&#47; Call Snapshots &#47;&#47; Available on iPhones and Android 6&#43; devices and in the desktop clients for Windows, Mac, and Linux</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Skype Insiders. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a new feature coming to you today in the latest update for Skype Preview on Android 6.0+ devices. With Call Snapshots, you can easily take a photo of a video call and share it with the person you‚Äôre chatting with. To take a snapshot of your call,
 just press the camera button in the lower left corner and you‚Äôll see the photo on the call canvas as well as in the chat. From that chat, you can save the photo to your local camera roll, forward it, remove it or post it to your highlights just like any other
 photo you have shared into a chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an Android 6.0+ device and are using Skype Preview version 8.14.76.6, check it out! We‚Äôd love to hear what you think about Snapshots. If you like it, we‚Äôll work to add it to Skype on other platforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(161, 29, 122, 1)">UPDATE: This feature is now also available in the 8.19.76 version of the desktop clients for Windows, Mac, and Linux.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(161, 29, 122, 1)">UPDATE: This feature is now also available in the 8.21.76 version for iPhones.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember you can give feedback here in the forums or in the app. To bring up the feedback options, gently shake your device or go to Settings / Help and Feedback / Send Feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all you do to support Skype. We can‚Äôt wait to hear about your experience.</p>
<p>The Skype Team</p>

<h2>            Sony Micro Vault Pro USD8G capacity 8GB model flash drive is not recognized by Windows XP 32bit, Vista 32 bit or Windows 7 64 bit</h2>
                    Nothing shows up when I open My Computer after plugging the drive. If I <br />
plug any other USB drive, they are recognized(and seen as External Drive G:&nbsp; ) so I know the USB ports are working fine. No other network drive is mapped which could cause name conflict.
<br />
<br />
In device manager, the message is the device cannot start Code 10.<br />
Went to Disk Management, but the disk is not seen. <br />
Ran the Microsoft Fixit tool from <a href="http://slickdeals.net/?sdtid=4805226&amp;sdop=1&amp;sdpid=51270848&amp;lno=1&amp;trd=http+support+microsoft+com+kb+31&amp;sdfid=17&amp;u2=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fkb%2F310123" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310123</a>, but it did not help.<br />
<br />
Tried updating the driver for USB drive, but Windows(after searching on the Web) claims best driver is already installed for the device. I don't notice an updated driver at http://www.sony.net/Products/Media/Microvault/products/usd/index.html<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 professional 64bit. Tried opening the flash drive on <br />
Windows Vista 32 bit, Windows XP 32 bit, but there also it is not recognized as an external drive.
<br />
<br />
The data recovery tools Recuva cannot work since Windows does not recognize the drive. User has some data which needs to be recovered. He claims that it was working fine last week on his home computer. He tried using it in his home computer now which also does
 not recognize it.<br />
<br />
Tried Paragon System Recover CD to see if it can recognize the drive as connected, but it could not. Attempted using Ultimate boot CD to check if it would recognize the drive, but it does not. When the drive is plugged, the light on flash drive is on as if
 the device is in use. The flash drive does not appear to have any physical damage<br />
<br />
What else can I try other than sending it to a data recovery firm?

            <p>Sounds like you've covered the bases - if it won't work in multiple computers or multiple operating systems, the drive is almost certainly dead beyond the ability of a non-professional to recover the data from it. </p>

            Thanks, using UVCView program, I can see that Windows is communicating with the USB device and retrieves some information which is posted below.

    <title>merging two favorites files - one from old without losing new entries - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mlb2012  say:</h3>
<h2>            merging two favorites files - one from old without losing new entries</h2>
                    <p>Am trying to move favorites from one computer to another, without losing&nbsp;any favorites that have been&nbsp;added to the second computer, which may&nbsp;NOT be on the first. Once I export Favorites from first computer to a USB port, does Import just replace the whole
 Favorites folder on the second&nbsp; computer or will it ask me&nbsp;if I want to save new one over old duplicate on second computer favorites file (like when you are saving jpgs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or is there another way to "merge" the two folders together, like visually opening up both files and selecting what to move over by hand....</p>
<p>Thanx</p>
<p>PS - am moving from Vista to a Win 7 computer; as well as syncing up two win 7's after that.</p>

            If you don't know the model number check the box it came in, or ask your mother if she knows. The model number might also be written somewhere on the webcam in small print.<br />

<span>Go to the website of the manufacturer and select your model (this is usually done in the Support section) and see if they have Windows 7 drivers. Download the driver(s) and follow the instructions to install - every camera is different
 so I can't give you exact directions. <br />

<p><span>i have the original&nbsp;release&nbsp;xbox 360 and the DVD drive is going in it and because of that I been having alot of issues with Halo 4 and audio skipping or not even playing at all&nbsp;and textures taking forever to load so i figured i'd give it a shot and
 installed it on the hard drive because that solved all the same issues i had with halo CE Anniversary and Halo reach. but it will not play off the hard drive, i have tried launching it from the home tab on the dashboard and in the game options menu but every
 time it played off the DVD and the game bugs out. Is there something im missing or is this another bug?</span></p>

<p>Like I said, as long as it's installed it should play off the hard drive no matter how you start the game. The disc will still spin at start up and sometimes they do spin during the game. The only way to play it without having to use the disc drive at all
 would be to download the game digitally.</p>

<p>it's definitely reading off the disc it will freeze for a second or 2 every now and then and the drive makes a bit of noise and the game resumes. it sounds like a jet engine and stops as soon as i eject the drive or close the game. &nbsp;It's not a big deal now
 that i have a brand new xbox S but I do wonder if it's a bug or the hard drive i recycled is *** up.</p>

<p>Do this:</p>
<p>Delete everything except your save files off your HDD that has to do with Halo 4.</p>
<p>Put Disc 2 in. Boot it up. The game will ask to install the cache. Let it. Then take that disc out.</p>
<p>Put Disc 1 in. Install it off the dashboard, then play the game normally. The disc will spin down within a few minutes of boot up.</p>
<p>One of the discs needs to create a cache on your HDD, and the other can be installed via the dashboard. Installing both via the dashboard won't create the cache, and the game will think there's nothing on your HDD and read off the disc instead.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I got the disc numbering right, but I'm too lazy to go and check myself. If Disc 2 doesn't ask to create cache, then it's Disc 1. But one of them does ask to create a cache because I had the same issue myself.</p>
<p>On a side note, you'll always get texture popping and low-res models popping in and out, albeit it's less noticeable when you have it installed. It's just 343i ruining Reach's engine.</p>
