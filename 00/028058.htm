            the only thing that worked for me is clean install 10074 iso and then, without installing anything else, i let it download and install the updates it required, i then switched to the fast ring and finally got the 10130. Of course you'll have to backup
 your files before and reinstall your programs after.

    <title>Location &#39;not available&#39; after hacking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djsfb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Location &#39;not available&#39; after hacking</h2>
                    <p>Someone from United States broke into my Hotmail account.&nbsp; Until they gained access in 'Recent Activity' it showed either United Kingdom or United States (them) under 'Location' and they quickly made the location 'not available'.&nbsp; I have secured my account
 but the 'location' is still showing 'Not available'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I scrolled down the times when the hacker had accessed my account.&nbsp; In one under 'Browser/application' in reads '<span>Exchange ActiveSync'&nbsp; (there is an IP address) and after that on each hacking occasion 'POP3' (with
 a different but consistant IP address).&nbsp; Location is not available since</span> even though I have secured my account and restarted my computer.</p>
<p>Please can you:</p>
<p>1. tell me how to get the location back</p>
<p>2. reassure me that they have not done a Sync so that they will continue to have access in any way to my account.</p>
<p>I have deleted all Outlook accounts from Apple devices since as a precaution.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

            I am having the same issue. I have tried for several days to get this resolved. I have provided my information. Been given the run around. Given a private link. Sent the information again. Was told to clear my cache,which I did, tried 3 different browsers,
 all of which have been upgraded. Told to send a screenshot.Told my screenshot could not be read, and to send again via One drive, which I did send, and never heard back. My location is still listed as not available, I feel this is not acceptable, and I am
 very frustrated.

<p>Hi Tina </p>
<p>Thank you for your quick replay. </p>
<p>Your questions force me to play with my bibliographic list again - and I think I mange to solve my problem by myself :-)</p>
<p><br />
If it happens to someone else - You just need add another citation to your document and then refresh the list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>I am not quite sure what you mean. </p>
<p>If you mean customisation of the wallpaper, it is impossible to change the Bing wallpaper, as that is set by Microsoft. The picture does change every day, though.</p>
<p>If you mean you want to know the description of the image, you should just tap the ¬© on the bottom left corner. Note: do not tap on the translucent grey area, as that will bring up bottom bar. You can try rotating your phone to landscape, and tap the ¬© symbol
 again.</p>
<p>If you mean where you can find the images for your own personal use, then I'm sorry to tell you that you won't find them, as they are kept by Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t see what i&#39;m recording on onenote</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just bought the surface pro 3 a couple of days ago and tried inserting a video&nbsp;on Onenote. But for some reason, I can never see what I'm recording, there only appears to be a black screen when Onenote opens a new window, instead of the whiteboard at school.
 &nbsp;After recording,&nbsp;I play the same video on onenote and it usually cuts out at least half the whiteboard since I can't adjust the angle of my surface because&nbsp;I can't see what I've been recording on my surface.&nbsp; It's only when I try to insert a video when it
 does that. I've tried recording a video using&nbsp;the usual camera app and works fine- no black screen when recording. &nbsp;I've tried turning on webcam and refreshing my device but none of these have worked.

            <p>I ran into this issue, and hopefully you've had it resolved since you posted this almost two years ago. If not, my experience may help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was strange was that this happened on only one of my two cameras; the onboard camera showed live recordings perfectly fine, but had this issue with my high-definition USB camera. I am lucky to have an educational license for Office 365, and thus, support
 for my product. After speaking to two reps, I completed additional steps that ultimately solved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps I did, before and after I spoke to the reps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Rebooted computer (small update occurred)</p>
<p>- Change the codec for the recording</p>
<p>- Reinstalled OneNote (included upgrade from 2015 to 2016)*</p>
<p>- Reinstalled drivers for the webcam</p>
<p>- Contacted Tech Support Rep, who had me do the following:</p>
<p>- Verified the camera was able to show live recordings on another application (store Camera app)</p>
<p>- Do a Repair on the Office 365 install</p>
<p>- Create a new notebook on a local drive</p>
<p><strong>- Removed all non-Microsoft services &amp; all programs from from startup</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Rebooted, including major feature update</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere in the above two bolded steps (as they happened together), something caused OneNote to solve its issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully these steps will help you (and others) to resolve this issue. In addition, I requested that the rep have this thread forwarded to the team that handles troubleshooting here, as it appears to have been abandoned some time ago, and this is the only
 thread that covers this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* - IMPORTANT NOTE: When upgrading to the 2016 version, I lost all the tabs that I created a few weeks ago. It turns out that they weren't deleted, but were instead in the backups, under Misplaced Sections. If you have this behaviour happen to you, don't
 immediately panic, and check there or elsewhere in the backups. It also goes without saying that you should back up your Notebook on your local drive, before attempting a reinstall or upgrade. I got lucky. You might not, so plan ahead.</p>

<h2>            Post-Malware Removal Residual Issues</h2>
                    I have cleared a number of malware programs using Microsoft Security Essentials, but still have residual issues: certain files have "disappeared" from their original locations, and cannot be accessed through their original folders (which have been "removed"
 by the malware in some cases).&nbsp; How can these file paths be restored?&nbsp; I have run a system restore from before the malware download.&nbsp; I have also had a "sound file" play in the background that I have neither heard before nor opened myself.&nbsp; My Full System
 Scan (on the most up-to-date definitions) claims that my system is "clean". Any help would be appreciated!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were you infected before or after installing MSE?&nbsp;&nbsp;Such questions help determine what may have happened to your computer and are one of the reasons Pa Bear is trying to learn more about the history of your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following is an excerpt from Bleeping Computer's Removal Guide For Windows XP Repair Fake Antivirus program.&nbsp; We're seeing similar events involving various fake AV programs and the following<strong> may</strong> assist you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>If you are infected with Windows XP Repair it is important that you do not delete any files from your Temp folder or use any temp file cleaners.</span></b><span> This is because when this infection is installed it will delete shortcuts found in
 various locations and store backups of them in the %Temp%\smtmp folder. It does this so that you when try to launch a program from your start menu, none of your shortcuts will appear and thus making you think that your computer has a serious problem. Therefore,
 you do not want to delete any of the files in your Temp folder as it will remove the backups that we will use later in the guide to restore your Windows Start Menu. For a list of folders that shortcuts are deleted and the corresponding directories where they
 are stored, please see this topic: </span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic405109.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><u><span><span>Unhide.exe - A introduction as to what this program does</span></span></u></b></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>To further make it seem like your computer is not operating correctly, Windows XP Repair will also make it so that certain folders on your computer display no contents. When opening these folders, such as C:\Windows\System32\ or various drive letters,
 instead of seeing the normal list of files it will instead display a different folder's contents or make it appear as if the folder is empty. This is done to make it seem like there is corruption on your hard drive that is causing your files to not be displayed.
 It does this by adding the +H, or hidden, attribute to all of your files, which causes your files to become hidden. It will then change your Windows settings so that you cannot view hidden and system files. Once the rogue's processes are terminated you can
 enable the setting to view hidden files, and thus be able to see your files and folders again, by following the instructions in this tutorial:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial62.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><u><span><span>How to see hidden files in Windows</span></span></u></b></a></p>
<p><span>Windows XP Repair also attempts to make it so you cannot run any programs on your computer. If you attempt to launch a program it will terminate it and state that the program or hard drive is corrupted. It does this to protect itself from anti-</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-windows-xp-repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><span><span>virus
 programs</span></span></u></a><span> you may attempt to run and to make your computer unusable so that you will be further tempted to purchase the rogue.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The "sound file" running indicates your computer is still infected.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for the advice all so far.&nbsp; I hope that the following information helps to refine the issue:</p>
<p>1. I run Windows 7 (64 bit) with SP 1 installed and install each and every update Iincluding security and OS updates) as it is released.</p>
<p>2. I run IE9</p>
<p>3. I have had MSE installed since the day I purchased this computer - approx Feb 11.&nbsp; I have similarly run the updates automatically.</p>
<p>4. I had Norton installed as part of the pre-installed software but removed it the day I purchased the computer before I had installed any of my additonal software.</p>
<p>I have had no issues unti I foolishly clicked on a very convincing phishing link from DHL (typically i was expecting a package!).</p>
<p>I intend to use the MSE "My computer is infected" link to see what they can do, but so far I have automatically removed the following malware with my (seemingly genuine) copy of MSE - I have conducted no additional manual clear-up.</p>
<p>Exploit:Java/CVE-2010-0840.HY</p>
<p>Trojan:Win32/FakeSysdef&nbsp;&nbsp; (x3!)</p>
<p>Exploit:JS/Blacole.A</p>
<p>VirTool:Win32/Injector.gen!N</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally I closed a running .exe file with task manager when a "sound file" was playing the executable was called something like "iexplorer32*.exe" - that stopped the sound (not sure if that helps anyone!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help</p>

                    I often call the USA or Canada and when I call a landline or mobile I am worried no caller ID comes up so they think it is a bogus call and hang up or do not answer. Is it possible for me to arrange for my company name to come up on the display to avoid

<h2>            Sync problems for last 2 days on Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Since yesterday afternoon my Outlook mail will not sync and the progress bar keeps showing 'x out of x updates - x seconds remaining'. If I close down and start up again it will sync, but then the next time I send/receive the same thing happens again.</p>
<p>What can I do to fix?</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying - I tried everything and still get the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I shut down outlook and then open it again I can receive &amp; send o/s mail, however if anything new comes in then I can't receive it, nor send anything new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message is below - says it can't connect to the server which I don't understand as it clearly can if I close outlook and open it again. Makes no sense why the connection problem starts once I'm logged on for a while.</p>

            <p>Hi Sara,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the instant update. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume that you have tried to update folders, upgrade Outlook to the latest version, repair the Office suite, check the issue in Outlook safe mode and create a new Outlook profile but all to no avail. The issue occurs too if you turn off the Outlook cached
 mode. </p>
<p>
1.<span> </span>Could you please share with us your detailed Outlook version?<br />
2.<span> </span>Does the issue occur to other users?<br />
3.<span> </span>When the issue occurs, capture a screenshot of the Outlook connection status. My example:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78b824cc-6c1e-4114-93c9-f4b391fecd17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78b824cc-6c1e-4114-93c9-f4b391fecd17" /></a><br />
4.<span> </span>If there‚Äôs another clean PC available in another network such as home, it is recommended that you set up the account to check the issue.&nbsp;

            Hi Sara,<br />
<br />
Since you have tried all the steps including creating new profile mentioned above, it indicates the issue persists with the new credential. To further troubleshoot the issue, I‚Äôd like to collect some more information below:<br />
<br />
1. In your Outlook client, navigate to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Office Account</strong>, provide the detailed version of your Outlook client.<br />
2. If convenience, try another network environment and see if the issue persists.<br />
3. Refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/What-is-the-Enable-logging-troubleshooting-option-0fdc446d-d1d4-42c7-bd73-74ffd4034af5#OnOff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            It is a problem with pc suite 6.84, it's very unstable compared to 6.83. Also if you look at your event logs you will notice lots of errors and notifications.<br />
<br />
Hopefully it will be fixed in the next version.<br />
<br />
I've stayed with 6.83.

            Hi alextooter,<br />
<br />
I have not ever heard that kind of problem...anyway, open control panel &gt; "add or remove programs" &gt; select "PC Connectivity Solution &gt; Change &gt; Repair.<br />
<br />
If that did not help, check what other applications running in your (is there any other application which could prevent PC Suite to read the target file?)

<h2>            every click takes me back to home screen &#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I keep running into issues where various apps will cease to work correctly and everything i click just takes me back to the device home screen...needless to say this is extremely frustrating.... First it happened when trying to browse for apps in the "Marketplace",
 i would click the marketplace tile, the main screen would load and then any link i clicked took me back to home screen... now it is happenning with an App i "bought" to track my blood sugar levels... all of a sudden everytime i try to access the historical
 reports i get taken to home screen... I have rebooted the device countless time now and this has not resolved itself, the app worked fine the past few weeks up until today... nothing unusual has happened other than unstalling the ATT U verse app earlier...
 what gives ? Has anyone else had this problem ????

    <title>Office 365 mail enabled user to user mailbox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365 mail enabled user to user mailbox</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have done Cutover migration from Exchange 2010 and had one user listed in mail enabled user instead of user mailbox. I can login onto outlook.office365.com using mail enabled username and password. However, any email sent is bouncing back without delivery.
 The user has Business Essential license associated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have on-premises exchange running but the user appeared has mailbox in Exchange in 2010. However, it has been listed as mail-enabled in Office 365.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to convert mail-enabled user to user mailbox in Office 365? How do I fix this problem? It only happened to one user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mitesh Sudan</p>

<p>Hi Mitesh,</p>
<p>The mailbox can only exist in one location after Dirsync is enabled. After cutover migration is completed, the on-premises Exchange mailboxes need to be converted to mail enabled users. It is not feasible to convert a mail user into a user mailbox directly
 in Office 365.</p>
<p>Considering the issue only affects one user in your organization, a workaround we suggest is 1.Backup the user mailbox data into PST files. 2.Delete the user mailbox or convert the user mailbox into a mail enabled user in Exchange 2010. 3. Re-sync the user
 to Office 365 and assign the Exchange Online license to provision a new cloud mailbox and then import the data from the PST files.</p>
<p>If you run into any problems, please let us know.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Alex</p>

            <p>Are you dragging CurrentFinancialCapacityID from Current_Financial_Capacity onto the same field in the related table? What are the datatypes (I'm guessing Autonumber and Long Integer)? Are both tables local? And are you creating the relationship in the backend

            Hrm. Not sure what's going on! Have you tried Compact and Repair? What's the exact error message number and text? What indexes or validation rules do you have on the two tables?

<h2>            Phone numbers get changed when exporting contacts from live.people.com to CSV</h2>
                    <p>I don't use Outlook on my PC. But recently I purchased a Nokia Lumia phone and so I started storing many new contacts in Outlook 2013 while adding them to my lumia device. Now I want to export all those contacts to a CSV file. So i logged on to live.people.com
 and tried exporting by clicking "Manage" &gt; "Export for Outlook.com and other services." The contacts were exported to a .csv file which I stored on my desktop. However, on opening the file I noticed that the phone numbers which are longer than ten digits (e.g.
 +91<span>9212165637) get truncated to the format E+11. In this case the number became&nbsp;</span><span>9.19212E+11. When I change the format of the cell from general to number and remove the decimals, it converts this number to 919212000000 which
 is WRONG! Also the plus sign gets removed because of which if I want to dial the number from any phone it does not connect! How can I cleanly export to CSV so that I can merge these contacts to my existing google account?</span></p>
<p><span>Please HELP!</span></p>

</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing when trying to export the contacts.&nbsp;Let me assist you with this issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>After exporting&nbsp;the contacts&nbsp;and when you try to format the cells and instead of selecting the number, select the category as
<strong>special</strong> and then&nbsp;choose type as <strong>phone number </strong>and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>
