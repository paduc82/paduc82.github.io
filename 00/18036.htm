<h2>            Office 365, temporary share a mail</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am new with Office365.</p>
<p>The company I m working with have 12 business licenses and 7 ec3.</p>
<p>All users have an email like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>They would like to have separated emails, like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, that a particular user, let's say user1, would manage.</p>
<p>user1 could have for example, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>User1 would like to be able to share his credentials to user2, to only have access to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** when he is on vacation.</p>
<p>These needs to be done on several users and mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be really appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
<p>Greg.</p>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Forum Support. From my understanding, the users in your organization would create second email addresses in their accounts and let a specific user (user1) to manage the second email addresses. Meanwhile, the specific user
 (user1) also need a second email address to share with another specific user (user2) to help manage when the former (user1) is on vacation. If there's any wrong, please feel free to let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Office 365 account, it's available to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-another-email-alias-for-a-user-0b0bd900-68b1-4bf5-808b-5d240a7739f4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create aliases/proxy email addresses</a>&nbsp;for users. However,
 you can not use aliases to sign in or send emails, because alias can be only used to receive emails. While if you'd like to let specific user manage the others' accounts, it's unnecessary to create second email address, you can

set the specific user as delegate</a> to the others. The delegate would have the permission your granted to access the others' mailbox. As a side note, there're three permission types for a delegate. You can make a view of the following link to make a contrast
 among them.</p>

<p>
</p><p>And if you have any difficulty on the configuration process, or it couldn't meet with your real requirement, please feel free to let us know. Also, may I know your detailed situation or reasons regarding this issue? I'd like to check if there's any workaround
 for you.</p>

                    <span>
<p>I would like to know if this is possible. I have a MS Access database that has information I would like to transfer to MS Excel. All of the data from the database would not be transferred. I would like to be able to add data to the database and have specific
 data transferred to specific cells. Example: Access; if data in column #1 = A and data in column # 2 = 12, copy data from column # 3.</p>
<p>Paste data into an existing Excel sheet. In this case the data above would go int book A, sheet 3, column D, row 4.</p>
<p>What we are doing has the customers in the database along with their assigned space # (a 2 part: column # 1 is their area and column # 2 is their space assignment). We also have a "parking chart" made in Excel that I am trying to get the data into automatically.
 Just trying to reduce workload and possible mistakes.</p>

<p><br />
This one is cool, I like to run it always is it provide a smooth channel between Excel Data and Access Data but with selection</p>
<p>I will start by a simple procedure.</p>
<p>1) Open you Blank excel sheet and point to the location you want Access data</p>
<p>2) Click on File / Open and change file type to Access Databases</p>
<p>3) Locate the Access data file and open it.. of course it will load all (yes), but now you have a connection to the source data.</p>
<p>4) Save the excel file just in case and make sure you Access data file is also close as this will cause communication error</p>
<p>5) Locate the menu item DATA under the menu item you will see CONNECTIONS you will see also PROPERTIES</p>
<p>6) You might need to use both but let us start with <strong>connection</strong> by clikcing it</p>
<p>7) You will find already a connection created when you loaded the full access data file that contains all data and all columns.</p>
<p>8) Now you see two table in this window (usage) and (difinition)</p>
<p>9) Select difinisiton &nbsp;</p>
<p>10) Locate the&nbsp;full conneciton string in a text-field</p>
<p>11) Locate the command type (drop down) and select SQL instead of the table name (it might be table1) it is the name of ACCESS table</p>
<p>12) in the command text write sql string similar to this <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">select id,field1 from table1 where id&gt;4</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>which will now refresh the access data showing only the columns (ID, Field1) and only date with ID row &gt; 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Apply this with you example.. if you do not find this clear, send me the two files with your request and I might be able to help</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kind Regards </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hassan</strong></p>

<h2>            Office 2007 connection exchange issues</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble connecting to my Microsoft Exchange Server. </p>
<p>When I try to ping the exchange serer, the packet is successfully sent/recieved&nbsp;.
</p>
<p>Also when I check my email address name, it will locate the name and place it in an underscored display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, when I attemt to open Outlook and send/recieve emails, the exchange is not available.</p>
<p>I am using a wireless connection to connect to the local network, and using Windows 7.</p>
<p>I setup my email when I was in the USA now I am in Japan.</p>
<p>Also at&nbsp;one point outlook was functioning correctly in Japan, but has since stopped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two messages I recieve are:</p>
<p>(OX8004011D) The server is not available, contact your administrator if this condition persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Ox80040115) The connection to Microsoft exchange is not available. Outlook must be onling or connected to complete this action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Activate Microsoft Office Proplus</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working in IBM and they are providing accesses to all the office licences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to activate for the first time the microsoft office already installed on my computer with my e-mail adress (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***). The answer was bad request so i couldn't use it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, i uninstall this version and download a new one on ISSI (IBM Standard Software Installer: microsoft office 365 proplus) and after the setup, it was the same situation. The login doesn't work and i can't activate and also use the office suite. I already
 looked at all your help pages and i can't activate it by internet (i don't have access to this step during the setup) so i'm blocked.<br />
Is there a problem with my e-mail adress ? With a request ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stay available for any information.<br />
Best regards,<br />
Chems-Félix Joly.</p>

<p>This is the only screen that i got access. I don't have the product key because normally we are using the e-mail adress to activate it but it's not working with it too.</p>

    <title>Virus Behavior Found in Windows 10 Laptop and Windows Phone 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Virus Behavior Found in Windows 10 Laptop and Windows Phone 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a HP Laptop with Windows 10 Home edition on Thanks Giving Day. The Laptop was pre-installed with McAfee trial software, worked for a month and expired. Since McAfee expired after a month of my Windows 10 Activation, I installed AVG Antivirus
 free version in its place. However, I enabled Windows defender to protect my PC before installing the AVG Anti Virus.&nbsp;Since I am a Microsoft Technology Stack developer, I admired Microsoft and preferred Microsoft Products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two days back, that is on Jan 06, 2017, I found a strange behavior in my Laptop. The system was operating on its own. The key pad, touch screen and key board commands were hardly working. Immediately I disconnected my WiFi, uninstalled AVG Antivirus and
 performed a full scan of my machine with Windows Defender. The Windows Defender did not detect any virus as such apparently in the video and was displaying - "PC status: Protected" message. This time luckily I was able to capture the behavior using my Android
 Phone. I am sharing those videos here for your reference using the following <a href="https://1drv.ms/v/s!Alfr4P47enh_jVeBnvmC5i-wHBhT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Video Link">
link</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Alfr4P47enh_jVa7SDjGFeQ1BRoC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows Movie Maker">
link2</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A month before the Thanks Giving Day, I experienced exactly same behavior in my Nokia Windows 8.1 Phone as well. It also used to open my Contacts list and make phone calls or sometimes even disconnect the phone call I am talking. It used to merge the contacts.
 Whenever such a behavior occurred in my phone, the device did not respond to my commands. The only option I had was to switch of the Phone and WiFi. Then after sometime same behavior used to show up occasionally. When the device was quiet, I tried resetting
 the phone to its original factory setting state. Even that attempt did not work. Soon after I logged in with my Microsoft Account, the device used to work on its own again. In fact, I tried to reset my Phone around 4 to 5 times but nothing worked. I even tried
 cleaning the temp data.&nbsp;Some times it is dormant and some times it is active. I Binged around and read few articles that Windows Phone is a Virus Proof and hence no anti virus would be available in the Windows Store. But in my case, I strongly felt that my
 device was attacked and felt sad since Microsoft did not care to provide a protection to its customers. This is the reason which forced me to switch to an Android Phone and its affordability. Otherwise, I would have opted for IPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help me resolve this issue. Will this be covered under warranty.&nbsp;Since, I am suspecting it as a some kind of virus attack/hack, do I need to reinstall my Laptop or return the device. I am not sure, if this attack is propagating through
 Microsoft Account data sync across devices (The reason for suspecting Microsoft Account is that, the latest advancements enabled the devices to sync the user data across devices. Since I logged into my new Laptop with same Account which I used for my old Windows
 Phone, did the virus propagated using this feature) or through WhatsApp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking you in Advance.</p>

            <p>9 times out of 10, weird random opening of programs or moving of the cursor are simply due to either stuck or shorted keys on the keyboard, mouse buttons or the touchpad when a laptop is involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may not always seem to make sense, but to understand the specific actions this can cause you need to fully understand which keys or other inputs are involved, since they aren't always caused by a single key.&nbsp; In fact, it's possible that the driver for
 the device itself might be involved, in which case simply pressing all of the individual keys and buttons looking for a sticking key may not find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen many of these&nbsp;in these forums&nbsp;over the years, though most are more clearly obvious when they describe a single letter or symbol repeating, often in either the login dialog or when an editor like notepad is run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of the first video (the second is misnamed and so I can't open it), it appeared that the icons along the bottom of the screen were being cycled through, starting initially with Cortana and then later the individual applications in the Taskbar.&nbsp;
 The sequence seemed to thus include a possible Tab character followed by an Enter, since the particular item highlighted was then being selected.&nbsp; I can't&nbsp;determine how that sequence could occur, but it was otherwise so relatively predictable that I truly
 suspect it was related to the keyboard somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason most people don't believe this is possible is because they aren't aware of how fast a keyboard repeats and that in most cases the PCs operation slows this action down to some extent.&nbsp;&nbsp;So even though it appears that things are happening very fast,
 in reality they are much slower than the key inputs are actually occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the most common causes of these sorts of problems is spilling something on the keyboard or touchpad, since a sticky fluid will typically start to cause these issues days after the initial spill.&nbsp; Even if you think you've fully cleaned the fluid off,
 it always gets into the crevices between the keys or under the edges of the touchpad, eventually causing them to stick or otherwise act in very erratic ways like causing the cursor to move randomly around the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know all of this from lots of personal experience, with both other people's systems and my own.&nbsp; In my case I've spilled lemonade on laptops twice, with keyboard replacement the solution for the first and flushing out with water under a sink (keyboard
 removed of course) the second time.&nbsp; I still have one slightly sticking down arrow key, though fortunately it only makes a snapping sound&nbsp;rather than sticking in a pressed position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't say if this might also have been the cause with the phone, since those are typically a sealed screen with no buttons today.&nbsp; However, if anything gets under the edges of a smartphone display then the same sorts of flaky issues occur as with a touchpad,
 since that causes the same sort of false apparent pressing in areas near the pressure.&nbsp; In some cases a plastic&nbsp;screen guard or even the edges of a shock protecting case can cause these false "touches" of the display, the first of which I've&nbsp;had happen&nbsp;myself
 when the screen guard was slightly misaligned.</p>

<p>It seems like faulty keyboard/touchpad to me, TBH. I too use Windows Phone and, yes, it cannot be infected, certainly not like you explained. But, I am no Windows Phone expert so I can't comment anything about it.</p>

<h3> bill723  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE11 cannot open any page</h2>
                    <p>OK Win10 installation worked fine on my laptop. No issues after nearly a month. Now after installation of Win10 on my desktop, IE11 does not open any page. The window seems to open but gets stuck displaying address bar for home page, no page content. Cannot
 navigate anywhere. I am using Firefox to write this which I have now set to my default browser. Edge basically works for most sites but some I want don't work with Edge. Anyway, I want to debug IE11. Is there some way to install it freshly? Do I need to revert
 to Win7 and then reinstall Win10? Needless to say, I would prefer to get my favorites back in the process.&nbsp; Any help with this would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>I tried all three suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Followed link provided, but got following message: "We're sorry, but the diagnostic solution you have requested is not available at this time. Visit our solution center to find more fixes to common problems". Already been there and couldn't find
 anything useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Tried running without add-ons per step 1. It made no difference. IE11 still does not work when running in this mode. (By the way, I hadn't tried this slick old fashioned way to run apps. It does however require knowing what your doing with name
 and the switches)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: I have Reset Internet Explorer and it also makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some further tidbits...&nbsp; When I open IE11, the address bar shows at the top. Tool icons on the right still work. Minimize, maximize and close in upper right still work. I can enable tool bar and it shows below the address bar.&nbsp; In all cases no web content
 shows and no navigation is possible. Changed home page and it opens with that web page shown in address area, but still no content showing and no navigation anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further ideas?</p>

            Update - Nothing has worked to resolve this problem. I tried all the suggestions posted here, with no resolution. I called ASUS the manufacturer, since computer is still under warranty. They said call Microsoft. I did that and after more than 15 hours
 on-line in multiple escalated sessions (actually several days of clock time due to difficulty getting sessions scheduled and them actually calling when they said they would). During these sessions,&nbsp;they took remote control and tried a lot of things with various
 repairs and tweaks. Bottom line, the&nbsp;issue is still not resolved. In this process, it came to the point of trying to re-install Win10. They created an ISO on my hard drive, but&nbsp;that also did not work. While running setup.exe, an error message occurred.&nbsp; Microsoft's
 conclusion was that I had "third party software" that was interfering with the Win10 ISO installation. I'm personally not so sure. In any case, they said there is no way to fix this and I will have to do a cle

            OK another update. I found my Win7 system repair disk created when I first got this computer. I booted from DVD and some Windows 7 files were loaded. At the end of that a Win7 screen with a window to set language etc. came up. However, neither keyboard
 nor mouse was working so there was not any way to proceed. Called the manufacturer, ASUS, to see what to do. Phone technician suggested that I reboot.&nbsp; I did so and an unlabeled screen came up with an option to reset this PC. I selected that option and reformatted
 the Win7 partition. Interestingly Windows 10 re-installed itself into C:\Win7.&nbsp; This took some time and at the end after several restarts Win10 was running.&nbsp; Of course everything I had previously installed along with data files were gone.&nbsp;This time, however,
 IE11 works fine&nbsp;and other issues with Win10 before seem to be gone.&nbsp; However, I still&nbsp;don't trust the previous download of Win10. At this point all the old stuff is gone from my hard drive, so ther

            Final update...&nbsp;&nbsp; Win10 on this desktop is now working fine after the clean install described above.&nbsp; All this worked flawlessly&nbsp;but took a long time&nbsp;to get everything, including e-mail and contacts back into Windows Live Mail.&nbsp;Still a mystery as to what
 went wrong before, but it seems unlikely that it was actually 3rd party SW as suggested&nbsp;by the Microsoft technician. All that original"3rd party software" is now re-installed with no apparent issue. Oh well, sometimes you just have bad luck. It could have
 been worse like losing all my data or finding Windows 10 is incompatible with my desktop hardware. I am now counting my blessings...

            Hi Pavel
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Product keys for Office and Windows are 25 characters. It sounds like you have a Redeem Code, which is for use one time. 
<br />
<br />If Office 2016 was registered to your account, first deactivate it then install it on the new computer.
<br />
<br />Step 1:
<br />
<br />From any computer, go to your Microsoft account, Installs page and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services/office/install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/services/office/i...</a>
<br />
<br />Under PC/Mac installs used, locate the computer where you want to deactivate Office 365.
<br />
<br />Select Deactivate to deactivate Office 2016
<br />
<br />Step 2:
<br />
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.
<br />
<br />Forgot your account details? See I forgot the account I use with Office.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forgot-the-account-i-use-with-office-eba0b4a2-c0ae-472c-99f6-bc63ee2425a8?wt.mc_id=scl_installoffice_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forg...</a>
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, do the following depending on your version of Office.
<br />
<br />If you signed in with a Microsoft account, from the Office home page select Install Office &gt; Install. (Office 365 subscribers should select Install again).
<br />
<br />This begins the download of Office. Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the install.

            Hi!<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
The problem is that I sync my outlook calender with the phone, meaning that it automatically drops appointments (and therefore alarms) onto my phone....<br />
Is there any way I can completely turn off the alarm beep? (Other than manually deleting them from all of my outlook appointments?)<br />
Thx<br />
Martin

            Hi<br />
I have exactly the same problem.<br />
I've tried everything but there is know way to turn off all the alarms collectively.<br />
Eventhough my outlook are only reminders not alarms, it seems to default to alarms on the phone. Maybe the later version Nokia will give an option of cancelling all alarms instead of individually.<br />
For this reason I have stopped using the program, as I am sick of midnight alarms (consequently flat batteries).<br />
Regards<br />

            If you create a meeting in Outlook with a reminder, that meeting will be synced (as it should be) to phone as a meeting with reminder (not an alarm)<br />
<br />
Outlook has a really annoying feature that by default if you create a whole day even, there is a default reminder 18 hours before the whole day meeting takes place. It took me some time to learn to set that type of meeting (a whole day meeting) must be checked
 as "no reminder" in Outlook, that is the only way to prevent phone from reminding about a whole day Monday meeting 6.00 Saturday morning. argh.

            Hi Martin! I had the same boring issue: I generally write down my appointments on PC Microsft Outlook: If you unflag the alarm setting on MO all the next appointments into PC or mobile should be not yet alarmed. I hope for you!<br />

Happens with all Nokia phones I’ve had and synced with Outlook. Reminds me why I became Windows Mobile User. Thinking of changing back, I really don’t wish to be woken at Midnight.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I've got this problem too - I'd just like it to remind me silently. Is there anyway to change the Calendar tone on the nokia 6230i ?<br />
I've seen that on other phones people have set the tone to be a silent .acc file - is there any way of trying a trick like that on the nokia 6230i to prevent it from going off ?<br />
<br />
Is there any way of setting the volume for the calendar alert tone ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Bernard

<p>Perhaps I misunderstood what you wanted. The macro simply separates the costs for work and material type resources and writes those costs into two separate field, Cost1 and Cost2. It does NOT change what you see in the Resource Names field. In order to see
 the results of the macro, you need to add the Cost1 and Cost2 fields as columns in the Gantt Chart view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that help? If not, exactly what do you want?</p>
<p>

<p><strong>Can’t Activate Office 2011</strong><strong><br />
</strong>Your Office 2011 product key can <strong>not</strong> be re-used in any of the following scenarios:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Erased your startup volume and reinstalled using the 2011 installer</li><li>Replaced your hard drive or SSD drive</li><li>Attempt to install on a different Mac<br />
<br />
</li></ul>
<p>In these situations, you will have to buy a new product key. They’re cheap! Home and student sells for about $20 on eBay because Office 2011 is discontinued and because 2011 will not run in future versions of Mac OS. Home and business is pricier, but still
 a lot less expensive today than when it was new.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you attempted to install with an older installer, you’ll have to remove what you have already installed. Here's

<h2>            media player and DRM files</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, </p>
<p>Looking for help with a licensing problem on my pocket pc (verizon 6700) in media player. I downloaded some software (overdrive) onto my computer for audio books from my local library. I had to perform a security update on my computer to allow
 the drm files to play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I transferred to my phone (on the storage card, inserted into the phone during transfer of files) , the media player errors out "cannot play the file because the license is not valid or corrupted". I was thinking that I needed to perfrom
 the security update on my portable device, but cannot figure out how to so so, of if I am on the right track.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also wondering if there is anyone that has tried pocket music? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any help would be appreciated, </p>

<h2>            Office 365 email going into recipients junk folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently changed our email server to 365 as we were having a massive issue with emails working from abroad and also our emails going into junk. &nbsp;While 365 has solved the working abroad issue it has not solved the going into junk. &nbsp; We work with a lot
 of suppliers and often new ones where it simply is not possible to ask them to add us to a safe list! &nbsp;How else can we solve this?? &nbsp;It is really annoying and un-productive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi TanyaN80,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have removed your personal address to protect your privacy. Based on the email address you provided, I check it from our backend and find it indeed lack of SPF records. Maybe do you not add correctly? Can you share
 a screenshot showing your setting about SPF record? See&nbsp;</span><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/eopfieldnotes/2015/02/06/ensure-your-spf-record-is-correct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ensure your SPF Record is Correct</a>.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Windows driver Package&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've just spent the last hour clearing out some rarely used software when I noticed the
<strong><em>"Windows driver package - Nokia pccsmcfd legacy driver" </em></strong>in my list of programmes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The size of this application is 3.52gb</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That seems an awfully large file for some drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know if this is correct?</p>

<p>We have now seen few PCs where WIndows -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Add and Remove Programs informs incorrectly the driver size. Actually driver size is less than 30 KB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Don't worry about incorrect information provided by "Add and Remove Programs" in Windows</p>
<p>- Don't uninstall this driver, because it doesn't really take more than 30 KB disk space</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers, Samuli</p>
