<h2>            At Risk Message, shows virus protection is turned off</h2>
                    This is the 2nd day I got a message that my computer might be at risk. &nbsp;When I click on the icon it shows virus protection turned off. &nbsp;Yesterday I scanned computer and then it came on. &nbsp;My setting are that it is supposed to scan daily at 2:00 PM. &nbsp;Why
 is this happening?

            Thank you for the reply. &nbsp;The block was checked to run only after computer was turned on. &nbsp;Once I unchecked this box, turned off last night and back on this morning, the scan had run and system showed virus protection on. &nbsp;Thanks again for your help.

            <p>First of all, the PC must be on and not sleeping for a scheduled scan to occur. Furthermore, in the settings, make sure that the option to scan only when the PC is on and not in use is not selected. A screensaver can be seen as activity and a scan will not
 start. Finally, MSE should only alert if a scan has not happened in about a month. So, I believe that the following applies:</p>
<p>Courtesy of forum users le Boule and ahaap:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Are you using CCleaner?</span>&nbsp; Piriform has programmed it for some reason to remove part of the MSE History files and it's deleting the files
 MSE checks to determine the last time a scan was conducted.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Open CCleaner&nbsp;Applications Tab, Under Windows uncheck MS Antimalware...that should prevent CCleaner from deleting the MS Antimalware scanning history&nbsp;files.&nbsp; The actions of CCleaner&nbsp; should not have any
 effect on the antimalware protection provided by MSE.</p>
<p>Per suggestion of MSE User
may </span>also need to uncheck MS Management Console.</p>
<p>You may&nbsp;need to run a "Quick Scan" and possibly re-boot the computer to re-establish a scan history.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Do you use Advanced System Care?</span></p>
<p>If so, open ASC, in the upper right corner, click More, Settings</p>
<p>Scroll to Quick Care, Privacy Sweep, go to Windows, uncheck MS Antimalware and MS Management Console.</p>
<p>Scroll to Deep Care, Privacy Sweep, go to Windows, uncheck MS Antimalware and MS Management Console.</p>

I too am having this problem.&nbsp; I can see my open windows in PowerPoint on my MacBook Pro (running latest OS) when I use Mission Control, but when I select the window, it shoots up toward top and disappears but doesn't appear in a main screen window outside

<h2>            disk is full in excel</h2>
                    hi, i have a user here who is getting this weird error in her Excel (office for mac). the file is on a network share and when she tries to save it after edit, it says "disk is full". there is more than 800GB available on that share and she has full permissions
 to it. when this problem happens, she can save the document to local drive/desktop. if she try to save the file after a
<b>while</b>, it works without a problem. &nbsp;it seems, it is happening more often now on her mac. any idea? thanks in advance.&nbsp;

            "Disk is full" is a rather unhelpful message for a generic error - i.e., for whatever reason, XL can't successfully write a temp file to disk, delete the old one, and rename the temp file with the original name. That could mean anything from the disk is
 actually full to the user doesn't have permission to delete or rename files, etc.
<div>
<div><br />
<div>So it sounds like a network error. Is she seeing any other flakiness with respect to the server? In general, it's more reliable to work on a local disk anyway, copying the file from network to HD, working on it and saving, then copying it back, but that
 shouldn't be strictly necessary.</div>

            no other issues with the server apart from few XL documents doing this. yeah, working locally is a work around for now but it's not the solution for the problem. thanks anyway. &nbsp;

            It might be more productive to consult a forum that specializes in whatever server brand and version you have running. The key things to investigate are whether the server's current update is supposed to work with the current version of Mac OS X that is
 deployed.

            <p>Thanks for the reply, however I simply wanted to know what is the functionality. Perhaps I could ask what</p>
<p>will NOT work on the Windows Phone connected to the Microsoft Display hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can have a functioning Windows 10 OS, and I can open office, the browser and remote connect PC's??</p>

    <title>Two Search Boxes Reduntant&#59; Administrator Permission Still - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> l.ion may  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two Search Boxes Reduntant&#59; Administrator Permission Still lame&#59; My Computer icon</h2>
                    <p>MS please&nbsp;pick one&nbsp;search&nbsp;and delete the other. Even with both, It won't consistently &nbsp;find files in My Documents or My Pictures. The&nbsp;two can't do what one does in Win 7. To find files I often&nbsp;have to use File Explorer and use its search (works perfectly.)&nbsp;
 I put a picture in My pictures and named it Mr. Yuck. Neither search box (the magnifying glass taskbar one or the Start menu one can locate it. Seems lame to me.
</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>Like Win 8/8.1 it frequently tells me I have to have administrator permission to do something. Then I click continue and it does it. How stupid is that? After all, I&nbsp;had booted up, entered my password and am the only user and administrator. Yet it tells
 me I need permission to rename a picture that I put in the top directory of Drive C. Same thing if I delete a system Image or many other tasks. If it was for security it should ask for the password or PIN again and not just go ahead after clicking continue.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Allow showing My Computer icon&nbsp;on Desktop like Win 7. I had to go to file Explorer and drag the "This PC" icon to the desktop. I&nbsp;also&nbsp;did it by&nbsp;putting a checkmark in the box to show in the start list,&nbsp;and then&nbsp;dragged it to desktop.&nbsp;Still this is not an&nbsp;easy
 way to make a Desktop icon for beginners.</p>

    <title>When I try and copy images from Word 2008 to another program it looses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> candace6b  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I try and copy images from Word 2008 to another program it looses quality and looks blurry &#47; pixelated</h2>
                    I've been really frustrated trying to figure this out. I have tried to save images for email signatures at varying resolutions (72, 300, even 600 dpi) and putting them into a 2008 Word document to be able to distribute to employees and for them to be able
 to copy and paste easily into their email programs. But when I copy the images FROM Word, whether I placed them in the word document as a PNG, PSD, or JPEG, they look blurry and pixelated when I paste them into programs like Entourage, Outlook, and even if
 I save them from word, or paste them into Photoshop.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm very confused because I read in another thread that Word 2008 does not compress images but it MUST. If I drag the original image file directly into Entourage or anywhere else without putting it in Word first, it looks perfect. It's only when I copy
 it from word that I get substantial quality loss and it's simply unusable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't find any information on if there IS a compression option, where in Word 2008 I can turn it off. I am at an impasse and it's extremely frustrating because my boss expects these email signatures to be distributed this way (via a Word document).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated. Please help me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm on a Mac OS X 10.7.5 running Microsoft Word 2008 and entourage is also 2008.</div>

            Word doesn't compress images automatically. In fact, Word 2008 doesn't even have an image compression feature that you can impose.<br />
<br />
My understanding of what's happening is based on the fact that Word is designed to be a powerful
<i>word processing</i> program for the production of printed documents. It's intended to handle large volumes of text-related content as efficiently as possible. Images are one of the most detrimental elements that can be inserted into a document.
<br />
<br />
Although high quality images can be stored in a document they are not fully translated to the screen in order to maintain speed. The full quality is output when printed, but a low resolution preview is displayed on screen while working while viewing/editing
 the document. Copying captures only the low res preview, not the image file itself. That usually results in a less than desirable version when pasted elsewhere because all of the image file data isn't copied.<br />
<br />
Additionally, copying involves the OS X Clipboard which causes a conversion of the image. It's one of the most certain ways to degrade an image... It's a convenience provided for saving time &amp; effort at the cost of quality.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to insult your boss :-) but using a Word document as a repository for images -- especially if fidelity is a concern - really isn't an effective approach. Perhaps s/he'll reconsider :-) Most email software have an Insert&gt; Picture feature as well
 as a provision for creating Signatures that include images.<br />

            Before I comment about Word, I have to preface my comments with my opinion about the idea of distributing scans of signatures. I can't think of a more open invitation to fraud. IMHO a scanned signature should never, ever be used to authenticate anything
 at all. A scanned signature can be affixed to ANY document that says ANYTHING, including contracts and forms, at the whim of anyone and everyone.
<div><br />
<div>Now about pictures in Word. You can always get at the original picture contained within a Word document. Make a copy first, then change the file extension from .docx to .zip, Double-click the zip file and then navigate the resulting folder to the Media
 folder. Your original pictures are there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Word displays a rendition of the original picture on the screen. The rendition may have effects applied, been scaled smaller, be recolored, etc. It is the rendition that gets copied to the clipboard, not the original picture. &nbsp;So even if you had a high
 quality large picture, what you copy to the clipboard is what is displayed in the Word document, not the original, even though the original is stored within the .docx file.

            Bob,
<div>Thanks a lot for your reply, it was helpful in understanding the problem better. I do definitely see that copying the image from the Word program is where the problem happens. But the interesting part is even just opening the word document in another version
 of Word on a PC (For instance I did it on a Windows 2007 version of Word) results in degraded image quality. My boss was seeing this every time I sent her the document - all images blurry and low quality - and I could only see it when copying the image from
 the document to the email program - otherwise on my Mac the document looked fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was able to "solve" the problem by sending all the images to myself on a Windows machine and creating the document there. Then, copying images from Word 2007 on Windows into outlook maintained all the clarity of the image without pixillation. However,
 when I sent this new document back to my 2008 Word on Mac, again the images appeared blurry, even just in Word.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's an extremely confusing problem. But, there are only 3 users who use Macs in our office - we can forward the signature via email to these users easily enough. I'm happy enough to serve the needs of 200 other employees - all on windows machines - with
 this document where they can easily copy and paste signatures. While I agree this method may not be the best for distributing images, unfortunately it currently is the easiest ways to set up our employees with their signature for their business unit (we have
 about 10 different signatures depending on a person's role in the company and what BU they are in). It's the simplest way right now that my boss, and all of the company is familiar with, to easily distribute it and have people set up their own signatures easily.
 It's not my call to change their distribution, I'm simply supposed to make sure it works, and do the graphics.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks a lot for your insight.</div>

            Hi Jim,
<div><br />
<div>Sorry for the misunderstanding - the signatures we are using are simply text and images, there actually is no written scanned signature being used. It just is our company logos and some affiliations we have for our business units, and typed names, contact
 info, etc. I only meant "email signatures" in the sense people can set up a "signature" to automatically send with each email they write.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the information about word. I will have to try the .zip method to see if that works. Even if it does, however, it will still defeat the usability of the word document we are creating. We have about 10 different "signatures" for our 200+ employees
 depending on their business unit and department. We bring in new employees quite frequently and it is much easier to send a simple document with the approved signature they can use, and fill in their personal information themselves, rather than customizing
 each and every employees signature etc.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks a lot for the information I now have a much better understanding of why the problem exists. As I said in my reply to Bob, I was able devise a work-around to serve all windows users (which is all but 3 people in the company) by using a windows version
 of Word (2007) to create the document. For whatever reason, copying the images out of this document on a Windows machine works perfectly and doesn't lose quality. However when opening the document made in Windows on Mac Word 2008, all images again appear blurry.
 Maybe the .zip method can at least fix this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for sharing your knowledge around this issue.</div>

            Hi again,
<div><br />
<div>You might experiment with a document where the image size is not altered by Word. In other words, use a graphics program to make the image file the size and resolution you want. Then when you insert the picture into your Word document don't resize it or
 apply any formatting to it. Right-click on the picture and choose Format Picture. On the size tab make sure the height and width are absolute and the scale is 100% for height and width. Then go through the other tabs and make sure there are no special effects,
 lines, fills, etc applied. I would think a picture that's set up plain like this ought to play nicely across platforms and when copied and pasted.</div>

<p>
</p><p>I had that problem too, but I fixed it. All you need to do is download Windows SDK 2006 or higher. Maybe there's something wrong on your browser that's why it fails to install. You must check Virtua Tennis 4 PC requirments on the internet. Then compared
 the VT 4 PC requirments on your PC system information on Dxdiag.exe . Where?&nbsp; (for windows 8 or 8.1) just point your mouse on the right side of the screen and click search, search RUN. then, Run will open and there's a searchbox, there you will type Dxdiag.exe
 . Also try to reinstall windows live on other browsers. That's all, Hope it helps! thanks!!</p>

    <title>No check-box filter menu in table column - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colorvision  say:</h3>
<h2>            No check-box filter menu in table column</h2>
                    All of the columns in a Table made in Access 2007 have the drop-down check-box filter menu working appropriately, except for one.&nbsp; This column is formatted identically to many of the others (combobox), and I have checked the related table that it draws
 the items from.&nbsp; Do you know why this might be happening?&nbsp; I would be happy to provide more information if that would be helpful.<br />
<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know some reasons will cause drop-down check-box filter menu disappear when you open a table in Access 2007. If columns or controls that are bound to
 expressions do not support filtering, or some Data Type like Memo,Attachment for table column does not support filter. Please refer to the following article to get help.</span></p>

            Hi Rex,<br />
<br />
Thank you for responding to me.<br />
<br />
I had the same thought, but the format of the column is "Number".&nbsp; I have another column in the table that pulls data from a similar sub-table in pretty much the identical way and it works!&nbsp; Here is how I have the parameters set (all items not listed are blank)...<br />
<br />
<p>Data Type: Number</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>General:</p>
<p>Field Size:<span>&nbsp; </span>Long Integer</p>
<p>Decimal Places: Auto</p>
<p>Required: No</p>
<p>Indexed: Yes (Duplicates OK)</p>
<p>Text Align: General</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lookup:</p>
<p>Display Control: Combo Box</p>
<p>Row Source Type: Table/Query</p>
<p>Row Sourse: SELECT….</p>
<p>Bound Column: 1</p>
<p>Column Count: 2</p>
<p>Column Heads: No</p>
<p>Column Widths: 0”</p>
<p>List Rows: 8</p>
<p>List Width: Auto</p>
<p>Limit to List: Yes</p>
<p>Allow Value List Edits: No</p>
<span>Show Only Row Source Values: No<br />
<br />
</span>
<p>Best,</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What happens or doesn't happen when you click the filter menu for this column?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you receive an error:</span></p>
<p><span>Run-time error '3075':</span></p>
<p><span>Syntax error (missing operator) in query expression &lt;expression&gt;.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If so, it's likely that the column names or table structure has changed in your lookup table since you created the lookup.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try this:</span></p>
<p><span>1. In your lookup properties for this field, click the ... at the right of the row source property to launch the query editor</span></p>
<p><span>2. Ensure that the field names for the 2 columns in your query match the names from the source table</span></p>
<p><span>3. Close the query editor and choose Yes to update the row source with your changes</span></p>
<p><span>4. Save the table</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any change?</span></p>

            Hi Dennis,<br />
<br />
I don't get an error message.&nbsp; Everything works normally, except that there is no check-box filtering capability (all text filtering and sorting options work perfectly).<br />
<br />
I reviewed the Row Source selection as you suggested and it looks correct.&nbsp; To be sure, I also compared it to a nearly identical field that works fine.
<br />
<br />
I certainly appreciate your help.&nbsp; If something else comes to mind, please let me know!<br />
<br />
Best,<br />

<p>Hi Maria, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the screenshot of Product Information, it seems you are using Office suite form Office 365 Home plan. I'd like to explain that not all editions of Office suites have Power Pivot. To learn more, see

            Hi Ijas,
<br />
<br />It depends on the hack, sometimes this can go un-noticed for a long time
<br />
<br />It further depends on what go hacked, your Microsoft Account, Email account web browser, Social Media account, an installed key logger . . . there are so many ways of attacking a PC
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows Defender and Fire wall or a 3rd party security suite and keep those up to date, you will probably be Okay, but nothing is certain. . .
<br />
<br />You basically need to be vigilant and would need to look for strange behaviour on your PC
<br />
<br />Are you experiencing strange behaviour and if so, please explain that in more detail . ..       
        </p>

            You should be ready to prevent hackers and make sure your windows and antivirus software are update. Normally, when someone attempt to hack you, you will see spyware and malwares in antivirus software. You might see suspicious process in task manager.
 Unwanted or suspicious change in your PC. There is no single rule or formula to see and compare and see if you are being hacked or not. But Windows is designed in a way to show you warning when something is suspicious , so don't ignore warning from Windows
 specially security warning.

            Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
It's an expected behavior that the corresponding workspaces in Power BI will be deleted if we delete the plan in Planner. The reason is the related group will be deleted if we delete the plan, so all resources related to the group will not be accessible.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
James

<h2>            Donation of Office for Community Project</h2>
                    Hello! &nbsp;I was wondering if anyone knew where I might be able to download a FREE version of Microsoft Office. &nbsp;My team and I are working on a school project where we will be doing a learning project at a local homeless shelter. &nbsp;We are hoping to teach them
 MS Office to help some of them get some of the skills that are required in the work place. &nbsp;However, after getting donated computers, we would require a download of Office, but do not have funds to pay for this. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know that we can do the 30 day trial, but I was hoping to get something permanent since they are keeping the computers and we could do this as needed in the future.<br />
<div><br />
Is there somewhere I can go to get help with this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for your help!</div>

<h2>            Start a link in full screen mode in IE</h2>
                    
<p><span><span><span>Dear all,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I would like to create a shortcut to SharePoint on my desktop for all our users. This shortcut should start IE in full screen mode as if you would
 hit the F11 button when the browser is open. This would allow the users to have more space to display the different lists and would give SharePoint the touch of an installed application on their desktop.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I do not want to change any registry keys, because the browser should work for all other websites as usual (&gt; if somebody wants to surf in the internet,
 the person opens IE with the standard IE shortcut). Only the SharePoint website should open in full screen mode (F11).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I know the kiosk mode, but I don’t want to reduce the browser functionality and I don’t want to use another browser.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Any ideas?</span></span></span></p>

<div>This would be a good application for a keyboard macro (if your users have programmable keyboards with unused keyspace &lt;w&gt;).&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, you could create a script which does both functions.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g.
