<h2>            &#34;Failed to create file&#34; Konica shared folder running Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Ever scene we were forced into Windows 10 our Toshiba e-350 business class printer can not write PDF files from the scanner to a shared folder under Windows 10. I have searched for darn near a year but the problem remains unfixed by windows.</p>
<p>The printer saves the file to an internal shared folder and we can use explorer to navigate to that folder and the file will open normally. The problem is, the file that is sent to the shared folder on a windows 10 machine comes up with a size of "0k" (not
 ok,) an empty file but with the right file name. When you try to open it you get an error obviously as there is nothing there, just the name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be a permission issue but the fact that the file name is written has me at a loss.</p>
<p>I have tried every conceivable approach within property's granting full control to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The log file within the printer, under scan, shows an error "Failed to create file".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sure miss Windows 7. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device seems to not be working as it did back in your previous operating system. We'd like to know some things to determine what changes we can apply to correct the error. Kindly answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did you install the driver for the printer?</li><li>Do the files appear differently when saved in a folder that is not shared?</li><li>Can you share more details about the configurations you did to the permission?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend using the printer with the compatible driver for Windows 7. If you have upgraded the PC to Windows 7 but left the driver for the printer untouched, it may have a hard time coping with the new operating system. To try this suggestion, follow
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">
this guide</a> by Andre Da Costa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you see changes after altering the driver version in use.</p>

<h2>            Icon size automatically changes....</h2>
                    Whenever my computer goes to sleep it automatically changes the size of my desktop icons to large. Is this normal? I have set the icons to small but need to reset them all the time because they automatically switch. Is there any way to shut this off?

            Hi jmoss,<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
<br />
2. Have you made any recent changes to the computer?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to check with the video card and the driver installed on your computer. Download and install the latest updated driver from the manufacturer website to view as per the required resolution. You may have you contact the manufacturer for getting
 the correct drivers –<br />
<br />
Do check for any exclamation or cross marks with the network adapter in device manager.<br />
<br />
Check if an update of the driver is needed. On right clicking the driver it will show an option to update. Click on that and follow the instructions.<br />
<br />
<strong>You may also update the drivers following the steps below:</strong> <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open Windows Update by clicking the Start button, clicking All Programs, and then clicking Windows Update.‌ If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In the left pane, click Check for updates.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. To see if updated drivers are available, click View available updates. Windows Update will list any updated drivers that are available for devices installed in your computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. If updates are available, click the driver that you want to install, and then click Install. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
Refer to the below mentioned link for further assistance:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong>OR</strong> <br />
<br />
If you already have updated drivers then you may follow the below steps to reinstall the Display driver through device manager:<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
Do the uninstall procedure of drivers mentioned below only if you have a back up CD of the driver -</strong>
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click System and Maintenance, click System, and then click Device Manager.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Note </strong>If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System, and then click Device Manager.<br />
<br />
<strong>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</strong>
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. In Display Adapter, expand Display Adapter, right-click the device drivers listed, and then click Uninstall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. When you are prompted to confirm that you want to remove the device, click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Restart the computer.<br />
<br />
After the computer restarts, the drivers will be automatically installed. Check after this procedure. If this does not fix the issue you may consider updating the display drivers from the manufacturer website.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>You may also check for the power management settings and check -</strong>
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open Power Options by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Power Options.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the Select a power plan page, click Change plan settings under the selected plan.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. On the Change settings for the plan page, click Change advanced power settings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. On the Advanced settings tab, expand Sleep, expand Allow hybrid sleep, and then do one of the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. If you are using a mobile PC, click on battery or Plugged in (or both), click the arrow, and then click on.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. If you are using a desktop computer, click Setting, click the arrow, and then click on.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Click OK, and then click save changes.<br />

<h2>            How to convert MBR primary drive to GPT without losing data</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My apologies if this is a repeat. I initially installed my Windows 7 64 bit onto a 3TB drive as an MBR. Therefore, I have 1TB of disk I cannot use unless I change it to GPT. I recently upgraded to windows 8 pro (NOT a clean install, but an upgrade) and
 now my Windows 8 is on the same type of drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is what I like to do:</div>
<div><br />
I want to convert my primary drive (i.e the drive with Windows) to GPT without (preferably) losing my data. Here is what I have tried to do to save my data:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. I have tried to create a system image to my external 3 TB hard drive, but I&nbsp;continuously&nbsp;get an error 0x807800C5. I tried and format my external hard drive to both MBR and GPT and I get the same message.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. I purchased Acronis True Image 2013 and tried to clone my disk from there. It won't allow me to clone to my external drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can I use File History to save my files, format my drive to GPT, and recover with a system repair disk? Any other methods to convert?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I have to clean install Windows 8 (which I would not prefer, but will do to get to use all 3TB of my drive) how can I do a clean install when I don't have a disk due to me just upgrading online.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for all your help and please let me know if there is any more info you need.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<h2>            MORE ISSUES&#33;&#33;&#33;  Keyboard Flaking out now...What is happening&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So now, on top of the other issues plaguing this device, just today, out of nowhere, for no reason, my keyboard is now freaking out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meaning, I cannot reduce the brightness of the keys.&nbsp; I hit the key to reduce it and what happens?&nbsp; It pops up the Edge Browser!!! WHAT? When I try and increase the brightness, it refreshes the browser.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, when I try and decrease the volume using the keyboard, It tries to close the browser.&nbsp; When I increase the volume, it acts like I am trying to enter a new URL. Mute button does the same thing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am in brightly lit room, now, I cannot even SEE THE KEYS because I cannot reduce the brightness!!!!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone PLEASE tell me what is going on here? </p>
<p>
</p><p>And for the LOVE OF HUMANITY, please tell me I don't have to do a full reboot of the my device and start from scratch, which I've had to do THREE TIMES IN TWO WEEKS to try and solve other issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is getting beyond ridiculous!!!!</p>

</p><p>Sorry to hear about your troubles with function keys on your Surface&nbsp;Book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have there been any changes&nbsp;or additions to Surface, installed apps or programs, accessories or language packs around the time this started?</p>
<p>Are you finding the functionality of all function keys changed?&nbsp; Can you verify FN lock, and does this change your experience?</p>
<p>Create a new local account, are you seeing the same behavior there?</p>
<p>Bring up the full onscreen keyboard.&nbsp; Are there any lit keys, as if&nbsp;'stuck'?</p>
<p>

            Check to see if the light is ON on your Fn function key.&nbsp; If it is, it then turns the top row of keys in to F1 through F12 keys instead of the Windows keys.&nbsp; The Fn key is now a toggle. &nbsp;This is by design and helps me immensely with Visual Studio 2015
 and software development.

    <title>Windows 10 is printing a background&#47;watermark - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 is printing a background&#47;watermark</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping someone can help. I have a new compute with windows 10. I have a new MFC Brother L8600CDW printer. Everytime I print something from the computer in the background covering the whole page is a series of faint dots like a watermark all except for
 a skinny border around the page. It does not happen when I print anything direct from the printer so therefore it isnt the printer it is something coming from Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has this happened to anyone else?&nbsp;</p>

            What software are you using to write the letter? It sounds to me like there’s some sort of stationary background automatically being printed along with the text.&nbsp;

            Yes that is exactly what its like a stationary background... have windows 10 and doesnt matter what program im in either word or quickbooks printing invoices! Ive rung Brother but because if doesnt do it on the manual test page it has to be coming from
 the computer! Is there anyway we can contact microsoft direct or would the print quality im choosing matter? Frustrating!! Thanks for answering

<p>It’s as though the template being used in both programs is set to use the same one. I know word allows creating a letter from a blank template so you could try writing a new letter using the blank template to see if it happens with that (if you haven’t already).</p>
<p>I can’t imagine it being the print quality. It’s more like when you choose to create a new letter it’s opening a stationary template rather than a new blank one.</p>

    <title>Monitor Flickering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pegasusstrike  say:</h3>
<h2>            Monitor Flickering</h2>
                    
<p>I currently use my Xbox 360 (Halo Reach Console) with a Dell ST2320L Monitor and hook it up via HDMI.&nbsp; However, I've noticed that when I turn my light off or my bathroom fan off that my monitor will go black for about 2-3 seconds, and then come back to normal.&nbsp;
 I would also notice that when my tenants used their television downstairs, my monitor would do the exact same thing, except more frequently.&nbsp; My monitor used to have this issue before when hooked up to my computer, but I've since purchased an uninterruptible
 power supply (UPS) and my monitor stopped having the "flickering" issues when I turned my light or fan off when it's connected to my computer.&nbsp; When I use my Xbox, I plug it into my UPS, but the monitor still goes dark for 2-3 seconds when I turn my light
 off or my fan off.&nbsp; I've tried nearly every single plausible outlet in my home, and everytime I turn my light off or my bathroom fan, my monitor still goes dark for 2-3 seconds.&nbsp; I suspect that it might have to do with the wiring in my house, the amount of
 energy my Xbox requires to run, or perhaps something is wrong with my Xbox.&nbsp; Is there any solution for this problem?&nbsp; I'd prefer not to restrict using my Xbox for when my tenants aren't home.&nbsp; Thanks for any help anyone can provide :)</p>

<p>Hey OP, this definitely sounds like an issue with the electrical current you're plugging into. The easiest way to make sure it's not the Xbox 360 would be to try it at a friend's house on one of their displays. Can you give this a go, and report back here?

<p>Thanks for the response. &nbsp;I tried plugging my Xbox 360 into an outlet at my friend's and I turned some things on and off (lights, fans, etc.) and nothing happened with my Xbox. &nbsp;I'm fairly certain that it has something to do with the wiring in my house,
 but is there any product I can purchase to regular the power in order to stop the flickering or maintain a constant voltage to my Xbox?</p>

<p>There is actually something you can buy. There are devices called UPSs (uninterruptable power supply), which are units you plug into the wall socket which then supply power to other devices. It's basically a smart battery which lets you ride out any short
 term problems with the mains supply, such as voltage drops/spikes ect. A decent domestic one with added surge protection will start at around $150, but it really depends how much you want to spend. Remember to read online reviews and seek professional advice
 before you buy. Oh, and avoid anything made by "Monster".</p>

<p>[quote user="PegasusStrike"]I've since purchased an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and my monitor stopped having the "flickering" issues when I turned my light or fan off when it's connected to my computer. &nbsp;When I use my Xbox, I plug it into my UPS,
 but the monitor still goes dark for 2-3 seconds when I turn my light off or my fan off.[/quote]Is your monitor plugged into a battery-backed UPS outlet or a surge suppressed UPS outlet? Is your UPS showing voltage fluctuations when you turn on/off the light
 and fan?</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>If the monitor is not on a battery-backed UPS outlet, try that first. You should also install whatever monitoring software your UPS came with and see what it's showing when you turn on/off the light and fan.</p>

<p>Ah, I re-read the original post and saw that you already own a UPS, so feel free to ignore my last message. Try Icestorm's suggestions first as it is a bit unclear what is plugged into the UPS.</p>
<p>Also to clarify, is your house supplied on single phase or 3-phase power? Is this supply problem endemic to your area or just your house? If just the house then you could try hireing an electrician to fix what's going wrong. It'll be costly but the problem
 with get solved at its source.</p>

<p>My monitor and Xbox are plugged into my UPS whenever I play, but it will still flicker whenever the fan or light is turned off, and still flicker when my tenants watch television. &nbsp;I'm currently using an APC Power Saving Back-UPS 750 and it's hooked up to
 my computer via USB port. &nbsp;I've tried fiddling around a bit to see if my computer can register if there's a voltage fluctuation whenever I turn off a fan or my light, but haven't been able to find it so far. &nbsp;I've also tried plugging the USB into my Xbox as
 well, but that doesn't seem to do anything. &nbsp;My UPS is capable of running my computer and Xbox (although I try to avoid this), and I haven't had any notifications from the program on my computer regarding any fluctuations.</p>
<p>I have no idea if my house is supplied on a single phase or 3-phase power. &nbsp;I really think it has something to do with the wiring in my house, but I feel like that would be much more expensive than if I purchased something to monitor/regulate my voltage.
 &nbsp;Even though my UPS cost me $100 and was supposed to do the job, it doesn't seem capable of handling it when my monitor is hooked up to my Xbox. &nbsp;Are there any other products that I should be looking at? &nbsp;Thanks again for all your responses so far guys</p>

<p>[quote user="PegasusStrike"]My monitor and Xbox are plugged into my UPS whenever I play, but it will still flicker whenever the fan or light is turned off,[/quote]No, that's not supposed to happen if your devices are on the battery-backed outlets.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Your UPS has two rows of outlets. One has a single outlet boundaried by a line and labled Master. The second row has three outlets labeled "Controlled by Master". Make sure your montior is on the row with the outlet labeled Master, and not on the other row.</p>
<p>[quote]I've also tried plugging the USB into my Xbox as well, but that doesn't seem to do anything.[/quote]It won't. The 360 won't know how to communicate with the UPS.[quote]Are there any other products that I should be looking at?[/quote]First make sure
 your monitor is on a battery-backed outlet. If it is, pull the power plug on the UPS and see if it stays on or the UPS dies right away. A UPS that fails right away indicates there's a problem with the battery or the transfer from wall to battery power.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Beyond that, you can get a rather pricey online UPS. Online UPSes always power devices from battery. They're pretty expensive.</p>

<p>My monitor and Xbox are always plugged into the row labelled, "Battery Protection + Surge Protection," which is on the row with the Master outlet.</p>
<p>I just took the plug of my UPS out of the wall and everything is running fine still. &nbsp;I know this UPS is supposed to be able to regulate the voltage, but I would love it if there was some other product that could just regulate the voltage to my systems as
 my UPS already has the backup power supply covered.</p>

<p>I've changed my UPS to the highest setting possible in terms of voltage fluctuation manually on the UPS and also through the computer application and neither is working when I turn my light off or my fan. &nbsp;I haven't had time to play on my Xbox while my tenants
 are at home or watching television, but my guess is that it still won't fix the issues that I'm having.</p>

            Hi,
<div>You should open the catroot2 folder by using the “CD” command. The path at point will look like c:\windows \system32\catroot2 (‘C ‘being the drive on which windows is loaded)</div>
<div>You can now delete the contents of the catroot2 folder by typing “del *.*” this will delete all the contents of the folder including files and sub-folders that were in the catroot2 folder.</div>
<div>If there is any other issue with Windows updates post back and we will happy to help you.</div>

 runs scans in the background durng idle periods.&nbsp; In addition, the Sony VAIO has a VAIO Care program (i.e., diagnostics, repair, updates, and&nbsp;restoration options, etc.) that is launched from time-to-time when I encounter computing problems.&nbsp; BTW Vaio Care
 facilityis not working properly at this time either.</strong></p>

<p>Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The Norton "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here as well as in your other thread concerning KB2667402 failing to install.</p>
<p>Note: KB2667402 was first released on 13 March 2012 and then re-released on 12 June 2012. See the FAQ on

<p>2. In your reply above you told me that a 30-day Norton free-trial came preinstalled on the Sony VAIO computer when you purchased it on 28 December 2010. Did Win7 (64-bit) also come preinstalled on the computer when you purchased it?
<strong>Windows 7&nbsp;Home Premium&nbsp;was pre-installed. However, it was&nbsp;upgraded to Windows 7 Professional via Windows Anytime Upgrade facility online on 12-03-11. I purchased the license from the computer vendor on 12-28-10 along with Office Professional 2010, which
 was an upgrade for the Office pre-installation.</strong></p>
<p>3. Did you (a) uninstall the Norton free-trialware AND THEN (b) download/run the Norton Removal Tool [1] &amp; reboot (c) AND THEN do a clean install of Norton 360 v4.x?
<strong>I am meticulous; I followed the recommended installation procedure. I kept a copy of the Norton Download Manager instructions dated 01-03-10. the installation process was&nbsp;automated; Start Download&gt;Run&gt;Continue = automatic download and install of the

</strong></p>
<p>4. Was Norton 360 <em>v5.x</em> installed when the Norton tech uninstalled it &amp; then did a clean install of Norton 360 v6.x?&nbsp;<strong>Norton 360 v4.x was installed to replace the trial version.&nbsp; Norton v 5.x was purchased by me via update on 12-21-11.&nbsp; I
 believe that the&nbsp;Norton Tech uninstalled the existing version prior to performing a clean install of Norton 360 v6.x.</strong></p>
<p>5. Do you know if the Norton tech ran the Norton Removal Tool &amp; rebooted the computer before (s)he installed Norton 360 v6.x?
<strong>The Tech, in my opinion, was experienced.&nbsp; I believe&nbsp;that the Removal Tool would have been&nbsp;used if that is protocol.</strong></p>
<p>6. What problems were you having that led you to contact Norton Support on or shortly before 20 March 2012?
<strong>On 12-01-11, Identity Safe in my Norton product&nbsp;would not&nbsp;autofill certain Web forms (financial institutions).&nbsp; It was then that a tech installed Mozilla Firefox in lieu of using IE.&nbsp; (Case# 01270469).&nbsp; Despite laborious manual diagnostics, he could
 not correct the issue&nbsp;and opined that autofill would simply not work with certain sites as a function of security related matters.&nbsp; I accepted his explanation and resolved to manually fill certain logons.&nbsp; On 03-20-12, I contacted Norton because I noticed
 that&nbsp;fees were assessed for an obsolete Norton product via automatic renewal.&nbsp; Rather than requiring a refund of the unearned fees, I accepted an extension of my current Norton subscription.&nbsp;&nbsp;This led to the upgrade.</strong></p>
<p>7. When (exact date) was Service Pack for Microsoft Windows (KB976932) installed according to<strong><em>Update History
</em></strong>(this time)? [2] <strong>The Service Pack was installed on 03-31-11.</strong></p>
<p>8. Is IE9 working OK when you choose to use it? <strong>Yes.&nbsp; It is functioning normally.</strong></p>
<p>9. What happens when you attempt to launch Chrome? <strong>Chrome does not launch.&nbsp; Yesterday, after you inquired about Chrome, I attempted to launch it.&nbsp; When it failed to launch, I decided to uninstall it;&nbsp;moreover, I do not use it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What&nbsp;do you recommend?&nbsp; I really do not want to re-image my computer.&nbsp; Some files and programs will simply not function properly afterwards, despite back-ups.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is obvious to me that certain third-party programs do not integrate or bridge well with Microsoft products.&nbsp; What, In your opinion, is the underlying cause of this Microsoft Security Update and driver problem?&nbsp; I would place the onus on Norton,
 but I do not&nbsp; trust Norton Techs to resolve a Windows 7 issue any more than I would trust HP to resolve these issues.&nbsp; Sony is not likely to&nbsp;be any more helpful.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I must get on with business; too many days have been lost.&nbsp; Using a semi-functioning computer is adversely affecting my productivity.&nbsp; Does Microsoft offer immediate one-on-one trouble shooting and support?</strong></p>

            <p>After following your instructions precisely, I regret to inform you that the installation of Security Update KB2667402 failed; it rendered the same error code 80004005. Every step was accomplished without problem or error with one exception;I did not restore
 the changes that Norton&nbsp;Registry Cleaner had made as I could not readily identify a reliable restoration point.</p>
<p>IE 9 appeared to run without error prior to these fixes and continues to operate normally.&nbsp; Slipstick was launched as instructed, even though it applies to Google Chrome, which was uninstalled yesterday.&nbsp; I&nbsp;infer&nbsp;that it is designed to fix issues with the
 Registry.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For Step 9, exercising discretion as you intructed, I ran the ie8-rereg.64on64.cmd as the OS is 64-bit.&nbsp; Neither ie8-rereg.32on64.cmd nor ie8re-reg.all.zip were&nbsp;launched as they do not apply.</p>
<p>Note that before we&nbsp;began this resolution process,&nbsp;the Fix-It processes 50202 (default&nbsp;and&nbsp;agressive)&nbsp;had already been applied by me to reset Windows Update Components.</p>
<p>What do you suppose it is&nbsp;about KB2667402 that causes it to be rejected?&nbsp; Which system components or programs does it affect?&nbsp; Might the problem be caused by something other than Norton; particularly since complete eradication of Norton components and clean
 installation of the program has been accomplished?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recall, I discovered the issue when troubleshooting my HP scanner which had quit working.&nbsp;HP insists that Windows 7 Updates are crucial to resolving the HP 8500 A909a all-in-one printer issues.</p>
<p>What do you think about re-attempting the solutions&nbsp;suggested in KB2509997?</p>
<p>Do you have the capacity to engage other Microsoft Engineers for additional insight?</p>
<p>What do you suggest?</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued&nbsp;guidance.</p>

    <title>Active program window &#39;disappears&#39; when mouse is clicked.... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Active program window &#39;disappears&#39; when mouse is clicked....</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been asked by a colleague to look at a rather strange issue with her PC terminal, where the active window will disappear behind other open windows when the mouse is clicked.&nbsp; For instance, if several windows are open such as Chrome, outlook &amp; file
 explorer and outlook is the top window, if I click "New" to compose a new mail, the outlook window will disappear completely behind Chrome and file explorer. OR if I have file explorer on the top and click "File," the file explorer window would disappear behind
 outlook and chrome.&nbsp; This only seems to happen when a virtual button is pressed, as opposed to clicking on the screen over the active window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If only one window is open, then everything works perfectly - that is to say that the programs all function - its just impossible to use when every time you click to do something,&nbsp; whatever you're working on disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC is running Windows 10 x64 and this issue has started recently, within the last few weeks.</p>
<p>As I type this, I don't have access to the terminal - I will repost the full spec when I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else come across this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for all your help and wisdom :)</p>

<p>Hello TheFen92,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will need more information about the Windows device to properly address your concern. Kindly verify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Is the issue happening on all user accounts?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>Can you tell me the current <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>OS Build</strong></span> of the Windows system? Right-click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, select <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong>, and then scroll down to
<strong>Windows specifications</strong> to find this information.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>While we wait for your response, I suggest performing a clean boot to determine if the issue is caused by a software conflict. A clean boot is an isolation method that boots your PC with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. Follow the steps outlined
 in the section: <em><strong>How to perform a clean boot</strong></em> from this <strong>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I<span><span>f you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you
 as soon as I can.</span></span></p>

<p>I have the same problem, called into Microsoft support twice now.&nbsp; First time they deleted a corrupted and created a new profile.&nbsp; 2nd time (yesterday)
<span>tech support </span>did a windows update.&nbsp; Still have the issue.&nbsp; Very frustrating, to the point of considering a mac book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I open explorer and attempt to rename a file I can not because the window deactivated and goes behind whatever else is open in that area. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click the start button, the second I move mouse from tray, start minimizes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I alt tab to switch windows, same thing.</p>

<h2>            Strange problem with keyboard My USB keyboard randomly stops working with its numlock light still on.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help immediately. I am using Windows 8.1 on a desktop PC I just bought for only a week. My USB keyboard randomly stops working with its
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">numlock light still on</span>. I have to randomly hit several keys (5-10 keys) quickly to make the keyboard work, and a few seconds later it would stop again. Re-plugging the cable makes it work for only a few seconds.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The keyboard works flawlessly with another machine</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem started a few days ago which re-plugging it would solve the problem, until today when it gets worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Device Manager did not show any problem, and the options on the Device Properties' Power Management tab did not work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My job involves using a program which hotkeys are essential, and this problem occurs in an urgent part of a project. I need help as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: My keyboard model is Acer SK-9626. And I tried re-installing USB Input Device and HID Keyboard Device drivers but it does not work.</p>

            Thank you very much for the reply. I am sure the problem is not with the USB plug, because I tried changing the port from the back of the case to the front one.<br />
<br />
This problem disappeared however. When it happened today I was in a middle of a large data transfer via an ad-hoc wifi connection, but I don't know how the wifi has anything to do with the keyboard. And I doubt the problem is permanently gone since it happened
 many times before even without any heavy transfer.

            <p>Quite honestly it sounds like a USB hub has a problem.&nbsp; But before we jump to any conclusions, I'd be curious if it happens in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 8, you can get to safe mode by holding shift as you click the Restart option on the power menu.</p>

            Thank you. I will try the safe mode if I have time.<br />
<br />
The problem happens randomly, sometimes I left the keyboard for hours and it's still working fine, and sometimes it stopped right when I am working, so I can't be sure if it would never happen in safe mode at all.<br />

If the issue is fixed in safe mode, then I would suggest you to perform clean boot and remove the program that is causing the issue.<br />

I would suggest you to connect different Keyboard and check if you are facing the similar issue. If you are not facing the similar issue with different keyboard, then the issue is with the keyboard. If you are facing the similar issue, then I would suggest
 you to update the Keyboard drivers.</span>

<p>I cannot wait for this game. This was a great way to start the day. IMO GTA:IV was great and by the time The Ballad of G@y Tony was released I think they were really heading in the right direction. With GTA:IV and RDR paving the way for GTA:V my expectations
 are very high.</p>

<p>I really liked what Rockstar did with GTAIV. That being said I also did enjoy San Andreas and going crazy in the Hydra. Either way, whatever they do with it I'll be happy as long as it's GTA. From what I have seen from the trailer it all looks like good
 fun. I wanna fly a Jet again.</p>

<h2>            BF4 - Single Play Campaign - Lost all progress</h2>
                    
<p>Spent about 5 hours playing BF4, single player on my xbox one. &nbsp;This morning, I load the game, resume campagin, and it loads from the beginning of the game. &nbsp;Seems no saves load at all, what a waste. &nbsp;Don't feel like replaying as the single player was boring
 enough. &nbsp;Funny though, the achievements I got thus far are still showing. &nbsp;No clue why this happened, but it shouldn't happen at all.</p>

<p>This is exactly why its stupid that Microsoft took away Storage Management from the users' control. You can't back up a working saved file on a USB stick in case situation were your saved file gets corrupted. You are forced to use a stupid system that in
 effect has only 1 copy of every game save youve ever played on the Cloud. Xbox One cloud doesn't care if its automatically uploading a corrupted same game file or not. Erasing your last working saved game file on the cloud. You are left with ZERO working backups
 of your save game.</p>

<p>I'm guessing Microsoft built in checks to prevent corrupt saves being uploaded but yes, without memory management you can't even check a save games file integrity.</p>

<p>I contatced EA this morning as mine has also been wiped. I am under the impression that the issue is related to the China Rising DLC and when that gets patched, single player should be reinstated. From what they told me, if you are connected online you are
 playing the campaign through the cloud. </p>
<p>This has been by far the worst launch i have ever witnessed, and i have had a lot of launch day consoles. Fifa glitches, battlefield 4 dlc issues, achievement issues, and single player issues. A real joke</p>

<p><span>Are you aware of problems with your internet connection or is the problem specific to this address?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your report seems incomplete in other respects.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool as like any registry cleaner it can
 lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal mode. Disable other security software whilst
 you are doing scans.<br />

            Haven't played it yet, but being in the game pass will let a lot of people try it without the need of third party reviews and then decide, after actually playing the game, if it is fun or not.

            I havent played it yet but I think its hard to judge a game from 10 minutes. I’m not saying it’s not great. But I think most games need a bit more time to see what they are really like.

            I had to pay $100.00 for a local computer troubleshooter to come in and utilizing&nbsp;third party software&nbsp;he was able to "hack" into my computer and open it.&nbsp; We reset the password.&nbsp; Microsoft was no help in solving the problem.&nbsp; The resetting of the password
 did not work in my situation because I was using a "local log in" password.&nbsp; The only recommendation I was getting from Microsoft was to reinstall Windows&nbsp;in which case I would have lost all my data.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 Screen Saver issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My screen saver will not come on after upgrading to windows 10. My power saving features also will not work correctly after the upgrade. This is quite annoying because I love Windows 10. On the plus side my sleep command on my keyboard works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p><br />

            No.&nbsp; I should not need a degree in computer software engineering, nor should I have to go in and manually manage every component of a $2500 high-end computer just to make the operating system operate correctly.&nbsp; Isn't windows 10 supposed to be the latest
 and greatest?&nbsp; I am not a Mac guy, but I can certainly see the logic in some of their arguments...

<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that after restart all your screensaver information that was saved from Windows 8 or 8.1 will show up.</p>

            I tried all your methods. I use razor periphelials for gaming. Once I&nbsp; unistalled the software the issue was resolved. Trouble is I need the software cause I am a gamer and its my equipment. I chalk it up to poor design. I never had issues with windows
 7 .I guess I will go back. Windows 10 is a fail product. Do more testing guys, u really didn't have to rush it.

            Are you saying we have to use the default settings? That we can't adjust them to our preferences? Why provide the option to adjust them at all? Your solution isn't much of a solution.
