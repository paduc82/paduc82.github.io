<h2>            How to free unused keys for Office Home and Business 2013&#63;</h2>

                    <span>We have about 8 office installations and more than a dozen keys for&nbsp;</span>Office Home and Business 2013<span>.
 Somehow all these keys seem to be used, possibly by installations on machines that ended up as garbage years ago. Is there a way to free unused keys (older machines that we do not use any more, but might have missed to explicitly deinstall Office)? MS support
 already told me they cannot do anything.</span>

<p>Norman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The person you spoke to at Microsoft Support is wrong.&nbsp; You need to push to have your issue escalated.&nbsp; It is only Microsoft that can 'deactivate' an installation where&nbsp; you no longer have access to the computer on which it was installed.&nbsp; The Product Key
 provided by the vendor is your proof of purchase.&nbsp; However, it is not only the Product Key that is involved.&nbsp; It is also the email address and password for the Microsoft Account used to setup Office Home and Business 2013.&nbsp; It will be helpful if you can provide
 at least the email address of the Microsoft Account used to setup/install your Office 2013.&nbsp; Microsoft are reluctant to assist because it is pushing Office 365.&nbsp; If they could get away with it they would no longer provide standalone versions of Office.&nbsp; The
 below is an extract from Home and Business 2013:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>"Genuine proof of license</strong>. If you acquired the software in a physical package, your proof of license is the genuine Microsoft Certificate of Authenticity label with the accompanying genuine product key, and your proof of purchase.
 If you acquired and downloaded the software online, your proof of license is the genuine Microsoft product key or PIN for the software that you received with your purchase, and your proof of purchase from an authorized electronic supplier of genuine Microsoft
 software. Proof of purchase may be subject to verification by your merchant’s records."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>PS: when Office 2013 was first introduced it was possible to setup/install it without using the email address and password for a Microsoft Account.&nbsp; This caused big problems because end users could not reinstall Office from their Office Account because
 one was not created because the email address and password for a Microsoft Account was not used.&nbsp; Using the email address and password to setup Office 365, 2013, 2016 creates an Office Account from where you can reinstall Office as many times as you desire.&nbsp;
 Not only that it also acts as verification of licence/Product Key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It may be worth knowing that the Product Key provided by the vendor is a Redemption Key.&nbsp; The actual Product Key is stored on the Office Account.&nbsp; They are different Keys.</span></p>

<p>PPS: What you are wanting to do is transfer the licence to another computer.&nbsp; Normally, this is fairly easy because all you need to do is uninstall Office from the old computer and reinstall it onto the new computer from the Office Account, which recently
 the link to the Office Account has been added to the Microsoft Account/Services and Subscriptions: &nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://account.microsoft.com/services/</span></a></span></span>
 &nbsp; You would need to sign in with the email address and password for the Microsoft Account used to setup Office</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>RETAIL LICENSE TERMS</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>How do I obtain a backup copy? You may order or download a backup copy of the software from microsoft.com/office/backup. You may not distribute the backup copy of the software. You may use it only
 to reinstall the software on the licensed computer. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can I transfer or reassign the software to another user or computer? You may not transfer the software to another user.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You may transfer the software directly to a third party only as installed on the licensed computer, with the Certificate of Authenticity label and this agreement.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Before the transfer, that party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may not retain any copies. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may reassign this software license to a different computer any number of times, but not more than one time every 90 days. If you reassign, that other computer becomes the “licensed computer.” If you retire the licensed computer due to hardware
 failure, you may reassign the license sooner.</span></p>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>thanks a lot, every word you wrote seems to be right. We finally called MS by phone, and they just freed at least one key. We also found an old computer, that we could still run to deinstall Office there.</p>
<p>The thing managing the keys through the email-adress authenticated interface is that there one gets no information about the keys, not even IF they are used, let alone on which machine.</p>
<p>At any rate, thanks again for the help and for keeping our spirits up ;)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Keep pressing Microsoft to 'release' the keys.&nbsp; I am sure that your company records show that you purchased them legitimately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing:&nbsp; You can install up to 25 instances of Office Home and Business 2013 using one Microsoft Account. But don't install them all at the same time, because the servers get worried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you install an Office on a computer obtain the Product Key from the Office Account at:
<span><span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://account.microsoft.com/services/</span></a></span></span>&nbsp;
 Note the Key and date so that you will know in the future which Office is installed on which computer.&nbsp; See:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-multiple-one-time-purchase-office-installs-that-use-the-same-microsoft-account-b2897d43-9ec1-4040-9cf0-2bafa416e071?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage

<h2>            Bluetooth on 950 won&#39;t connect to Ford Fusion Sync.  Any ideas why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a 950xl and it works great with the Ford.&nbsp; When it connects, it says "voice, messages".&nbsp; But when I repair my wife's 950, all it ever gets is "music".&nbsp; It pairs as an audio device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would it not be able to do the same thing the 950xl does?&nbsp; They are both on the same version of the OS (10.0.15254.401) although the firmware is different (mine: 01078.00053.16236.35006&nbsp; hers:&nbsp;<span>01078.00053.16236.35005)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm sure her phone USED to work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>… time passes …</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried both phones on my MB SLC 300.&nbsp; Both worked fine there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why the Ford would work with one and not the other?</p>

<p>I seem to have gotten it to work.&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure what part of what I did made it work.&nbsp; But what I did was delete the Sync from the phone Bluetooth devices.&nbsp; Then I deleted the phone from Sync.&nbsp; Then I went into the system settings on the Sync until
 it let me add a device.&nbsp; The phone was listening for pairings.&nbsp; The Sync said it found the device and did the number match.&nbsp; I didn't say yes, but said add a different device (or some such wording).&nbsp; That let me to a secondary menu which listed the phone.&nbsp;
 I clicked on that, then I think I got the prompt with a number again.&nbsp; I had a similar dialog on the phone so I said yes to the phone and then yes to Sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it all looked like it worked.&nbsp; Voice, messaging, and music.</p>

<h3> carmen921  say:</h3>
<h2>            C2-03 TEXT MESSAGING INSERTING CONTACT PHONE NUMBER</h2>
                    
<p>I'm a celphone prepaid loader so I often refer to my phonebook &nbsp;whenever I send a prepaid &nbsp;load. In other nokia phone model to paste a contact person's name or phone number in the body of the text message all you need to do is choose "insert name" or "insert
 number" and I can't seem to find this feature in the c2-03 model. All I can find is "insert symbol" which would only allow you to insert special characters or smileys, whereas &nbsp;"insert object" would allow you to add attachment. &nbsp;This is a very important feature
 as it saves time to just import the information from the phonebook instead of inputting phone number right off the keypad.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;CETokyo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to verify, since when have you been experiencing this issue? Can you tell us the version of the Outlook application that you're using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, if you have another Outlook account, kindly check if the same issue persists. In this way, we can further isolate if it's account related or it's just with the application. Also, if you have another iOS device that
 has an Outlook app that you can use to sign in to your account, kindly check if all of your IMAP subfolders will appear.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="contentHeader2"><span>I have seen this question before but it hasn't really been answered. Can anyone help?</span></p>
<p>Nokia Lumia 735.</p>
<p>Windows mobile 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past two months, I have exceeded my data plan with my mobile provider only a few days into the month. I do not use my mobile excessively, and have always had some MB remaining at the end of the month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the past two months, my data plan has been all but used up by 'Data to Restore'. Under 'Data Sense' where it shows the usage of the data on wifi and 4G etc this app tops the list. There is a large amount of wifi data used by it and an even greater
 amount - almost all my 500MB plan, of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Data to Restore' isn't an app as such, but seems part of the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my mobile set to download on wifi only, so don't see how it would have used it on my data plan.</p>
<p>Auto uploads and backups are turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this?</p>
<p>There is no explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have since upgraded to Windows 10 mobile today so will see if the same issue occurs again this month but would still appreciate any response anyone has.</p>

            Hi Frenchmicky,<br />
<br />
<br />
This issue may be hardware or software related given that settings are good and that the issue occurred only after the latest Windows update. To resolve this, let's perform a
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">soft reset</a></strong>. This method will not remove
 anything at all from your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situation.<br />
<br />
To perform a soft reset:<br />
1. Make sure your phone is turned on.<br />
2. Press and hold the volume down and Power button until your phone vibrates and restarts.<br />
<br />
Take note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'Slide down to power off' prompt appears).<br />
<br />
After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
We're just here if you have further questions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have raised various tickets with MS on&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportrequestform/8ad563e3-288e-2a61-8122-3ba03d6b8d75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">New support request</a>&nbsp;for the same IP and each time I have the same templated
 responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I get a response with a ticket number.</p>
<p>The next response from MS says "Not qualified for mitigation".</p>
<p>Then when I follow up I get "I do not see anything offhand that would be preventing your mail from reaching our customers"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The name of the helpdesk user changes but the text is always then same. &nbsp;I assume I'm not actually reaching a human.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further follow-ups from me requesting escalation is simply ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two relays - one works fine and the other is blocked by MS.</p>

<p>Hi JTTKU,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the conversation runs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next response from MS says "Not qualified for mitigation".</p>
<p>Then when I follow up I get "I do not see anything offhand that would be preventing your mail from reaching our customers"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the their response to my follow-up implies that "Not qualified for mitigation" means there's nothing wrong (and therefore there's nothing to mitigate) rather than there's no way they can fix it (which would be nonsense anyway since the issue
 is clearly with their MTA).</p>

                    Здравствуйте! Мой Nokia Lumia 800 видит сеть лишь одного из трёх украинских операторов (сеть Киевстар). В сим-картах остальных операторов он видит их меню (установленные сим-приложения), но пишет "нет сети". Телефон приобретён в Германии, поэтому он никак
 не может быть залочен под Киевстар. В чём тут дело и что сделать, чтобы он работал с сим-картами других операторов. Спасибо!

<h2>            can&#39;t receive emails intermittently from chartermi.net</h2>
                    I have recently installed Office 2007 with outlook on my home computer. I can send emails on my charter.net account via outlook with no problems. I can receive emails via outlook with mixed results. Sometimes the emails download with no problem. Most times,
 however, the receive fails with the following error message:&nbsp; ! Task "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***-Receiving" reported error (0x8004210E) : 'Your mailbox is temporarily unavailable because another e-mail message is being&nbsp; delivered to it or another mail application
 is accessing it. The server responded : -ERR [IN USE] account is locked by another session or for maintenance, try again.'
<br />
<br />
I have an android mobile phone on which I established an account for my chartermi.net email account. The emails to my phone are fine. I checked with Charter and it will not offer any tech support for any third party email programs, such as outlook, but suggested
 that I contact Microsoft Support. Can you help? Thank you!<br />

    <title>Outlook 365 opening messages keeps moving them lower on screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 365 opening messages keeps moving them lower on screen</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue that developed about 3 months ago.&nbsp; I am using Outlook 365 and when I open email messages, they open in a new window correctly the first time.&nbsp; The message opens full screen as I have it set to open.&nbsp; However, the next message I open will
 open slightly lower on the screen as if it is trying to tile over the first message.&nbsp; This happens even though I have closed the first message.&nbsp; It will continue to open each new message I open lower and lower on the screen.&nbsp; This is very annoying because
 as the messages continue to open lower on the screen, it prevents me from scrolling down on the message also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Office 365, but it still continues to happen.&nbsp; I have compared all my settings for this install of Outlook with another computer I use and they are identical, but the other system does not have this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem began about the same time that there was a system update for Windows, but it may not be related.&nbsp; I tried to reset the computer back to before the update and uninstalled Office and reinstalled it but it still had the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This system is running Windows 10 on a Surface Pro 3.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Randyb06,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you mind trying to record a video for your issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my checking, when I open a new email, it will be opened to full screen, when I&nbsp;minimize the window, then create another new email, it also will be&nbsp;expanded to full screen, rather than lower than the first one. Please try to&nbsp;maximize the second emails
 or it cannot be maximized any more.</p>

    <title>access to msn.com email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jt holck  say:</h3>
<h2>            access to msn.com email</h2>
                    Four days ago I received a pop-up message requesting a password for my email account as I was reviewing my emails. &nbsp;When I typed my current password, it then brought up a screen that said someone else may be trying to log-in to your email account and lead
 me through options to get a new code. &nbsp;Unfortunately my secondary email address was defunct (old job) and the phone number was a land-line, so unable to text a code. &nbsp;I submitted a ticket to receive a cod e but that was 3 days ago with no reply from microsoft
 within the promised 24 hours. &nbsp;I then went on the chat-line which went for over an hour only to have them recommend I submit another ticket, which I did. &nbsp;I have heard nothing from microsoft technical support from either of these tickets and am now very anxious
 to get this issue resolved - I've been without email for over 4 days now! &nbsp;How can I get a new code (password?) to once again access my msn.com email address? &nbsp;Thanks for any help!

            <p>Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;I did check for viruses and did not have any on this laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then attempted to reset my password (have tried that multiple times over the past few days). Unfortunately it is the reset password process that is not working. &nbsp;When prompted, the options are to send to your secondary email (mine is now defunct as it
 was with my previous employer), text to the phone provided when you set up the email (the one listed for me is a land-line), or phone call. &nbsp;I just tried the receive a call option (again) and it is not working. &nbsp;A call comes in from "Verify" (714-707-3260)
 but there is no answer or person or recording on the other end - just one ring and a hang-up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whoever "Verify" is, that service is not working. &nbsp;So I am still stuck with no "new code" to reset my password and still without my msn.com email. &nbsp;It is unfortunate that no one from microsoft seems to care about their customers.</p>

<h2>            How do I see a list of external users I have shared a file with and remove some&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I cannot believe how difficult this is or if it is even possible. &nbsp;So I have a folder on my OneDrive for Business and I shared it with a user outside my company. &nbsp;That user can edit files, create files, etc. &nbsp;This works fine. &nbsp;But if I then want to remove
 that user from access to that folder I cannot. &nbsp;In fact, I can't even see that the user is shared with. &nbsp; I see nowhere that I can get a list of users with access to the folder. &nbsp;I had assumed that I would have a "shared with" option and just be able to "uncheck"
 that person from the list. &nbsp;But there is no option to see who a folder is shared with, either outside or inside the company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at Sharepoint, this has the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I missing here?</p>

            <p>In the "modern" ODFB view, you have a column that indicates the "sharing status" for every file/folder. Click on the "Shared" entry, it will bring the right pane where you can see a list of people (and guest links). Pressing Change Permissions will allow
 you to remove individual entries, or revoke access altogether by pressing the "stop sharing" link on top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the Classic view, when pressing the "shared" entry a dialog will popup, where you will be presented with a similar options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The experience can certainly be improved, no question about that...</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can check the list of the shared users or delete them with the steps below in OneDrive for Business:</span></p>

<p><span>You can check the list of the shared users or delete them with the steps below in SharePoint Online:</span></p>
<p><span>Select the file&gt;Share&gt;Shared with&gt;Advanced&gt; Select the users you want to delete permission&gt;Delete unique permissions</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: The external users who has signed in account can be showed in the list. That means, if you share with them without sign in requirement, you can’t see them in the list. You need to remove the shared link to delete the permission for

            <p>Thank you for the response. &nbsp;But I did that and there is no list, &nbsp;just "add people", a link icon, and myself as the owner. &nbsp;I shared it with another account outside the organization and can in fact open the folder and edit or create files in it from that
 account. &nbsp;But I do not see that account listed in the users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, even though I know this is shared because the people I shared it with got the email and in fact accessed the folder there is no indication of this in the right pane:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d981861-2590-4c50-bd11-8c0c43847ca1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d981861-2590-4c50-bd11-8c0c43847ca1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I shared this twice with 2 different people today, 4/20. &nbsp;I have refreshed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So again, no way to see users. &nbsp;To your final comment, if I share a folder with 3 people and I want to remove just one from access I have to delete access to all three and re-add two? &nbsp;Or add each one individually so I can delete them if I like? &nbsp;</p>
<p>This of course assumes there is a way I can actually see who I shared it with, which I can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really sad, to accomplish this I need to have them use Google Drive. &nbsp;There, you just add the users and when done you just click "x" and it's revoked. &nbsp;Even if it worked as you point out it would be far too cumbersome for the average non-technical
 user and I would again hear the chorus of "Why do we use this? &nbsp;My Google Drive or Dropbox is much easier". &nbsp;I have no intelligent response to that, because they are right. &nbsp;So far the only useful thing in this deployment has been email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the rant, but it really is frustrating. &nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jim,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We understand your feeling. To help you approach the requirement and deliver better experience for you, please see the information below:
</span></p>
<p><span>The sharing feature not only has "shared with" function, but also has "get a link" function. Either of them can be selected by your situation.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>With the “shared with” function, we can add or delete permissions individually which is hit your requirement.
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69e6c5fa-49b6-4d83-96b9-9ef3be152809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69e6c5fa-49b6-4d83-96b9-9ef3be152809" /></a></p>
<p><span>And with the “manage links” or “get a link” feature, you don’t have to add the accounts manually. This is very helpful when you want to share public items to large number of users.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>About the issue that you can’t see the users in the list, please check the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>As only sign-in required person will be showed in the list, ensure you have checked “Require sign-in” when you share with external users.</span></li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb04877b-8a9b-4406-8207-5a3ac731e9d7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb04877b-8a9b-4406-8207-5a3ac731e9d7" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><span>The new shared users haven’t accessed to the shared folder. After they have accessed the shared folder, they will be showed in the list.</span></li><li><span>If you are using “Get a link” function, ensure the access link is sign-in required.</span></li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afe63a16-e72c-4626-8885-28a0d07ab61f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afe63a16-e72c-4626-8885-28a0d07ab61f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We know the functions are too much so that some customers are a little confused. But all the questions can be posted here and we will be glad to help you solve them all the time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your understanding,</span></p>
<p><span>Rena</span></p>

            <p>I have no idea where "manage links" is in your first screenshot, I don't see that anywhere. &nbsp;Even if it did, look at your screenshots. &nbsp;Are you really going to put some non technical executive through that? &nbsp;Then when they come and ask you in 6 months "can
 you get me the list of people I shared that report with?". &nbsp;You have to say "I have no way to get it". &nbsp;He or she is going very quickly want to know what exactly they are paying for. &nbsp;Especially when I can get that same info in 2 minutes in my Google account
 which is free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for signing in, that is not an option. &nbsp;If we share with an outside vendor we cannot expect them to have a MS account, nor should we. &nbsp;So we will (according to what you say) never have any idea who we have shared it with, unless we write it down on a
 sticky note and put it on our monitor;+}</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, even if we did, if one of those people becomes somebody we need to remove, then we have to remove the link for everybody and re-share it with the others. &nbsp;Do you know how that presents to a customer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more I look at this the more I become disappointed I suggested this solution to the company. &nbsp;It makes me look like an idiot and I can't argue with them, I just assumed something as elementary as this would work like other cloud file solutions. &nbsp;Now
 I have to tell them they can't do it and to use Google drive. &nbsp;It seems like Office 365 is fine for an in house solution, but if you have customers or vendors or contractors outside the organisation it falls flat.</p>

            <p>Hi Jim,<br />
<br />
Sorry for us making it confused. I have written a summary to keep it clear for understanding how this external sharing works.<br />
<br />
Per your description and information provided, I assume that you are sharing the folder by clicking Share button and set the sharing options like below<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c86b170-1ef9-4112-8612-c92545c9c1a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c86b170-1ef9-4112-8612-c92545c9c1a0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Via this way, the external user will receive a link with edit permission to this folder in their mailbox. When they click the link, they are access the folder.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong><br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The external user himself doesn’t have any permission to the folder, but the link itself are granted edit permission.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please notice that if anyone who accidently get this link, he will also be able to access the folder and have the same permission as others.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As external user are not directly granted the permission, OneDrive for Business won’t record who is actually accessing the folder. Therefore, external users information won’t be shown anywhere in OneDrive for Business.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Since you want to remove some of the external users’ permission, it is not feasible to do so. To control the permission of external users sharing by this way, we can only manage the link itself. Therefore, either all external users’ permission are removed
 or all permission are remained.<br />
<br />
Considering your situations, there could be two options.<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remove the existing link, and create a new link. Send the new link only to the external users you want to share.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Share by selecting “<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Only people in the To: line</span>”. In this way, external users need to register a free Microsoft account or Office 365 account (if they have an Office 365 account for their company, it is also
 workable). However, the good point is that you can check a list of external users you have shared because permission is directly granted to their accounts. And permission can be managed per user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you still have any concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ryan<br />
<br />

    <title>Calculations using bookmarks in a forms field Word 2019 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tegween  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calculations using bookmarks in a forms field Word 2019</h2>
                    <p>I set up a form using text boxes and the properties of these boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance my first text box is Monthly Income which I have bookmarked as 'monthyincome'. It is formulated as a number with two decimal places and both the Fill Enabled and Calculate on Exit are selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reference the 'montlyincome' text box in my form and I have below it I have a text box which has a bookmark 'exclusion' which is a fixed number formatted to two decimal places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next we have a total text box which is bookmarked as 'earned'. This text box is of type "Calculation" and the expression is = (monthlyincome - exclusion)/2. It is formulated as a number with two decimal places and Calculate on Exit is selected. This works
 just fine but then I run into problems when I use this result, which I said earlier is bookmarked as 'earned'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance further down in my form I have other text boxes, one of which is bookmarked as 'unearned' and a total income text box which is bookmarked as 'totalincome' and it too is &nbsp;formulated as a number with two decimal places and Calculate on Exit is
 selected. The type is "Calculation" and the expression is = (unearned + earned).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tab out of this text box the result is padded with an extra .52. The padded number varies depending on what 'monthlyincome' is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as to what is happening here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed it by subtracting whatever the padding turns out to be but since it is not a fixed amount the form is of no real use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            My Tab, Arrow, and Enter keys quit working in Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have been working in one Excel spreadsheet with very little formatting, or formulas, etc. and all of a sudden my tab, arrow, and enter keys all quit functioning at the same time. &nbsp;They work for anything other than moving between the cells in my spreadsheet.
 &nbsp;This is a job that I am doing for a client who needs this done fairly quickly. &nbsp;This has slowed me way down. Any suggestions? &nbsp;This is my livelihood! &nbsp;What could be causing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked scroll lock. That is not it. &nbsp;I have done the file&gt;options&gt;advanced&gt;transitions thing that others have discussed and that has not worked either. &nbsp;I have started and restarted Excel and my computer. No luck. This is extremely frustrating. &nbsp;It's
 only in Excel that these six keys lose fuctionality.</p>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to know the edition and version of office installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>To find out, open Word or Excel ---File----Account---next to the update option icon you see the Office build.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Was it working previously?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Was there any updates installed.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Do you get any error messages?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us try to open excel in safe mode and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do that, close Excel. Let us type in ‘Run’ in the search bar next to start button, click on the 'run' icon that appears – in the 'Run window' type in Excel /safe and hit ok. (Note: There is a space
 between Excel and /).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result,</span></p>
<p><span>Click the File tab. </span>
</p>
<p><span>Go to Options.</span></p>
<p><span>Click Add-ins.</span></p>
<p><span>In the Manage section, select COM Add-ins and click on Go.</span></p>
<p><span>Now uncheck the Add-ins and click on OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try to repair Office from the control panel and install all the updates and check.</span></p>

<h2>            How do I make Outlook download graphics in emails by default</h2>
                    I've recently installed Office 2010 Pro. &nbsp;When I receive emails, any that include graphics or pictures come in with just white boxes with a red X in the upper left corner. &nbsp;I can right click on the box and click "Download Pictures", but this gets to be
 labor intensive when I receive numerous email this way. &nbsp;How can I make Outlook download the graphics by default? &nbsp;I've searched the Options and all of the ribbons, but can't find any settings to make this happen.

            Use SHIFT-Restart to get a boot menu and then choose to Go back to the previous build. You could also try mounting a replacement blank virtual hard disk in the same VM and clean install 15025 so that you can still test it.

</p><p>having difficulty getting =DATEDIF function to work in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 'start date' of column 'E,4' which is 28/08/2009 (UK date format) and in column 'M,4' I need to calculate the current age so it would appear as 8.1 years but this total needs to be a running total so that whenever opened the actual age to nearest
 month appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the following formula but I get the dreaded&nbsp;#NUM! appear in the M,4 cell</p>
<p>
</p><p>=DATEDIF(TODAY(),E4,"y,m")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help and advice on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>DATEDIF Function works like below for your understanding:</p>
<p>=DATEDIF(Start_Date,End_Date,"Parameter")</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have entered: =DATEDIF(TODAY(),E4,"y,m") where 2 wrongs:</p>
<p>1. Today() is always greater than E4, so if you deduct then a - (negative) figure will show and it returns #NUM error.</p>
<p>2. Second wrong is you have entered 2 parameter with "" (Double quotation mark). You need to use just once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like below:</p>
<p>=DATEDIF(E4,TODAY(),"y") will show you 8 years</p>
<p>=DATEDIF(E4,TODAY(),"Ym") will show you months after deducted all the years</p>
<p>=DATEDIF(E4,TODAY(),"Md") will show you the remaining days after Months deducted</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, for getting the age result you can use this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=CONCATENATE(IF(DATEDIF(E4,TODAY(),"Y")=0," ",DATEDIF(E4,TODAY(),"Y")&amp;" Year "),IF(DATEDIF(E4,TODAY(),"YM")=0,"",DATEDIF(E4,TODAY(),"YM")&amp;" Month "),IF(DATEDIF(E4,TODAY(),"MD")=0,"",DATEDIF(E4,TODAY(),"MD")&amp;" Day "))</p>

<p>
</p><p>As I think NO. The formula returns 30 days but not a month. You can mention it as I've shown in my earlier post using Concatenate.</p>

<p>Thanks for your fast reply, it doesn't work as '8 years 30 days' is too long so I will leave it as '8.0'</p>

<p>Fair enough...</p>
<p>...but to me, it seems just what you're looking for: Just take the year/month/days calculation, and remove the days part, and remove the texts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it&nbsp; :-)</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the solution on the web page below and adapted it for displaying it to look like a digital format</p>
<p>
</p><p>=DATEDIF(E4,TODAY(),"Y")&amp;"."&amp;DATEDIF(E4,TODAY(),"YM")</p>
