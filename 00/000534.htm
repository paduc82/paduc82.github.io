<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The dial pad should be working using keyboard number pad. What is the exact Skype version number that you’re using?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you trying to dial a number during a call?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Noevir_L</p>
<p>The Skype version I am using is 12.9.604.0 - supposedly the latest available for Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I call a number, and when I am asked to "hit 1 for sales, 2 for service" etc, or I am asked to enter the conference ID, the number pad on the keyboard is disabled for some reason. I have to use the cursor to take numbers off the dialpad shown to me on screen
 by Skype, which is extremely inconvenient. This was not the case in previous versions of Skype that I have been using for some six years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be some sort of change in settings, but I can't identify it.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>
<p>Simon</p>

<p>Hi. I finally got to speak with someone who knew something about Skype, and they told me to download and install a previous version of Skype. I currently have running V 7.40.0.151, which works fine. Just don't be tempted to replace it with a more recent
 version!</p>

<p>Yeah, I was using the "classic" (desktop?) version before updating to the Windows 10 version and didn't have an issue with that one. So you're saying, you never were able to get it to work with the newer one eh? That's just beyond frustrating. I am usually
 a big fan of doing updates as with most companies it means improved performance, but SO OFTEN with Skype the newer versions have LESS functionality than the older ones... I just don't get it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for taking a moment to reply, it's appreciated. I am hoping that someone has a work around for this, as I'm on conference calls all week that require me using the dialpad while on a call.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>If you find a workaround, please let me know. I just can't use Skype without being able to use the keyboard for the dialpad! For the time being, I will just use the older version, though. I completely agree that each new Skype release seems to do less than
 the previous one!</p>

<h2>            Office 365 email client</h2>
                    My company in Australia is basically a korean company and it is from korea, they control the outlook emails. We have subscribed for Office 365 enterprise e3 and every thing was going good. My boss needs to set up a new email setup on our current server, so
 do I need to install office 365 from the start to my server or just install the email client to the server. Could any one please help me and I am kind of desperate to get the answer.

<h2>            White Screen of Death on 5800 xm</h2>
                    
<p>Clue anybody to probable&nbsp; cuase of white screen of death on a 5800 xm&nbsp; . Where phone just&nbsp; sticks on the white screen&nbsp; or sometimes the actual boot screen . Its not a&nbsp; reboot that happens phone just freezes battery out solves the problem . Have an idea that
 it could be tied to the Auto Keyguard switch&nbsp; but that may be a red herring .</p>

            this happend with my old N97 and it took a hard reset to solve it, the guy in the vodafone shop said its caused by an unresolved system argument (error) which could be caused by a dodgy download,<br />
not sure about the 5800 but its s60 v5 as well

<p>I had this problem - went on for weeks, and a hard boot didn't fix it for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The remedy in the end involved simply hooking it up to my PC (tethered connection), and my 5800 finally overcame her stubborn white screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia PC suite somehow, perhaps by interrogating the device, managed to bypass the fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also recommend upgrading to the latest firmware and OS, as it has ended improving performance and stability for me as well as adding many Symbian features previously unavailable on the 5800 such as scrolling contact bar etc.</p>

<p>its annoying the heck out of me as it has only been since the last upgrade to V 40 summat or other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i've turned the auto keyguard off in settings just to see if that solves the problem for now.</p>

<p>hi amiri,</p>
<p>to narrow down this issue, i’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. are there any other versions of office co-exists in the two user’s computers? if yes, which version of office is the default program?<br />
2. how do you install the office 2013, from office 365 portal, or other way?<br />
3. have you tried in another computer with the same office 365 account to see if this issue persists? this will help us confirm if it’s related to the user accounts themselves.<br />
4. could you provide us with the screenshot of the extra activation page? to upload screenshots, you can click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> and then click the icon of <strong>insert/edit media.</strong></p>
<p>to further troubleshoot if this issue is related to the sharepoint library, could you help us confirm the following information?<br />
1. does the sign in dialog box appear when you try to save a document to the sharepoint library?<br />
2. does this issue occur when you try to use another browser?<br />
3. to access the online team site library from office, you can refer to the following steps:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1). open the office client, and select account;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2). add a service to the office 365 sharepoint;<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7e7fe95b-5f55-4cc6-964d-82c0e3bb46cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7e7fe95b-5f55-4cc6-964d-82c0e3bb46cd" /></a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3). saving the document to the sharepoint, please refer to the screenshot below:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b0e75c92-1d21-42a1-ba2f-43e14a8691e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db0e75c92-1d21-42a1-ba2f-43e14a8691e3" /></a><br />
<br />
4. if this issue still cannot be fixed, please go to <strong>file &gt; account &gt; sign out</strong> of all the accounts, and then sign into the account using the same as the one of the office 365 team site to see if there’s any improvement.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e11e6ac2-ea4a-4296-bc88-93f1c2fb1eff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de11e6ac2-ea4a-4296-bc88-93f1c2fb1eff" /></a><br />

<p>Hi Kerwin,</p>
<p>I am not sure where my reply gone :) anyways, I have fixed the issue thanks for the help and I have figured that a single version of skydrive for business was installed on the machine where it had office 2013 full package. so I removed the skydrive for business
 and repaired the office and it works now. </p>
<p>Thanks for the instruction and help. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Multiple Logins to same Windows 10 Profile</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have 3 students who at home login to the same Windows 10 computer profile.&nbsp; They then either login to the browser or Teams App on the computer with their own Office 365 login profile. When they try and access the files it says access denied or they cannot
 download their files they can see in the app or browser. As soon as they login to a incognito browser / in-private their can access the files and download. This points to a caching issue with credentials in the teams app and browser. This is point to a bug
 whereby the credentials are being cached on a single profile be it in the browser or app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>

    <title>Is there a way to set a tab order in Excel 2013&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fogharty1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to set a tab order in Excel 2013&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I was wondering if there was a way to set a tab order in an Excel worksheet, so cells that are rarely used can get skipped over. I know forms in Adobe Acrobat Pro allow you to&nbsp; set the order in which a user tabs through form fields, etc. but it would
 be great if the same thing could be done in Excel. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can give would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>One option is to protect the worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the cells the user should be able to edit. You can hold down Ctrl to select non-adjacent cells.</p>
<p>Press Ctrl+1 to activate the Format Cells dialog.</p>
<p>Activate the Protection tab.</p>
<p>Clear the check box labeled Locked. (By default, all cells in a worksheet are locked, but this only becomes effective when you protect the sheet).</p>
<p>Click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activate the Review tab of the ribbon.</p>
<p>Click Protect Sheet in the Changes group.</p>
<p>Use the check boxes to specify what the users will be allowed to do.</p>
<p>Make sure that you leave the check box "Select unlocked cells" ticked!</p>
<p>If you wish, specify a password that will be needed to unprotect the sheet. If you do, make sure you remember the password!</p>
<p>Click OK. If you specified a password, you'll be asked to enter it again as confirmation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing Tab will now cycle through the unlocked cells only.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMO it is not possible, the suggestion that Hans' has given will not allow to select the rarely used cells without unprotecting the sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no knowledge about Adobe forms but know that the same can be done in Excel VBA forms.

<p>
</p><p>Reading: I was wondering if there was a way to set a tab order in an Excel worksheet, so cells that are rarely used can get skipped over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My reading, but I can be completely wrong, let's say I am on cell A50, the next most visited cell is C75 and the second most visited cell is H20, it should jump from A50 to C75 to H20 but keeping track of each visit and increment a counter, and this even
 after closing and reopening the workbook. Maybe next time it should in another order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is simply no answer to this question. Did I select a cell, did I update a cell...</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t refresh Excel data from a Microsoft SQL 16 database using Mac OSX 10.11.6</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to refresh the data in a spreadsheet downloaded from a Microsoft SQL Database V16 using Excel 16 on a Mac OSX 10.11.6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The connection works when I am using the spreadsheet on a machine running Windows 10 and Excel 16 but can not make a connection with the Mac. All of the Database query and connection buttons are greyed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried connecting a new spreadsheet to the MS SQL db but I get the following connection error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[SqlServerODBC] (15) Failed to connect to the SQL Server instance: [HY001]: Problem in SSL_connect</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that Mac OSX 10.11.6 supports TLS1.2</p>
<p>
</p><p>My website developer isn't Mac savvy so I'm on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or suggestions would be welcome.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Catherine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check if this issue is related to Excel, please use Excel to connect another database (E.g. access )to see the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can use Excel to connect to your database, please create an new database table then use Excel to get data from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, please share with me more info as below:</p>
<p>1. The version number of your Excel(Excel&gt;About Microsoft Excel).</p>
<p>2. The detailed steps about how do you connect your SQL database.</p>
<p>3. Screenshot of the error message you encountered and your Database query and connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neo</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>You probably have to add the port number after the IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>123.456.789.9,12345</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the delimiter is comma, but it might be a semicolon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can edit by going to the Data tab of the Ribbon, and click the Connections button</p>
<p>In the Workbook Connections dialog select the connection and then choose Properties</p>
<p>In the Connection Properties dialog you can edit the query and add the port number. You can also add your password to the connection string there so you don't get prompted for the password every time you open the workbook, but maybe that isn't something
 that would work for you, security-wise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver is installed with Microsoft Office. You can't do anything to get it or install it. It's there already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other option when making a new database query allows you to use other brands of ODBC drivers to connect to most other kinds of data sources (although other brands also support SQL Server, too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a shame that Microsoft pays people to reply really fast. Them emphasis is on speed, not quality. Judging from Neo's response, he knows next to nothing about this, so he replied with something - anything - that looks like a reply so he gets credit for
 it.</p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time. Appreciate your kindness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have the port number apended to the IP with a comma but I’ll give the semi-colon a go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, all of the data menu options in the sheet are greyed out and the original connection string doesn’t appear in the connection or properties dialog to edit on the Mac.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to create a new connection from a new sheet, I get the dialog box about the missing MS ODBC drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same sheet downloaded to a Window 10 machine works fine. Can edit the connection/properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a tad frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ll try the semicol when I get home.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Resource Availability Report</h2>
                    I want to create my own resource availability report in Project 2016. I know there's a visual report but I'd like something that I can view and customise myself within MS Project. I think I need the Remaining Availability field in there somewhere. I would
 appreciate any guidance on this. As a PM it's important to see not just overallocations but also under utilisation for resources. Your advice is appreciated. Thanks.

<p>For starters, why isn't the basic Resource Usage view adequate? Remaining availability, along with several other resource based fields, can be displayed in the timescaled data.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have not answered a question for you in a long time.&nbsp; The answer to your question is that you can create an Excel visual report to show resource availability.&nbsp; Here is what you would need to do:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Create the new Visual Report template for Excel using the Resource Usage data.&nbsp; The fields you need for your report will already be in the template (Work Availability, Work, and Remaining Availability).</li><li>Add the Resources field to the ROWS drop area.</li><li>Add the Weekly Calendar field to the COLUMNS drop area.</li><li>Add the Work Availability, Work, and Remaining Availability fields to the VALUES drop area (in that exact order).</li><li>Expand your time dimension in the PivotTable to the level of detail you want to see.</li><li>Save the Excel workbook as an Excel template.</li></ol>
<p>Keep in mind that this report will only display the time span that matches the Duration of the project you have open, and the column headers will show items like Week 14 and not the actual dates.&nbsp; Those are limitations of using Excel Visual Reports for this
 purpose.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Using my own domain with Office 365 Personal</h2>
                    <p>I can't seem to find a definitive answer so thought I'd ask the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my own domain (I've had it for years). I use another company to host my mailbox and have MX Records pointing my mail to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now want to move to O365 but can't seem to find anywhere that confirms that I could do O365 Personal using my own domain and just change the MX records to point to MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone tell me whether this is possible with O365 Personal please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ashby.</p>

<p>Hello:</p>
<p>I'm having trouble with Internet explorer 8 since few days. Most of the internet and intranet pages that worked well earlier are not displayed correctly. Many pages appear blank. IE also prompts a message stating "A Problem displaying local host causing
 internet explorer to refresh..." The same *exact* page(s) worked very well until few days ago. I'm having this trouble in several local and internet web pages. I have tried resetting IE with no help. Compatibility mode does not help. Uninstalled IE 8.0 feature
 and re-installed with no luck. None of the support articles fix my problem. This is really frustrating. Please help.</p>

                    When I installed Excel 2007, I uninstalled Excel 2002 aka XP, but I don't like 2007, so I reinstalled 2002. Now whenever I open Excel 2002, I get a message: This copy of MS Office has not been activated.&nbsp; But when I go to Help&gt;Activate Product, the message
 is: This product has already been activated. How do I gte rid of the erroneous message? TIA.

<p>Lou</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hi Lou, I think that part of the problem is having only part of the 2002 not being installed. Multiple versions of Office do not coexist very well. It is not recommended but can be done. Here is what I would suggest.</p>
<p>Uninstall all Office entries. Install and activate all 2002 Office.</p>
<p>Install all 2007 Home and Student and activate.</p>
<p>Then uninstall whatever you don't want. The activations should work.</p>
<p>One more thought. The Office 2002 is a full rather than an upgrade I assume.</p>
<p>I have also included this link:</p>

<div>It gives general advice as to how to install multiple versions of Office on the same computer.</div>

            <p>First, create a recovery drive (Windows key + X &gt; Control Panel &gt; File History &gt; create recovery drive).</p>
<p>

<li>Which email provider is hosting your account?</li><li>Which Outlook version and build are you using to sign in to your account? You can check this

<p>The email provider is Google gmail</p>
<p>MS Office 365 Version 1706 Build 8229.2103</p>
<p>No changes made that point to this problem - could have been a MS update...ummm!</p>
<p>Been through the set up and all looks OK. I checked the setup with my laptop and the settings are the same but the laptop does show the up-to-date Sent data. If I have needed to refer to sent data I either use my laptop or go direct to gmail and use the
 sent file there. It is just annoying that I can't get it on my desktop.</p>
<p>Have been through the repair Office routine - lost Outlook completely! Reinstalled Office 365 - Outlook restored but still nothing in the Sent folder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We appreciate the information that you've provided. Our next step is to run Outlook in safe mode to determine if the concern is related to an add-in issue. To do this, follow the steps provided on this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. Once your Outlook is in safe mode and sent items are now present, you can disable the active add-in that's causing the issue. For more information on how to turn an add-in off for Outlook, you can check this

    <title>Deactivated Hotmail account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Deactivated Hotmail account</h2>
                    <p>I've just logged into my hotmail account for the first time in a while to find it was deactivated and all my emails have been purged. I am devastated by this. I have lost all the emails my mum ever sent me. She passed away not long after I switched email
 providers, so I have no other emails from her.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>This is the first time I have been able to face reading her emails since she passed and I am heartbroken that the emails aren't there any more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me. I am at a loss.</p>

            I can't believe Microsoft cannot help me. These emails are all the correspondence I have with my mother. I will never be able to speak to her again, these are my only link to her. I trusted Hotmail and Microsoft to store these for me, to keep them safe.
 And they deleted them without thinking that they could have some value beyond the amount of space they were taking up on some server. Ten years of emails. Gone.

<h2>            blank &#34;Message from webpage&#34; error dialog</h2>
                    Has anyone ever gotten the "Message from webpage" error dialog but the only thing displayed, other than the title, window X and OK button, is an exclamation point in a yellow triangle? I'm trying to figure out what might be causing this problem which appears
 to occur randomly. I'm looking for any guidance on things I should verify, like configuration settings or add-ons enabled/disabled. I've gone through various steps to resolve other IE errors by reviewing configuration and/or disabling add-ons, but this particular
 problem is a bit more elusive.<br />

            I have since found out that there may be an issue with how the version of IE was upgraded. In addition to the pop-up message mentioned, the folks reporting the problem were also getting IE crashes. These crashes occurred more often than the blank pop-up
 and posed a more serious problem. Upon investigation I found that the systems where the problem has been occurring appeared to be running older versions of IE related files such as icompat.dll, iedvtool.dll, iedw.exe, ieproxy.dll, xpshims.dll and mshtml.dll.
 Every time these errors came up, I had the individuals provide me with the appcompat.txt file that was generated for reporting to Microsoft. I then compared the files listed in that file with the files I have on a system where IE works without errors and found
 the differences.<br />
<br />
This leads me to a follow-up question: What is the best method for upgrade IE6 to IE8 on Windows XP systems?<br />

</p>
<p>My question is not because I can't live without it for a while, but because I want know why is this happening? It is some updating?&nbsp;Is there option that this app has some different update mechanism implemented? Different from classic Store update? How can
 this be possible?</p>

<h2>            Exchange Online Protection - Spam whitelisting and malware protection</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a question regarding the Exchange Online Protection. I have it deployed it as a standalone product, protecting an on-premise Exchange infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found one record on Technet stating that Anti-malware mechanisms cannot be disabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd just like to get a confirmation that adding a specific sender to the Spam filter white list, or a server IP address to a connection filter white list will not result in bypassing the anti-malware / anti-virus capabilities of EOP, so the emails will not
 be classified as spam, but will still be protected by the malware filtereing.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>BR,</p>
<p>Michal</p>

            OneNote doesn't have a feature to change the color of page tabs. They will always get it from the section. As a workaround for your problem you can add something like [Completed] in front of the page title so that you can easily see the ones that are completed.

<h2>            Online Picture Box</h2>
                    <p>Office Clipart has always been in a handy sidebar to the right. &nbsp;Why does it now have to take up the screen, blocking all my text. &nbsp;I can't even click away to look back at my document unless I close the images dialogue box. &nbsp;How can make it a sidebar again
 instead of a separate box?</p>

            But I can't make it any smaller, so it still blocks my work. &nbsp;Also (and more importantly), I can't keep the thing open and edit my work at the same time. &nbsp;I need to be able to multitask. &nbsp;It's almost to the point that I want to drag my old computer out
 with Office 2010, even though it occasionally shuts down randomly, to edit these powerpoints because having to RE-OPEN the stupid online picture box every time I move to a new slide is the DUMBEST WASTE OF TIME I've encountered so far. &nbsp;Office 2013 has been
 okay otherwise, but increasing my number of clicks is not making the product more functional and it's certainly not helping me to be more productive.

            <p>You'll notice that it's now called Online Pictures and not Office Clip Art. &nbsp;MS is moving away from providing clip art with Office; &nbsp;what you get now is a Bing search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that that's the case, you can use your browser to search Bing, Google or anyplace else for images. &nbsp;The only difference is that with the Online Picture feature it's slightly easier to determine what sort of licensing the picture carries. &nbsp;With other
 searches you'd have to deal with that on your own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you'd be able to move the browser anywhere you like, resize it, minimize it, whatever.</p>

            In the upper right corner of the Clip Art panel, click on the down-pointing arrowhead and choose
<strong>Size</strong>. You can make the panel any size you want, though if you make it tiny you'll have to scroll more to reach all the controls. This also works for all other similar panels in Office 2013.

            <p>I suspect that the confusion here may have to do with varying update levels, though none of my VMs give me anything but the Insert | Online Picture option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my copy of PPT 2013, I don't have an Insert Clip Art feature at all; it's become Online Pictures on the ribbon (though its internal name still refers to inserting clip art). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking the Online Pictures button on the ribbon produces the same result as Hannah's getting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But JohnW ... it will resize. &nbsp;Bigger. &nbsp;You can have it fill the whole screen with a white dialog box with the original contents neatly centered. &nbsp;The intern must have gone back to school.</p>

            Hi Brian,
<br />
<br />Try performing an Echo Test to make sure your Microphone is working in Skype
<br />
<br />Search for the Echo / Sound Test Service contact
<br />
<br />Call Echo and follow the instructions
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If it turns out your microphone is not working on Skype:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy - Microphone 
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your microphone' is turned on and make sure the appropriate app is also set to On
<br />
<br />
<br />Then in Settings, go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Recording Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Uninstall Skype 12:
<br />
<br />Press Windows Key+X
<br />Click Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />install the 8.30 version which Microsoft is replacing Skype 12 with on Windows 10: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/download/win/Skype-8.30.0.50.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/do...</a>
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Microphone
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Microphone
<br />
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />If you are using an external mic, make sure it is not unplugged or turned off.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
