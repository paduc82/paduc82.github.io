                    <p>Somehow, my Skype settings have been inadvertently changed so that, when I type message text, I am in an overwrite mode where new letters replace existing letters. How do I switch back to insert mode???</p>

            Hi, SandyM4188
<br />
<br />My name is Mays and I am an Independent Consultant. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem.

            Hi, PseudoNQ
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor.   I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the OneDrive sync app on each computer and make sure that you are sign into the same account in each app. 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows key + R on your keyboard. 
<br />
<br />Then copy and paste this text into the Run window that appears and press Enter:
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset
<br />
<br />That will reset OneDrive
<br />After a couple of minutes, the OneDrive cloud icon should show in the system tray.
<br />
<br />If it doesn’t start, open Start, find OneDrive and start it
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br /> 
<br />You can try the following procedures below:
<br /> 
<br />Log into OneDrive on your computer and run the following commands to update OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows key + R 
<br />
<br />In the Run window, enter: 
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset
<br />
<br />Wait 2 minutes and then execute the following command: 
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\update 
<br />
<br />Click OK. 
<br />
<br />Make sure the OneDrive icon in the notification area of the taskbar disappears and then re-appears after a minute or two. 
<br />
<br />If the OneDrive icon doesn’t re-appear after a few minutes, open the Run window again and enter: 
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't solve the problem please try to reinstall the last version for OneDrive in the link below

It started, and at once its paused.<br />
I need no sync at all for the moment, I use onedrive only for easy method<br />

Perhaps ite better to find a working program for that.</span></p>
<p>

<p>What about this example from automatic messages?</p>
<p>Its not at all a rare thing when using Windows.<br />
Always returning problems with passwords, no matter what one do.<br />
When I AM logged in to this windows-pc, why is that not enough for being logged in also to onedrive. with same account.<br />
<br />
(Login;&nbsp; You are already logged in, the account or password is wrong, try again)<br />

            Please, follow the procedures in the link below:
<br />
<br />1. Exit OneDrive (right click in the system tray)
<br />
<br />2. Go to Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt; Credential Manager
<br />
<br />3. Click on "Windows Credentials" (on the right)
<br />
<br />4. Choose the down arrow to the right of "OneDrive Cached Credential"
<br />
<br />5. Choose Edit, and enter your OneDrive (Microsoft Account) Username/Password.
<br />
<br />6. Go to the start menu, and launch "OneDrive" again
<br />
<br />This may restore your OneDrive without resetting your local copy.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, simply remove the "OneDrive Cached Credential" (there is an option to do so) and let OneDrive start over. The positive side is IF you wanted to move your OneDrive to another location, you'll have the opportunity to do so during the reset. Either way, you will NOT lose your online data.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.

<p><strong>But there its "stop". and as always, a big confusion.<br />
Finally I fount the panel anyhow and easy found the place to edit onedrive credentials - but username?&nbsp; I dont remember what i used, and I login to the struggle without any.<br />
Its always a big struggle with accounts and google and windows and mails and...<br />
why? (why didnt i set the same password to google as to gmail)<br />
Why am i not logged in to onedrive when logged in to windows??<br />
Ok, I found the username to, but cant remember the password.&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>Adding day after, yesterday I at least edited the "onedrive creditals" and filled in a password, but didnt know what that will change. I was also asked to activate a windows account, and i choosed one of two (I have a working account in a laptop
 with win pro) and set the same pincode as before.&nbsp;<br />
I was not clear over if i got logged in to any account without a password, or not, but i didnt care before. I choosed "empty" as a password half year ago, what i remember.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This morning I got extra struggle to get in to this "win 10 home" and had to log in tree times (marvelous) -first to Win 10, I didnt need before and its really no need for that in the place for this desktop.<br />
No unknown person goes in there, a small office for only me.<br />
I also keep no "security" stuff on this PC.&nbsp; (who many private persons do that? -besides of all unserious pictures and videos, that is so usual that it doesnt have to be hidden at all in most cases, and i dont even download such)<br />
Next the annoying remark-window for onedrive pops up, not easy to remove.<br />
Im asked (forced) to login there. Ok, I use the password in the credital process yesterday, and logged in. Annoying window gone. Now I can do some work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Well, I can see in the taskbar that onedrive is paused. (two vertikal lines) so the only wanted function, simple savings of schreendumps, is NOT working.<br />
(I want no other sync. If my mobiles and laptow and pc where synced together, my paid wireless broadband would be consumed too fast, and not even any need with it, i transfer manually all important material)<br />
I rightclick the icon in the taskbar.<br />
There i can login AGAIN (marvelous)&nbsp; and NOW -its working, (even more marvelous) if I happen to need it today.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I dont need or want to login at all. This process with 3 logins is rediculous and takes time whenever i start windows.<br />
Also before typing the first pinkode to get into windows (i dont want that either) i waited perhaps one minute, and that was not ok for windows, so it powered the pc down. Why?<br />
<br />
Im ofcourse ready to remove onedrive "app".<br />
It only means more work when taking a schreenshot and much more work if taking a series of them. (must open paint every time and save)</strong></p>

</p><p>I solved this continuous problem with disturbing pop-ups regarding onedrive in a dull but simple way. I uninstalled onedrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cause I want no sync at all Im now suffering a little when making a schreendump and&nbsp; more if I make a series of them. Onedrive , when working (always had to be unpaused and returning to paus next login) -was a superp help for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still my question is,&nbsp;<br />
why am I not logged in to onedrive when i log in to windows.</p>

                    Original Title: caps lock
<div><br />
</div>
<div>my capslock keeps getting on and off.this is frustrating while typing.so i googled and fixed it.i ran "killcapslock.reg" and it helped me turn off the capslock key.but when i tried to play "mass effect 2" game,a box appears informing me the hardware is
 not support and that i may experience reduced performance and instability.the game runs as usual but during gameplay the game stops working when i press esc key(which gives me the option to save the game).I tried turning on my caps lock again by running 'disablekeyboardmap.reg'
 and reinstalling the game but the same problem occurs.pls help...its my fav. game
<div>P.S. i referred the website how to geek.com to help solve my above mentioned issues</div>

<h2>            windows 10 frozen on welcome back screen</h2>
                    Since updated to windows 10, my pc is stuck on a blue screen that says Hi There, Welcome back! There is a NEXT icon on bottom right of screen but every time I hit it nothing happens. Have shut down pc and restarted several times but always goes to this
 blue screen. Talked to tech. He told me to download the ISO file and save to a USB from another pc. Did that but when I inserted the USB to my pc, nothing happened. I am very upset over this whole mess. I want my pc back!!! Can anyone help me please!

            <p>I finally took my desktop to my local computer repair shop.&nbsp; He hooked up my desktop and everything worked.&nbsp; he was able to finish the windows 10 download onto my computer.&nbsp; however, when i plugged it back in at home, i still could not get my wifi mouse
 to work.&nbsp; I took everything back to him--desktop, monitor, mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; He determined that my mouse/keyboard were not capable with the new windows 10.&nbsp; i had also taken another wifi mouse i had laying around.&nbsp; it was compatible, but the keyboard was
 not.&nbsp; i bought a used keyboard from him for $5 and when i got it all back home, everything worked and i've not been having any problems except for having to learn the new W10 format.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, hopefully this "easy" fix will work for some of you.&nbsp; BTW: my repair man told me that if I want to buy a new wifi keyboard, to just make sure it's compatible with W10.&nbsp; Good luck.&nbsp;

<h3> seniorart908  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fall Creators Update &#40;Version 1709&#41; and Indexing Options</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It appears as if the latest Creators Update (Version 1709) "breaks" Indexing Options for Offline Files, at least in Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; I've tested several of our systems, all of which included Offline Files in the Indexing Options under Version 1703,
 and, when they finished updating to Version 1709, Offline Files did not appear any longer.&nbsp; Moreover, using the "Modify" button in the Indexing Options window showed that where Offline Files used to be located as an option to be added to the Index List, the
 icon there apparently points to a non-existent file or registry entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has anyone else seen this?&nbsp; If so, any idea how to fix it?&nbsp; Or is it a new "feature."

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you Jomel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have posted that using the Feedback App (I think).&nbsp; (It wasn't that user-friendly - but that's a different issue.)&nbsp; On a slightly different not, is it possible to access the Feedback App via a "vanilla" web page?&nbsp; That would be really useful in some
 situations.</p>

<p>I am having the same issues here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After a clean install of 1709 the system refuses to properly index the start menu. So when installing other applications I can not just hit the windows key and start typing the name. This is an issue with ANY third party app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into the indexing settings and click on 'Start Menu' as a index location it says "csc://&lt;my user SID&gt;" and states that it does not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalled the OS like 10+ times in different ways and same outlook.</p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately,&nbsp;"Win-F" only works on a Win 10 machine.&nbsp; If I'm traveling, and just have an Android or other system, or am using a public library computer that's running Win 7, I'm totally out of the loop!&nbsp; Again, access to Feedback to stay up to date
 via a vanilla web page would be nice.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not aware of any fix for this yet!&nbsp; I suspect the problem is buried deeper in either the registry or the UAC settings for my skill set, so we, and our clients (we're a Microsoft Certified Refurbisher) are just living with it, including a few other
 Windows 10 "features!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe Microsoft will fix this in the next features update!</p>

<h2>            Please fix my account</h2>
                    <div>This is unacceptable! It is not an issue that I made. I am unable to logon to my microsoft account because of a system issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I log in your system reroutes my information multiple times to the point I get an error message about to many repeated authentication attemps.&nbsp; This is what is blocking my accout. I am helpless to solve it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been told the this is a known issue with other customers and that the accounts have been fixed. So obviously why is mine not fixed. I have waited over 48 hours updated my password cleared my cookies and cache as I was instructed to do from multiple
 service people and the issue still has not been resolved.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a bigger issue then me clearing my web browser. Something is wrong with a code, sever room switch or something in one of the many data facilities you own.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like tech manager to answer my issue and fix the problem. I find it very insulting that you would rather not fix my issue and just apologize and hope I go away with that email below. I pay for multiple products from your company and to use them
 I have to log in to my account.&nbsp; If I can't log in I can't use or receive the service I'm entitled to. So the email below is not helpful at all especially if you are suggesting I should pay additional money for software help when I can't even login to my account
 in the first place!</div>

<div>Very unhappy customer!</div>

<p>I am now talking to an escalated tech support group to resolve this issue. I had to contact the xbox support group by submitting a support call ticket. I explained everything that has happen over the past few days and was escalated right away. They are very
 perplexed as to what is causing this issue is and it now under investigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that if anyone else is experiencing this same issue to do the same and contact that group. The more people that report this the more data they will have and the faster this might get fixed.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 slideshow does not change photos as specified - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philip mak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 slideshow does not change photos as specified</h2>
                    <p><span>I set up to show photo slideshow in the background by right clicking on the Desktop and selected Personalize. It worked as specified when I selected a folder in which there were photos (e.g. 2015 photos). When I selected a master folder
 (e.g. All Photos) in which there were folders of photos (e.g. 2013, 2014, 2015 Photos) and not photo files, it took a long time to change a photo and was stuck with a couple of photos only. Anyone has similar experience and how to fix this?</span></p>

            <p>Hi! Kumar! Thanks for your advice!</p>
<p>I was able to follow every one of your instruction but the problem was still there. In the LOCK SCREEN screen, I noticed something peculiar. It showed "You need more than one picture to show in your slideshow". In this screen, I selected Slideshow for Background.
 I also selected my master photo folder in which there are many photo folders and not photo files immediately under the master photo folder. It seems that Windows 10 could handle a folder with photos but could not handle a folder with sub-folders containing
 photos. Please advise.</p>

            <p>Generally subfolders are not supported when selecting a specific folder.&nbsp; I believe that you can use the old interface to include subfolders if you select the Pictures library by running:</p>
<p>
</p><p>control /name Microsoft.Personalization /page pageWallpaper</p>
<p>
</p><p>from a WIN+R (Run) prompt, but subfolders inclusion is generally not strongly supported.</p>

            <p>After I typed in the command above, nothing showed up. When I did a search, it could not be found. I had been using this function of specifying a master folder with sub-folders of photos to display slideshows in previous versions of Windows with no problem.
 It looks that this is a deficiency or bug which had escaped Microsoft's testing. Hope that they will fix it in later updates!</p>

            Hi! Kumar! Thanks for your advise! I entered the command exactly as you indicated including the blanks at the proper places. I was able to get into the Choose your desktop background window under Control Panel &gt; All Control Panel Items &gt; Personalization
 &gt; Desktop Background. When I used the Browse key to select the master Photo folder, it showed "No items match your search". When I clicked the Save Changes anyway and checked back, the master Photo folder was not saved. A previously selected sub-folder appeared.
 When I selected any sub-folder under the master Photo folder, the photos in the sub-folder appeared correctly in the window and also correctly in the background. It seemed to show that Windows 10 looks for photo files in the specified folder and could not
 handle sub-folders only under the master folder.<br />

            <p>Hi! Jayant!</p>
<p>I just came back to my desktop computer after traveling, and tried out your advice. I created a new local user. The exact same problem still appeared that the slideshow did not work with the master folder but worked with sub-folders in which there were photo
 files.</p>
<p>BTW, the method shown in your link to create a new user did not work on my computer. I searched for another way in the web: at Run, type in control userpasswords2. This method worked and I created a new user successfully.</p>
<p>May I suggest that you create a photo file structure like mine to see if you may repeat the same problem on your computer?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Philip</p>

<p>I have the same problem as described by the original user, Philip, in 2015 [When I selected a master folder (e.g. All Photos) in which there were folders of photos (e.g. 2013, 2014, 2015 Photos) and not photo files, it took a long time to change a photo

<p>
</p><p>The upshot was that it seems Win10 photo slideshow background does not support a "directory of directories".&nbsp; Does anyone know if this has been corrected (although my patches should be current) or a workaround has been found?</p>

                    I tried installing Chinese IME using the Control Panel --&gt; Change Keyboards and other input options. However, after selecting the required IMEs and keyboard input methods, I am not able to see the language option toolbar at the Task bar. I'm using Windows
 7 <strong>Professional edition</strong>. I am able to install the IME in my desktop which uses Windows 7 Home Edition.

<p><span>Hi guguof,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try removing the Chinese language and then install it again and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try removing the Chinese language from&nbsp;<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>,restart
 the computer and re-add the Chinese language and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To remove Chinese language, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start and select Control Panel<strong><span> .</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>b. Click&nbsp;<strong><span>Clock, Language, and Region</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Region and Language</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Keyboards and Languages</span></strong> tab, and then click
<strong><span>Change keyboards</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Under&nbsp;<strong><span>Installed services,</span></strong>select Chinese (China) and
 click <strong><span>Remove</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click&nbsp;<strong><span>Apply</span></strong> and<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This would remove Chinese language. Restart the computer and add the Chinese language again and check if that works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the Language bar isn't listed in the Toolbars menu, you don't have multiple input languages installed on your computer. You need to add additional
 languages using Region and Language in Control Panel. For more information refer the link given to add the Input Language.</span></p>

<h2>            Help can&#39;t validate my account&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>hi guys. I have a huge problem,so I hope some of you can help me. I bought Section 8 Prejudice via Steam for Pc. When I was going to sign in in GFWL and submit my serial, I got an error message saying that I may be using an account from an unsupported country
 (I live in Chile, and IT IS supported). Then I tried to log in in GFWL Marketplace, but I got an error message code 80154017 sayiing that there's a problem with my account that I have to solve. It then redirects me to the xbox website, and it says that I have
 to update my account, and then gives me 2 options to update it: via PC or via Xbox 360. I tried via PC, but I got this message every time I try, no matters what I do: Oh,oh, that shouldn't have happened. seems like you found a glitch. And if I try via Xbox
 360, it says "Can't validate account".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, after all this, I created a new account (this one worked), but when I submited my serial, it says that it is being used by another account!</p>
<p>The thing is, that my game serial is trapped in an account that can not be updated, and therefore, not be used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to fix this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>You should go and change the game licence </p>

<p>Note: You can only do this one per year so if you decide now you have to wait 1 year.</p>

<h2>            &#39;Ghost Recon&#39; is &#38;quot&#59;better with Kinect sensor&#38;quot&#59; story....</h2>
                    
<p>Interesting comments from DigitalSpy - hardcore game plus Kinect shock as follows :-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Ubisoft today revealed the box art for <em>Ghost Recon: Future Soldier</em>, which confirms that the game will be compatible with Kinect.<br />
<br />
A purple logo at the top of the <em>Ghost Recon: Future Soldier</em> box art proclaims: "<strong>Better</strong> with Kinect sensor."
<br />
<br />
In January of last year, Ubisoft claimed that the new <em>Ghost Recon</em> would bring a completely new and fresh approach to the shooter genre.<br />
<br />
It is unknown how Kinect will be used in the game. No Xbox 360 game has yet used both a controller and Kinect simultaneously, though it is possible with the technology.
<br />
<br />

<p>Sounds good to me. I expect they'll use the kinect elements for hand gesture commands for your squad etc.

</span></p><div><span><strong>How To Find Drivers:</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong>Do not use device manager it may tell you the device is up to date but will not tell you if it is corrupt &nbsp;Instead</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Search</strong> Google for the name of the driver, or go to the computer makers site.</div>
<div><span><br />
<strong>Compare</strong> the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<strong>Visit</strong> the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />
<br />

    <title>500 Internal Server Error on Windows Media Player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lancegrabmiller  say:</h3>
<h2>            500 Internal Server Error on Windows Media Player</h2>
                    <p>Have been slowly ripping my music collection for many years now using Windows Media Player. All of the sudden, a few days ago, it stopped allowing me to find album info or add it (giving the 500 Internal Server Error warning), making me unable to rip anything.
 Gave it a couple of days to see if the problem was on Windows end, but it has been a week now and I'm still having the same problem. Help?</p>
