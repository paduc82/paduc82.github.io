<h2>            can&#39;t download apps or updates from marketplace</h2>
                    
<p>I have a samsung focus. Since Thursday, I've been unable to download updates to installed apps or download new apps. I can get into the marketplace and see the apps, but when i try to install i get a message that either says can't acces this now, try again
 in a little while or error code c101a24b. When I try to get the updates, it appears to be downloading (bar indicates progress to 100%). After the download is finished, it says attention required. tap here. The I get "can't get ithis info right now. Check back
 in a little while." Internet, email, texting all works fine. I uninstalled 2 apps thinking that it was an application problem, but it clearly isn't and now I can't reinstall those apps either.</p>

            <p>Microsoft doesn't support Marketplace&nbsp; in all countries. As a result you are unable to&nbsp;upload apps on your Windows7 phone. the trick is to get yourself an US live account (one with country = USA). and use that account on your W7P, which unfortunatly requires
 you to reset the phone. Request a new Zune account as well.</p>
<p>this did the trick for me, else you have to live with the annoying error message 'Try again a little later'.</p>

<h2>            All Office files corrupted &#40;no virus&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need help badly as ALL my office files are corrupted in the ENTIRE COMPUTER! Includes excel, ppt, docs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What happened was this situation has been around for months but usually after restarting a few times I'll be able to open the files. But now, totally cannot.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm using Win 8 Office 2010 all genuine versions, just bought them this year Feb. Initially I thought it was a virus but after scanning and refreshing the computer (win 8 function which deletes all apps but retain files), nothing worked out.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried the open and repair function and changing trusted settings from all kinds of forums, none worked.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The message shown for all the files are that the file is corrupted and cannot be restored. Tried using recovery softwares and all said beyond repair.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've actually frequently backed up my files in my external HD but apparently the copies inside are corrupted too since Apr. Only those before Apr were saved. Using other computers to open the files didn't work either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help as the files are important to me. Thanks.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Presumably you refer to data files. Were these created on this PC or have they been transferred/copied from another PC?</p>
<p>Are these Word or excel docs?</p>
<p>Are they located in the default data locations?</p>
<p>Presumably you can start Word, create and save a new doc, then are you not able to open that doc from within Word (File&gt;Open)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you know you are virus/malware free, what tools have you used to scan?</p>

            Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, I refer to all data files by Office. Some were created in this PC, some were not, but all were corrupted. They include excel, word and ppt files. Regardless of locations, all are corrupted.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've tried starting excel. save a new doc, and that can be opened.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, &nbsp;a file i created 1 week ago on the same PC cannot be opened now.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know there isn't a virus as my brother did a scan for me and he's into IT also. He couldn't figure out why are all the files corrupted. Therefore I'm seeking help here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>

            Can you post a couple of examples on skydrive so we can look at them?<br />
<br />
These new files you create, do they eventually become corrupt too?&nbsp; You seem to have a fixed time span, April to a week ago, is that right?<br />
<br />
There is a type of malware attack that encrypts all of your files. But then they send you a blackmail notice, pay up or never see your files again.&nbsp; I don't know if that applies to your situation.<br />

            Oops, sorry, my paranoia kicked in. I just realized I don't want to take the chance of downloading your files, in case they are infected with something. I don't have a machine I can risk infecting.
<br />
<br />
I have no idea of how to identify the "ransomware", I have just read about it. <br />
<br />
If you have paid for an antimalware program I'd suggest contacting them directly for help to see if they can identify the malware or help you confirm there is no malware.
<br />
<br />
All new data file files become "corrupt" over time, but the OS and apps don't. That sure sounds like some sort of targeted attack. The other option I considered was a bad HD, but expect that would affect all files, OS, Apps and Data alike.<br />
<br />
Right now, in paranoid mode, I suggest you make an image copy backup to DVDs, in the hope you may some day be able to recover your data files, (not to an external drive to avoid the chance of infecting it too), then re-install Windows from a DVD, not your recovery
 partition (which, being in paranoid mode, I assume has also been infected) or your old known good backups, and start from scratch with a known clean installation.
<br />
<br />
since you apparently did become infected, I would also consider changing the malware program you are using.<br />
<br />
Please confirm the following safe computing "best practices":<br />
<ol>
<li>you have 1 anti malware program running (even if it is "just" Windows Defender)</li><li>you have a firewall program running, ie Windows Firewall</li><li>you have "User Account Control" turned on</li><li>you are using a "user" class Windows ID, not an Admin ID</li><li>you have all Windows Updates applied up-to-date (you may want to avoid Office 2010 SP2 for the moment, a few people have been having problems with it)<br />
</li><li>you have a router (not just a modem) between your computer and the internet</li></ol>
<p>You can find out about #1,2,3 in the Control Panel &gt; Action Center.</p>
<p>You can tell about #4 in Control Panel &gt; User Accounts (it should say "local Account").</p>
<p><br />

            Thanks for the advice, since you mentioned about the possibility of malware attack, I've alr did a full malware scan with Microsoft malware software. No files were found infected. Anyway, I understand not going through the risk of infecting your files
 too. Thanks so much for your kind advices and help. Looks like only praying to God now will help. Haha! :)&nbsp;

            No one anti-malware program can find everything. It wouldn't hurt to try some of the other freeware alternatives, one at a time, like malwarebytes that Palcouk suggested.<br />

Sorry, praying won't help, it is analog and computers are digital ... &lt;grin&gt; <br />
<br />
As I suggested before, the "final solution" is re-installing Windows. That is my preferred method of fixing malware infections.&nbsp; It takes longer, but is surest method.<br />

            YES, Reinstalling Windows will wipe all data files. Reinstalling Office will NOT affect your data files.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is why I suggest you do a full image copy backup before re-installing Windows.&nbsp; You can also do a simple copy of your data files, but the image copy is a good idea just in case you miss something important.<br />
<br />
If you don't already have one, this is a good time to get an external USB drive to backup to. Large drives 1TB in size start around $79 and to up to $200 for 4TB.&nbsp; That is room for several backups.&nbsp; Backing-up to a USB drive is MUCH faster than doing it to
 DVDs. And having the backup on an external drive means the WHEN (not IF) your HD dies, you will still have all of your files on an external drive that is unaffected.<br />

<p>
&nbsp;Try this procedure...
</p><p>Open a webpage. Stretch it out to fullsize. Don't use maximize.<br />
Choose any link on that webpage and right-click&gt; open in a new window.<br />
Stretch that second window out to the desired size- don't use maximize.<br />
Close the first IE window. Then close that second resized window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should do this for every Internet Shortcut (Start, Desktop, Taskbar, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you ever close a window that's not full-sized, you will probably have to repeat the procedure.</p>

<h3> gabrielsmom  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Search for Unstructured Text in An Access 2007 Database&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings!&nbsp; I'm using Access 2007.&nbsp; I have a very simple movie database and know little to nothing about VBA programming.&nbsp; There are only two tables:&nbsp; MovieInfo (which contains the movie title, media, description, etc.) and Category (which is a sub-table
 of the Category field in the MovieInfo table, and lists the various categories (Adventure, SciFi, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p>At my main form I want to include a 'Search Titles' button that when clicked, presents the person with an input box.&nbsp; The person would enter any known words contained in the movie title.&nbsp; They would be presented with the results of their search (don't care
 about sorting at the moment).&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if the person entered 'Thomas Engine' the query would return all records from the Title column in the MovieInfo table which includes those two words - a movie called 'Thomas the Tank Engine - Track Stars' would be returned even though there
 were words between the two words the person entered (Thomas Engine).</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this and I look forward to hearing from someone!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Cheers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Karl and thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>The main form itself doesn't do anything but appear onscreen.&nbsp; There are five buttons contained on the form:</p>
<p>"Enter Movie Data" which brings up a form into which the particulars for a record is entered.&nbsp; I created this to avoid accidentally altering a table when adding a movie to the database.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of the buttons relate to the duration of the movie.&nbsp; For example, the one called '1 hour or less' runs a query which returns all movies that are 60 minutes or less (based on criteria entered in the query: &gt;0 And &lt;61). This information is taken from
 the 'Length' column which is the number of minutes of the movie.&nbsp; The results are then ported to a report to make it easier to read.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The button I'm hoping to add will be 'Search' which would work as described in the first post.&nbsp; I don't have any of the components of the Search button completed yet (query, form, etc.).&nbsp; I don't know how to structure a query that allows one to search for
 text in an inexact manner.</p>
<p>I hope this makes sense.&nbsp; Please let me know what further information I need to provide.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>SELECT MovieInfo.[Length (Minutes)], MovieInfo.[Length (Minutes)], MovieInfo.Title, MovieInfo.Media<br />
FROM MovieInfo<br />
WHERE (((MovieInfo.[Length (Minutes)])&gt;0 And (MovieInfo.[Length (Minutes)])&lt;61));</p>

No.&nbsp; Where do you expect to see the movie information displayed after pushing the buttons?<br />

<p>I would like the search button to operate similarly - the trick here (for me) is to be able to enter search criteria as described in my first post.</p>

<p>This can be a little bit tricky: if the user typed a search term such as "Thomas the Tank Engine" you certainly would not want all movies containing the word "the"!</p>
<p>You'll actually need some VBA code to "parse out" the single text string "Thomas Engine" into its components, and construct a Query containing the criteria. Here's some *untested air code* that might do so:</p>
<p>Private Sub cmdSearchKeyword_Click()<br />
Dim strKeywd() As Variant ' define an array to hold terms<br />
Dim strSQL As String ' define a string variable for query<br />
Dim iPos as Integer ' define a number as an array index<br />
strKeywd() = Split(Me!txtSearchTitle, " ") ' split string on blanks<br />
strSQL = "" <br />
For iPos = 0 to UBound(strKeywd) ' loop through array<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = strSQL &amp; "[Title] LIKE '*" &amp; strKeywd(i) &amp; "*' AND "<br />
Next iPos<br />
strSQL = Left(strSQL, Len(strSQL) - 4) ' trim off final AND<br />
DoCmd.OpenReport "yourreportname", WhereCondition:=strSQL&nbsp; ' open report<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>This will build a query criterion such as</p>
<p>[Title] LIKE '*Thomas*' AND [Title] LIKE '*Engine*'</p>
<p>and then open the report with this as a search criterion.</p>
<p>Note that this code has <strong>no</strong> error trapping, provision for noise words such as "and" or "a", tolerance for spelling errors, etc. but I hope it will get you started.</p>

<p>Hello and good morning, John:</p>
<p>I created a query and in SQL view, cut and pasted the code you shared above.&nbsp; The only text I replaced was "yourreportname" with the actual name of my report.&nbsp; My code looks like this:</p>
<p>Private Sub cmdSearchKeyword_Click()<br />
Dim strKeywd() As Variant ' define an array to hold terms<br />
Dim strSQL As String ' define a string variable for query<br />
Dim iPos as Integer ' define a number as an array index<br />
strKeywd() = Split(Me!txtSearchTitle, " ") ' split string on blanks<br />
strSQL = "" <br />
For iPos = 0 to UBound(strKeywd) ' loop through array<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = strSQL &amp; "[Title] LIKE '*" &amp; strKeywd(i) &amp; "*' AND "<br />
Next iPos<br />
strSQL = Left(strSQL, Len(strSQL) - 4) ' trim off final AND<br />
DoCmd.OpenReport "rptTitleSearch", WhereCondition:=strSQL&nbsp; ' open report<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>When I try to run the query it stops at the first line with this error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Invalid SQL statement; expected 'DELETE', 'INSERT', 'SELECT', 'PROCEDURE' or 'UPDATE'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Contacts from the past are gone</h2>
                    I logged into skype after about 2 years and all my contacts are gone. When I signed in, for some reason it asked me for my birthday, and i accidentally entered the wrong birth year. Could this be the reason why my contacts are gone? Keeping in mind, skype
 is showing conversations from other people i know but my old conversations that i remember are gone and my old contacts are gone but it is showing contacts from my phone. Can I do anything to fix this?

    <title>Horizontal scroll by mousewheel not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thanatica  say:</h3>
<h2>            Horizontal scroll by mousewheel not working</h2>
                    <p>I have a Logitech M500 mouse. This mouse has a mechanical mousewheel (the "ticking" kind), which can also be clicked from the sides to horizontally scroll. The great thing as that this works almost everywhere... In my browser, in Notepad++, basically almost
 everywhere as far as the programs go that I use. Except for Excel 2013. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Possibly related, it also doesn't work in regular ol' Explorer file browser windows. Not a bother, because I use Total Commander. But the horizontal scroll thing does work in Internet Explorer 10, which seems odd to me (same company behind Explorer and Internet
 Explorer, after all).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I got the mouse, I did not install any drivers myself. I just connected the mouse and let Windows looks for and install proper drivers completely automatically. And since it works perfectly in the browser and my code editor, I figured the horizontal
 scroll function was working properly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there perhaps some kind of thing that I need to do to make Excel recognize a horizontal scoll from the scrollwheel, or have I perhaps stumbled upon a bug?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>btw, this is my mouse:</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the drivers were automatically installed by Windows, it may not be the exact driver for the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a disc for the driver provided along with the device, If so you may update the driver and then check if this issue occurs.</p>
<p>You may have to contact your computer manufacturer to update the drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you say that this issue occurs with Excel application and Windows Explorer, are you able to use the horizontal scroll on other Office applications like Word, PowerPoint?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results and details for further assistance.</p>
        </p>

            <p>In "Devices &amp; Printers" the mouse shows up with the correct name and even picture. This leads me to believe the correct drivers are in fact installed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The horizontal scroll by mousewheel does in fact work perfectly fine in Word, which further leads me to believe that this problem is in Excel, not in the driver.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried a few others as well:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Word: works</p>
<p>Excel: doesn't work</p>
<p>PowerPoint: doesn't work</p>
<p>Outlook: works</p>
<p>Visio: works</p>
<p>Visual Studio 2012: works (not in all panes, tho)</p>
<p>Explorer: doesn't work</p>
<p>Internet Explorer: works</p>
<p>Firefox: works</p>
<p>Photoshop CS5: doesn't work</p>
<p>Command prompt: works (genuinely surprised :P)</p>
<p>Notepad: works</p>
<p>Paint: doesn't work</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The fact that it works in so many applications and doesn't work in some other, indicates that it is something that has to be implemented by a developer of that application, and it isn't something that "magically" works like vertical scrolling usually does.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For now, as far as Office 2013 is concerned, this problem exists only in Excel and PowerPoint (although getting PowerPoint to show a horizontal scrollbar is a challenge in itself). If this problem can be fixed in the Explorer as well, that would be awesome.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this issue occurs not only with Office applications but also with Windows Explorer and other applications as well. Hence the issue is not related to the installed application.</p>
<p>You may check if there is an updated driver for the device by contacting the manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Since the horizontal scroll works fine in other Office applications, and in even more other applications, one could also argue that whatever it is that makes it work in those applications, has not been implemented in the others. Hence the issues *is* related
 to Office after all.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I shouldn't need to remind you that just because it doesn't work in Explorer, means that it doesn't work anywhere. I'm saying is neither Microsoft nor Windows is perfect. The implementation could be missing in Explorer just as well as in Excel, do you realize
 that?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Obviously it's not a driver issue. Please don't brush this issue off like that (although I'm sure your intention is to help). Since the horizontal scroll works fine in some application, it can't possibly be a driver issue. If it where, it wouldn't work anywhere,
 which isn't the case.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also shouldn't need to repeat that this <strong>does work in Internet Explorer</strong>. I guess I should :)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So please Microsoft, again, can you fix this bug?</p>

            I've been using computers since 1968 and I am absolutely sure that the horizontal scrolling issue is a bug in Microsoft PowerPoint 2013 (at least the Office 365 version).<br />
<br />
I have tried everything I know to determine the root cause and nothing will fix this short of Microsoft going into the code and patching this bug.<br />
<br />
The horizontal scrolling feature that utilizes the tilting of the scroll wheel works for EVERYTHING else in Office EXCEPT PowerPoint (at least on my computer and others that I have around the house).<br />
<br />
I can't get the tilt-wheel to do horizontal scrolling in PowerPoint and I'm using all the latest drivers and it is a Microsoft mouse.<br />
<br />
I would estimate that this is costing me about 15 minutes of extra work a day because I have to always zoom out, use the slider to scroll and then zoom in.&nbsp; What a pain!<br />
<br />
Please fix this soon.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            I have a Microsoft wireless Laser Mouse 7000, and the horizontal scroll wheel doesn't work for in Excel 2013. This is a real pain in that I work with very large spreadsheets constantly and this has been a real unexpected consequence of my recent upgrade
 from Office 2010 to the Office 365 Pro subscription. I am going to stick with 2010 for the rest of our office until this is fixed.

            <p>Has anyone found a way to scroll horizontally in PowerPoint, Microsoft Office 2013, Office 365 Pro subscription?</p>
<p>Is there any way to do it short of putting in new or editing libraries?</p>
<p>I can scroll horizontally in Word and Excel 2013 but there is not way to scroll horizontally using the mouse in PowerPoint 2013.</p>
<p>PowerPoint 2010 work great for horizontal scrolling.</p>
<p>Did they just leave this feature out of PowerPoint?</p>
<p>Will they ever put it back in?</p>

<p>
</p><p>To <strong>update the formula so as to get rid of 00-jan-1900</strong> in subsequent cells wherein column A has blanks - refer below image:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3f2499f-1b3d-404d-a81b-ec7212ae8203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3f2499f-1b3d-404d-a81b-ec7212ae8203" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter below formula in cell E2 and copy down:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(A2="","",A2+MAX(INDEX(($G$2:$G$5)*(NOT(ISNA(MATCH($F$2:$F$5,B2:D2,0)))),,)))</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The formula will return blanks in cell E4 &amp; E5 because A4 &amp; A5 are blank. You may have any date format in column A &amp; column E (current format is: d-mmm-yy).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may add further values at any time in column F &amp; G for matches by just updating the range $G$2:$G$5 (if you want to add 2 more values in column G, just update this range to $G$2:$G$7) and the formula will remain as short as at present.</p>

                    <p>My Windows Phone 8.1 has a problem, it reboots quite frequently, and battery JUMPS when rebooting.... The screen freezes, goes black and restarts, and when doing so for example once I had battery on 74% and it jumped to 29%!!! I used the Stop Restart App
 by Windows, but it says my phone is ok but I still should install updates offered to me when I don't have any! Sometimes it doesn't even stay on for 2 minutes, what do I do?</p>
<p>P.S. Battery and screen overheat like mad when rebooting and it HURTS SO BAD ������������������</p>

<h2>            Shared folder&#47;notebook not showing on iPad but visible in Skydrive</h2>
                    My boss has a Notebook he shared via OneNote. &nbsp;I can see/use it via PC version of OneNote. &nbsp;I can see it and use it via Skydrive via browser on the PC. &nbsp;However, it does not show on iPad OneNote 1.3. &nbsp;I can also see it via Safari on the iPad, but I cannot
 view contents or select it via Safari - just view the icon and name in Safari. &nbsp;We have tried every configuration detailed in other threads - putting the Folder at the same level as root folders like Documents, sharing at both the Folder and Notebook level,
 etc., but no joy. &nbsp;What are we missing?

            I did review that link. &nbsp;The thread refers people to the FAQs wherein the FAQs supposedly state that notebooks sjhared by others are not visible on the iphone. &nbsp;This is exactly opposite of what the FAQ says for OneNote for the iPad - FAQ #3 states that
 notebooks can be shared and viewed on the iPad.

            There does not appear to be any way to add a folder or notebook on the iPad using either Safari or OneNote on the iPad. &nbsp;The only action appears to be adding a new note or modifying one in the Personal Folder/Notebook.

<h3> michaelle  bas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2007 &#34;Not Implemented&#34; message</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba laptop which runs on Windows 8.1. On this pc I use the Office 2007 suite including Outlook 2007. I also have Bitdefender Total Security 2017. I have never had a problem until I bought and installed Office 365 which provides the 2016 Office
 suite. I have continued to use Outlook 2007 as I haven't had time to export my calendar data and my contacts. Now I am getting a "Not Implemented" message anytime I click on any of the functions ie. Send/Receive, File (to export contacts and data), etc. Is
 there somewhere I can go to get simple language help ie. 1 do this, 2 do that. 3 click on this? Fortunately my email account is still functioning on my iphone so I still can get notifications that way. Thanks for any help. Michael

            Thank you! Your solution answered my question. My old files, calendar, contacts have moved from Outlook 2007 to Outlook 2016. May I asked another question? I am planning to buy another laptop (this one weighs a ton). If I transfer my Office 365 suite to
 that pc, will the information be automatically transferred or will I have to do something special?

<h2>            Enable Ink Mode for Office Communicator</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using Windows 7 , just a normal Desktop PC, it is not a tablet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have some users who have Ink Mode enabled on OCS as screenshot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e762399-eca5-450e-8b0c-14422762c513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e762399-eca5-450e-8b0c-14422762c513" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly after restart the machine, the Ink Mode disappeared though we have already tried to re-enabled as we did before by changing the registry value</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\Tablet PC</p>
<p>Key: IsTabletPC</p>
<p>Type: REG_DWORD</p>
<p>Value: FFC1 in hex mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>But seem to be not affected anymore. We have multiple users, but not all facing same issue, some user still remain the feature even reboot daily.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Band 2 freezes during software update - solution&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My microsoft band (±2 months old) asked for a software update this morning. I've did the update, but at the end, it said on my android phone that the update had failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my band is somehow 'stuck' in a semi update and is showing nonsense on the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've did the 2 button reset yet a few times. Then I can choose a language, but then it stays in a certain start up loop. After choosing language, the next screen is in another language and ask if I want to proceed with iPhone. The options to choose are 90min
 and android (90 min as a choice makes no sense...). Either what I choose, after 3 menu's that make no sense, I'm back at the screen to choose a language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Good morning, Eddie!
<br />
<br />We can check the Wiki page here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explor...</a>
<br />
<br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />And I just checked my 1803 box with the latest updates, and checked the version of IE, I put it below:
<br />
<br />11.228.17134
<br />
<br />Similar to Edge, when you run updates on your PC, IE will automatically update. If you’re running an insider build, it’s possible there is a newer version. 
<br />
<br />Check out this link - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028118/windows-run-the-latest-version-of-internet-explorer-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402811...</a> - to make sure you are running the latest version. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />- C

<p>Morning Charlie!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate the quick reply. I checked the Wiki, unfortunately the release date were back in 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far the latest range that I have come across are 11.0.9600.19002 &amp; 19003, not sure if this is latest as per Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The build you have seems different, I wonder why.</p>

            OK, so it looks like you are quite a bit behind my version.  That suggests you are quite behind on Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Give us your Windows Version and Build numbers:
<br />PLEASE PROVIDE FULL Windows and/or Office Edition, Version AND Build Numbers
<br />
<br />Also go in to Update History and look for failed updates.  Report the error codes associated with any failed updates. 
<br />

<br />Although MS does not tell you, when you are asking for help, we really do need to know specific the Windows (or Office) Edition, Version AND Build numbers you are running. 
<br />.
<br />Contrary to MS's wishful thinking, we are all NOT running the "most recent" version (actually Version AND BUILD!) .  Individual recurring, (obviously unfixed) Windows update errors cause people to be running older versions and builds. We commonly see people running versions of Windows that have fallen out of support because they are 18 months old due to unfixed update errors during that span of time. 
<br />.
<br />The simplest way is to RUN the WinVer command  (option 4 or 5 in the following tip)
<br /><a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-determine-what-version-windows-7-you-have" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-determine-w...</a> 
<br />.
<br />Or you can run the following script to copy and paste the full information:
<br />.
<br />Report Windows Edition, Version and Build number
<br />This “copy and Paste” process will get the full Window Build and Version number information we need:
<br />.
<br />.  *  In start menu, search for POWERSHELL
<br />.  *  Click on it to open a PowerShell window
<br />.  *  Copy the following lines, between the lines of ***, not including them
<br />.
<br />********************
<br />.
<br />$name=(Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem).caption
<br />$bit=(Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem).OSArchitecture
<br />
<br />$vert = " Version:"
<br />$ver=(Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion").ReleaseId
<br />
<br />$buildt = " Build:"
<br />$build= (Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion").BuildLabEx -match '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' |  % { $matches.Values }
<br />
<br />$installd = Get-ComputerInfo -Property WindowsInstallDateFromRegistry
<br />
<br />Write-Host $name, $bit, $vert, $ver, $buildt, $build, $installd
<br />
<br /> ********************
<br />Note: the install Date will take a minute to capture the required info
<br />
<br />.  *  Paste them in the PowerShell Window
<br />.  *  Then hit enter.  
<br />.  *  It will return something like this:
<br />
<br />Microsoft Windows 10 Home 64-bit  Version: 1709  Build: 16299.431 @{WindowsInstallDateFromRegistry=18-01-01 2:29:11 AM}
<br />
<br />.  *  Copy that and paste it into your reply

            I can't find a Win 7 version number listing. But I did find this list of update KB numbers.  Look in your Update History to find the most recent KB number and see if you can find it in this list to get an idea of how current you are:

    <title>Office 2010&#47;Lync 2013 Bootstrapper Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamiepassa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010&#47;Lync 2013 Bootstrapper Error</h2>
                    <p>Multiple machines, either new from factory or existing workstations, get this error when installing Lync 2013 on top of Office 2010 Standard. I get "Microsoft Setup Bootstrapper has stopped working"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only fix i have found out that works is to completely uninstall Office 2010 and install Lync 2013 first. WHY??!! Something is not right that this is happening and its clear that it happens to a lot of people but of course Microsoft doesn't have an answer.
 It would be fix for a real fix instead of manually uninstalling a piece of software to install another one.&nbsp;</p>

<div>You are certainly not and this question has been posted many times on the forum already.</div>
<div>The easiest is to configure an account on an Exchange server and use the same account on the PC to get all the data.</div>
<div>Otherwise, there are a few utilities out there that can help you get the data from a .olm archive to a PST (but I haven't tested any myself)</div>
