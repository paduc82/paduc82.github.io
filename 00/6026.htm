    <title>Most emailed contacts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Most emailed contacts</h2>
                    Our organization recently changed names.&nbsp; Our director would like to email her most-used contacts (i.e. those she has emailed with in the past year) to inform them of the change.&nbsp; Is there any way to sort the Contacts list to find out who these contacts
 may be?&nbsp; She has thousands of contacts, so going through them individually would be very time consuming.&nbsp; I've done some research and tried looking in the registry but couldn't find anything that would help.<br />
<br />
Thank you!&nbsp; I appreciate your help.<br />

            <p>There is nothing that will give you contact ranking by # of emails sent (leastwise not that I'm aware of).</p>
<p>One way&nbsp;that would get you the desired results that is to export the "To" (and CC/BCC if applicable) email addresses from the "sent items" and summzarize those accordingly. Something that should be able to be&nbsp;done fairly quickly using MS Access queries against
 the exported data.</p>

    <title>Change Internet Explorer Security setting in Registry to allow active - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Change Internet Explorer Security setting in Registry to allow active scripting</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to find the registry key where I can change Internet Explorer v9 custom security setting to allow active scripting so that I can then export the reg file and email it to a couple of people who are using the exact same machine as I am, as active
 scripting is disabled on their computer and so they cannot access certain websites . How can this be done? Or can a abtch script be written for this? Many thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You should zip the files first before adding them as attachments to an email.</p>
<p>Client email programs open eml (email files) either in plain text or Rich text format (depending apon the users client email settings) and do not run scripts.</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>post your files to your Skydive public&nbsp;folders and send the link to your friends in their email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<br />
By "Autosum", I presume you mean the icon on the Home tab of the ribbon, shown circled in red below.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fpublic.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pPW0dMhqLIOHSVvWp9l6VPOcbBtslnNEWaLRARvFBx6GfEYKA_PUpMIFtUC-MlzUT4MQ3bDflLev69Ea5GMvgCA%2fxl2007%2520autosum.jpg%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<br />
What you describe is the way that feature has always worked.&nbsp; I consider it a misnomer.&nbsp; It is a shortcut for creating a SUM formula as well as some other functions selected by clicking the down-arrow, as you learned.&nbsp; I never use it.&nbsp; And it is not the feature
 that you want, apparently.<br />
<br />
Instead, to get a sum of the selected cells, look at the lower right of the status bar below the worksheet data.&nbsp; It should look something like this (again, I have circled the interesting part in red):<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fpublic.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pGt5kGQpm_WgGp9b-U8pipe7zIKyCfpaiOH3I6-d5FiRdM3Nfhw_HvXxfAgCSkKAz-DMWORHR-sbI0vX_jxre-w%2fxl2007%2520statusbar%2520sum.jpg%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<br />
If you do not see at least that information on the status bar, it might be because the sum information has been disabled.&nbsp; Place the cursor over an empty space on the status bar, right-click and select the summary information that you want.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fpublic.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1prp918HGqQZIyLnSfwc3GRIhl446BwqXGp21ELhkOKpOJDuNWOMnwJubS8N5ayLYY2HfEV30SX5ehpp8ZzRQQJg%2fxl2007%2520statusbar%2520menu.jpg%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />

2) What exactly are you referring to&nbsp;when you say&nbsp;"<strong>Getting booted offline</strong>"?<br />
3) If this issue is confined to any particular website, have you logged on to any website such as “msn.com” while browsing for websites or mails? If yes, which is the particular website that you have logged-in?</div>
<div>4) Is this issue specific while browsing online using Internet Explorer?</div>

            <p>I also am having to sign in several times a day sometimes several times an hour at many sites.&nbsp; Places like my att account where I always click the option to stay signed in for 2 weeks and yet it signs me out. Facebook also signs me out about 10 times a
 day which is new. I had a message when this all began that my computer was at risk and did not have internet security. My Norton product said all was up and running fine. I clicked the Microsoft message to 'turn on Norton firewall protection' and also to turn
 on the internet protection from Norton even though the Norton showed all just fine. The problem began then I believe. Windows shows my windows security to be off and Norton to be on. I really have to get this fixed!
</p>
<p>Oh and yes, this is using internet explorer and I do not use MSN for email. It is my aol account, and many websites. As soon as I sign in all is well, but it signs me off so often it is frustrating and a total waste of time!</p>

<br />
1) Where exactly are you being asked to sign-in again? Is it on the computer or the mail browser or the website on Internet Explorer? IT IS ON INDIVIDUAL WEBSITES LIKE AMAZON ETC THROUGH&nbsp;INTERNET EXPLORER.<br />
2) What exactly are you referring to&nbsp;when you say&nbsp;"<strong>Getting booted offline</strong>"? I AM BEING LOGGED OUT OF ACCOUNTS AT SITES ONLINE DURING A VISIT AND BETWEEN VISITS AND ON EMAIL ACCOUNTS ALSO BEING LOGGED OUT EVEN WHEN MARKED TO STAY LOGGED IN FOR
 2 WEEKS AT&nbsp;SIGN IN.&nbsp;THIS DID NOT HAPPEN PREVIOUSLY AND IS STILL GOING ON. <br />
3) If this issue is confined to any particular website, have you logged on to any website such as “msn.com” while browsing for websites or mails? If yes, which is the particular website that you have logged-in? IT IS MY AOL , BELLSOUTH, AMAZON ETC.. MAINLINE
 WEBSITES THAT ALLOW YOU TO STAY LOGGED IN FOR AWHILE NORMALLY.
<div>4) Is this issue specific while browsing online using Internet Explorer? I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS JUST WITH INTERNET EXPLORER, BUT IE IS WHAT I USE TO BROWSE AND PREFER TO USE. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN UNTIL MY MICROSOFT SOFTWARE ON THE COMPUTER TOLD ME I DID
 NOT HAVE INTERNET PROTECTION (WHICH I DID, AND IT SHOWED MY NORTON BEING FULLLY UP TO DATE AND FUNCTIONAL) AND IT SAID I DID NOT HAVE A FIREWALL IN PLACE ETC AND SO I CLICKED THROUGH THE MICROSOFT NOTICE FROM THE TRAY TO FIX AND RESOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS. UNFORTUNATELY
 WHATEVER CHANGES IT MADE TO MY COMPUTER HAS TO BE THE PROBLEM, I ASSUME IT IS A FIREWALL ISSUE, BUT WHEN I GO TO CHECK FIREWALL THROUGH THE MICROSOFT SOFTWARE IT ONLY WILL SAY TO WORK THROUGH THE NORTON SOFTWARE AND THAT DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ON
 IT AS FAR AS I KNOW. </div>

                    <p>I am having no luck at all getting OneDrive to sync with my online data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Office 365 account (Business Premium), Windows 10 Pro. I do not sync my computer user account with my Microsoft online account.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Onedrive icon (systray) states no libraries are currently connected.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Files exist in OneDrive online and I can use it fine via the web portal along with all the other Office 365 features. One Note sync's fine locally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did run the easyfix 20149 which reported there were no files to clear out the cache.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you mentioned that the installer appears to show progress then closes, I would suggest you follow the steps below to check whether the OneDrive client is blocked by Group Policy.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press (Windows key) + R to open the
<strong>Run</strong> box.</span></li><li><span>Type gpedit.msc and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Local Group Policy Editor, in the folder list under Local Computer Policy, navigate the folders to
<strong>Local Computer Policy</strong> &gt; <strong>Computer Configuration</strong> &gt;
<strong>Administrative Templates</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Components</strong> &gt;
<strong>OneDrive</strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the OneDrive screen, under
<strong>Setting</strong>, click <strong>Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the <strong>
Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage</strong> box, make sure it is set to Disabled.</span></li></ol>

<h2>            Word 2007 - keeping a table intact</h2>
                    <p>I have a document several pages in length.&nbsp; I have several tables in the document and these tables are of varying length.&nbsp; Let's say the second table begins on page 1 and extends from page 1 on to page 2.&nbsp; I'd like to keep this second table "intact" meaning
 that the table does not have a page break inserted in its middle.&nbsp; I know I'll have perhaps a lot of white space at the bottom but I don't care.&nbsp; This socument is for on-line reading not printing.&nbsp; I know I can press Ctl-Enter (hard page break) and "push"
 the second table to the top of page 2.&nbsp; But I think there's a more sophisticated (automated) way to do this so that the entire document has this property - keep all objects/tables together.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            With Rohn's paragraph-formatting tip, <u>don't</u> apply the 'keep with next' attribute to the last row; otherwise, you may end up with some tables that would fit on the previous page being forced to the next page just because they have to stay with the
 paragraph that follows the table.

I'm not a lawyer either and this topic has been debated back and forth on one of the Pocket PC forums I moderate (not this one).<br />
<br />
I believe it is illegal to use an OS that has never been licensed for a device, so I believe the versions of WM6.0 that many users have installed on Axims, IPAQs, and probably other mobile devices are illegal.&nbsp; However, I have never seen or heard of anyone
 being prosecuted for installing one of these ROMs to their device - it is small potatoes.&nbsp; From time to time, I have heard of some of the sites that hosted these kinds of ROMs receiving Cease &amp; Desist letters.&nbsp; The response has been to remove the ROMS from
 the hosted websites and move them to RapidShare and other such places.<br />
<br />
For an individual user, I think it boils down to your own personal ethics.&nbsp; If you install one of these OS to your mobile device, you will probably not get caught and penalized in any way, but that does not make it legal.

<h2>            Transfer of contacts from Outlook 2003 to address book in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a new computer running Windows 10 after the OS (Windows XP) finally crashed and could not be revived. I was using Outlook 2003 on the old computer. The techs uploaded my contacts from Outlook 2003 but could not get Outlook 2013 to pull them
 into the address book. I have a very long list of subscribers (about 1,500 individuals)&nbsp;to material I prepare and send out frequently. I seem to be faced with&nbsp;re-entering each name and email address so that they will appear in the address book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone run into this problem and found a way to copy from contacts into the address book? Should I consider loading Outlook 2003 onto the new computer?</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Currently, we do not have an option to use the lineal in OneNote app for iPad Pro. The good thing is, you can forward this as a feature request to our product team as a consideration for future OneNote release. If you think that the app needs some tweaking
 to make it more efficient, then we highly advise that you make a comment in our Feedback page. Our developers are collating suggestions for the improvement of your experience in using OneNote. The features and the visuals of apps are updated with the help
 of users' feedback. Click this <strong><a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/327180-onenote-for-ipad-iphone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to proceed.</p>

<h2>            how can i download Skype for ipad2 running IOS 9.3.5</h2>
                    How can I down load Skype for iPad 2 running IOS 9.3.5 (i.e., the current/last version)?
<div>
<p>I recently had to reset my iPad 2 to factory settings (IOS 9.3.5). &nbsp;Now Skype won't install from the App Store -- re-install requires IOS 10, without an option for installing older version (like other apps, re-installed on the same device).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise how to proceed.</p>

            Hi Romina
<br />
<br />You can't, if you removed an existing compatible version of Skype that worked with iOS 9.3.5, the App store doesn't provide access to older supported version.
<br />
<br />The unfortunate recommendation would be to upgrade to a newer iPad that supports iOS 10.
<br />
<br />Its not an answer but just the way things have been setup by the software developer and iPad maker. 
<br />
<br />You might want to consider Facetime as an alternative. Most of my Family members have iPhone and iPads anyway and its already built in.
<br />
<br />An alternative you might be able to consider is Viber.

<div>As a workaround, Skype for iPhone can be used on an iPad with iOS 9.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Install older iTunes 12.6.5 with AppStore support:&nbsp;</div>
<div>https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208079&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. 'Purchase' the Skype for iPhone by downloading it in iTunes. Make sure to login in iTunes with the same Apple ID as on iPad.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Open Skype for iPhone in AppStore on iPad via this link:&nbsp;</div>
<div>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-iphone/id304878510</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. Select 'cloud' icon to install Skype for iPhone. AppStore will prompt that iOS 10 is required and will offer to download an older version.</div>

    <title>Bluetooth Audio Autoplay Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wire fox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Audio Autoplay Settings</h2>
                    <p>When I connect via Bluetooth to my car (which is set to be an auto-connection), my phone will auto-play music from Xbox Music. &nbsp;If a timeout period has elapsed from the last time I was playing music (I'll estimate that it's one hour), it will start playing
 as if I used the shuffle command: it will <em>always </em>begin with the same song (first song, alphabetically) and have a random shuffle thereafter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find this feature extremely annoying, as it is wasteful of data (my phone will be playing music to the car receiver while I'm actually listening to SiriusXM), plus it's helped foster a special hatred to the song "The Take Over, The Break's Over" due to
 hearing the opening chords of that song <em>every single day I drive. &nbsp;</em>I would love to be able to switch off this Autoplay feature so that I can have more manual control of my music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an RM-1073_1001 Lumia 640 LTE running Lumia Denim.</p>

<h2>            Default &#34;Save As&#34; Location Should Be From Where File Was Opened...But It Is NOT &#40;MS-Office 365 apps on Mac&#41;</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<div>
<p><span>Doing a "Save As" on a file from within an Office 365 application (e.g. Word or Excel) does NOT default to the location where I opened the file (instead it defaults to wherever I saved the LAST file I was PREVIOUSLY working on).</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Detailed description...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I open a file using an Office 365 application on my MacBook Pro (High Sierra), for example MS-Word, if I want to save that file as a different name it is easy enough to do a "Save As".&nbsp; However, the default location for a "Save As" is the NOT
 the location where I opened that file, but instead it is the location where I saved the PRIOR file that I was working on.&nbsp; This is consistent behavior across MS-Office applications e.g. Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc.&nbsp; If I open a file from a folder, that should
 be my default folder when doing a "Save As".&nbsp; It is common behavior to do a "Save As" to save a file as an incremental version...but I have to navigate the whole directory structure just to get back to my starting folder (unless I've already saved a file to
 that folder in that session).&nbsp; Why is this the default behavior, is it correct (i.e. what you intend), and is this configurable?</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In case that narrative does not make sense, here is what happens today:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) Save file "123.docx" to folder "ABC" and close that file</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>2) Open file "456.docx" from folder "XYZ" (by double clicking on it in Finder or opening from within Word)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>3) From within Word do a "Save As" (i.e. so you can save as "v2" or whatever)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>4) The default location for the "Save As" is folder ABC (the last place I SAVED a file)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As a result I have to navigate from my home folder back to wherever the folder I opened the file from in order to save a copy of the file to the same location with a different name (THIS IS THE PROBLEM)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here is what I would expect the behavior to be...</span><span> </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) Save file "123.docx" to folder "ABC" and close that file</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>2) Open file "456.docx" from folder "XYZ" (by double clicking on it in Finder or opening from within Word)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>3) From within Word do a "Save As" (i.e. so you can save as "v2" or whatever)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>4) The default location for the "Save As" is folder XYZ (the last place I OPENED a file)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This way it is very easy to save a file you a working on with a new name so you can keep multiple versions in one place&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why is the default behavior "backwards" to common sense and traditionally how things work?&nbsp; Did this recently change (I swear it used to default to where I opened the file from...and have been a lot of updates the last few months).&nbsp; And is there any way
 to change this (e.g. is this configurable setting or bug that needs to be fixed)?&nbsp; Appreciate any thoughts or suggestions...thanks!<br />

<p>Hi JMSChicago,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing your experience with us.</p>
<p>I follow your steps in 1~4 and do a test in the same version of Office at my end, I open a file from folder "XYZ" and try saving it as a new version, when clicking File&gt;Save as, the default folder showing is the folder "XYZ".</p>
<p>
</p><p>For troubleshooting, I'd like to suggest and confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1.If you directly open the "456" file in folder "XYZ"(skip the step 1), make changes in it and go to Save as, does it shows folder "XYZ " as the default location?</p>
<p>2.<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open your Mac in safe mode</a>, check the outcome in Office.</p>
<p>3.Try <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25796?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
creating a new Mac account</a>, log in Mac with the new account, check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>4.According to your description, it seems you didn't have the issue before. What changes have you done before the issue happens? (Install any program, update Office or Mac)?</p>
<p>(What is the last working Office version for you?)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There isn't a direct way that I'm aware to import Google contacts to Skype.
</span>As far as I know, there's no built-in syncing in Windows and you might need to turn to third-party syncing software.&nbsp;Try importing your&nbsp;Google contacts to Outlook. Now that Skype is integrated into Outlook, the Contacts will be there (but I don't think
 that's your option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I experienced. During initial setup (For example, the new outlook email, i have created, it had asked whether to merge with the existing Skype account or not). You have a choice to accept or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remember right, it had also given a choice to merge my existing google email contacts with Skype account. For good reasons, the application has somehow deducted my gmail account based on the same user id I had used. That was nice.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Choose forder to save sent email to in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    I need to be able to choose the folder to save emails I am sending to so I am not constantly having to move them from the sent view.&nbsp; This is a very basic task these days so not sure why I can't find it in Outlook 2016.&nbsp; Considering moving to Office 365
 but if Outlook will not provide the necessary functions I don't think I will subscribe.

    <title>Haunted Windows 7 System - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terrydavisrq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Haunted Windows 7 System</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems I have an embedded malicious virus in my 7 Home Premium. I have tried to thwart its activity by clearing the&nbsp; temporary folders, but it repopulates its components as soon as I close ,or restart the system. I've tried to isolate in&nbsp;a 'zip' folder';
 once I gathered them for it,&nbsp;but&nbsp;one file component can not be 'renamed' or deleted. Its taken over privileges, and seems not even detectable by Microsoft Security Essentials. I have noticed that a 'symbol' appears&nbsp;in the MSE scan several times during a run.
 A symbol of a cellphone and a&nbsp;person symbol with it. I have reset my desktop to factory many times - it does no good; it slowly regains it prior positions even in the first stages of updates. *Sigh* I don't know what to do. I've tried reconfigures, and other
 component deletions and downloads. Would&nbsp;someone please advise me on how to kill this persistent monster.&nbsp;&nbsp;Could Microsoft somehow access my</p>
<p>&nbsp;system to locate&nbsp;and disgorge this malicious thing?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hi Sal_mm,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’d like to say that the expanding and collapsing behavior of Outlook is random. But there are two basic rules:
</p>
<p>1. Outlook should remember which folders were expanded or collapsed when you closed Outlook and should also start with this folder state again.</p>
<p>2. If a folder is collapsed and a new message is delivered to one of its subfolders, the folder will automatically expand to that subfolder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you don’t want your mailbox folders collapsed, please add your Inbox and other folders that receive mail to Favorites list. Also, navigate to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Outlook start and exit &gt; Start Outlook in this folder &gt; Select an email folder
 which do not receive emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem still persists, please provide us the following information:</p>
<p>1. What version of Outlook client do you use?</p>
<p>2. Did this problem occur before? If not, do you install any application or add-ins which may cause this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Barry</p>

    <title>Entourage failed to establish secure connection to outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bbao  say:</h3>
<h2>            Entourage failed to establish secure connection to outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Hi Experts</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the title summarised, my Entourage 2008 for Mac prompts the following error message at start up saying it is unable to establish a secure connection to a Microsoft server because a certificate on the server's certificate chain has expired or is not valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40789ce6-6807-4fcc-a9ee-bb8860210dbc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Entourage 2008 worked well before. it is running on Snow Leopard (OSX 10.6.8) on my iMac. The iMac was powered off for a year until recently i started using it for casual web surfing and PDF reading.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried checking where i can import the required root certificate but didn't find any thing I can do with Keychain Access. I also checked the help given by the error message, it is for Tiger and Leopard only.<br />
<br />
I also tried removing all email accounts, and reconfigured it to access outlook.com with IMAP (imap-mail.outlook.com) and SMTP (smtp-mail.outlook.com). the same error persists.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, if I change connection settings to accept unsecured communication over IMAP and SMTP, Entourage may work but it is not something I could accept.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion and comments please?<br />
<br />
Regards and Thanks,<br />

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I have already double checked the setting before posting the question online. I have correct IMAP and SMTP settings applied including the server names, port and of course the credential. as I mentioned, the same settings worked before, for a long
 time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess something is wrong with the certificate. That's why I am researching how to install the latest certificate(s) against these IMAP and SMTP servers. however, I do notice the server names are actually changed to a long version (shown in the screenshot)
 once used to establish the connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more suggestions please?</p>

I also see that a lot of people are having this issue, why is this happening and why is Outlook not fixing the problem?<br />

            Thank you for your reply, I did clear cache but still had the problem. However, I have the problem fixed and this is what worked for me.
<br />
<br />
MY FIX:<br />
<br />
1) I deleted all of my SENT FOLDER.<br />
2) I then deleted (Emptied) all of the DELETED FOLDER.<br />
<br />
That's it! <br />
<br />
I had tried everything I have read in threads and this is what finally worked for me. I was amazed as to the thousands of sent e-mails that were in my SENT FOLDER. I think that if you delete only some of the SENT FOLDER that may work as well, but I decided
 to just clear everything out. I was about to drop Outlook and set up a new account but this finally worked for me, as I did this out of pure desperation, having no email reception for days.
<br />
<br />
I am not computer literate enough to understand how or why this worked, all I can do is share my experience and just hope this feedback is of help to someone.
<br />
<br />

                    <p>This is moronic, but I am unable to find _direct_ and comprehansive link of instruction on where to download Office 2016 64 bit version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enter my key at setup.office.com and get an installer for Office 32 bit (x84). I don't need that. There is no selection of x64 at&nbsp;setup.office.com and there is no selection of 64 bit version at the main site of office.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a misleading help article that suggests that you can choose 64 bit Office 2016 on the main page of office.com, but it is false, you can't choose anything and help article provides some old dated screenshots of the website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is absolutly stupid, beyond any reason. Please, someone, point me to the working link where I can download that goddamned Office 2016 Proffesional Plus 64 bit. And, Miscorosft, for the love of god, fix that nonsence.</p>

</p><p>This is what I get at the main office.com page. The links from Install Office button follow to Office 365, Office 365 again, "I have a key for Office" that leads to setup.office.com and a final link that leads to a help article.
 Again, the only link for Office 2016 is for setup.office.com where I input a key an get a webinstaller for x86.</p>

<p>
</p><p>On a side-note, why are you trying to download the 64-bit version?</p>
<p>Many people, including me at an earlier time, believe that since they have a 64-bit operating system, they should use the 64-bit version of Office. This is a mistake.</p>
<p>Having a 64-bit version of Windows (or a different OS) is a prerequisite for using the 64-bit version of Office, but it is not a good reason to do so.</p>

<p>I not showing an error screen. I'm showin a UI of office.com from where (supposedly) I have to be able to download Office 2016 in both x86 and x64 variants and fail to find 64 bit variant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen those articles, thanks, but I need that 64 bit to work on large sets of data and huge presentations. It's not my call to steer the workflow away from huge files, I gust have to do that. And no matter the reason - it is absolutely absurd that there
 is no simple way to just open one page, press one link and download a distribution of Office. And I would like to get to the bottom of this.</p>

&lt;&lt; <br />
<br />
Going to guess it's because you skipped the step/instruction regarding "Install from Office.com/MyAccount. Skipping that part will result in an x86 (32bit) installer download<br />

<p>That&nbsp;<span>Office.com/MyAccount redirectes me to</span> https://account.microsoft.com/services/?OCID=PROD_Office_CONS_MyAccount_Migration</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way to get to simply downloading any version of Office 2016 from there. I haven't actually bought Office 2016 from Microsoft website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply have a key that I enter after ordinary installation and that's it. So I need that MSI or EXE file that I launch, install, open any of Office apps and enter a key. Simple as that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just can't wrap my head around that this is such a hard thing to do. How can anyone have any objections againt torrent trackers after such absurd UIs and intaraction scenarios?</p>

            Doesn't matter where you purchased the key from as long as it's legitimate. Just need to create an MS Account and associate the key with that account.
<br />
<br />If you want to use an offline installer, the instructions are as follows but still going to require having a MS Account created
<br />
<br />Use the Office offline installer

<br />As for anything else - I just provide the info you're looking for and will leave comments about the process to others.

<p>The key I'm trying&nbsp;to use actually is from my expired MSDN subscription from when I was an MSP so it is most definatly legit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I get from those help articles you need some "<span>association</span>" or whatever between MS Account and said keys. I do not have this&nbsp;<span>association, don't know how to create one
 and don't think with whatever keys this is possible at all - you have to follow some not so obvious path to create that association.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, sadly, this problem is unsolvable. For some reason Microsoft decided not to put Office installers publicly while there was no problem with Windows ISOs that you can download even without any MS Account at any time
 for whatever reason. I have no other choise then do grab MSDN image from somewhere else like a tracker. This is really, really disappointing and even pathetic for Corp team responsible for .com websites as well as Office team that has not allowed a simplier
 solution.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for the help though, I know you have nothing to do with those decisions as most MVP don't or else we would have seen a very, very different MS Corp by now.</span></p>
