    <title>Trouble making PDF from A5 document - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trouble making PDF from A5 document</h2>
                    I'm using Word 2011 for Mac and Mac OSX Mountain Lion. I've got a long document in several sections - it's a history journal. The final publication will be A5 sized and will be given to a printing company to be printed on A4 paper folded in half and stapled.
 The whole document is set for A5 paper. I want to produce an A5 sized PDF file from it. I go to File - Print and in the little quick preview in the dialog box, it looks fine - all 85 pages of it. But if I then use the PDF button to create a PDF or to open
 a PDF in preview, the resulting file does not look OK. Some text is on top of other text. So for example, the text from the top of page 2 is overprinted on top of the lower part of the text on page 1.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As far as I can see I can't add an image to a post here but here is a link to screenshots of both the Word original and the muddled PDF. I've blurred out some personal details in the text.&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help me find out what is going wrong?</div>
<div><br />

<div><b>Edited to add</b> - Since posting this, I have tried with an A4 version of the document instead, and that exhibits a similar problem. I have also tried with a different A4 document (15 pages, all one section) and that produces a perfectly good PDF file.
 I have also tried the document on a different Mac, and the same problem occurs, and it also occurs with an older document of a similar type. So it doesn't seem to be just a problem with this document or with my Mac's set-up .&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Do I have to conclude that the Mac can't produce a proper PDF from a Word document with multiple sections - Ian</div>

What is this "Similarity"? <br />

Hi Rachel
<div><br />
<div>By "similar" documents I meant other editions of the journal. The similarity is that they are Word documents containing more than one section. They have to be arranged in sections because we need endnotes at the end of each article, which is achieved by
 making each article a new section, and setting endnotes to "end of section".&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'd happily upload a file, but I'm not sure how to. There doesn't seem to be a button for that here.</div>

<p>Hi PROTEI MENA,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that your subscription is Office 365 Business Essential with Skype for business basic client. I suggest you try to re-install the client and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49440</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can also try to clear the cache of Skype for business and see if it helps:</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the %localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync folder.</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Delete your <strong>sip</strong> profile folder</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Go into the <strong>Tracing</strong> folder</p>
<p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Delete the all files, but not the folders</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Huni</p>

<p>What I find particularly interesting is that none of the replies above seem to mention that Skype for Business is in fact being phased out and replaced with Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is precisely what Microsoft "Support" told me after a week of faffing around, asking for screenshots etc.&nbsp; Why Microsoft would allow new clients such as myself to download and install SfB when it doesn't even work (by the admission of their own Tech
 team) is absolutely beyond me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in short: if you can't see your Contacts tab, chances are nothing you or anyone else does is going to fix the problem.&nbsp; You should even see a banner saying you're being moved over to MS Teams (which doesn't help those of us who need SfB for other reasons).</p>

<h2>            OneNote for Windows 10 Security</h2>
                    <p>With the different versions of "OneNote" and the seemingly universal use of the term "OneNote", regardless of version, my question is related to "OneNote for Windows 10 [I am a 365 Subscriber].</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally saw in a Microsoft descriptor when comparing "OneNote for Windows 10" to OneNote 2016 the reference to "OneNote for Windows 10" being stored in "the cloud". Since most cloud access storage requires my personal password to access whatever cloud
 I am using, my question is "how is my "OneNote for Windows 10" secured only to me?</p>

            Dear Ian,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />OneNote syncs with your account and stores information in cloud. When you are using your account to log into PC, you should provide your password, if you have not share it with anyone and it is a secure one, you will be the only one to login to your account and to use your files and notes.
<br />
<br />But since you have Office 365, you can choose which OneNote you want to use. It is either OneNote for Windows 10, or OneNote 2016 ( also this one will be decommissioned in 2 years )

<p>LA,</p>
<p>Thanks and 2 further questions:</p>
<p>#1. Security Access: </p>
<p>Just to be clear, the security control over my OneNote for Windows 10 is solely governed by my entering my password when I log on to my computer? So once I have entered my password and leave my computer on, then my OneNote is accessible to anyone else if
 I were to walk away and leave my computer on such as when I need to leave it on to use my VPN from an offsite location?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2. Cloud Capacity:</p>
<p>Not that it is a "current" issue, but one I anticipate if I were to seriously start using OneNote for Windows 10, since everyone seems to charge by the storage capacity I use in their cloud, how big is the cloud storing my OneNote for Windows 10?</p>
<p>Appreciate your thoughts?</p>
<p>Ian</p>

            Dear Ian,
<br />
<br />1. It depends on what do you want to secure more. When you sign into PC and then you will authorize in OneNote for Windows 10, everyone who will have access to that PC will have access to OneNote. You can create different accounts on your PC and use your account to login. Also in OneNote you have an option to sign out from current account, so even if someone else will login, he/she will not see notes in OneNote. If you want to set remote control of your PC you can do it, however if you will be on another PC with Windows 10, it is enough to login to your account in OneNote to access your notes.
<br />
<br />2. OneNote is taking capacity of OneDrive, so it depends on how much capacity do you have. Since you have Office 365, you should have 1tb, which is a lot to fill in only with notes.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for your interest on using<strong> App Highlights</strong>. However, this app has already been discontinued for WP 7.5 devices since&nbsp;<strong>September 30, 2014</strong>.&nbsp;This is the reason why you're getting the connection error on
 your phone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend that you un-install App Highlights from your phone&nbsp;and go directly to the
<strong>Windows Phone Store</strong> to find great apps and games for your Lumia 510.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Force data entry based on a condition in an adjacent cell</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 10~Excel 2016</p>
<p>I have a worksheet, that will identify data &amp; return to a cell that a date is required to be entered.</p>
<p>My question is, can I format a cell to insist on data to be entered where an adjacent cell contains the text "Date Required"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Backup</h2>
                    <p>A system backup with "File History" is awkward and doesn't work properly including failure to recognize USB drives.</p>
<p>Automatic backup of selected files is a useful feature, but one also needs an easy to use Full Backup as is available for &nbsp;Windows Server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Acronis backup. &nbsp;It is a awkward, huge program - over 1 GB. It does install without &nbsp;apparent errors, but problems were encountered during a full system backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dell Backup does work, but you need the Pro version. &nbsp;Dell AppAssure is unusable due to an incredibly poorly designed program security system. I gave up trying to use a demo version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can we have an easy to use, reliable full system backup for Windows 10 that functions like Windows Server backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backup on a Dell Venue Pro has some interesting specific issues. First, this is a Tablet computer, but using Dell's backup software requires an accessory keyboard.</p>
<p>Entering the BIOS options requires repeatedly pressing of the + audio button on the computer. The BIOS must be set to Windows legacy mode, unsecured in order to boot from a USB drive and, unfortunately, some manual steps are required for each "cold start".&nbsp;</p>

<p>wbAdmin and FileHistory works to a thumb drive here after advanced sharing the thumb drive and giving Everyone full permissions. &nbsp; Be nice if it would backup to a SD card for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Much better than leaving a thumb drive sticking out or paying big bucks for
 a larger byte micro usb drive on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree, would be nice to have a Windows default system image program /&nbsp;slightly customizable&nbsp;backup type program.</p>

            <p>I very rarely talk about 3rd party solutions... especially for home, SOHO use... mostly I deal with enterprise solutions, so please do your own evaluation... but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months ago I found a little program called EaseUS todo backup... I was a bit concerned installing an app from China (perhaps idiotic to think that... but I had a spyware concern)... but I needed a small app for a small hotel... So far I haven't found
 any strange communications... (via an older ISA server I use at home)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... a cool little app ... also the paid app has per item mail backup (haven't checked the 'mail' app though... I use Outlook)... if you get the trial, they'll be offering you a discount within a few days...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I paid $20 US for the Workstation version on sale... $40 regular...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check out the trial... I'm on my tablet, so I won't list all the bits... but it does do imaging, dissimilar hardware restore (never tried that myself), email item level, encryption, partition, file level, differential, incremental, (both configurable periods
 ... i.e.&nbsp; x days between 'full' ... and retention policies</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... just something to look at... I don't deal with a lot of 'small' solutions, so maybe someone knows of something better... for this one client it's working well ...

            <p>Yes ... but recovery does not always guarantee data... various options ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use bitlocker, don't forget to keep your key available (you can get it inside the bitlocker control panel applet ... PRIOR to failure obviously) I keep mine on two separate encrypted drives, but you can print it out ... you will need it to access
 your drive assuming the drive is still accessible. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you overwrite a failed system (should that be required), you should use the recovery drive to boot to a command prompt. You very likely will be able to navigate to your files and perhaps copy them off. You can remove the USB recovery drive after you
 are at the&nbsp; prompt&nbsp;if you have a single USB port (e.g. surface tablet)... and add a USB drive to copy your files too..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure you find the correct drive letter .... depending on attached devices/your specific config.,&nbsp;when you boot to USB recovery, your actual drive you want to recover will NOT be C: .... Again, actual depends on config... you'll know by browsing to the
<p>
</p><p>Copying the entire user directory may cause some permissions/name length&nbsp;issues.... particularly with the appdata folder... (reasons outside scope here) ...you can skip APPDATA without losing anything too specific... maybe google earth saved places (version
 dependant) ... anyway.... poke around and grab what you need... I can't speak for all apps out there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use ROBOCOPY at the prompt ... ROBOCOPY /? for commands.... special notice to /E or /S flags... /S subdirectories without empty folders, /E is subdir WITH empty folders... don't forget you may want a folder on the destination drive&nbsp; ....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;md mydirectory</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: This refers to Windows 8.1 ... I have NOT done a recovery on Windows 10 yet, but looking at the various applets in 10, I'm sure it's close enough to get through ... perhaps identical</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway ... tedious typing on the tablet without my keyboard around&nbsp; ...😉</p>

            My backup always crashes just as it has about 90% of the system image completed.&nbsp; Any ideas? &nbsp;I suspect it has to do with the win7/win10 backup shemozzle.&nbsp; I hate fancy backup system.&nbsp; They are a PITA to recover from and impossible when the software becomes
 redundant, which it inevitably does.&nbsp; Why can't they use something simple like Syncback Pro that simply copies from one drive to another?

<h3> speedycart  say:</h3>
<h2>            onenote screen clipping not going to selected page</h2>
                    <p>Hi, using pc with latest windows in it and latest OneNote, with everything up to date.&nbsp;I use the shortcut screen clipping (windows key+shift+S) all the time and several months ago it stopped sending the clipping directly to the OneNote page that I chose
 it to send to. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the screen clipping tool (even when OneNote is closed) the screen goes gray and I select what I want clipped, but nothing happens (does send to clipboard). Something that I find interesting is that when I do that the selection box has a red outline.
 whereas when I am on a OneNote page (the only way I can get a screen clipping in OneNote) and I insert a screen clipping, that selection box is black? I'm assuming there is a setting that I have wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried setting the "send to OneNote" setting and shutting down and changing back, but it doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When OneNote was closed, when I used the shortcut it would open OneNote and insert it into the page I had selected. It no longer opens OneNote or puts it in the page I've selected for it to send to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>

<h2>            Mozilla Firefox spell checker doesn&#39;t work correctly with Outlook.</h2>
                    Mozilla Firefox spell checker doesn't work correctly with Outlook E-mail. It will show a word that is spelled correctly as being wrong. When you right click on the supposedly misspelled word the dictionary shows the same spelling as one of the choices.
 If you click on the dictionary with the same spelling as you already have, it just adds the first letter of that word again. so you have the same spelling with two of its first letters (e.g. If it showed spelled as being incorrect and you corrected it you
 would get sspelled).&nbsp; Then you have to go in and delete the first letter that it added. Is that an Outlook problem or Mozilla problem? By the way spell checker worked perfectly while typing this question which would lead me to believe it is problem on the
 Outlook side.

<h3> benuhron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Timevalue function always returning &#35;VALUE when referencing a time cell</h2>
                    So I have a numbers document that I have used for a paycheck sheet to keep track of my hours worked. My formula simplified is =(timevalue(cellb)-timevalue(cella)). Cell a is clock in and cell b is clock out. I used the formula when I switched to excel
 and all it ever gives me when I reference another cell is #VALUE. I tried inputting just the clock in and clock off times and it works. Am I missing something? Or am I going to have to input every clock in and clock off into each function when I need to enter
 them? Thanks!<br />

            If you're desperate to use the TIMEVALUE() function, you also need to use the TEXT() function...TIMEVALUE(TEXT(cellb,"HH:MM"))-TIMEVALUE(TEXT(cella,"HH:MM")). But be aware that you need to enter your time in 24 hour format (e.g. 20:00 for 8pm)

            TIMEVALUE() requires a string representation of a time as an input. If your entries are actual times (e.g., 08:00, 17:00, 3:00 PM, etc.) you'll get the #VALUE! error.
<div><br />
<div>If you're entering times already, then just use:</div>
<div><br />
<div>=B1 - A1</div>
<div><br />
<div>or, if there's a possibility that the times will start in one day and end in another (spanning midnight):</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;=B1 - A1 + (A1&gt;B1)</div>

 in protected sheet</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the protect procedure was named <strong>Protect_All</strong> then this is the code needed. When the workbook open the permission will be live.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">&nbsp;Private Sub Workbook_Open()</span><br />

<span>Loop through all sheets</span>
<span>Loop through all sheets</span>
<p>To protect and unprotect all sheets we need to run a loop that will loop through the sheets one at a time. There are 2 types of loops suitable here. The
<strong>For Each</strong> loop is especially designed to work with objects so it is very well suited. You could also use the
<strong>For</strong> loop.</p>
For each loop
<p>Here is an example of how <strong>For Each</strong> loop is constructed.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">Dim ws As Worksheet</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">For Each ws In ActiveWorkbook.Sheets</span><br />

<span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">Next ws</span></p>
Here is the code to protect all sheets
<p><strong>In the code below we are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Turning off screen updating to stop flickering as we protect and unprotect each sheet.</li><li>Using the For Each loop</li><li>Protecting each worksheet with the password “Online”</li><li>Screen updating is turned back on (even though this is not necessary as it will happen by default)</li></ul>

<p>Hi Rajat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your concern is that prying eyes might see the password by examining the code, simply password protect the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the VBE:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tools</strong></li><li><strong>VBAProject Properties</strong></li><li><strong>Protection</strong> tab</li><li><strong>Lock project from viewing</strong></li><li>Enter password</li><li>Confirm Password</li><li><strong>OK</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d07612c9-61f6-4a87-b687-fdda8a32d767?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d07612c9-61f6-4a87-b687-fdda8a32d767?upload=true" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Save the workbook as Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook format</li><li>Close the file&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Next time you open the workbook and try to view the code you will be prompted for the VBA password.<br />

<h2>            Linking Microsoft and Skype accounts</h2>
                    <p>I have read bunch of Microsoft instructions and help articles that were not helpful at all. A few days ago I found out that I got signed out of my Skype account and after all my attempts to sign I was redirected to Microsoft site that was stating that such
 Microsoft account doesn't exist. After researching I realized that Microsoft keeps killing Skype accounts and forcing people to link their good ol' Skype accounts to Microsoft account. Since I already had MS account and I decided to try. I tried multiple times
 including following instructions on&nbsp;https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/a-single-sign-in-for-skype-and-your-other-microsoft-services&nbsp; but whenever I try to enter my Skype account, Skype after recognizing it redirects me to Microsoft site and MS states
 that account doesn't exist. I got to the vicious cycle and there is no why to contact MS customer support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody was able to provide working steps how to link Skype account to MS account or how to contact MS help?</p>

            Hi George,
<br />
<br />If you no longer wish to pay for a subscription to Office 365 and you want to install the full Office 2019 package, you should remove Office 365 and then install Office 2019
<br />
<br />Use this tool from Microsoft to remove all remnants of a previous Office Installation:

<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in

<br />On the Office home page, select Install Office - Install

<h2>            No sound after startup</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently updated to Windows 10 Pro TP 10041. When I startup after shutdown, my sound option dows not show Speakers, just Realtek Output. So, no sound available. However, after I restart, Speakers are available and there is sound. If I put the PC to
 sleep mode, the sound is back after I turn the computer back on. Why is this happening? I did not have that problem when I was back on Windows 10 TP 9879... Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel Document Recovery</h2>
                    <p>I can no longer open an Excel document after not saving a copy from document recovery. The original file was saved on OneDrive. It now says that the document is corrupted and cannot be restored or extracted through Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I had it saved on OneDrive, but I didn't save the changes, then I closed my laptop, it ran out of battery. A day or so later I open up Excel and it has the file with all the changes, but it's in Document Recovery and I select the option to save a copy,
 but I didn't want two separate files, so I canceled and closed the file. After that I couldn't open the file again. The file is listed with all my other files on OneDrive, but an error comes up when I try to open it, it says, "Excel cannot open the file 'REG
 notes.xlsx' because the file format or file extension is not valid. Verify that the file has not been corrupted and that the file extension matches the format of the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix the file, so it will open?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello M.Ichsan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that before, when creating a team in Microsoft Teams, the group and group calendar will be automatically added to the OWA and Outlook client. However, the feature is changed now. When creating a team in Microsoft Teams, an Office 365 group will
 be created. But it will be hidden from the Global Address List. This is why it will not be add automatically in the Groups in OWA and Outlook client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to do the following steps to add this kind of groups manually: </p>
<p>1. Use the Office 365 admin account to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a>.</p>
<p>2. Run the following comlet: <strong>Set-UnifiedGroup -Identity GroupName@company.onmicrosoft.com -HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled $false</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a863774-8393-46bc-9aa7-09ecaf196785?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a863774-8393-46bc-9aa7-09ecaf196785?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>3. Go to OWA or Outlook client, join the group manually and the group calendar will display now.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 - Input latency when using backspace key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Input latency when using backspace key</h2>
                    <p>Sometime within the past week, my Outlook installation has become less responsive when correcting my typing. I can type long emails just fine, but if I use the backspace key to correct a mistake, it sometimes takes around one second to actually perform the
 action. If, for instance, I typed "humognous" and hit backspace five times to retype the word correctly, it would take almost five seconds before I could start typing again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior only occurs in Outlook. I can use the backspace key without input latency in all other applications including Word, Excel, and Google Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used OffCAT to scan for any issues, and none were found. I am using Windows 10 Anniversary Update with KB3194798 installed (October 11 roll-up). Office Professional Plus 2016 32-bit is installed using my Office 365 E3 license. The installed build
 of Outlook 2016 is 16.0.7329.1017. The only add-ins I have installed are those installed by default, MessageHeaderAnalyzer (from the store in Office 365), and OffCAT 2.2 (which was installed after the problem began).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a reasonably fresh build of this machine, as well. I think Windows 10 Anniversary Update was installed fresh (not upgraded) about a month ago.<br />

            <p>I also have ProPlus and went through all these steps, none of which worked. After my last post yesterday, I realized that since ProPlus defaults to (First Release for) Deferred Channel, we don't have the latest build. After a bit of a struggle I was able
 to switch to the Current Channel, at which time Office updated, and the problem went away!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as actually being able to switch channels, the first option on Microsoft's page
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3185078/how-to-switch-from-deferred-channel-to-current-channel-for-the-office-365-suite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;didn't work at all. The second option there (.bat file) didn't work at first until I ran it elevated. But at last, no Backspace lag.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regularly use several email accounts for various online games, now I find that I can no longer log into one of these - instead I am told my "account has been temporarily suspended"... and when I submit my mobile number to recover it, I'm given the message&nbsp;&nbsp;"Usage
 limit exceeded".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How can I fix this, as the account is inextricably linked to the online gaming account (eSports related, so a major pain now with upcoming Tournaments).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know, that the account hasn't been hacked, hasn't been used for any purposes that break Microsoft rules, so am very disappointed that this issue has arisen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How do I fix it ?</p>

<h2>            offset for side by side view</h2>
                    I'm currently tinkering around with a project in word, currently titled "Good Will Extorted" and&nbsp;available&nbsp;in the amazon kindle format.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However I still need to toy around with style and format before I'm comfortable with submitting it into create space where I'll publish it in paper. As I have been editing and manipulating my manuscript and converting it between&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;I've noticed
 one little thing that kinda makes keeping track of the printed appearance a bit obnoxious. because the first page of this&nbsp;document&nbsp;will be printed on the right side of the printed version the left is now shown on the right side w/ a side by side view of my
 5x7" pages.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>if printed it'd look like this when propping the book open</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;<span> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;page 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; or &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;empty offset<span> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;First page</div>
<div>page 2<span> </span>page 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Left<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Right</div>
<div>page 4<span> </span>page 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Left<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Right</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>etc......</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>but with the current side by side view it shows up as</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>page 1<span> </span>page 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; pages show up backwards &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right<span> </span>
Left</div>
<div>page 3<span> </span>page 4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right<span>
</span>Left</div>
<div>page 5<span> </span>page 6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right<span>
</span>Left</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>etc......</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I'd like to know is whether there is an offset setting to make the file to show up like the first set, I can insert a cover page to temporarily offset the view but I keep having problems converting it back and forth after removing that page and attempting
 to keep the same format and appearance.</div>

            <p>You can have the view you want in Print Preview but not in Print Layout view. The first thing you need to do is add Print Preview Edit Mode to your Quick Access Toolbar so that you can get the classic Print Preview (not the one shown by File | Print). To
 do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the QAT and choose Customize Quick Access Toolbar.</li><li>Under "Choose commands from," select All Commands.</li><li>Scroll down to Print Preview Edit Mode and select it.</li><li>Click Add&gt;&gt; to add it to the QAT.</li></ol>
<p>Possibly you have already enabled either "Mirror margins" or "Different Odd and Even Pages" for headers and footers. With either of those options enabled, you will see true facing pages in Print Preview Edit Mode.</p>

<p>Well Tom its been a while, sorry about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied the code from the website in the hyper link. I changed IE to GC and InternetExplorer to GoogleChrome and created a class module for part of the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get an error: "User-defined type not defined." at Dim GC As clsGC</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a beginner it looks like I need to add a Reference, but I don't know which one to use.</p>
<p>

    <title>Distorted sounds in Video converted from PowerPoint 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> indikawickramasinghe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Distorted sounds in Video converted from PowerPoint 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have been&nbsp;using&nbsp;Office 365, 2013 and recently upgraded to 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I create&nbsp;PowerPoint&nbsp;presentations with narrations and converted the same to a video using the export feature to create videos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, after conversion the video has a distorted sound &nbsp;when converted using Office 2016 version. Also, i found that video shows hidden audio controls of narration audio files in the&nbsp;PowerPoint too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I contact the MS and had&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;support session. They tried to repair using troubleshooting and sfc /scannow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But did not work. Also, i contacted MS by phone and they were unable to give me a proper solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, I uninstall and&nbsp;reinstalled&nbsp;Office 365, 2013. With this version, the Powerpoint converts perfectly and it give high quality sounds. And there are no hidden audio controls seen on the video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me to fix this issue with Office 365 2016. OR is it a inherent problem of new version..&nbsp;</p>

            I created many powerpoint presentations. However, once converted from the PPT 2016 , the video gives a distorted sound.&nbsp;

            <p>This problem come only in videos that have been converted using&nbsp;PowerPoint&nbsp;2016 version. When I revert back to the 2013 Office 365 package, videos converted works perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is another observation in this problem. The speaker icon which comes after inserting the video keep appearing in the converted videos even though setting are set to hide option in the PPT.</p>

            <p>Hi Maria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be interested to know what the add-on is that makes 2016 Powerpoint render with perfect sound - would you share the information here please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At present I'm creating my powerpoint videos without sound then adding them to explaindio latest version along with &nbsp;the soundtrack and getting my final video that way, but it isn't ideal and certainly I expected much better from a Microsoft product!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only upgraded from Office 2010 to 2016 to get the Powerpoint render to full HD feature - am very disappointed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi, Trish,</p>
<p>The conversor I tried is iSpring SlideAlloy. In fact I downloaded the first trial versión I found, I didn't search too much. Here you are the link:</p>
<p>http://www.ispringsolutions.com</p>
<p>I can't assure it is good, I work witk Office 2016 only since last week and tried it once. &nbsp;I made a Cristmas card with an embedded video song embedded and several animations. The video had been recorded with an iphone one year ago, and it has a quite good
 sound. Well, I got a perfect mp4 video from my Christmas card with this conversor,with a watermark in it, of course. Instead, the one I made in Power point gave me a horrible continuous noise over my song. As I said before, I hope Microsoft fix the problem,
 it is not logical to pay for new software if you pay for Oficce and it offers the same function.</p>
<p>bes regards. Teresa</p>

            <p>Hi Teresa, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>Yes, I know of iSpring, I used their add-on years ago before I got Camtasia, back when powerpoint couldn't create videos by itself. Like you, I don't want to pay for another product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just actually been talking to Microsoft powerpoint support on the phone and they say there is nothing wrong with the software, it's always a problem on a specific computer or a combination of factors that cause the problem and they wanted to take control
 of my computer to look, but I'm running some processes I can't stop at present so wasn't prepared to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did get a suggestion that from control panel, try a repair of the Office installation or uninstall &amp; re-install the software.</p>
<p>Could well be computer configuration, RAM, CPU speed etc, other software or hardware conflicts</p>
<p>Of course, run malware, antivirus checks etc - they all say that</p>
<p>

<p>Anyway, if it's not the software, must be my setup, so back to sleuthing!&nbsp;<br />

<p>Good luck with it.</p>

    <title>How can I always show the Print Preview on the File Tab&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I always show the Print Preview on the File Tab&#63;</h2>
                    How can I ALWAYS show the Print Preview on the File tab?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It used to be that whenever I went to the Print section of the File tab, the Print Preview would display. &nbsp;Now I have a button that says "Show Print Preview" that I have to select in order for the Print Preview to display?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was doing things in the Page Setup, but I'd prefer NOT to have to select another button each time I want to see a print preview? &nbsp;I've looked for an option to change this setting but can't find one.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone point me in the right direction?</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            Thanks for all your feedback. &nbsp;I'm not using any custom themes in Windows, but it does appear that this problem has resolved itself! &nbsp;(I didn't do anything--that I'm aware of--but all of the sudden, my print preview IS now appearing again! &nbsp;Gremlins at
 work...
<div><br />
<div>Thanks everyone for your help! &nbsp;I think we can consider this issue resolved...for now!</div>

<h2>            suddenly my microsoft word and excel are gone</h2>
                    
<p>when i purchased my macbook a few years ago, i also purchased word, excel, powerpoint, entourage.</p>
<p>this morning got up to do some work and when i went to click on the word icon nothing happened and a question mark appeared.&nbsp; i checked in my applications and the microsoft office 2004 folder is there, but no sign of word or excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>what can i do?&nbsp;</p>

            Do a Spotlight search for Word and then for Excel. If you find the applications, move them back into the Microsoft Office 2004 folder.
<br />
<br />
Otherwise, you need to run the installer.<br />

            Hi Karmen, 
<br />Sorry, no, if the messages were purged because you didn't access the account for more than a year, they are gone and can't be recovered.

            Hello KarmenRamos, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are having an issue with recovering e-mails from your 10 years old Outlook account. I know how important this is to you and I will try my best to advise you on this.
<br />
<br />
I find that this article may be relevant to you: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/13811/microsoft-account-doesnt-exist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/13811/...</a> <br />
<br />
Since your last logged in was 10 years ago, I am afraid all your e-mails had been purged due to inactivity.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You may refer to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/servicesagreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Services Agreement</a> <strong>section 4aii</strong>: <br />
<code>ii. Account Use. You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a five-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless provided otherwise in an offer for a paid portion
 of the Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4(a)(iv)(2) for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account. You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox
 and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you.</code>
<br />
<br />
I am sorry for the inconvenience caused. :( <br />
<br />
I hope my answer is helpful to you. <br />
<br />
Regards, <br />
Sutharsan <br />
