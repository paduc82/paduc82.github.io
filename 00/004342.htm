    <title>Word 2007- Check Boxes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 2007- Check Boxes</h2>
                    <p>I need to fill into a document a set of Check Boxes where I can title each one, and then I can put the set in different places of the Word 2007 Document, where the person reviewing the documents can only click on one check box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The detail is that I want to have a list of check boxes whice are titled:&nbsp; Yes, No, Maybe, Discuss&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then can put those 4 boxes in different places on the Word 2007 Documents so the person that clicks each time can only effectively answer a question
 thru one of the boxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if this is some type of group box or some other way to put in in different places of the document, that's what I need to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I don't want restrict the document as there will be other places to still type in certain words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            If you think that is complicated, then what you now propose would be even more so. By far the simplest option is to do as Jay suggested and use dropdown fields with the choices. There is no simple answer to what you wish to do.<br />

            Check boxes are really the wrong kind of object for this, because it would require a macro to enforce the "only one per group" rule. That gets you into all sorts of difficulties you don't want to deal with.<br />
<br />
If everybody who uses these documents will have Word 2007 or later, then you can use dropdown content controls, which don't involve restricting or protecting the documents. If the documents have to be used in Word 2003 or earlier, you must use dropdown form
 fields instead, because those versions (even with the Compatibility Pack) can't use content controls. If you use form fields, the document must be protected to make them work, but you can leave other parts of the document unprotected.<br />
<br />
In either case, the first thing to do is to open the Word Options dialog, go to the Popular tab of the dialog, and check the box for "Show Developer tab in the Ribbon". The buttons for inserting content controls and form fields are in the Controls group on
 the Developer tab.<br />
<br />
If you're making Word 2007-only documents, click the leftmost button in the second row in the Controls group, whose tag says "Drop-Down List". Then, in the right-hand half of the Controls group, click the Properties button. In the Properties dialog, click the
 Add button and type in the word Yes. Repeat this for No, Maybe, and Discuss. Finally, click OK.<br />
<br />
If you're making Word 2003-compatible documents, click the fourth button in the second row of the Controls group, whose tag says "Legacy Tools", and click the third button in the top row of the menu, the Drop-Down Form Field. Click the Properties button. In
 the dialog, click the the "Drop-down item" box and type the word Yes, then click the Add button. Repeat this for No, Maybe, and Discuss. Finally, click OK.<br />
<br />
To make protected areas in the document around the form fields and other areas that are not protected, you must insert section breaks between the areas. The smallest part of a document that can be either protected or not protected is a section, which is the
 area between section breaks (or at the beginning or end of the document). Usually you'll want to use "continuous" section breaks, which don't force a new page.<br />
<br />
Once all the form fields and section breaks are in place, click the Protect Document button on the Developer ribbon (and there's another one on the Review ribbon that does the same thing). This opens the Restrict Formatting and Editing pane on the right. Click
 the check box under Editing Restrictions. Set the dropdown under the check box to "Filling in forms". Then click the "Select sections..." link below the dropdown, which opens a dialog with a list of the document's sections. Uncheck the sections that will be
 unprotected, leaving the checks for the sections to be protected. Finally, click the Start Enforcing button and click OK in the password dialog (you can leave the boxes blank if you don't want a password).<br />

<h2>            Office 2013 CTR alongside Office 2016 CTR</h2>
                    
<p>The 
FAQ on the wiki says that "You also can't have different versions of Click-to-Run installed on the same computer, for example Office 2013 and 2016", however when I deployed Office 2016 through Intune (using the instructions at&nbsp;<a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/office/How-to-Deploying-Office-e9f296fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/office/How-to-Deploying-Office-e9f296fb</a>),
 the computers I deployed to have both Office 2013 C2R (as an already existing install) and Office 2016 C2R installed. The file associations (.docx, .xlsx, etc.) are still tied to Office 2013, but both Office 2013 and Office 2016 appear to be co-existing side
 by side.</p>
<p>Does the wiki need updating?</p>
<p>Also, is there a way to configure the Office 2016 Deployment Tool so that it will uninstall 2013 CTR when 2016 CTR installs? I haven't seen a way to do that.</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have received the log file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After checking the details, your existing Office 2013 is the&nbsp;Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 (<strong>MS</strong>I) as you mentioned above, which can co-exist with Office 2016(C<strong>lick-to-Run</strong>).</p>
<p>Here are two articles for your reference:</p>

<h2>            Internet timing out and lots of spinning balls...</h2>
                    <p>Build 9926</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seemingly random time-outs and much waiting for pages to load - sometimes minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network troubleshooter couldn't find anything, and sometimes it flattered to deceive when I'd fire up a browser and it'd load the requested page immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In desperation, I flushed the DNS cache in the hope that it was DNS related. Right now it's behaving itself but that could be just an evil trick it's playing on me, so I'll update this post later either way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[Update]</p>
<p>Okay, the DNS cache trick failed and on the restart this morning, the same unresponsive net behaviour exhibited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just did a net stack (ipv4) refresh and hoping that's done the trick. So far so good, as evidenced by the fact that typing this edit is actually possible at the moment from WTP10 - it wasn't possible 20 minutes ago.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed. Will issue a further update later today. </p>

<h2>            SSL&#47;TLS POP&#47;SMTP setting 6270 &#63;</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
I recently purchased Nokia 6270 and I do have GPRS connection working well for WAP sites and for Internet access on my laptop.<br />
<br />
I have been trying to configure my GMAIL account on the email client provided with 6270. Gmail pop/smtp access required secure connection SSL/TLS and I could not find any place to set SSL or TLS YES. in personal configuration, there is everything to set except
 these.<br />
<br />
It was there in old Motorola E398..The settings are really confusing.<br />
<br />
If anybody has accessed/configured GMAIL on 6270, please help..<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Rajiv

            i believe there is no ssl setting for this type of phone. i think (but may be wrong) that you only get it on series 60, 80 and 90 phones. the 6270 is a series 40.

            Thanks...<br />
<br />
But this ridiculuos by first from Gmail that they only allows pop access via SSL and then by Nokia for 6270, by not providing SSL feature...<br />
<br />
I have to now restrict my self by using the m.gmail.com wap site, on which I can not send any attachement from phone :-(<br />
<br />
I guess my 2 yrs old Motorola E398 was better then 6270 atleast for Email settings.<br />

            i think saying that the moto is better than the 6270 is incorrect, from the specs of the phone it is a very capable and modern device. when it comes to gmail and the way the decide to allow you to pick it up - thats not a matter for here.<br />
<br />
if ssl connections were important to you, you should have looked at the phones spec before you bought it. nokia makes many phones (mainly series 60) that do support ssl/tls etc.

            you are right that I should have checked it before buying, I think you can expect such a small feature from a highend mobile. Nokia do claim it as highend mobile. I randomly looked at some of the mobile from different makes today and all of the high end
 mobiles have this feature.<br />
<br />
And by the way all the email clients do contains feature for specifying SSL or TLS.<br />
<br />
Does that means that 40 series is missing this feature because that is only provided in 60 series. Or is there any logical reason behind it.<br />
<br />
Is there any software version update that can provide this feature. I have Version 03.65 19-12-05 RM-56

            the 6270 is not a high end phone, no series 40 is and is not advertised as such.<br />

i dont understand the rest of your post tho.

<div>Just wondering, <b>how to</b>, or <b>is there a way</b>, to set up an Office 365 (Exchange) Calendar (account) in Mountain Lion's Calendar app? (formerly iCal)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The reason being, I don't always launch Outlook 2011 every time I am on my home iMac, but I would still like to view my office calendar somewhere, like on the Calendar app in Mountain Lion, from time to time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have successfully set up my Office 365 Exchange account (same account) on both iPad and iPhone. &nbsp;But doesn't seem to be working on the Mac.</div>

<div>Thanks and cheers</div>

            This issue seems more related to your Hotmail account rather than an issue with the phone itself. Contact Hotmail help to see if there are any old devices they can see linked to your email. Post on their forum:<br />

<h2>            Gmail issue - can&#39;t send email to one specific address</h2>
                    I've hunted around for a solution to this problem &amp; downloaded this hotfix (<span><a href="http://hotfixv4.microsoft.com/Microsoft%20Word%202010/sp2/word2010kb2597052fullfilex86glb/14.0000.6114.5000/free/441660_intl_i386_zip.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://hotfixv4.microsoft.com/Microsoft%20Word%202010/sp2/word2010kb2597052fullfilex86glb/14.0000.6114.5000/free/441660_intl_i386_zip.exe</a>)
 but before I dare to run it, am wondering if anyone here has had the same issue or could resolve it without needing the hotfix?<br />
<br />
</span>I've used Gmail through Outlook 2010 for a couple of years now &amp; have never encountered this problem before now, &amp; equally unsure how or when it began exactly.
<p>I use a POP a/c to access my Gmail and am receiving mail fine. &nbsp;On trying to send to my brother for the past 2-3 wks now I get this error msg:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Steve () on 24/08/2012 23:25<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; None of your e-mail accounts could send to this recipient."</p>
<p>And that's EXACTLY what the msg reads = in other words, the system has removed his email address and does that every time. &nbsp;I even deleted his contact details out of Outlook but the same thing happened even with putting the details in manually.</p>
<p>He's receiving mail fine from others &amp; I can send to him ok from Gmail online - it's only through Outlook. &nbsp;I also can send to others through the Gmail a/c in Outlook without any issues - it's only his that bounces back. &nbsp;His email address is an 8 letter
 word with no spaces or fancy characters etc.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />

    <title>Onenote high network usage while syncing but no progress - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Onenote high network usage while syncing but no progress</h2>
                    <p>I was having a lot of syncing errors so I decided to remove and re-add a large notebook. It has been more than a week of updating constantly at a speed of 2.2Mbps. Unfortunately it is making little progress. If I am lucky, 3 pages will be updated to the
 cloud over an 8 hour period. Each page contains only a small amount of information (18KB when copied to word). The progress it was making has slowed. I have multiple errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need the password to sync this notebook. (Error code: 0xE4010643)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've removed and re-added my office15 credential in the Credential Manager with no success. I also tried the "get help" button which only provides basic syncing tips that haven't done anything. I have onedrive installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What really confuses me is that there <em>is </em>some progress made, just not much. If I am having an authentication problem, I would think that nothing would update. I am checking the progress by going to onedrive online and paging through my partially
 added notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is making me nuts any help would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>sorry I'm just reading my own post and you're right it's not clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my data model I'm calculating average handling time and process time as an KPI in sec and converting it into the hh:mm:ss format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my pivot table the&nbsp;time is displayed correctly so e.g. 00:04:45.</p>
<p>But Power View is not displaying the number. It shows "HH:mm:ss"</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope that's better</p>

            <p>I don't think you should get your hopes up. Microsoft is deprecating Power View in favour of the Power BI Desktop application and Power BI service online, where Power Query, Power Pivot and the data model can be used in a similar way to create data visualisations

                    I can't playback videos in fullscreen mode even though that's how I have it setup on my HTC s621 (win mobile 6 standard, CE OS 5.2.1238 (build 17745.0.2.3)). It does it in fullscreen for about 2 seconds then shrinks down so I can barely see it.

I am sure it was not meant to be a personal attack but I would&nbsp;REMIND you that all the moderators here are users just like you and spend time because they like helping others.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It is is almost as if something is touchng the screen and it goes back to normal mode. The only thing I can think of is that some program that might be running in the backgound is causing it to drop the fullscreen.&nbsp; I just ran a test with my 8525 and Tuch Pro
 running a couple of videos on each device ... no issues on my end.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Just as a thought, if you were to try an alternate player such as TCPMP, does it always work?<br />

    <title>Do I need to purchase an Extra 2010 licence - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrianmorgan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do I need to purchase an Extra 2010 licence</h2>
                    I bought office 2010 2 licence version in July 2011 and installed on 2 machines. I am now having to buy a new machine that I need to install Office 2010 to. I said I own the software, I just need a new licence, but the retailer said that I can not use
 the previosu disk and must buy a single licence version for a further 257 GBP. Surely, as I have already bought the software, all I require is a new key and not a single licence software installation? Anybody advise here?

            Essentially correct.<br />
<br />
Uninstalling from old machine is done to comply with terms of the license. The Activation system doesn't actually track uninstalls (a questionable design choice IMHO).<br />
<br />
That means as Tony said, you will almost certainly have to do a phone activation and talk to a live "service rep". After you explain that you have uninstalled and are transferring to a new machine they will have to manually allow your activation to go through.<br />

            The number should be displayed by your system when you select phone activation. If it doesn't, then these tips will show you alternate ways of getting the number:<br />

<p>NOTE: you can find links to the specific activation instruction for Office or Windows in hyperlinks at the bottom of the article</p>
<p>If none of the other fixes work, do a phone activation. Do not enter anything until the phone system offers you the option to talk to a live service rep. Explain the problem to them. You are transferring the installation from a “dead”
 computer, or you are getting an invalid product key and would like to know the exact reason</p>

    <title>Insufficent funds notice yet balance is reflected in Skype credit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rk17-18  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insufficent funds notice yet balance is reflected in Skype credit</h2>
                    <p>Hi there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I added £10 Skype credit to my Skype account for the first time this weekend in the hope that I would be able to use Skype to make international calls to mobile numbers abroad in Africa. Boy was I in for a surprise!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to make the first call which lasted 5 mins or less only for the line to be disconnected and a message saying I have insufficient funds for the phone call popping up on the screen. At first I thought the call must be super expensive if the whole
 £10 is already finished in a short space of time. I checked the Skype credit and to my surprise about £3 had been deducted and £7 remains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After closing the Skype app on my laptop and reopening it again the Skype credit was still the same, I tried calling two different international numbers and the same insufficient funds message kept coming up without connecting the call at all.&nbsp; I even tried
 calling and texting my own mobile number in the UK to no avail, some attempts today to call have also failed yet the balance still remains the same at £7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this has been a really bad start to my experience of using Skype credit and I am yet to receive a response from the Skype team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** My question is why am I unable to use the Skype credit on my account? ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone numbers I am calling are not blocked - the first call worked for less than 5 mins - I calculated the call charges which come up to about 45p/min to establish that I am well within the limit of the Skype credit I do have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

                    <p>everytime I try to save a new notebook directly into onedrive, it saves it as an internet shortcut. &nbsp; When you click it, it takes you to onedrive.live.com, where you can sign in and use the online version of onenote. &nbsp;But if I save notebooks to somewhere
 else outside of onedrive (such as google drive or my pc), it saves it as a normal onenote document. &nbsp;I've also noticed that when I copy-paste a notebook from a different location to onedrive, it eventually changes it to an internet shortcut. &nbsp;How can I save
 a notebook directly to onedrive as a normal onenote document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And another thing: &nbsp;I've found these internet shortcuts to be completely undeletable. &nbsp;If you delete them, they come back in less than 5 seconds. &nbsp;How do I change this?</p>

            Thank you very much. &nbsp;While I don't completely agree with Microsoft's approach to onenote's relationship with onedrive, I learned through experimenting that you can store onenote notebooks on the onedrive and open them without internet access by opening
 the onenote application directly. &nbsp;And the online and application versions sync, too.

<h2>            Junk Email FOlder Outlook 2013</h2>
                    I have a junk email folder in outlook but the folder is empty. I can see the contents of the folder from my phone (Galaxy S2). I tried to forward the message from my phone to my email and the I also tried to move the email I need in the junk email folder
 on my phone to inbox and it won't. Couple of questions:<br />
Where are the junk emails stored in Outlook 2013 if they are not in my junk email folder?
<br />
Why can't I move or forward the junk email from my phone? <br />
<br />

    <title>GDR 2 for Windows Phone 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            GDR 2 for Windows Phone 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&nbsp;runned GDR 2 (Windows Phone 8.1.2) on my Lumia 820- it was installed through the Windows Insider Program for a long time ago. Recently I installed Windows Phone 10, but was not satisfied by the upgrade and returned by means of Windows Recovery Tool to
 8.1.1. Unfortunately I missed the GDR 2, as the&nbsp;Insider Program has stopped supporting&nbsp;the old Windows Phone&nbsp;devices. Could you suggest any way to get back the 8.1.2 update?</p>

            Are you sure you don't still have the 8.1 update 2 I did the same on my 930 and when I rolled back to 8.1 I still have the.2 update but if you don't you can just use the upgrade advisor app to update again but stop at 8.1.2 just don't update to Windows
 10

<p>Thank you for your repy!</p>
<p>My actual version is 8.10.14234.75.</p>
<p>The Upgrade Advisor app can not help, because officially Microsoft decided to not upgrade Lumia 820 to WP 10.
</p>
<p>I used Over The Cable Updater to get WP 10, but with this program you can not control the update process.</p>

            It sounds as though either the download was incomplete or the disc creation faulty. Are you able to copy the disc content to the hard drive and install from there?
<br />
<br />
Do you still have the downloaded ISO disc image? It may be in the Temp folder if the installer has finished with it. Open it with (say) WinRar or PowerISO and copy the files to the hard drive. Install from the hard drive.<br />

<p>Hi Armaud,</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. </p>
<p>Most words/values can be used as tags in Yammer for users to easily search for posts and files. This might be a good feature moving forward but as of the moment, the feature you are looking is not yet available.
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Cannot print via wireless - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n7vrz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot print via wireless</h2>
                    Printer is an HP Officejet Pro 6970 previously an HP Deskjet 2540b with the same probems.<br />
1. Printer is installed and drivers updated.<br />
2. Printer is set to default.<br />
3. Wireless connection to printer is 'Connected' as shown on the printer screen and HP Network Configuration Page printout. (This was printed via the printers control panel.)<br />
4. IP address set.<br />
5. DCOM Server Process Launcher is running.<br />
6. RPC Endpont Mapper is running.<br />
7. All other computers can print via wireless to this printer after software installation on them.<br />
8. This computer can print ONLY if printer is connected via USB cable.<br />
9. If I open a document outside of Notepad, Wordpad, etc. and try to print it just sits in the queue and does not print.&nbsp;<br />
10. Trying to print from Notepad I get a window with 'The handle is invalid.'<br />
11. Trying to print from Wordpad gets me nothing. Nothing in the print queue and Wordpad closes after a bit.<br />
12. Libre Office 5.4 cannot even find the default printer.&nbsp;<br />
13. Network is set to private.<br />
14. Printer and file sharing check box is checked and workgroup name is the same for all computers.<br />
15. Control Panel&gt; Network and Internet&gt; View network computers and devices shows the printer.&nbsp;<br />
16. Using HP Printer Assistant I can get a diagnostic or an alignment page printed.&nbsp;<br />
17. Thinking there may be a problem with some part of the motherboard, i.e. some chip or something, I changed motherboards. I even used a different manufacturer. I still have the same problems as described above.&nbsp;<br />
18. Although this computer is on a wired connection to the router, I can connect to the internet via wifi if I so choose. So the wireless (ASUS PCE-68) from this computer is working.&nbsp;<br />
19. Nothing I've found on the 'net has worked.<br />
20. Windows printer diagnostic and HP printer diagnostic find nothing wrong.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that your PC's Print Spooler Service is not working correctly, preventing you from printing. To troubleshoot this, we recommend clearing spooler files and restarting the Spooler Service. To do so, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type<strong>&nbsp;Services</strong>, then select the search result of the same name.</li><li>In the&nbsp;<strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;list, double-tap (or double-click)&nbsp;<strong>Print Spooler</strong>. Select&nbsp;<strong>Stop</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>In the search box on the taskbar, type&nbsp;<strong>%WINDIR%\system32\spool\printers</strong>, select the file folder in the search results, and then delete all files in the folder.</li><li>Search for and open&nbsp;<strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;again</li><li>In the&nbsp;<strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;list, double-tab (or double-click)&nbsp;<strong>Print Spooler</strong>.</li><li>Select<strong>&nbsp;Start</strong>, and in the&nbsp;<strong>Startup Type</strong>&nbsp;list, make sure that&nbsp;<strong>Automatic</strong>&nbsp;is selected, and then select&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how things go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Allan</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a similar problem to OP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop updated to 17074.rs on the weekend.&nbsp; This morning, I brought the laptop back into the office, and now it won't print to the wireless printers, either by wifi or by a LAN connection through the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other systems in the office are still printing to these printers just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the above, but it is still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, I have tried printing from Edge, Firefox, Adobe Acrobat and MS Word.&nbsp; No joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printers are 3x Brother HL-2270DW Mono Lasers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shane</p>

<p>Just to clarify, are you using an <strong>Insider build</strong>? If yes, we would like to know what Insider build are you using. Also, may we know when did this issue start happening or are you able to print using

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tagged this thread but wanted to add some information in hopes it will help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printer:&nbsp; HP Officejet 4650</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue and have been troubleshooting in for the past several days.&nbsp; My sys info is below.&nbsp; I have not changed printers prior to the insider preview updates and the printer issues just came about within the past week.&nbsp; The printer itself is
 working fine as I can print via email and from other devices. In the course of troubleshooting I have assured the print spooler service is working correctly and is currently working.&nbsp; I wonder if this is an issue with the HP printers? When I set this printer
 up to print via their web service it performs fine (which entails sending it through email directly to the printer (major hassle).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,</p>

<p>What I finally di after doing everything you have done...was to remove the printer and manually re-add it via IP address.</p>

            I have had this issue with a wirelessly networked HP Officejet Pro 8630. I ended up uninstalling the printer and reinstalling. THere was a bad driver issue. But the HP smartprint could see the printer, just could not print from applications and apps.&nbsp;

<p>Yes, I am in the Insider Program. The current build that I have installed is 17074.rs_prerelease_flt.180116-1539.

            I'm not sure that it is a bad driver in my case. I have installed the software on my laptop from the same disc I used to install it on this computer and it can print via the wireless network while this one cannot.

    <title>sent pdf attachments, shows blank white screen or sometimes only one - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> newbie_123n  say:</h3>
<h2>            sent pdf attachments, shows blank white screen or sometimes only one third of the page on receipents computer</h2>
                    I often send an email with pdf attachment to clients. However in the past few months, I am starting to get a response that the recipients are getting a blank white screen or only one third of the page are showing up when they open the attachment. At first,
 this issue only happen every a couple of days, but now it is getting worse to the point that all of the pdf files that I attach to my email come up blank. I am using Outlook 2007. I have tried to reinstall the outlook 3 times in the past, but the issue always
 come up in just two or three days after I reinstall. Please help!!<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

    <title>Word 2013 - Printing Specific Page Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> feisty84  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 - Printing Specific Page Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with Word 2013 and an A4&nbsp;document set up for label printing onto Avery labels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The document has custom margins, multiple pages, and tables to space 3&nbsp;columns (with 8 rows)&nbsp;of address labels down 9 pages. The tables contain plain text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole document prints fine. (with a warning about the custom margins)</p>
<p>The issue comes when&nbsp;a specific page is selected to print. If I use the custom print option to choose a single page to print,&nbsp;Word then&nbsp;attempts to print&nbsp;with no errors or warnings. When I check the print&nbsp;queue, no print job has been generated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested this on several different computers with different models of HP and Brother printer connected and it is the same on each one. Office has all the updates applied from windows update and the printers&nbsp;are operating correctly for every other type
 of document.</p>
<p>Each computer is running Windows 8.1 Enterprise x64 (Update 3 with all updates)&nbsp;and we are using the 32 bit version of Office 2013 Professional Plus SP1 (with all updates)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behaviour suggests a potential bug in Word 2013 as the document prints fine when you print it normally. Also, if you&nbsp;scroll down&nbsp;to the page in question and choose "Print Current Page" the print then works successfully (again with the warning about the
 custom margin)</p>
<p>If this is a known issue, any advice would be welcome. Failing that, I hope to report the issue so it could potentially be looked at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

            <p>Hi Dr Mathew Joseph,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me help you to open the Office 2013 applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us try to open the application and unable to then you may navigate to the following location and try to open the Office 365 applications:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\ClentX86 or ClientX64\Root\Office15.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If still unable to open, then you may repair Office 2013 installation, following the steps from the article below:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2769349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2769349</font></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not help, then the only option is to remove Office 2013 by running the fixit from the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</font></span></a></p>

<p>Even now when try to&nbsp;access&nbsp;Word, Excell etc, by double clicking on the Office icon, it again asks 'do you want this program to make&nbsp;changes to your computer?',<u> and when I click 'yes'&nbsp;the&nbsp;whole process is repeated.</u></p>
