<h2>            How do I change the default action of Explorer back to &#34;explore&#34; when a cd&#47;dvd drive is selected.</h2>
                    For some reason the default is "install or run". I've found this in the registry, but can't make any sense of the accompanying entries.

<p>I now understand what you want to do and I also believe it can be done with modifications to the registry but I have no idea what they are (and can find no references or articles on it).</p>
<p>One thing you could do would be go to Start / Control Panel / Default Programs / Change Autoplay Settings / set autoplay to on (yes I know you turned it off) and change EVERY option to "Open Folder to View Files using Windows Explorer."&nbsp; Then that would
 automatically occur whenever you inserted a CD - thus making it an automatic default (instead of a manual one&nbsp;using the context menu).&nbsp; I don't think this would change the context menu default option or the default action taken when double-clicking on the
 CD in Windows Explorer but it may get you closer to what you want to be happening.</p>
<p>I would suggest you repost your inquiry in the Technet Forums at: <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/itprovistasetup/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/itprovistasetup/threads</a>&nbsp;where they are a bit more technically-oriented than we are here and might know the registry tweak to accomplish your objectives.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 login loop after the 1903 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tokimeka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 login loop after the 1903 update</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I'm having trouble with logging into my computer. The problem is: when I enter my PIN/password, the screen says "Welcome" and the circle next to the text is spinning endlessly. I've been waiting for 1 and a half hour but the screen still shows a spinning
 circle and it seems as if nothing progressed. There's no buttons I could click, so I have to hold the power button on my laptop keyboard for it to turn off, and then turn it on again to get to the login page. I've restarted my PC multiple times and I am losing
 my patience.</p>
<p>This all started after I installed the newest 1903 Windows 10 update using the update assistant - I haven't been able to log in since the update was ready to be installed (which was all done today).</p>
<p>I also tried to get my conputer into safe mode, and it worked. In safe mode, when I log into my account to unlock the computer, it only takes about a minute and I'm able to hop in. When I exited it though, I was hoping the issue would also go away in normal
 mode, but I was wrong and now here I am, looking for help on this endless login problem.</p>
<p>What should I do to stop the loop? I would appreciate any help.</p>

            Hi Angeleleina.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start or function: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  The bootable media is also the only method that doesn't require the password if you're stuck on that.
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1903 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />Good news, Microsoft is changing Update policies soon as announced recently here:  <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/04/04/improving-the-windows-10-update-experience-with-control-quality-and-transparency/#25qbCuAVA5Vkx6mC.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/201...</a>
<br />Until then you can manage Updates with all possible options here:

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the exact same issue on about 30 machines in my corporate environment right now.&nbsp; I have halted all upgrades to 1903 due to being unable to pinpoint the cause of this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as Angeleina said, the PC boots normally and displays the login screen.&nbsp; Then when a user attempts to login, it will say "Welcome" with the spinning circle and never get past it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone been able to find a root cause?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed it only affects PCs upgraded from previous builds of Windows 10.&nbsp; &nbsp;A freshly imaged machine of Windows 10 1903 will login successfully every time.</p>

<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>So far I haven't been able to find a solution to this, but I found a way that prevents this problem from happening by falling back to a previous version and consequently not updating to newer versions. I will try my best to explain the process below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get out of the login loop, you have to press the power button right after you've started the computer. Then, you need to hold the "Shift" button and click on "Restart". Soon, you will get a blue screen with multiple options on screen. For me, the only
 solution that worked from here was to press "Troubleshooting" -&gt; "More Options" -&gt; "Return to a previous version". It might take some time for your computer to restart again. If all goes according to plan, you will be able to log in successfully this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if you want to prevent Windows from installing the update when you turn off/restart the computer, you should open File Explorer and navigate to "C:\WINDOWS\SoftwareDistribution" and delete everything in that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sincerely hope that helped! Again, it's not a solution, since you can't keep your computer up to date, but merely a prevention.</p>

<p>I just signed up here simply to provide a solution that I've never thought would work. I've had this issue for the past last year. Tried everything to update 1903 to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ONLY solution that worked was when I read this reddit post:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/clj6bd/updated_to_1903_now_stuck_in_a_login_loop/evwhfgz/</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is (believe it or not, super simple!):</p>
<p>"Start it in Safe Mode"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted the PC in safe mode, I got past the login screen instantly! Windows continued the update. Then rebooted to normal mode, and everything was working again.</p>

    <title>How to set owner to LOCAL SERVICE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frankymacky  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to set owner to LOCAL SERVICE</h2>
                    On an XP machine, I accidentally used a command line tool (cygwin's bash shell) in an administrator's account to hierarchically change the owner of "c:\Documents and Settings\LocalService".&nbsp; All child files &amp; folders that hierarchically fall under that
 folder had their ownership changed to Administrator.<br />
<br />
To try to correct this, I checked an XP Mode VM and found that all files/folders within "c:\Documents and Settings\LocalService" should be owned by LOCAL SERVICE.&nbsp; This is from choosing files/folders within "c:\Documents and Settings\LocalService", bringing
 up their Properties panel, going to the Security tab, clicking on Advanced, and selecting the Owner tab in the resulting Advanced Security Settings window.&nbsp; I can also use that tab to change owners, but unfortunately, I can't change the owner back to LOCAL
 SERVICE.&nbsp; That is not an option in the in the list of names for changing ownership.&nbsp; Presumably because it is not a regular account.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to set the owner back to LOCAL SERVICE?&nbsp; What is the effect of having the wrong owner?<br />
<br />
P.S. I also have the same problem with the "c:\Documents and Settings\NetworkService".&nbsp; Thanks for responses on that, too.<br />

            Hi Dennis.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try resetting Xbox app at Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Xbox &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset.
<br />
<br />If that fails re-register Xbox from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If those don't help then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Changing a Japanese WIndows OS to an English one. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Changing a Japanese WIndows OS to an English one.</h2>
                    I'm thinking of buying a computer in Japan.&nbsp; Until now, there was no way to convert the Japanese version of Windows into English (unless you had Windows 7 ulitmate, I think).&nbsp; But I've heard that with Windows 8, I could get the Japanese version of the
 OS and change it to an English one.&nbsp; Is this true?&nbsp; It would certainly make things more convenient for buying a computer in Japan.

                    I am having trouble install the windows 10 upgrade to my windows 7 computer. I have tried many times to install it with no success. I goes through like it is upgrading but at the end It will say restoring previous version on windows and goes back to windows
 7. It comes up with an error 0x8007002C - 0x4000D The installation failed in the SECOND_BOOT phase with an error during&nbsp;MIGRATE_DATA operation. I have uninstalled my antivirus, unhooked all my USB devices, tried with a clean boot environment, that was the
 only thing only I seen about this issue, nothing has worked, I have 135GB of free space on my hard drive, so I don't think it's a space issue. I Used the MediaCreationToolx64 and created an ISO disk, didn't work, I tried putting it on an USB, still didn't
 work. I upgraded it through windows update, didn't work, when I upgraded it through windows update I got error 8007002c and error 1900208. I also have a windows 7 laptop, that upgraded with no problem to windows 10, but now I

</strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. </span></span></p>

            Your right, Microsoft response was didn't help at all, still can't upgrade. The only thing in thier responce I didn't try before was they said to unhook all hard drives but the main one, so I tried that yesterday, took my computer all apart, removed all
 hard drives but my main C: drive (I had 2 other hard drives and a SSD) That didn't work either, I'm at a total loss of what to try. If I do find a way to upgrade, I'll post it on here so other people with the same problem will have a way to get upgraded.

            I would like to think that MS has seen this error code during the Beta testing. &nbsp;I would also like to think that this error code appeared on the machines of MS engineers. &nbsp;I would like to think that they had a fix to this problem. &nbsp;So either they have
 no fix to the problem or they have a fix but they are being tight-lipped for reasons unknown. &nbsp;This has been a most frustrating experience, having tried upgrading my PC unsuccessfully at least 20 times now, and receiving countless error messages each time.
 &nbsp;I have tried all of the "fixes" with obviously no luck in getting W10 installed. &nbsp;I am thinking about buying a full edition license but the only reservation I have in doing so is there is no guarantee that I will have any success with that. &nbsp;Aaaaaaargh.

<strong>Norton Removal</strong> Tool [1] <em>or the <strong>McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</strong></em>&nbsp;[2] &amp; reboot (c)&nbsp;BEFORE you will&nbsp;be able to successfully install the Symantec application. Contact Symantec Support for further guidance, Javier.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            PA Bear, thanks again for your suggestions.&nbsp; I did just try running the Norton Removal Tool and then tried to re-run the Windows Installer before trying to install Symantec Endpoint, and still get the not enough storage space error.<br />
<br />
I guess I will ask Symantec Support for suggestions as well.<br />

thanks again for your help.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am Chetan Savade from Symantec Technical Support Team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a known issue that while installing SEP on Widows 8 machine it rolls back. Although you are getting different message I would suggest to try the steps given in this article</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 / 2008 R2 - SEP Client installation rolls back.<br />

</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not helped then pass on the SEP_Inst.log file,&nbsp;Log file should be present under %temp% folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also suggest to fix the Windows Installer issue first.</p>

<br />
Unfortunately I can't follow these rollback steps.&nbsp; I had already gone through the uninstall process, and I also ran the Norton Removal Tool.
<br />
<br />
I can't seem to add an attachment file to send you the SEP_Inst.log file, so I will have to add its contents instead.&nbsp; Sorry that it is so long.<br />
<br />
Well, I guess this reply tool won't let me add that either.<br />
<br />
How can I send you the SEP_Inst.log file?<br />

                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have user running windows Xp professional with service pack 3. The user is getting the following error when she logs into the computer each morning. Error: Could not load file or assembly 'WMIControlLibrary, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"
 or one of its dependencies. The system can not find the file specified. Only thing that seems to not be working is Office calendar printing Assistant. I have removed this file and the issue still persists. Also, I have not found anything&nbsp;in the event viewer
 in that relates to this error. The only error I did find was a problem with .net framework. I removed all the framework installs and thier updates. Restarted the computer and ther error went away and was replaced with errors from the programs that require
 that file to work. I&nbsp;reinstalled .net framework 2 and the&nbsp;error returns. I left all the otther frameworks off the&nbsp;machine. I have ran an repair on&nbsp;.net framework with no change. I am not entirely sure that the .net framework is the problem though. I am just
 assuming so. At this point I am not sure where to go from here on resolving this issue. Any one got any ideas??&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
One possible reason why this issue occurs is when the computer did not start correctly. For us to isolate your concern, we would like to ask for the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you tell us if there's any hardware or software changes on your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What is the exact message that you're getting? If possible, provide a screenshot.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you may try unplugging additional hard drive, and other external devices.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back, and we'll assist you further.</p>

<p>When you say network discovery is this from the taskbar or from Network &amp; Internet?&nbsp; Does it say secured and connected?&nbsp; If it does not say connected it may be from your next door neighbor.

<p>I have 5 or 6 different networks that show that are from the local area as they are broadcasting and my computer can hear them.&nbsp; They are secured and I can not get into them as I do not have their password.

<p>I have an HP laptop running windows 7 pro 64.&nbsp; I have a program called Bowser Electronics (OBDII code reader for cars).&nbsp; It worked fine a few months ago and works on two other windows 7 computers, one is pro and one is ultimate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to start it up the computer "things" like it normally does when you click on an application but no window is opened.&nbsp; If I go to task manager, I see the exe running in processes tab&nbsp;but not in the application tab.&nbsp; I've tried uninstalling and
 reinstalling multipul times. I've also tried uninstalling with the&nbsp;help of revo uninstaller to clean up the registry at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am doing this as adminsitrator with&nbsp;full permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
a. You may also disable the User Account Control and the security software temporarily and check.<br />
User Account Control (UAC) can help you prevent unauthorized changes to your computer.</div>
<div>
<div>Refer to the article below for steps about disabling the User Account Control.<br />
<strong>Turn User Account Control on or off</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off</span></a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Important Note: </strong>We don't recommend turning User Account Control off. If you do turn it off, you should turn it back on as soon as possible.</div>
<div>b. Refer to the article below which explains how to disable the Antivirus software on your computer.<br />
<strong>Disable antivirus software</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a><br />
<strong>Important Note: </strong>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong><br />
I also&nbsp;suspect that another third party application is causing the conflict with this application. Perform Clean Boot troubleshooting to find the root cause of the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer to the article below for steps and more information on clean boot.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow the step 7 in the above article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

<p><span>Hello Nichol77,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Site.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to Shekhar's reply, you may try running the Program Compatibility troubleshooter and then check the issue as there does not appear to a program installation file for
 Windows 7 provided by the program vendor. To do this, please see the link below:</span></p>

<p>Hello Mary -</p>
<p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; I am in contact with Bowser electronics as well.&nbsp; I've tried running in xp with the same result.&nbsp; I've checked the prolific usb/serial driver and have updated it to the newest version.&nbsp; I also did this to the two other computers
 running windows 7 and this program to verify that it works.&nbsp; I tried uninstalling my USB devices from device manager and reinstalling them.&nbsp; Any more help would be greatly appriciated!&nbsp; Thank you thus far for the help.</p>

<p>Hello Nichol77,</p>
<p>Are you having problems with just this one application or with other applications not opening?<br />
Did you try the clean boot? Did you disable all 3rd party programs from starting? Did you still experience the issue?<br />
Does it work in Safe Mode?</p>
<p><span>Next, let's run System File checker to see if you have any corrupted system files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: </span><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Restart your system.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Now run chkdsk:<br />
1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade or do a clean install.<br />
2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)<br />
3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.<br />
4. Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, try again and see if you are able to get your Bowser program to work.<br />
<br />
Please reply back with an update. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></p>

<p>This is the only program that is having an issue.&nbsp; (Although I probably only have 4 programs installed if you count&nbsp;MS Office as one)&nbsp; I tried the clean boot, but will try it again.&nbsp; I have not tried safe mode yet, but will check before going through the

<p>&nbsp;The SFC scan did find errors which it was not able to correct, and a log was made.&nbsp; I can email you the log?</p>
<p>The chkdsk scanned (hour or 2&nbsp;so long!)&nbsp;It ran through 5 of 5 and I had to leave it.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I came back it was ready for me to log in to windows so i am assuming it finished.&nbsp; I logged in and tried to run&nbsp;Bowser with the same results, it made the computer

                    <p>Many countries and systems uses proxy servers.</p>
<p>This means that whatever information, emails, searches, etc are actually blocked and stored at the proxy servers first before being transmitted to your account.</p>
<p>File scanners, keyword scanners, viruses, changing of file/website contents, etc happen and some are blocked from access.</p>
<p>So this is a real security risk having to go through the internet to store your stuff.</p>
<p>Is there a way to ensure security/encryption in this instance?</p>
<p>How do you ensure undesirable authorities do not lay their hands on it?</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately there is no shortcut for moving Apps between virtual desktops. It’s a built in feature comes by design. We cannot move Apps from one desktop to other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you can switch from one desktop to other desktop by pressing <strong>WIN + CTRL + LEFT</strong> or

    <title>Using ROBOCOPY In A Batch Script To Backup Files &#38; Folders On - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using ROBOCOPY In A Batch Script To Backup Files &#38; Folders On Windows Vista&#47;7</h2>
                    <p>This isn't so much a question as it is a contribution for those, like myself, who are looking for thorough examples of how to use ROBOCOPY in a batch script (.BAT file) to backup their Windows Vista/7 data.&nbsp; I am, by no means, a master of such things, but
 I've been using the script below for many months, and I believe it's a&nbsp;decent example of how to implement ROBOCOPY as a means to backup data.&nbsp; Being that I was never able to find a decent example myself, I hope that my contribution will help others.</p>
<p>You must accept all responsibility for use of this script.&nbsp; I will not accept any responsibility for data that is lost as a result of its use.&nbsp; I am not claiming excellence in this matter.&nbsp; There are those that are much better at this than I am.&nbsp; I'm sure
 some of you might find gross inefficiencies or other such lameness in my script, but if you do, and feel like commenting about it, please be kind.</p>
<p>Copy the script below, and paste it into Notepad, or similar text editor.&nbsp; Save the file, and make sure the file name extension is '.BAT'.&nbsp; Be sure to read the comments in the script, and define the variables to suit your needs.</p>
<p>The backup script below will perform a complete backup on the first day of the month of the users profile that is currently executing the batch, and it will perform incremental backups of the users profile every day subsequent to the day the complete backup
 was performed.&nbsp; This process repeats itself on a monthly basis.&nbsp; I schedule this backup to run every day of the month, and I keep 32 days of backup history.&nbsp; This means, I always have at least one complete backup, and up to 31 days of incremetal backup history
 to refer to.</p>
<p>If anyone has suggestions as to how to improve this script, please feel free to contribute in this thread.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thanks, I appreciate that.&nbsp; Just FYI, I added one last line to the script.&nbsp; I added the "attrib" command to execute after the complete backup process.&nbsp; This ensures that the Archive bit gets reset on all of the files after the complete backup, so that the
 next incremental backup doesn't copy files that have already been backed up in the complete backup.&nbsp; Without this command, the first incremental performed after a complete backup will contain some of the files that were copied in the complete backup, even
 though those files may not have changed.&nbsp; The incremental process uses the /M switch, which sets the Archive bit of the source files to OFF after copying the files, but the /M switch also instructs robocopy to only copy files whos&nbsp;Archives bits are set to
 ON, so that switch cannot be used in the complete backup process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The script still functions safely and reliably without the attrib command.&nbsp; However, it doesn't operate as efficiently as it does with it.&nbsp; E.g., not a big deal, just a deal.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I request you to install all the pending updates and check if you face the issue. If the issue persists I suggest you to download and install the latest Windows defender manually.</p>

            <p>Have been having all kinds of problems with Windows since support ran&nbsp; virus ck. and said they found virus and malware and removed them.&nbsp; Windows would not start until they reset prior to&nbsp;malware removal.&nbsp; Since then I have had to do a fresh install of windows
 several times.&nbsp; Even installed new hard drive and fresh install.&nbsp; Defender still will not do full scan, only run quick scan.</p>
<p>Have updated everything to latest and problem persists.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thank you for taking time to answer problem.</p>

<p>Hello Shailesh, <br />
<br />
<br />
Issue as such can be a result of some changes in the configuration settings. To better assist you with your concern, we recommend that you enable the built-in Administrator account on your device to remove the password on your user account. To do this, follow
 the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Open System Recovery Option menu on your computer to access Command Prompt:</strong>
<p><br />
A. Restart your computer using the computer's power button.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
B. Do one of the following:<br />
<br />
- If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you need to try again by waiting until the Windows logo prompt
 appears, and then shut down and restart&nbsp; your computer.<br />
- If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to repair, and then press and hold F8.<br />
<br />
C. On the <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>Boot</strong> <strong>Options</strong> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight
<strong>Repair</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>computer</strong>, and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>. (If Repair your computer isn't listed as an option, then your computer doesn't include preinstalled recovery options, or your network administrator has turned them off.)<br />
D. Select a <strong>keyboard</strong> <strong>layout</strong>, and click <strong>
Next</strong>.<br />
E. On the <strong>System</strong> <strong>Recovery</strong> <strong>Options</strong> menu, click
<strong>Command</strong> <strong>Prompt</strong> (see screenshot below for System Recovery Option Menu).<br />
</p>
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Enable the built-in Administrator account:</strong>
<p><br />
A. On the <strong>Command</strong> <strong>Prompt</strong>, type <em><strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong></em> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
B. You should see a message that the command completed successfully. Once you see this message, Restart your computer and you'll now see the
<strong>Administrator</strong> <strong>Account</strong> as a choice.<br />
<br />
</p>
</li><li><strong>Remove the password of the user that you cannot login.</strong>
<p><br />
A. In the <strong>Search</strong> box, type <strong>Computer</strong> <strong>Management</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong> to open the <strong>Computer</strong> <strong>Management</strong> window.<br />
B. On the left pane, expand the <strong>Local</strong> <strong>Users</strong> <strong>
and</strong> <strong>Groups</strong> and click on <strong>Users</strong>.<br />
C. Right-click on the username that you want to remove the password and select <strong>
Properties</strong>.<br />
D. Under the (<strong>username</strong>) <strong>Properties</strong>, click on the
<strong>Member</strong> <strong>Of</strong> <strong>tab</strong>.<br />
E. Click <strong>Add</strong> button, type <strong><em>Administrators</em></strong> under
<strong>Enter</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>object</strong> <strong>names</strong>
<strong>to</strong> <strong>select</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong> then <strong>
Apply</strong>.<br />
F. Right-click on the username that you want to remove the password and select <strong>
Set</strong> <strong>Password</strong>.<br />
G. Leave the <strong>New</strong> <strong>password</strong> and <strong>Confirm</strong>
<strong>password</strong> section <strong>blank</strong> and press <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
H. Once done, restart your device and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
</p>
</li><li>After performing the steps above, you can now <strong>Disable</strong> <strong>
Built-in</strong> <strong>Administrator</strong> <strong>Account</strong>. To do this, follow the steps below:
<p><br />
A. In the <strong>Search</strong> box, type <strong>cmd</strong>, and then press <strong>
CTRL + SHIFT + Enter.</strong><br />
B. If the <strong>User</strong> <strong>Account</strong> <strong>Control</strong>
<strong>dialog</strong> box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click
<strong>Continue</strong>.<br />
C. On the <strong>Command</strong> <strong>Prompt</strong>, type <em><strong>net user administrator /active:no</strong></em> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that you are logged on as your regular user account.</p>

    <title>Adding a sound device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lloydgarver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding a sound device</h2>
                    For years with my xp, I have used a philips speech mike pro which is a handheld device that serves as both a mouse and a microphone,<br />
After installing the device, the computer seems to recognize it as a mouse, but not as microphone. WHen I try to "add device" it doesn't list it.<br />
<br />
Also, how do I get the control panel, and anything else to the "classic look?"<br />
<br />
Thanks -- Lloyd

<p>For the SpeechMike Pro to work, did you install the software that came with the device?&nbsp; There should be some software &amp; drivers that will allow the OS to fully use all of the&nbsp;functions of the device.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To get control panel to go back to the "classic look", when you open it the next time, click the "Switch to Classic View" in the upper left hand corner.</p>

<h2>            Stuck on build 16299.15</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with downloading the latest updates.</p>
<p>Currently I'm on Windows 10 Pro, Build 16299.15.and Windows Update is saying that my machine is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last cumulative windows update I've received is KB4054517 in December 2017.</p>
<p>I have heard that Microsoft has stopped the cumulative updates for some AMD machines due to some faulty spectre patches.</p>
<p>However, it's now february and I am receiving various updates (Flash, Office, etc.) over windows update, but no cumulative updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was on 16299.125 but then I had the idea to uninstall the last patch in hope that I would receive the latest cumulative one.</p>
<p>The result was a redownload of the december patch and change of the build to 16299.15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am not in the insider program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've tried so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>As described above, removing the last cumulative patch and redownloading</li><li>WIndows Update troubleshooter</li><li>Removing the windows updates cache</li></ul>
<p>Does someone else have the same issue?</p>
<p>What can I do here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Crescento</p>
<p>
<br />

<p>Thank you for the reply, Kapil.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have heard that some of the updates brick the OS on AMD machines due to the aforementioned spectre patches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also thought to do that, but then again, there must be a reason why I'm not getting them.</p>
<p>I am currently worried that I'll brick my machine if I install them manually.</p>

            The update KB4056892 which had a build number of 16299.125 bricked AMD based systems and afterwards it was resolved by newer patches like 16299.198 and .248.
<br />Direcly Install KB4074588 that skips the entire bricking and fixing:

<p>A step in the right direction but I suspect that is not going to resolve your problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Explorer.exe is used by many applications. When you get a crash are you seeing a problem with another programme?</p>

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On checking the system information file I found that Explorer.exe was also faulting due to the ntdll.dll. This appears to be occurring a lot more than being caused by iertutil.dll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact the faulting ntdll.dll module also seems to affecting agent.exe and mmc.exe applications causing them to produce application errors.</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>You are misreading the report. The problem is caused by the first named application not the second named application. With most application errors you will often find that reinstalling the first named application resolves the problem. However, explorer.exe
 is an intermediary between two applications and the report does not name the first initiating application.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version), update definitions and run in normal mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.<br />
