I keep seeing more of these files popping up in the temp folder. Note; the text doc with URL in name is the tmp file.
<p>
</p><p>So I went into properties and checked the time it was created.<br />
Then I went into Norton Histories and saw an ISP Statistical Submission by Norton at the exact same time the tmp file was created in the temp folder. So I went and located the file Norton submitted.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I opened mshtml.ddl on Note Pad and it has the same type of funky weird characters as the URL tmp files which keeps appearing in the temp folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa9ce78d-87de-488a-86ce-1e785389ed97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa9ce78d-87de-488a-86ce-1e785389ed97" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>NOW. The question IS - is this a normal process of Microsoft Windows 10 to place these URL tmp files on my system? (Refer to the first image) If so, what program is causing this issue? I think this all started with the big recent Windows 10 update.</p>

            Wha, what is happening? This is the second time in a second thread I've asked a question about the temp files and I've got a reply not answering the specific question I want answering.<br />
<br />
My concern is WHY ARE the tmp files have all of a sudden started appeared in the temp folder when they haven't done so before? Is it a now normal MS process or is it a virus that's causing them to appear? It can't be anything I've installed because, I've uninstalled
 everything leading up to the month of August 2016. They appearing in the folder like everyday and I have to delete them every time I go in there. I've done numerous virus scans in normal and safe mode and used AV root kit tools to kill off any process that
 shouldn't be running, and I've cleaned out the browsers using other tools recommenced by BC. Oh yeah, I've been to Bleeping Computers and they've said my systems is clean. That still doesn't explain why I keep seeing those tmp files. When I open them to view
 in notepad, those odd and wired characters MATCH a known Microsoft DDL file (mshtml). SO this is why I'm here. I thought maybe I should ask the experts at Microsoft to see if they might be able to help identify what process is causing it (if any at all or
 that it might be mshtml dumping tmp files with names beginning with URL), so I can eliminate the possibility it might be a virus or malware or something - and I must say, I am very disappoint by the responses so far. I really hate to be that guy, but I'm just
 so frustrated and I want to know what process is causing those files to appear on my system, for crying out louuuuuuud!

            <p>This is a Microsoft Community for consumer users&nbsp;manned by other consumers and occasionally visited by Microsoft first level support, so technical questions will never get the best response here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned the file is obviously created by Norton, so&nbsp;Symantec would be the best place to get more detailed information regarding their applications.&nbsp; Your own research already shows that the files are created as part of an "IPS Statistical Submission",
 so going there to ask what these are for would be an obvious direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those here are most familiar with Microsoft security products and even then would only typically know the basics, so ranting here about lack of knowledge relating to 3rd-party products only shows your own ignorance of these simple facts.</p>

<h2>            Quick Info not working</h2>
                    Quick Info has suddenly stopped working in Office 2007 VBA (all office programs). I have Auto Quick Info ticked, but don't now get the automatic prompts nor anything when I press the Quick Info button. Everything else seems normal. Any ideas?

            That's not a good sign, it indicates your installation may be in worse shape than the Quick Info problem alone might suggest. It's a judgement call as to whether you want to get as much mileage as you can out of you existing installation, or bite the bullet
 and do an uninstall/reinstall now. If you choose the latter route, ensure you back up any customizations you've done first.

<h2>            Computer issue is out of my control.</h2>
                    <p>Hello now I never thought this would happen to me but my computer is now unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OS will automatically update itself and install new software even make changes, this to me is completely stupid and not a safe thing to do but that's just me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This to me screams Zombie Virus, Zombies are caused by hackers and Trojans but the issue/attacker is Microsofts updates&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer wont display properly I tried to change the drivers and uninstall them. Windows 10 uses the Engineering drivers that kept installing themselves and I always noticed problems with them I always tried to remove them but they kept coming back so
 I decided "With poor confidence" to deal with them, I tried to do some trouble shooting but I just cant the screen is flashing and colors/pixelated pinstripes keep flashing I tried to do changes with the screen doing this but I got sick the flashing makes
 me feel woozied I almost felt like throwing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the computer on now to see if a live update goes on and finally fixes this nonsense cause I have no other idea what to do I'm to afraid to lose my data I have important data on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stuck using my old HP Mini till I figure something out and whats funny is this Laptop is also using Windows 10 so this confirms a GPUd river issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clue what to do? Or is it possible its my GPU that finally gave up on me? I'm seriously lost here.</p>

            <p>Ok i dont know how to thank you but THANK YOU!!!!! I MEAN THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was close to throwing out my Lenovo PC but i saw your post and it gave me a idea, first let me just say your suggestion did not really solve it because no such flash software for my PC was available at all and because flashing a BIOS was the last thing
 i wanted to do because its a scary thing to do if done wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i did was i remembered what i did wiht my old Gateway 32bit PC that had a picture problem and nothing was being drawn i used the CMOS Jumper and fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this PC it was really hard to take out the jumper cause its so close to the metal casing and i just couldnt get it out safely or properly and i remembered the battery so while i brought the PC back to my attention the first thing i did was remove the
 battery and installed the RAM back and following the GPU after that was done i inserted the battery back in and i was amazed that my computer finally started to work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thank you for the post this saved me from buying another PC and its running great again.</p>

<h2>            Our email address was hacked and is now blocked from sending messages.</h2>
                    
<p>We currently use Microsoft Outlook 2010 to email with "incoming server ( POP3) 995" and "outgoing server (SMTP) 587".</p>
<p>Our email was hacked on Monday and has been sending out mass spam, some of which has bounced back undelivered. &nbsp;We have done a full scan on the PC and a malware scan and removed a couple of issues. &nbsp;We have changed passwords to increase our security. &nbsp;But
 now, we can not send any mail from this email address to any body without it bouncing back with the following message...</p>
<p><b>"Delivery has failed to these recipients or groups:</b></p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
Your message couldn't be delivered because you weren't recognized as a valid sender. The most common reason for this is that your email address is suspected of sending spam and it's no longer allowed to send messages outside of your organization. Contact your

<p>The email address is able to send emails to the other email account linked with the company (both are @btconnect.com) and that email address is completely unaffected to be able to send external emails without issue. &nbsp;Both email addresses are receiving emails.
 &nbsp;I spent yesterday on the telephone with BT who were not able to resolve the issue and suggested I contacted Microsoft. We tried sending emails directly from the 'BT Business Office 365 site access' but had the same non-delivery message.</p>
<p>I can private message you with exact NDR information if you need.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 950 Dual SIM - reception indicator changing from LTE to 4G</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have Lumia 950 Dual SIM. Reception status indicator changes and sometimes 4G, while other time it shows LTE. I know that technically it is the same technology, but that inconsistency is frustrating. Does anyone know the reason of this and also how can
 I rectify this bug?</p>

            Hi! The connection that you will have in your phone depends on the signal strength you're receiving from your network provider. Have you tried asking them if there's an issue with their service? You may try rebooting your phone and see if it helps. ^___^

            <p>Hi Kim!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you misunderstood the question a little bit. I know that 4G=LTE. And I have consistent signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that sometimes it is 4G and sometimes (after reboot or operator settings SIM update) LTE. I would like to force it to be LTE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that depending on market these indicators are used interchangeably (i.e. Poland has LTE while UK has 4G).</p>

            <p>The mobile operator may configure how the connection icons are displayed.<br />
Currently, in my country, Voice over LTE is work-in-progress and may only be available on some select cell towers, and with a small selection of phones.<br />
- Does the phone stay on LTE if you make a phone call when it displays LTE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specific connection type and the display of connection icons cannot be controlled in the handset settings, so it's good advise to consult the mobile operator. There is usually a news section or a blog on their website regarding their LTE plans and progress.</p>

            <p>Dear Hans!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. However, again, this is not quite what I meant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is not related to the operator's coverage in any way. This is the system bug/(feature) that causes the indicator to show sometimes 4G and other times LTE. When the SIM is inserted into PL country variant phone it shows LTE. While the same SIM is
 inserted in the same location to UK CV it shows 4G. However my DUAL SIM handset keeps changing the LTE to 4G and vice versa. This happens i.e. after&nbsp;I change SIM and phone prompts me to reboot it in order to apply settings. After the phone is rebooted the
 indicator changes.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not consider the scenario with multiple phones. In this situation, similar phones come with different firmware for each intended market. I would guess one phone is updated to be VoLTE capable and the other one not yet.<br />
This is why I asked, if the phone stays on LTE when making a phone call?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the Dual-SIM phone, please keep in mind that only (any) one of the two SIM slots can be used for high-speed 3G/4G, while the other is 2G only.<br />
The correct LTE settings for the specific operator is fetched from the SIM and may require a restart to apply. It should however not revert back to the default settings unless maybe if the other SIM also is used for data - or if you have found a Dual-SIM specific
 software bug.<br />

            <p>So AT&amp;T has announced the end of 2G by end of&nbsp;2016.&nbsp; If our 2nd SIM is on AT&amp;T,&nbsp;at that time if the 2nd SIM can only connect to 2G, in less than 1 yr is our phone crippled?&nbsp; I understand why 2 LTE connections would not be made, but why can't the 2nd SIM
 (non Data)&nbsp;connect to best connection available, but only use voice side?&nbsp; Is this a hardware limitation or OS?</p>

            That's actually a good question - I have experienced that when roaming in Japan. They scrapped their 2G years ago.

            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The forum users concluded the 2G-only secondary SIM in Lumia dual SIM phones is a hardware restriction. - I'm not aware of any official communication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be stated on the box, and in the user manual, of course.</p>

<p>Hi Steve, I just tested the entire process. I am using windows 7, Office 2010 and MySQL</p>
<p>Create a new db, add&nbsp;an odbc table, create a query and a form, open both.</p>
<p>Then I went into mysql query browser and rename my table.</p>
<p>On Office:</p>
<p>I delete the table, link it again (with the new Name), renamed it (To the Old Name)&nbsp;and opened my queires and forms. Everything works fine.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

I hope this helps, Bre-x Just a regular user, not an expert

</p><p>What I do before installing a new build is copy the .esd &nbsp;installer out of the WU download C:\ $Windows.~BT\sources folder to a named folder outside of the windows insider build you never know when you may need it for &nbsp;clean install or an update install&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I had to do a clean install of 14332 after the WU instal blew up . ( that was just the last time I needed current install media )&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
You will need the ESD to ISO decrypter .zip &nbsp;to make a DVD or USB boot media . after you
 extract the decryption tool zip file just put the decrypter and ESD in a named folder and execute the decrypter &nbsp;and your ISO will show in there .<br />

            <p><strong>RIGHT &nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;AFAIK That's like the one ( * exactly similar to what I been using ) at the<strong> MS &nbsp;One drive link&nbsp;</strong>I posted earlier presumably they keep it updated and it works fine .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I used it on <strong>14332. rs1</strong> on 6 May 2016 &nbsp;for a clean reinstall when the WU install blew up but I have the updated 14.7 .zip also from a 10 forums link I've used that
<strong>14.7z </strong>&nbsp;also on <strong>14328</strong><strong> .rs1</strong> to archive a recent ISO when the
<strong>143328</strong> WU download ESD came in and it worked .&amp; on prior clean installs &nbsp;from ESD 's . I keep maybe 3 recent ISO or ESD unless we get a turd then I toss it ☺</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My understanding is the last update to <strong>14.7z</strong> was DEC '15 or JAN '16 same as the githubgus33000/ESD-Decrypter file @ the &nbsp;link above at least thats true @ the 10 forum link but the github download was easy *as long as you watch for the correct
 named file on the lists ☺&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Is it possible to specifically define a collapsible endpoint&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kp garrett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to specifically define a collapsible endpoint&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been hunting the web for answers to this and have not found anything of genuine help. I'm trying to create a sub-section of a parent section that collapses the code samples so they don't clutter the readable portion of the document -- something akin
 to the "spoiler" sections inside a forum post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the layout for visual reference:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1" style="margin-left: 60px">1) HEADER1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 60px">Text explaining this section and the purpose of the code.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="margin-left: 90px">a) SUBHEADER1</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 120px">Code sample for SUBHEADER1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="margin-left: 90px">b) SUBHEADER2</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 120px">Code sample for SUBHEADER2</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">Text wrapping up the section with additional notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1" style="margin-left: 60px">2) HEADER2</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">Same structure as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1" style="margin-left: 60px">3) HEADER3</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">And so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now using the header styles this mostly works nicely, except for one problem: SUBHEADER2 seeks to include everything up to the next header in its collapse field. So the wrap-up text illustrated above also hides when collapsing SUBHEADER2. Functionally speaking
 this means that if you collapse the code sample from SUBHEADER2, you don't get to see the additional notes that follow-up the code sample.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This order of readability is very important for the doc I'm creating, so I can't accept the current behavior. Is there a way to manually set a header style's collapsible endpoint? Can I force Word to collapse only the code sample under SUBHEADER2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there another way I should be going about this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            Insert a new paragraph between the end of the code for Subheader2 and the start of the wrap-up text. Format it with the same header style as the subheaders, don't put any text in the paragraph, and format the paragraph mark as 1 or 2 pt font size so there's
 no extra space.

            <p>Thanks, Jay. I've successfully done this as a work-around before, but it seemed odd to me that I would have to jimmy-rig my doc so much when the collapse functionality should be able to handle this level of customization. My question was definitely pointed
 more at the use of the existing functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of that, as a header style, that silly arrow still shows up when the mouse hovers over that blank line, so it's also not really ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But your suggestion certainly works technically speaking and, if it ends up being the only thing I can do, well, I'll be doing it.</p>

            <p>Try this:</p>
<p>Open the Styles pane (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+A). Click on the New Style button at the bottom left.</p>
<p>Now look at the screen cap: Give the style a name, and then click on Format, Paragraph.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7cdde75a-5d8e-49ad-8c57-cc984baa51a9" /></p>
<p>Then in the paragraph dialog, Set the outline level to 2:</p>

<p>Does that help?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for all the extra effort to illustrate it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it seems like this does almost exactly what Jay's suggestion does. It definitely works in that SUBHEADER2 excludes this paragraph when it collapses, but it leaves those collapse arrows on the text block in question. If that block ends up being multiple
 paragraphs, all the paragraphs have collapse arrows on them. Apparently the outline level is exactly what is set in all the header styles in order to tell the collapse functionality what to include and exclude in the collapse.</p>

            <p>Well yes, it would look more or less the same.</p>
<p>But I try to avoid empty paragraphs in a document if I can help it.</p>
<p>For example, I would assume that you have the Keep with Next setting on in the subheader style (you should), so if you format the "spacer" paragraph with the same style as Jay suggests, it will stick to the additional notes paragraph (which is not a problem).
 But that would push that next additional notes&nbsp;paragraph slightly down if it were at the top of a page. Since it's formatted only 1 or 2 pt, it's not big, but I would notice it. I suppose I'm too perfectionist about things like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, it's a lot of manual work if you have to do many of them, since you have to apply the style, and then change the font size, each time. With my solution, you only apply the style each time (thus half the amount of work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, if you make changes to the style, you could (not necessarily, but could) lose that extra point size setting, so there is always this "issue" lurking in the background which I don't like.</p>

            <p>I agree with your points but I didn't mean to imply both solutions had identical outcomes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary reason both solutions are so similar is they both end up putting the collapse arrow in a place it doesn't belong. As far as I can tell these arrows don't functionally collapse anything, but every single one of these wrap-up paragraphs will have
 the arrows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a look at this image I created to illustrate the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a86a54c-23b5-462d-99ed-98afb865ecea" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, the collapse arrows show up on the left of each paragraph, even though these are not really headers. That appears to be because the outline level option you mentioned is precisely how the collapse logic figures out what style to add the collapse
 functionality to. anything set as "body text" doesn't have any collapse functionality, but all the outline layer levels do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Granted, this looks worse than the doc because the arrows only show up when you hover over the paragraph with the cursor; I pieced the image together to more clearly illustrate what this looks like. But even if you don't hover over the text and reveal the
 arrows, there's another issue this solution creates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see on the lefthand side, in the Navigation pane, each of these paragraphs is being counted as a header in the outline. Even though they are not intended to be headers, using any form of the header style solution causes Word to treat the text
 like headers, and that's just not the way I want to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arguably I could leave the one-blank-paragraph concept to keep text out of the nav outline, but that's still not ideal, because it does insert a blank space in the outline that is fully functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I really hope to figure out is how to tell Word where the endpoint of the collapsible text block is. Maybe it has to be in VBScript, or as a macro somehow, or has to use fields, or is deep in developer mode. But there has to be a way to define that
 endpoint -- somewhere.</p>

                    <p>I understand that for Homegroup to function both PC (two on the network) need to have IE 11 as their default browser (is this correct?).&nbsp; All attempts to do this fail as IE does not appear as an option when selecting the default browser.&nbsp; I realise that

<p>My thanks for that. &nbsp;I did realise later that I had probably mis-read your intentions and went through what I thought was correct. &nbsp;Amusingly, Windows 10 insisted on an update/reconfigure with BOTH restarts which rather slowed things down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the course of all this, I discovered at Control Panel&gt;All Control Panel Items&gt;Default Programs&gt;Set Program Access &amp; Computer Defaults under the Custom radio button Chrome had been set as my default browser (no idea how!) and that was, apparently, the
 cause of my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE 11 is now my default browser and I can return to my original problem with Homegroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thanks to Coni GK, Don Varnau and the Cyber_Defend_Team for all their help. &nbsp;I will now close this thread (when I've found how) and start again with my Homegroup problem, which still persists.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dear Parry,</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>It is always a best practise to remove any previous office suites before proceeding with a new one so as to eliminate the collision of document opening in both the offices.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>However when ever the office 365 gets installed it bifurcates the office which is installed earlier thereby minimising&nbsp;the compatibility issues. However it is always recommend that you remove earlier version of office.</strong></em></p>
<p>

<h2>            OneNote App doesn&#180;t update after purchase of Office 365</h2>
                    


<p>i have an office 365 home subscription for more than a month now. trying to insert excel tables in onenote i´ve noticed that you can do it in different ways going to the insert tab and selecting excel worksheet, but it turns out i don´t have that option
 y my onenote app, and as a matter of fact i have less tabs too. the picture shows what tab´s i have. i think it hasn't updated to the onenote with full functionality after i subscribed to office 365, but i can´t find a way to do it. i´ve contacted the support
 and spoke with somebody that connected remotely to my mac but he didn't fixit.</p>
<p>how can i do to have the full functionality?</p>

<h2>            Emails Permanently deleted without reading.</h2>
                    
<p>Good Day All,</p>
<p>I have a user that has been missing emails, we asked another user who communicates with that user often to add a read receipt. When the user misses emails now, we found out that the read receipt says the email was deleted without it being read. The user
 says he never saw the email. Is there a way we can find a log or account for the emails that weren't seen by the user?</p>
<p>The emails aren't in Deleted Items. We are using Office365. The emails aren't online, there isn't an anit-virus add-on.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>

<p>There are lot of factors that can affect this. First of all, run a message trace, make sure that the message actually reached the recipient mailbox:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200712(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
technet.microsoft.com/.../jj200712(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>If you are certain it was received OK, run a eDiscovery search against the user mailbox (or simply use the Search-Mailbox cmdlet) to locate the message in the target mailbox. Even if it was deleted (either by the user, or a rule, or an app or whatever),
 it will be preserved for minimum of 14 days in a folder only accessible by administrators. More info for example here:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff660637(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
technet.microsoft.com/.../ff660637(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>Lastly, you can also turn on mailbox audit for Owner actions and then search the audit logs for details about the missing mail:

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for that ...but I think perhaps I'm asking the wrong question.</p>
<p>I can get into my MS account fine.....I have changed the password anyway...alls good there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There problem comes when I have been asked to update my Outlook passwords for the two charity email accounts....I don't remember the old passwords to be able to update them&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25a99757-183d-489e-a014-51f10dad376a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25a99757-183d-489e-a014-51f10dad376a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>this is a different password to the MS password.... and the one of the two I have forgotten.</p>

 I'm not missing something. I pay for the subscription</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
<br />
You may need to wake up the phone by performing a soft reset. To soft reset the phone, just press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time until the phone turns on.
<br />
<br />
Give us an update for the outcome. <br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

</p><p>We lost password for admin account of our Office 365 and person who registered it on his own mobile number and email is unreachable. How can we reset password then? We can control domain and DNS records themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Click Admin&gt;select Users.</p>
<p>3. Select the account which forget password&gt;click reset password.</p>

<p><span>Hello Ilya,</span><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am working on this thread. From your description, we understand the password of your Office 365 for Business tenant admin credential has been lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, in our tenant, the Global admin can reset the password for any Office 365 account. However, as you mentioned above, there is only one admin account on your organization. May I know if it
 means there is only one admin account under your Office 365 tenant?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, please try the steps described in the article to reset the password on your side:</p>
<p><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/37413.o365-admin-password-recovery-options.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/37413.o365-admin-password-recovery-options.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, please contact with the global admin for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, If you still can't reset the password on your side, we'd like to collect the following information to check it on our backend:</p>

<p>Hello Ilya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You provide us the right screenshot about Office 365 subscription. However, it shows that you are using
<strong>Office 365 Business </strong>Subscription, not the <strong>Office 365 Business Premium</strong> Subscription.&nbsp;Please see:

            Sorry, my mistake, looks like it was Business till now but we bought 17 new licenses Business Premium and want to activate them, already have Microsoft Online Services Activation email.
