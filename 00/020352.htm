            <p>There seems to be something wrong with your Mac's file system, as you would not be having this problem if Mac OS were OK - especially if you did a complete reinstall of Office and re-ran the Mac OS X update.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Did you run Disk Utility to Repair permissions? &nbsp;If not, do that.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Have you done anything that might affect your OS - haxies? Anti-Virus? Disable those.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Try installing in safe mode (hold the Shift key down while booting). If that fails, I'd run something like DriveGenuis or DiskWarrior. Still Fails? Then back up all your files to external media, wipe the drive and start over.</p>

<p>You have been a community member for a long time. You have been an insider for a long time. But you don't tell us what build you are on? What your computer specs are? What you have tried? How long it has lasted? Do you get an error report. Have you posted
 in Feedback Hub?&nbsp;In fact you haven't actually asked a question..? It's a beta version, some things don't work.</p>

            <p>How rude to address me is such a manner!</p>
<p>I am on 14379, the problem started with the previous build. Do I need to tell you what build that was? Since I've been an insider "for a long time," it would be safe to assume that I had the latest build.</p>
<p>I have a SP3 i7 4650U CPU @ 1.7GHz 2.30GHz, 8GB RAM 64-Bit OS Windows 10 Pro. I told you what I tried if you bothered to read it. No error message or I would have said so. I also told you that it was a Microsoft bluetooth mouse.</p>
<p>Yes, I posted in the Feedback Hub, with both builds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't think I needed to put a ? at the end of my post. Guess some people are just daft!</p>
<p>I know it's a beta version and that some things don't work, after all, I've been a community member and an insider "for a long time." Posting it here was to seek an answer since we don't get one from the Hub. Do you have an answer?</p>
<p>How does it feel to be talked down to? Some of your own medicine, Huh D-D?</p>
<p>Next time, and I hope there isn't a next time, try a little tack instead of tackyness.</p>
<p>How's that for a question?</p>

            Suggestion check with Surface support site [<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Click Here</strong>]</a>&nbsp; for the newest drivers, sorry if you think I'm jumping in but I have had a few people
 using Surface devices didn't even know about the support site, and I only posted to you as in your posting you don't mention anything about updating drivers. keep on testing.&nbsp;

            Thanks, Joe. I did check for updated drivers, I even deleted the drivers and rebooted, which reloaded the latest drivers. I appreciate your response, at least it addressed my issue and wasn't curt.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, we apologize for any inconvenience that you face due to the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say that, you have the latest drivers installed in your computer system, do you mean that you have the latest drivers for both Mouse driver and the generic Bluetooth drivers and also the latest USB drivers installed in your computer system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you connect the wireless Bluetooth mouse to your surface pro and then use it and after some time it automatically disconnects and then to reconnect it again, you have to use the settings. This behavior in your system, could be due to some
 internal software conflicts. Hence, as of now, please try running a clean boot and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in</span><strong><span>Clean Boot
</span></strong><span>state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>DISCLAIMER:
</span></strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</span></span></p>

    <title>Changes on mobile devices not updating Outlook.com calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roberd21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changes on mobile devices not updating Outlook.com calendar</h2>
                    <p>I realise a similar issue was reporting last year in the forums . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of a few days ago, any events created or amended on my mobile devices (Nexus 7 and HTC Touch HD Windows Mobile 6.1 - yes, I know it is ancient) fail to update my Outlook.com calendar. Changes and amendments initiated from my desktop PC using Outlook&nbsp;
 and the Outlook Connector sync correctly to Outlook.com and sync down to the mobile&nbsp;devices without a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to avoid using the Android Outlook app to create and amend events for some time due to rolling issues (free/busy time and timezone problems - events appear on the Nexus as Azerbaijan time instead of Gulf Standard time despite all the devices
 and calendars being set to GST; I think it is a bus in the Android app), so I have used Outlook.com as the master for some months.&nbsp; The HTC worked perfectly until a few days ago.&nbsp; Outlook Connector from the desktop PC continues to work perfectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried resetting the HTC but without any benefit.&nbsp; I have also recreated the connection on the desktop PC in the hope that that might solve the problems on the mobile devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most annoying that I have to remember the events I create while out and about so that I can recreate them when&nbsp;I get back to the PC.</p>

            <p>Okay, this is getting more complicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reset pretty much everything yesterday after I noticed that I hade not received any email on the PC despite the emails lying in my Outlook.com account. Nexus was retreiving them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seemed to right things again and I was able to update the calendar from my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as soon as I plugged the phone into the PC using the USB connection to re-sync my Notes and Tasks from the phone (the reset of the PC had obviously wiped these and Outlook.com doesn't support Notes or Tasks&nbsp;- WHY NOT?!), it knocked over the calendar
 and email is not longer being retreived by the PC.&nbsp; Again, as before, I can send, just can't receive email on the PC, the calendar update problem has represented itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I am now guessing that something has been changed and it impacts Activesync when run from a PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help or insights to solve the problem would be appreciated.</p>

I didn't think of that one.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do have some BING alerts supposedly registered but I always use Fullscreen mode (with Auto-Hide off) so I never see the BING bar anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows what that combination does?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> adcjones  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to begin page numbers at 1 on a different page other than the actual page 1</h2>
                    This is becoming a real pain and is more difficult than it should be.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a document that is over 400 pages. &nbsp;The first 3 pages are title pages and a blank page. &nbsp;i want the actual numbering to being at "1" on the page where the text begins, which is on the actual page 4 of the document.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Clicking the box for "Different First Page" merely takes it away from page 1 and makes the actual page 2 "1"...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I see no option whatsoever for formatting that I want "1" to begin on actual page 4.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The same goes for a header I would like to add. &nbsp;I don't see the option to make it NOT APPEAR on the first 3 pages!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help, this is very frustrating. &nbsp;I have been very adept up until now at Word, but this new Word 2010 is giving me fits.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me help you rectify the issue about not being able to view and/or sent an attachment while using your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to verify if the issue happened when&nbsp;accessing your account through the web or on a mail client like Windows Live Mail. If the issue&nbsp;was while web-based Outlook.com was being used, we need to gather the following details to be able to start
 our investigation:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
If the issue happened on a mail client specifically Windows Live Mail, may we know if you get an error code or error message when trying to open the attachment? Do you encounter the issue on a specific file type? Were you unable to download or view the attachment
 when using a different computer?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will wait for your response.</p>

<p>Now, I am using outlook which was switched&nbsp;to from previous Hotmail couple of months ago. I could not receive the emails with a little large size attachment. Like today, I received a email with a 200 kB size attachment, but the other emails with larger attachment
 were rejected per other people's messages &nbsp;who tried to send me attachment. One more thing, it is supposed to have record in "sent" every time emails were sent, but now, there is no record at all when I sent out emails with attachment and I did see records
 after&nbsp;I sent emails without attachment. </p>

            Hotmail.&nbsp; I actually pay for additional storage on hotmail and realized that I was over on my storage capacity.&nbsp; That solved some of my problem.&nbsp; But...I still can not access my account at all from internet explorer 10, and am only receiving some of my
 emails on hotmail.&nbsp; I checked my business webserver today that is forwarding to my hotmail account and realized that 2 hours ago emails without attachments were sent to me that did not open in my hotmail inbox or in my junkmail which I check regularly.<br />
<br />
I will note that I did just do a microsoft service pack update.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that you've finally figured out the cause why you weren't able to send emails with attachments and this was due to full mailbox storage which you've already remedied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your issue with accessing your account through Internet Explorer 10, please explain the behavior. Does it freeze up on you? Do you get an error message? You may attempt to optimize your browser through this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/internet-explorer/slow-five-tips-to-boost-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>then try it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mentioned: " ...emails without attachments were sent to me that did not open in my hotmail inbox or in my junkmail which I check regularly."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this mean you cannot open/view these email messages? Please clarify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to us. It's good to know that you can now access your account in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we would need more details on how you cannot open or access your contacts. Kindly answer the following questions for us to isolate the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried to optimize your browser and check if you can access your contacts in
<a href="https://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://people.live.com</a>?</li><li>Are you receiving any error message when accessing your contacts? If yes, what is the exact error message you encounter?</li><li>Provide us a description of your People page when you access it like if contacts does not appear when you login to People page, blank page, page freeze, etc.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be waiting for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Judith</p>

<h2>            Different headers on every page</h2>
                    <p>How do I insert different headers on every page in a 1000+ page manuscript?</p>
<p>It's not just even/odd headers, but different text on every page.</p>
<p>Word 2010</p>
<p>Problems:&nbsp; (1) When I insert a section break at the bottom of each page, the line of text is no longer justified to the right margin.&nbsp; (2) When I insert a new header on each page (yes, I am clicking Link to Previous),&nbsp;the preceding header changes; consequently
 I am inserting the headers twice for every page.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Can someone please help?&nbsp; Thanks, Patty</p>

<h2>            HELP&#33; Outlook is sending random links to people&#33;</h2>
                    Okay, so i have two basic accounts, one where things like social media is linked up to and my close (school) friends have, another is one i use for work, school, ect.. &nbsp;both of these emails are attached to each other using my phone (Samsung Glaxey S2).
 I got an e-mail from someone asking me if i had sent them this random link, or if it was spam. Thankful she has because it made me do some digging and after I had found out that this has been sent to anyone that e-mailed me on any one of my accounts and its
 been ongoing for about two months!!!! i don't know if it is my phone that has a virus, or the e-mail app its self being hacked, i read up on how to reset your email, but i don't see how that would help. The last message was sent on the 27, and if it follows
 th same pattern, it will most likely happen again in a week or two. This is a HUGE problem for me, because the link is being sent to people from collages, work, teachers ect.. all its quite embarrassing, plus it might mean that someone else is n my accounts,
 seeing ill my stuff. The main way i use my e-mail to is from my phone as i don't always have my laptop with me, so its something i would really like fixed and fast!!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please HELP!!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&lt;added&gt;</div>
<div>i have deleted the E-mails from my phone, and i am almost scared to download the Outlook app. because I am still unaware if 1. its even my phone and 2. if its the e-mail app its self or just my phone.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>also i have done a virus sweep on my laptop, there is nothing showing up!</div>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Sorry for the delayed response.<br />
<br />
<br />
<font>There's a possibility that your account is hacked/hijacked. We strongly recommend that you attempt changing your password immediately:
<br />
<br />
1. To change your Hotmail password, sign in to https://account.live.com.<br />
2. Select the <b>Change</b> option next to <b>Password</b>. Or if you want a direct link, you can go directly to the
<b>Change Password Page</b>. </font><br />
<br />
<font>It is important to ensure a strong password to prevent future risks to your account, and to change passwords at regular intervals.<br />
<br />
</font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Feel free to reply back here for further clarification or create a new post if you have any other concern.<br />
<br />
</span>Thank you<br />

<p>
</p><p>FWIW, I do hope you realize that Office 2008 is out of production, obsolete &amp; no longer supported. In the opinion of many it also is one of the poorest releases of Mac Office &amp; has no support for Macros/VBA. Although much of what you may learn can be applied
 in other versions of the software, rather than investing time &amp; money on it specifically you might want to consider moving up to Office 2011. It is far more capable, far more stable, supports Macros/VBA, etc. It is the most current release so it is fully supported
 &amp; most likely will be for at least 2 years beyond the release of the next version. Also, there are free tutorials &amp; videos available from Microsoft on current product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If money is an issue it may be worth your while to consider an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Home Premium</a> subscription which can be paid monthly or annually. It provides a local installation of Office 2011, enables use on multiple computers, access to many additional online services as well as automatic upgrade to the next release.</p>

<br />Sorry that solution was not successful. Is possible you might have deleted the conversation? Were you able to sign into Skype for Web to see if the conversation is still there?

<h2>            Document Recovery on Word Mobile</h2>
                    I am asking this for my sister. She uses Word Mobile on her laptop to do her school report but there were some trouble saving her document and the Word Mobile closes. When she opens it again, the file can be found under the Recent place but could not manage
 to open the document. It states that it has been replace or removed. I have Googled but all I can do is find her document here AppData &gt; Roaming &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; Recent Items. Its file type is a shortcut. Whenever I tried opening it, I can't. Says it's
 unavailable. Tried changing its properties but nothing works. Is there another way for me to retrieve this file?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that the file you are trying to access is stored on a flash drive that is no longer connected to your mobile, or because the file was saved in a format that is not supported in Word. To narrow down the issue, we'd like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What are the exact error messages?<br />
</li><li>Are you able to open other Word files?<br />
</li><li>Where is this file stored?</li><li>Have you tried opening the item from its original location instead of opening it from Recent items/folder?</li><li>What is the file type of the document (i.e. .docx, .dotx, .dot)?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>How can I use VBA evaluate on a weeknum calculation with variable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rick_849  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I use VBA evaluate on  a weeknum calculation with variable rownumbers</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I stubled accross this challenge:<br />
<br />
I am trying to use vba evaluate function to put weeknumber data in a specific row.<br />
<br />
All data concerned is on the active worksheet.<br />
<br />
Code that I use looks like this:<br />
<br />
Range("w2").Activate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Worksheets("Datasheet")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For RwNr = 2 To .Range("U:U").Cells.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeConstants).Count<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Cells(RwNr, 23).Value = Evaluate("=WEEKNUM(" &amp; .Cells(i, 21).Value &amp; ";2)")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next RwNr<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
<br />
This keeps coming up with a #VALUE! error. When I enter the function directly into excel, it does work.<br />
When I change the function in VBA into a simple SUM, it works.<br />
I have tried changing the ";" in the weeknum formula into ",", but this gives a #NUM error.<br />
<br />
Data used in column 21 is a date, in european format (dd-mm-yy), which as I mentioned, is no problem when using the normal excel formula weeknum.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any ideas how i can solve this?<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The variable i in your code isn't initialised or incremented so that's one source of an error. The other is the use of .cells( when using evaluate. The formula is expecting an address. Try it like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dim RwNr As Long<br />
With Worksheets("Datasheet")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For RwNr = 2 To .Range("U:U").Cells.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeConstants).Count<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Cells(RwNr, 23).Value = Evaluate("=WEEKNUM(" &amp; .Cells(RwNr, 21).Address &amp; ",2)")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next RwNr<br />
End With</p>
