<h2>            No Safe to Remove Hardware icon after synching Samsung Omnia II</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I recently purchased a Samsung Omnia II and have not had any problems synching it with Vista 64 and WMDC 6.1. However, I never see the "Safe to Remove Hardware" icon. I've just been unplugging it since I can't find the icon or any eject options anywhere
 as I do when connecting other devices in a USB port. I don't find anything anywhere that tells me if I should or shouldn't have to do anything to safely remove this device.</p>
<p>So far I don't think this has caused any problems, but I am concerned that I could be creating one that will raise it's ugly head in the future.&nbsp;Should I be seeing the Safe to Remove icon and, if so, how can I get it do display?</p>

            I've never seen that message either and don't think you'll ever see that message.&nbsp; When syncing is completed, you can just remove the device without potentially causing any problems.

<p>Hi Wilson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the steps in this article to check if the error exists:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2797062/-microsoft-office-cannot-verify-the-license-for-this-product-error-whe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"Microsoft Office cannot verify the license for this product" error when you start an Office app</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the error persists, I would like to confirm the information below for further investigation:</p>
<p>1.Where did you install and download Office?</p>
<p>2.Whe does the error begin to appear? Does it prompt when you are trying to open an Office application at the first time after you install Office? If it appear previously, what actions did you perform
 before the sudden change?</p>
<p>3.Does it happen to all Office applications?</p>
<p>4.Which Office 365 product are you using? You can go to Control panel&gt;programs and features to check this.</p>
<p>5.A screenshot of the error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Best way for recording yes&#47;no answers in questionairre - tick boxes&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>I'm recording audit checklists for our firm. It has 23 questions with compliant/non-compliant options as answers (yes/no basically).</p>
<p>I set up my tables and forms by listing all 23 questions so the clerks can tick/untick the boxes for each question on each questionaire according to the results of the audit. I have added tick boxes for each question where tick represents Yes (or Compliant)
 and untick represents No (or non-compliant) outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The basic fields in my main data collecting table are:</p>
<p>Name (from linked table)</p>
<p>Department (from linked table)</p>
<p>Q1</p>
<p>Q2</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>Q23</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to be able to report on basics, such as number of non-compliance per person; how many non-compliance we had all together; or which questions have the highest non-complinace, etc. But I cannot seem to crack a simple query to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I wonder: Have I made a mistake using tick boxes&nbsp;for each 23 questions? Is there a better way of recording this kind of information? If yes, how can I convert over 500 records with 23 question each into a better form of showing yes/no answer?
</p>
<p>Or if I can keep the tick boxes, how can I build basic reports and queries to answer those simple questions above?</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated - I'm on a tight deadline........</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>KZF</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Firstly. don't despair as you read this; there's a get out of jail card at the end.<br />
<br />
You've made a very common mistake, I'm afraid, which is to do what is known as 'encoding data as column headings'.&nbsp; A fundamental principle of the database relational model is the Information Principle.&nbsp; This requires that all data be stored as values at column
 positions in rows in tables, and in no other way.&nbsp;&nbsp; In your case each column represents a data value, the question.&nbsp; The correct design is to have multiple rows per question in a related table, so the model would be made up of tables like this:<br />
<br />
Employees<br />
....EmployeeID (PK)<br />
....FirstName<br />
....LastName<br />
....DepartmentID<br />
....etc<br />
<br />
Departments<br />
....DepartmentID (PK)<br />
....Department<br />
<br />
Questions<br />
....QuestionID (PK)<br />
....Question<br />
....QusesionIndex<br />
<br />
The QuestionIndex column is simply to determine which order you want the questions presented in and would have values from 1 upwards.<br />
<br />
ResponseSessions<br />
....ResponseSessionID (PK)<br />
....ResponseSessionDate<br />
....EmployeeID (FK)<br />
<br />
Responses<br />
....ResponseSessionID (FK)<br />
....QuestionID (FK)<br />
....Response<br />
<br />
The primary key of this table is a composite one made up of the ResponseSessionID and QuestionID columns.&nbsp; The Response column would be of a Boolean (Yes/No) data type<br />
<br />
For data entry you'd use a form in single form view based on the ResponseSessions<br />
table with a text box control for the ResponseSessionDate and a combo box for the EmployeeID, set up in the usual way to show the employee's name's and department:<br />
<br />
ControlSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EmployeeID<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName &amp; " " &amp; LastName, Department&nbsp; FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm;3cm;3cm<br />
ListWidth: 6cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert them.&nbsp; The important thing is that the first dimension of the ColumnWidths property&nbsp; is zero to hide the first column.&nbsp; The ListWidth is the sum of the ColumnWidths
 dimensions.<br />
<br />
Within the form would be a subform, in continuous forms view, linked to the parent form on ResponseSessionID and based on the following query:<br />
<br />
SELECT Responses.*<br />
FROM Responses INNER JOIN Questions <br />
ON Responses.QuestionID = Questions.QuestionID<br />
ORDER BY QuestionIndex;<br />
<br />
In the subform would be a combo box bound to the QuestionID&nbsp; column and a check box bound to the Response column.<br />
<br />
As you want all questions answered you can automatically fill the subform as soon as a new row is inserted into the ResponseSessions table in the parent form by outing the following code in its AfterInsert event procedure;<br />
<br />
Dim strSQL As String<br />
<br />
strSQL = "INSERT INTO Responses(ResponseSessionID, QuestionID) " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "SELECT " &amp; Me.ResponseSessionID &amp; ", QuestionID " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "FROM Questions"<br />
<br />
' insert rows into Responses for each question and current response session<br />
CurrentDb.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError<br />
<br />
' requery subform to show new rows<br />
Me.[YourSubformControl].Requery<br />
<br />
Note that YourSubformControl is the name of the control in the parent form which houses the subform, not the name of its underlying form object, unless both have the same name of course.<br />
<br />
You can see an example of this sort of set-up in action in the file Traetments.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
This little demo file includes a means of automatically inserting a programme of treatments for a patient. Go to the Patient Treatments form from the opening menu and go to a new record; then select a patient, the rabies immunisation treatment, and a starting
 date in the parent form; then click the Create Treatment Programme button.&nbsp; You'll see that it inserts a set of rows into the subform ready for the date administered values to be entered for each.&nbsp; It's a little more complex than yours as it dates the treatments
 according to a predefined schedule, but essentially it does much the same as yours would.<br />
<br />
For transferring your current data to a new model as described above you'd first need to set up and fill all the tables bar the ResponseSessions and Responses tables.&nbsp; Then it gets a little trickier as you need to firstly insert rows into ResponseSessions (one
 per row of your current table)&nbsp; and then into Responses (one per row/column of your current table).&nbsp; The first is easy to do, the latter requires a UNION ALL query which brings all the questions and answers into two columns only.&nbsp; It's doable, but without
 knowing the full details of how your current table is structured I can't give you chapter and verse for the query to do this.<br />
<br />
If your deadline is imminent I think you might find it difficult to get the database correctly restructured in the time available.&nbsp; As a short term expedient you can create a UNION ALL query to work with:<br />
<br />
SELECT [Name], [Department], "Q1" AS Question, [Q1]<br />
FROM [YourCurrentTable]<br />
UNION ALL <br />
SELECT [Name], [Department], "Q2", [Q2]<br />
FROM [YourCurrentTable]<br />
UNION ALL <br />
SELECT [Name], [Department], "Q3", [Q3]<br />
FROM [YourCurrentTable]<br />
UNION ALL <br />
&lt; and so on&gt; to<br />
SELECT [Name], [Department], "Q23", [Q23]<br />
FROM [YourCurrentTable];<br />
<br />
This will give you result table in which the data is correctly represented as values at column positions in rows, not encoded as column headings.&nbsp; It's then a simple task to create queries based on the above query which aggregate the data for use as the RecordSource
 properties of reports.<br />
<br />
While this should enable you to get the results you want at present, I'd strongly recommend that you bite the bullet and restructure the database as a set of correctly normalized table as a longer term solution.

<p>Hi Ken</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would it be any way possible to give me more details about how to build this UNION ALL query you mentioned below?</p>
<p>I've been trying to read up on it, but it somehow it doesn't click into place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would it look like this - where AuditDate2012 is the table with all the info in it (although the PracticeGroupID and FeeEarnerID are coming from two other related tables)</p>
<p>SELECT AuditData2012.PracticeGroupID, AuditData2012.FeeEarnerID, AuditData2012.Q1<br />
FROM AuditData2012<br />
UNION ALL<br />
SELECT AuditData2012.PracticeGroupID, AuditData2012.FeeEarnerID, AuditData2012.Q2<br />
FROM AuditData2012<br />
UNION ALL</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>SELECT AuditData2012.PracticeGroupID, AuditData2012.FeeEarnerID, AuditData2012.Q23<br />
FROM AuditData2012<br />
UNION ALL<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to be such a simpleton - I've never done a UNION query before.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Krisztina</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If your deadline is imminent I think you might find it difficult to get the database correctly restructured in the time available.&nbsp; As a short term expedient you can create a UNION ALL query to work with:<br />
<br />
SELECT [Name], [Department], "Q1" AS Question, [Q1]<br />
FROM [YourCurrentTable]<br />
UNION ALL <br />
SELECT [Name], [Department], "Q2", [Q2]<br />
FROM [YourCurrentTable]<br />
UNION ALL <br />
SELECT [Name], [Department], "Q3", [Q3]<br />
FROM [YourCurrentTable]<br />
UNION ALL <br />
&lt; and so on&gt; to<br />
SELECT [Name], [Department], "Q23", [Q23]<br />
FROM [YourCurrentTable];<br />
<br />
This will give you result table in which the data is correctly represented as values at column positions in rows, not encoded as column headings.&nbsp; It's then a simple task to create queries based on the above query which aggregate the data for use as the RecordSource
 properties of reports.<br />
<br />
While this should enable you to get the results you want at present, I'd strongly recommend that you bite the bullet and restructure the database as a set of correctly normalized table as a longer term solution.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You need to include another column in the result set, with the Q1, Q2 etc column name as a constant string expression (wrapped in quotes) in each part of union operation.&nbsp; This will then identify which question the value in the Answer&nbsp;&nbsp; column relates
 to:<br />
<br />
SELECT PracticeGroupID, FeeEarnerID, "Q1" AS Question, Q1 AS Answer<br />
FROM AuditData2012<br />
UNION ALL<br />
SELECT PracticeGroupID, FeeEarnerID,"Q2", Q2<br />
FROM AuditData2012<br />
UNION ALL<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
SELECT PracticeGroupID, FeeEarnerID, "Q23", Q23<br />
FROM AuditData2012;<br />
<br />
The aliases for the column headings only need go in the first part, and the whole query is terminated with a semi-colon.<br />

            Unless this is a protected form, then, since it is unlikely that this is a trial version of Office 2007, the likelihood is that this is a retail version that has not been activated. Go to Office Button | Word Options | Resources and click Activate.

<p>
</p><p>I have seen several suggestions that all relate to earlier versions of hotmail or outlook.....In Windows 10, I do not have the functionalities taht many of the earlier versions of Hotmail had......Apparently, the lastest Outlook ( I have Windows 10) eliminated
 the icons or tabs to correct this problem.</p>

            As I noted, this request was never answered....there were ideas on earlier Windows versions and Hotmail releases but none specifically addressed either Windows 10 or the most recent Outlook version...I still have the same issue...I have Ad-free Outlook
 and yet I have a huge blank panel on the right side of my screen that obscures my in-box reading panel and therefore makes using the in-box inefficient and just a bother......not at all customer-friendly....

                    ==============================<br />
Environment at time of issue:<br />
==============================<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit&nbsp; SP1<br />
MS Office Professional Plus 2007 SP3<br />
<br />
last MS updates installed on 8/1/2015<br />
<br />
Have and HP Photosmart 4280 all-in-one printer.&nbsp; The driver date is 2009 and has been at that version for quite a while.<br />
<br />
No new software or software updates were installed to my knowledge<br />
<br />
The MS Office (windord) software had been working for several years and then as of 10/2/2015, started to get the following error message when launching<br />
MS word:<br />
<br />
**********************************************************************************************<br />
WINWORD.EXE - Application Error<br />
The application was unable to start correctly (0x80000003). Click OK to close the application.<br />
***********************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
I tried launching Excel and it started up OK, no error.<br />
<br />
I went through the list of office 2007 applications and tried to start the others.<br />
<br />
There were 5 that wouldn't start and threw the same application error (0x80000003) and message:<br />
mspub.exe<br />
winword.exe<br />
powerpnt.exe<br />
msaccess.exe<br />
outlook.exe<br />
<br />
There were 3 office applications that did start up and were not giving the above error:<br />
excel.exe<br />
infopath.exe<br />
msproject.exe<br />
<br />
I checked in OS application event viewer and found the following application error which first occurred on 10/2 (nothing prior to that date):<br />

What has been done attempting to resolve the issue:<br />
=====================================================<br />
<br />
I tried repairing MS Office 2007 via the Programs and Features selection in Control panel which ran for a bit but failed.<br />
<br />
I then did an online search for winword.exe faulting (0x80000003)<br />
<br />
Found this recommendation and followed all suggestions - still same error:<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-office_install/want-to-repair-microsoft-office-professional-2007/2f281855-367c-e011-9b4b-68b599b31bf5?auth=1<br />
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/928218<br />
<br />
So after completely uninstalling and reinstalling MS Office 2007 from scratch, still getting same error message for winword.<br />
<br />
Tried to launch winword in safe mode (winword.exe /a) but it failed with same error message.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ran Microsoft office diagnostics - it didn't find any issues.<br />
<br />
As of today, system is patched and current both for MS Office 2007 and windows 7 updates.<br />
<br />
Still getting same error.&nbsp;

 as of 10/31/2015, the issue had disappeared as mysteriously as it appeared.&nbsp; I am no longer getting the error message when opening MS Word or MS Word documents.&nbsp; As before, nothing had changed (to my knowledge) on the computer.&nbsp; The issue is resolved, cause

<h3> dennyfulmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            forward mail to phone &#40;outlook.com&#41; from desktop</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Windows phone with an outlook.com account.&nbsp; At work I have a desktop with Win 7 and Office 2010.&nbsp; I have installed the Hotmail connector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to&nbsp;get some of my desktop/business emails from specific Outlook 2010 contacts, &nbsp;on my Windows phone.&nbsp; In other words, I do not want to&nbsp;get all my business email on my phone, just from some of the people in my contact list.&nbsp; Should I set up a rule
 in my desktop outlook 2010&nbsp;to forward these emails to my outlook.com account, or is the a better way using the Hotmail connector to interact with my outlook account&nbsp;and get those emails to my phone??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Denny</p>

<p>My only email account&nbsp;that Office2010/Outlook on my pc&nbsp;uses&nbsp;is hosted by TimeWarner cable, and I use it all the time and it forwards messages without any problem.&nbsp; It is pop3&nbsp;type and my desktop office2010/outlook communicates directly with the Timewarner
 server, we do not have exchange server.&nbsp; It can forward email to anyone without problem (except outlook.com), including my gmail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked the "outlook.com" section of these bulletin boards why it wouldn't work and they told me to ask the "office" section how to get the internet headers of the bounce back email&nbsp;and send it to them.&nbsp; As explained in my Aug 23 post, the internet headers
 box is empty when I go to file/properties for the bounced back email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. How can I get the "internet headers" from the bounced back email (see Aug 23rd post)&nbsp;that the "outlook.com" people are requesting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Does the Hotmail connector interfere with forwarding to my Outlook.com mail box?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How best do I copy and paste from a Word doc into my email&#63;</h2>
                    My email server is Yahoo mail and it doesn't take a direct copy and paste without changing the formatting (especially hard returns and spaces). I have tried changing to a san serif font and deleting the first line indents but that's not any better. It's
 a long passage that I need to paste inside an email because the recipient will not accept an attachment. 30 pages is too long to type from scratch! Thanks for any help.

            I don't know anything about Yahoo mail, but in it, can you use Paste&gt;Special and paste as a picture?&nbsp; If not, use Paste&gt;Special to paste as a picture into another Word document and then copy the picture from that document and paste into into you email

Robert19, thanks for that idea, which seems a good one. I have tried it&nbsp;but found it the same&nbsp;as regular copy and paste, troubles and all. I suspect it's an incompatibility between&nbsp;Yahoo mail and Word. A friend with Gmail says she has no such troubles as other
 friends have confirmed.

            Doug, thanks for the idea. I've tried it now and can special paste inside a Word doc, but when I copy and paste it into Yahoo mail it goes wonky. Compatibility issues, I'm sure. Yahoo needs to wake up and make life easier for people trying to do business
 using their mail. Thanks much!

OK. My first reply disappeared when I hit "Helpful" before sending,&nbsp;so I'll write this again. Copy and special pasting into the clipboard and also separately into a new Word doc before pasting into email was no improvement. But you got me to tinkering and I
 tried copying and special pasting with retaining text only and that resulted in a paste job into email&nbsp;that I can manipulate better. It still arrives with extra space between paragraphs and some first-line indents do not arrive intact. Still, it's better than
 when the backspace and delete commands acted as a hard return (which they were doing before -- too frustrating!). So, thanks for getting me to experiment further.

            <p>You obviously have NOT followed my suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Paste&gt;Special&gt;Picture (Enhanced Metafile) to paste a picture of what you copied into a Word document, and then select that picture and copy it to the clipboard and then paste the picture into your email message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your version of Office 2103 includes Outlook, you can use Outlook as the interface for you Yahoo Mail Account by following the steps at:</p>

You obviously are NOT working with the Yahoo mail that I have courtesy of AT&amp;T UVerse.&nbsp;Your instruction of:&nbsp;Paste&gt;Special&gt;Picture (Enhanced Metafile) sent to clipboard then copied into a new Word doc then copied from that into email&nbsp;works as well as the Keep
 Text Only selection I tried,&nbsp;but requires more&nbsp;stages to&nbsp;accomplish. I have also tried a variation with Collect W/O Showing Office Clipboard. There are&nbsp;probably a couple of variations I haven't yet tried, but not many. In the CopyPasteSpecialPictureClipboardCopyPaste
 version, some of the formatting remains the same and some of it changes. I have been using Explorer to access Yahoo but might try Outlook as you have suggested.

<p><span>Here's an update, in case you run across this again. Though I have used Yahoo for years because it's part of our communications package, it is often awkward to work with. I have plenty of complaints
 about it.&nbsp;MS products have been&nbsp;reliable and productive.&nbsp;I've even used Word to format books for print production, so I was hopeful for&nbsp;a trick&nbsp;to&nbsp; help me accomplish the work I needed to do. I've spent hours in the attempt and have&nbsp;concluded that the problem
 is with Yahoo. It's outdated, or doesn't license the intellectual property&nbsp; it needs to remain compatible, or their development people don't care about productivity, or something.&nbsp;With the help of my niece's gmail account, I&nbsp;just this weekend&nbsp;performed a simple
 copy and paste of a Word doc into&nbsp;an outgoing email message. It worked perfectly whereas Yahoo stinks for that. I do thank you for your persistence in attempting to help me. I wish you had a large hammer to use on Yahoo&nbsp;and thereby improve the lives of humans
 everywhere.</span></p>

            <p>There is a separate Mac group</p>
<p>In MS Outlook the address book is simply a filtered view of Contacts that have an electronic address</p>
<p>What have you updated from? and is that all you did, simply purchased/installed 365? and didn't change/add an Outlook Profile?</p>
<p>In OL 2016 there is a sub-menu used to access contacts</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
Regarding “If I type in a contact in the contacts search area the contact comes up but nothing like a book as before”, do you mean the book in Outlook for Windows as illustrated by the following screenshot?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/592deb30-12c5-4ba6-b1d4-66783746cc8b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/592deb30-12c5-4ba6-b1d4-66783746cc8b" /></a></p>
<p><br />
When you search in Outlook for Mac, it is expected you don’t get the box containing contact information like that above since Outlook for Mac and Outlook for Windows are quite different in many aspects such as the interface.<br />
<br />
If the scenario is different, please give us more detailed information. Some screenshots are preferable.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Jasmine<br />

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are referring to the screenshot (book) given by Jasmine, it makes sense that Windows Outlook and Outlook for Mac are totally 2 different things (The interfaces of them are different).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are talking about another situation, we suggest you upload a screenshot about the “book” too so that we can have a better understanding.</p>
<p>

<h3> joannebentley  say:</h3>
<h2>            PROBLEM RECEIVING E MAILS IN OUTLOOK 2007</h2>
                    <p>I have outlook 2007 on my desktop that was working fine until 3 days ago.&nbsp; Since then I have been able to send e mails but have received nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i go to outlook the send/receive box says its complete but then nothing comes into the inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've logged on and off, contacted my ISP provider and tried numerous fixes from the internet but to no avail.&nbsp; The last think I have done is remove the address in account settings and configured a new address which states it's been successful. However the
 problem still remains.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not very computer literate so my understanding is very limited, but it's quite important that I get this fixed as it is a work e mail&nbsp;</p>

            <p>. Managed to pair it now. However I have a recurrent problem. I've tried going to device repair, write down that Keeps saying battery&nbsp;&nbsp;was lost&nbsp;even when fully charged. Has done this several times over the past few weeks. Driving me mad. I am on my 5th or
 6th band due to this recurrent problem and no one ever says what is being done to solve the issue.&nbsp;

            <p>No, syncing is still taking ages and it refuses point blank to sync the exercises. Really making me annoyed. I am doing a 90 day Bodycoach plan but can't track/monitor the exercises. I have paid a lot of money and lost a lot of time/weeks while waiting for
 the band to be replaced etc. and spend too many hours trying&nbsp; to do the most basic things. So frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I don't lose battery power, it just goes to a blank screen, you have to plug it in to recharge and it says battery was lost please enter date and time and goes back to battery life that was there before the screen goes blank. Why is it so useless. My
 warranty should be extended by several weeks because of all the times I have been unable to use orit or waiting for it to be returned. I am on my 6th band. How stupid is that. I have updated everything. Tried again. Now says I need to factory set it but doesn't
 tell me how. useless. very angry.</p>

<h2>            Can I create a batch file or something similar to change the default search engine&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a way I can create a batch file, or something that will do the same, to change the default search engine on a computer with Internet Explorer from Bing to Google? There are computers I regularly use that have Bing set as default, and while I can
 go through the whole 5 minute changing process every time I use them (settings are cleared at logoff), I would much prefer being able to automate it. Can anyone please point me in the right direction?

            <p>You could change default search from search provder setting. Or you&nbsp;could just visit:</p>

<p>And add Google as default from the page.</p>
<p>It is possible to do it with some script or registry but I recommend to use IEAK:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem. In my case though, I attached the PDF printout directly in my OneNote Mac version. Then after the notebook was synchronized I took hand notes with my iPad Pro without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem appears when I re-open my OneNote on the mac and I see only blank boxes where the images (PDF pages) were, I made sure that the notebooks were sync - in fact I can see in my Mac the hand notes I took with the iPad Pro, but I can not see the images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that the images are still visible in the iPad Pro, the images there were never lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas how to resolve this?</p>

            Hi Ernesto,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, after taking notes in the notebook on your iPad, when you open the notebook in OneNote for Mac, you get the blank box only with your notes. I suggest you check the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Close the notebook in OneNote for Mac, then reopen it to check the outcome.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Ensure your OneNote is up to date.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Create a new notebook to check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, could you please provide the information below?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. The version of Office: OneNote&gt; About OneNote.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Related screenshots if you encounter any error message.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yoga

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try the following troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Switch off/on both the router and the phone. Try to connect again and then observe.</p>
<p>2. On your phone, do the restore factory settings. To do this, go to <strong>Tools &gt;&nbsp;Settings &gt; General &gt;&nbsp;Factory settings &gt; Enter the security code</strong>. The default code is 12345 unless changed.&nbsp;<span>Try to connect again and then observe.</span></p>
<p>3. If the above steps didn't work, try to delete the access point and then set up again. To delete, go to&nbsp;<strong>Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Connection &gt;&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>Access points &gt; Select the 3G wiFi access router &gt; Options &gt; Delete</strong>.&nbsp;</span><span>To
 set up again, go to again to </span><strong>Access points &gt;&nbsp;Options &gt; New access point</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Upon checking the specification of the router, it supports up to five devices only. Can you verify if there are five devices connected to it? If it's less than five, are you getting any error message when connecting to it?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.&nbsp;:smileyhappy:</span></p>

    <title>Freeze upon insertion of trimmed movie clip - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lon sarnoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freeze upon insertion of trimmed movie clip</h2>
                    I have a movie in .wmv format.&nbsp; I have created two trimmed clips from that movie using Real Player Trimmer, a front portion commencing with the beginning of the original movie, and a back portion commencing from a midpoint of the movie.&nbsp; Placing the entire
 movie into a slide works fine.&nbsp; Placing the front trimmed portion of the file (commencing from the start of the original movie) also works fine.&nbsp; But attempting to place the back portion causes PowerPoint (both version 2003 and version 2007) to crash.&nbsp; All
 three clips play back without problem in Windows Media Player.&nbsp; I have tried different midpoints all with the same problem.<br />
<br />
The freeze/crash occurs during Insert, not during playback.<br />
<br />
I am operating within Windows XP.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

            I am going to have to study how to insert the clip as a Windows Media Player object.&nbsp; I have been using the Movies and Sounds&gt;Movie from File menu item.<br />
<br />
I have been using Real Player Trimmer to create the clips, but Real Player is not executing at the time of the PowerPoint hang.<br />
<br />
I am afraid that the Event Log information I posted earlier was an incorrect event.&nbsp; Here is the information generated by the hang I just experienced again.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hanging application POWERPNT.EXE, version 11.0.5529.0, hang module hungapp, version 0.0.0.0, hang address 0x00000000.<br />

Why don't you trim in something other than Real Player trim (Like Movie Maker) and see if Real Player is adding info PPT doesn't understand?<br />

    <title>Is it safe to delete multiple versions on Microsoft Office without - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is it safe to delete multiple versions on Microsoft Office without losing files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to uninstall old versions of Microsoft Office to free up desperately needed disk space until I can get a new computer. I have Office 2010 Professional Plus, but also still have Small Business 2003 and Office Enterprise 2007. In addition, there are
 several features of 2010 Pro Plus that I neither need nor use - is it possible to selectively uninstall components safely? Thanks.</p>

            <p>Your question is best answered in the MS Office Forums: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: Also if the files are worth keeping then make a backup to another drive (USB / Flash or burn to a DVD)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also if you have both .doc and .docx documents you need to keep a version of Office that supports both file formats.</p>

            Thank you for your response. I also got another response however that said that "as there will be as variety of shared files and resources you will need to repair whichever Office version you choose to retain".&nbsp; I should add that I should have said uninstall
 rather than delete because I do know that that's what I would have to do, but as you didn't mention the repair aspect I thought I would ask you about that.&nbsp; I went to the page you suggested but it didn't really expand on what I already know about how to do
 the uninstall, which isn't my problem. I'm more concerned about what this repair part is all about&nbsp; and what is involved and how to do it? Thanks again.<br />

            Uninstalling should not cause a problem with deleted shared files (because the Windows uninstall process is written to be extremely conservative when it comes to this question, it will default to leaving potentially shared files rather than deleting them).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You still should do an Office Repair.&nbsp; As well as shared files there are a LOT of shared Windows Registry Entries.&nbsp; Doing an office repair will also reset these registry entries to the version of Office that is being repaired.&nbsp; The most common problem you see
 with registry entries has to do with Windows Default File Associations.&nbsp; In English,&nbsp; which version (exactly where the program file is located) of an Office application is used to open the file when you double click on it in Explorer.<br />
<br />
You trigger the repair in the same place as you do the uninstall.<br />

<h2>            Groove songs have no usage rights, same songs play in Zune</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 10, and have been a Zune pass user for years. When I try to play certain songs in Groove, I get an error about usage rights suggesting I delete the song and download it again. However, those same songs play with the Zune
 software. I don't see anywhere in Groove to force a media update.

            <p>I don't want to remove my PC from the devices list. All of my music will play in the Zune player on the same PC that Groove says those same songs don't have usage rights. Clearly, they have usage rights or they would not play in Zune.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting all my songs and redownloading them does not seem like a viable solution, especially when there are limits to downloading the same song for some stupid reason.</p>

<h2>            Dead Nokia 5800</h2>
                    
<p>My Nokia 5800 died...</p>
<p>I upgrade the FW to v20.0.012 but i had a lot of bugs and a very annoying one that killed the screen every time it was blocked. So I decided to run again the Nokia Update Software to reinstall the FW, may be that way the problem will be fixed, the thing
 is, the light went off for a mere second, turning off the computer I was using to update the phone, so the phone was in the middle of the update. It was impossible to turn it on again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took it to a service center (not Nokia Care) and they told me to go to Nokia Care, there the staff checked it and told me that the phone didn't accepted the revival procedure, I ask the other service center again and they told me of a message that the
 phone didn't accepted the v20 firmware because it has a newer installed, how is that possible, if the v20 is the newest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible for a new FW to fix the problem???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or do I have now a nice looking and expensive door step</p>

<p>Thanks I'll try it, the problem is that my mobile is imported from Hong Kong, so I don't have warranty, my cousin that lives in Hong Kong send it to me, I'm going to send it back there with her, to see if she is able to get it fixed.</p>

<p>There is nothing to worry about. Unfortunately this happens sometimes and it's a bit tricky to work out , but every good repair center is able to do the job for you. If phone is dead it needs to be "flashed dead". This will bring it back to life. As I am
 not sure if it is not beyond the community rules here to share such type of info, I can not be more helpful to you. A hint: google 5800 flash dead . But anyway, the best you can do is search for a repair shop that will know what to do. The flash dead method
 works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope I helped and good luck!&nbsp;</p>

            Remember!&nbsp;when you buying Nokia phones, don't forget call to&nbsp;Nokia&nbsp;care&nbsp;centre&nbsp;to repair it. It will happen always with you and with every Nokia phone. Their phones are&nbsp;buggy&nbsp;and Nokia don't fix it,&nbsp;because, tom fix your issues, u need to buy another Nokia
 phone...

<h2>            Pivot Table - limitations on readable data&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to create a Pivot Table reading from a spreadsheet (in Mac Excel 2011)&nbsp; that has more than 550,000 lines of data.&nbsp; When I create the pivot table, and am using the Builder, the Bulider is not reading all of the data on the orignal spreadsheet,
 stopping at phone #s beginning with (402) area code. is this normal for Mac?&nbsp; It never seemed to work this way in windows 2007 version of office. Am I doing something wrong?

            According to Excel help (search for specifications and limits) there is a limit of 10,000 items displayed in filter drop down lists. All of the data is probably in the pivot table.<br />
<br />
Clearly, Mac Excel 2011 pivot table features are not as complete as the Windows version. The UI is slightly different, and some options are simply not supported.<br />
