<h2>            Hotmail blocked by servers</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>My Hotmail account is being blocked by various servers from sending me mails. As I run my business on a Hotmail mail account I am unable to receive mails from various servers. When I investigated the issue I was informed that the security certificate of
 your outlook server has expired. How can this be as Outlook is a crucial part of Microsoft's services.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<h2>            Qt 4.7.2 and Above and Ot Apps in the Ovi Store - Installation Issues</h2>
                    
<p>I have N8, PR 1.2, Qt 4.7.2 from Nokia Qt SDK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I install apps that require Qt from the Ovi Store. It just says "Preparing..." for a long long time, then it either crashes or the phone just reboots without installing anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia, please fix Qt or fix the Smart Installer. The same behaviour for Qt 4.7.3, but if I install a Qt app that is not packaged with Smart Installer, it installs FINE!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help! There are a lot of Qt Apps now and they are awesome... but I cannot install!!!</p>

            I suggest that you remove the Qt from installation, and install the Qt apps from Ovi Store direct. They will be bundled with a Qt installer/runtime that works correctly.

<p>I don't think that is a solution. Qt 4.6.4, or Qt 4.6.3 which is bundled with the Smart Installer is buggy and crashes most apps in my phone including the Ovi Store. Since Qt 4.7.2, the problem has gone but Nokia has forgotten to push Qt 4.7.2 with the Smart
 Installer, hence creating problems for Qt Apps bundled with older versions of Qt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this is a problem and an oversight on Nokia's part and must be addressed. They are pushing Qt 4.7.3 now, but Smart Installer is still not equipped to handle this and crashes. This is rather stupid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of application that I want to use and buy, I don't end up buying because of this. So in the end, Nokia loses money.</p>

<p>You cannot uninstall Qt. If you know of a way., let me know. Even Nokia's Qt 4.6.3 from Nokia Besta Labds and Forum Nokia cannot install now. Expired certificate. This is really a flaw. I hope they fix it soon!</p>

<p>Of course you can uninstall Qt. I've been installing and uninstalling Qt runtimes on my 5800 every now and then when trying out an app. The only time you can't uninstall Qt is if you are using an S^3 device (N8, C7, C6-01, E7), or you installed the Qt runtime
 for S^3 on an s60v5 device (n97, 5800, etc), in which case you can't uninstall it because its not fully compatible and the phone can't read the uninstall file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>????????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not a matter of uninstalling. It is a matter of Nokia getting it right! See Posts #3 and #4. Qt 4.7.2 is the only Qt I know that will not crash my apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Qt 4.6.3 certificates have already expired and some component dependecies that installed in Qt 4.7.2 cannot be overwritten by Qt 4.6.3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So do I say, I get rid of these apps? I don't think any sane person would kill essentials apps and downgrade to a Qt version that is old and not usable for their purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence, your solution to uninstall/overwrite is kind of insane. Do you want to uninstall/overwrite everytime you need to install something? Or do you want Nokia to push a Smart Installer that will work with their latest versions of Qt that they have been
 pushing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Nokia wants to live, they need to get Qt right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So please... since they are pushing Qt out to these 3rd party developers, and more and more Qt apps are showing up at the Ovi Store, they have to make sure their support system, including Smart Installer that does all the installation is 100% fool proof,
 not 100% fools!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments and suggestions. They don't work but kudos for trying. The solution is not to have a temporary "mickey mouse" solution but a correct one from Nokia!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Just to be clear, I was suggesting you overwrite your installation of Qt 4.7.2 with another Qt 4.7.2, as it MAY be a result of a hidden error in installation.

</p><p>The issue that you're experiencing with the call and SMS notification is caused by an update on your Lumia 640. Since you have already performed a soft reset and do not want to hard reset yet, you can try resolving the issue by making changes to your phone's
 notification settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change your phone's notification settings, go to <strong>Settings </strong>
&gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Notification &amp; actions</strong> and toggle the notifications for your apps under the
<strong>Get notifications from these senders</strong>. You should also try changing your ring tones.</p>

    <title>Locking and unlocking parts of MS Word document - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Locking and unlocking parts of MS Word document</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings, I am trying to create a form for staff performance appraisals, and the form needs to be revisited at least thrice each year; once for staff to create goals and then again for staff to respond to their goals, and finally for supervisors to comment
 on how well the person achieved goals (bureaucracy!).&nbsp; I was thinking of creating three text boxes for each performance category, essentially one box for each visit.&nbsp; During the year, staff/supervisors would each digitally sign the form that they agree to
 the goals, and then they would sign again at end of year.&nbsp; Sooooo, is there a way to isolate the editing of text boxes, so that they are locked from editing once staff/supervisors have signed goals?&nbsp; Can forms be created that restrict editing to only certain
 text boxes?&nbsp; If possible, I can avoid using online forms that, for us, have been unstable and inefficient.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.&nbsp; Michael</p>

            <p>Power Pivot will be available only if you have either Microsoft Excel Standalone version (not part of Office) or you have Microsoft Office Pro Plus / MS Office 365 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm if above is the case.</p>
<p>
Assuming that your version is above, try following -<br />
<br />
Fix it by going into Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; selecting Microsoft Office Pro Plus 2013 &gt; selecting Change &gt; Add or Remove Features &gt; Continue &gt; click the + next to Microsoft Excel + Add-ins &gt; drop down next to PowerPivot and select Run from My
 Computer &gt; Continue and then go back into Excel and it should be now available as an add-in under com add-ins. Looks like the default installation didnt install PowerPivot in your case.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If the above doesn't help you -&nbsp;<br />
<br />
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2805999/<br />
<br />
If none of the above work, you should reinstall MS Office again. Make sure that License Keys are available before you attempt reinstallation. (Do Complete installation not Typical installation so that all features of MS Office get installed)</p>

            I dont have OneNote on my machine. I use a Mac with Office for Mac software. I use the OneNote on my ipad and was prompted to sign in this week(having never been asked before) and when I used my hotmail sign in, it pulled up the SkyDrive page and showed
 zero files. I dont have OneNote app on my Mac so cant see how it ever synced. I really need those files and noticed similar problem by Ben Schorr from April 15, which&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;seem to have been resolved. Please help?

<p>1. Are you using the same Microsoft account (formerly known as Live ID) to log into the iPad app as you were before?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Go to SkyDrive.com from a computer. In the documents folder there should be a notebook named "Personal (Web)". Open that up in the web app. Are your notes there?</p>

            Like the OP, I was using the free version of OneNote when suddenly an update required a login. I put off logging in as I had to retrieve my credentials. Now that I've logged in, all of my recipes are gone. No, I didn't back my iPad to my desktop version,
 because nothing said I was going to have everything wiped out with an update. Please explain how those of us who lost our data because Microsoft decided not to allow access to locally-saved data can get it back. I don't have that issue with Apple's native
 notebook. Perhaps I was mistaken for having faith in Microsoft.

            This same thing just happened to me. &nbsp;I was using the free app on Windows 8 and have been for about a year now. &nbsp;When today I was prompted to sign into Skydrive - there was no warning that if I did so that I would loose all the files on the app. &nbsp;Now they
 are all gone and it doesn't seem like there is any answer to where they would have gone to. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Sometimes I hate computers....</div>
<div>Very disappointed in ONENOTE and in the fact that no one is answering this question as to why the prompt was made and where these files went. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Poof up in smoke.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Feel like crying but I'll just go to sleep instead.</div>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am busy dealing with my own new features on Build 16237: GSODs </p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, my computer is on auto sign-in. Therefore, I don't see the lock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first new feature GSOD:</p>
<p>

    <title>DKIM failing with &#34;bad RSA signature&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            DKIM failing with &#34;bad RSA signature&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all.&nbsp; I have had DKIM up and running for a month or two now (Microsoft support set it up) and it was working fine for all my domains until sometime around 2/29/2016.&nbsp; Since that time my DMARC reports say I'm getting a PERMERROR for DKIM.&nbsp; I used the
 DKIM Validator tool at <a href="http://dkimvalidator.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dkimvalidator.com</a> and it is reporting the following:</p>
Validating Signature
<p><br />
result = fail<br />
Details: bad RSA signature</p>
<p>I tried rotating keys within the GUI and that did not work, got an error saying the TXT records were not able to be published.&nbsp; I disabled DKIM and then re-enabled DKIM, but that did not fix the problem.&nbsp; I am out of ideas honestly.&nbsp; For something billed
 to be "set and forget," DKIM implementation within EOP has been a nightmare for us.</p>
<p>If it helps any, I am an EOP only customer, I have an on-premises Exchange 2013 environment and just use EOP to filter all inbound and outbound mail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>DKIM needs CNAME records , not TXT record. Have you checked if you have configured it properly ?</p>

<p>Yes, the CNAMEs are setup correctly. &nbsp;As I said in the initial post, this worked fine for a month and then just stopped on February 29th without me doing anything. &nbsp;The key Microsoft is signing the messages with does not appear to match the public key they
 have in the DKIM record which is causing a DKIM fail.</p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>You can again test in your outbound email (new test email) if DKIM is being failed or no?</p>
<p>If you have setup CNAME records and it's still failing, then you better contact Microsoft by Service Request so they can check with Backend and Escalate the case in order to set correct Public Key for your domain. Nothing setting required from your end,
 I believe.</p>

<p>"PermError" is related to SPF failure due to syntax or evaluation. From <a href="http://www.openspf.org/SPF_Record_Syntax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.openspf.org/SPF_Record_Syntax</a></p>
<p>Its mentioned as "If some kind of syntax or evaluation error occurs (eg. the domain specifies an unrecognized mechanism) the result is "PermError" (formerly "unknown")." Though, the TXT record for SPF evaluation for this domain looks good.</p>

<h2>            How to add &#34;Open in new Excel window&#34; option to XLS files&#39; context menu in Explorer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I right click an Excel file in Windows Explorer, I would like to have the option to open the worksheet in a new Excel Window. All the instructions are found are meant to change the default setting (Always open XLS in new window), this is NOT what I
 want, I want to have both options and the default action is to open in existing window. I KNOW how to open a file in new window, I would just like to be able to do it in 2 clicks instead of opening a new window and drag-and-droping.

            Hey Geoff,
<div>I'm a statistician at my day job and I spend my days in Excel. &nbsp;I've wished for this many many times... and for some reason I've never investigated it until I saw your question.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Well, I believe I just made both our lives easier. &nbsp;Here's how I did it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>Download the open-source <a href="http://types.sourceforge.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Types utility</a>, which allows you to change file type settings in Windows 7 (the interface for which is no longer present in the Folder options).<br />
<br />
</li><li>In the Classes dropdown menu, find Excel.Sheet8 (that 8 refers to the version number of Excel you have installed, or more appropriately the version of Excel that made the files). &nbsp;With that selected, click the Gear icon to open the properties of the class.<br />
<br />
</li><li>On the Actions tab, click in any blank white space to make sure nothing is selected. &nbsp;Type a new action in the top box (I used "Open in new window"), then click the + plus button to add it.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Select your new entry, then put this into the bottom box (your path to Excel may be different, you can copy from one of the existing actions).<br />
<br />
<b>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\EXCEL.EXE" "%1"<br />
<br />
<br />
</b></li><li>When you're done, just close out of every window and give it a try. &nbsp;It worked great for me here.</li></ol>
<div><br />
<div>Also - one side effect you are likely already aware of: &nbsp;Excel files open in separate windows are isolated from each other. &nbsp;It makes it exceedingly difficult to write formulas that reference the other file, among some other oddities.</div>

<h2>            Speech Recognition unable to download</h2>
                    <p>So I was trying to enable my Cortana so Speech was on downloading, but it suddenly failed. The reason of failing was an error 0x800F0950.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot:</p>
<p>And I guess due to this there's another problem, i.e., the language portion is grayed out in the screenshot:</p>
<p>and also in control panel in Ease of Access&gt;&gt;Speech Recognition, there's nothing but only a line stating,"Windows Speech Recognition is not available for current display language."</p>
<p>Please help. I've tried everything but nothing helped.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96a4193f-a720-4446-9b45-176792ca1aca?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96a4193f-a720-4446-9b45-176792ca1aca?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how difficult it is, when the device won't work in the way it should. For us to isolate the issue, we'd like to know more information on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Which build version of Windows 10 are you using?</p>
<p>2. Do you have any third party antivirus software installed on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can try the below steps and check if we can fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Check and install Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest you to check for Windows updates and install all the available updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + I</strong> together to open <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Click on <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong> &gt;
<strong>Check for updates</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any trouble in installing updates, you can use the Windows Update troubleshooter (<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update &amp; Security </strong>&gt; <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong> &gt;
<strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try downloading and installing the speech feature. If the issue persists, follow method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Disable anti-virus program and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any third party anti-virus program installed on your computer, I'd suggest you to disable it for some time and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disclaimer: If you have Windows 10, you'll get the latest antivirus protection with Windows Defender. When you start up Windows 10 for the first time, Windows Defender is on and actively helping to protect your PC by scanning for malware (malicious software),
 viruses, and security threats. Windows Defender uses real-time protection to scan everything you download or run on your PC. Windows Update downloads updates for Windows Defender automatically to help keep your PC safe and protect it from threats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, follow method 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: Perform a clean boot in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest you to perform a clean boot and check if the issue persists. Refer this article on
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disclaimer: A 'clean boot' starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality while in
 a clean boot environment, however, that functionality will return when you reset the computer to start normally after you have finished your troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response so we can further assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            How to extract views &#40;queries&#41; from an access db&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>What's the best way to extract query definitions from an access db in order to reproduce them through "create view" in another vendor's db (assuming you've been careful to define them in a way that produces "vanilla" SQL)?</p>
<p>You should be able to use the database documenter, and then edit the output into a script, but is there a better way?&nbsp; Also, I've encountered bugs with that.&nbsp; The preview intended for the printer is fine, but when you export the report to a text file, it
 truncates the SQL.&nbsp; If you export it to an Excel spread sheet, it doesn't seem to produce a column containing the view names.&nbsp; It does produce untruncated data if you export to HTML, but that produces an individual file for each view, and has more extraneous
 ____ to edit out to turn it into an sql script.</p>
<p>I'd file a bug report, but it seems nigh unto impossible to do so.</p>
<p>In general, does access have any kind of "SQL dump" facility?</p>

            Since Access doesn't have views and since Access SQL is different from T-SQL, you best bet is to open the Access query in SQL view and copy and paste into SQL Server. Then edit the query to create the view.

<p>Hi IanTaylor6058,</p>
<p>Generally, when the user uses the odoo developer (SMTP client submission) to send the email with Office 365, the device needs to meet the following conditions:<br />
1.&nbsp;Authentication: You must be able to configure a user name and password to send email on the device.<br />
2.&nbsp;Mailbox: You must have a licensed Office 365 mailbox to send email from.<br />
3.&nbsp;Transport Layer Security (TLS): Your device must be able to use TLS version 1.0 and above.
<br />
4.&nbsp;Port: Port 587 (recommended) or port 25 is required and must be unblocked on your network. Some network firewalls or ISPs block ports—especially port 25.</p>
<p>The requirement for TLS is vice important, if your device doesn’t support TLS, it might not support to send the email from Office 365.</p>
<p>Alao, if you want to set up the SMTP relay, please refer to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn554323(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>not a big deal now but if something comes out that i really want i would prefer to buy it at midnight from my xbox rather than go downtown and wait for it to be put on the shelf</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use Weather channel app, I use Weather app directly from MS (version 4.13.47.0). Why third party app cooperates with Calendar instead of MS one? Anyway, the problem still exists after update to OS 14393.231 and Calendar app 40798.0: for the current
 day I have correct forecast (12), for future days it's completely wrong (28/26)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I still have sync problem with outlook.com (some past calendar entries that are on outlook.com are missing in my phone). Can this sync problem be the cause?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Peter</p>

</p><p>I have the same problem on a Nokia Lumia 1520 -&nbsp;I seem to get the weather for another location (where it's tropical).&nbsp;Signing in to my Windows account doesn't help, nor does a soft reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The odd thing is, if in Calendar I click on today's weather icon (29C, whereas it's more like 9C outside!) I get to see a msn weather page with the correct location and temperature.</p>

            Hi, signing-in (I am signed-in already) nor sync settings change doesn't help. My calendar events are synced correctly - I change something on the phone, I can see it (later) in outlook.com, I change it on outlook.com, I see it (later) on the phone. But
 weather is not shown anymore, at all... now also that wrong weather has gone :-)

 the IE window gets focus. At that point, a page refresh is triggered and user experience is disrupted.</span></p>

            Microsoft has basically stopped supporting\updating IE. So really the only thing I can suggest at this point is to use another browser that works.
<br />And if you want you can let Microsoft know via Feedback hub about IE.
<br />But to be honest not sure if they will address it as like I said IE is out the door soon.
<br />Sorry can't be better help.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that the client machines are using the same IE security zone and that their current zone settings are set to the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Security tab, click "Reset all zones to default".</p>
<p>
</p><p>use the File&gt;Properties menu in IE to obtain the IE security zone that the host is mapped to on the client machine... expected Intranet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your client should have deployed Enterprise Mode Site lists, and should have mapped any legacy intranet applications to a lower IE version emulation mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You find out which IE version emulation mode is being used and how it was established from the f12&gt;Emulation tab eg. IE8 emulation - Enterprise Site Mode lists</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expect that the win10 machines/IE11 will show that they are using a different IE version Emulation mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for more developer/administration information please see</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>thanks for the feedback. Best we can tell from our analysis, this actually has something to do with how IE 11 in Windows 10 deals with setTimeout() JS calls in inactive tabs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@IECUSTOMIZER, we've double-checked, but the security zone is correctly set to Local Intranet and it is indicated as such. The browser should post an AJAX request once a timeout elapses, set by a setTimeout() statement. This request goes to the same host,
 and the session is re-validated on the back end, so no cross-domain requests are involved.</p>
<p>Curiously, this works just fine in Windows 7, but once we try on IE 11, the inactive tab appears to pause all setTimeout callbacks until the tab receives focus again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be documented anywhere. Some research on StackOverflow shows that setTimeout and setInterval calls are reduced in background tabs to save battery, but they should not stop completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@SarahKong, unfortunately since this is a legacy enterprise app, switching browsers is not an option just yet. We've been able to test this specific scenario with Chrome and Firefox (both worked fine), but those are not suitable for everyday use of the application,
 sadly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great to find out what's changed in IE11 with Windows 10. I've gone through some changelogs concerning new group policies, but none seem to apply to this particular case.</p>
<p>
</p>

            In our case, it is a little bit different. When there is an inactive tab with a loaded application and the session is terminated the SP (application) requests the IdP (OKTA) and everything seems to be okay until the SP receives the response from IdP.<br />
<br />
I used Fiddler and the OKTA "Signing in" page contains HTML form which is automatically submitted and redirected to the application, but there is a problem - this form is never submitted. I don't know why but this is only happening in IE under Windows 10 (Win7,
 8.1 is fine).<br />
<br />
But what I know there is something different under Windows10.<br />
<br />
I am attaching the screenshot how the inactive tab looks like and the main problem is - when the application wants to&nbsp;receive a response from IdP - IE is waiting for a user response to get the tab to "active" state to continue.<br />

                    I just got an HTC 8x yesterday, and shortly after I added my microsoft account(an outlook.com email) the sync for it starting giving me error&nbsp;80070057. I've seen a lot of other people having this issue but they get it working by deleting some characters
 from folders, but I don't see any of these foreign characters, and I added the account again as just an outlook account and it works. I would really like to fix it since it is my primary microsoft account that I cannot change.

            Go to http://account.live.com and change the password to less than 15 characters long, then re-add the account on the phone. This seems to have resolved the issue for a few users.<br />

    <title>adding automatic disclaimer Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            adding automatic disclaimer Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am trying to add an automatic disclaimer within Office 365 that gets appended to the message once it is sent. (doing this to keep it out of the individual signature blocks) and I can add the rule but when I test it, it keeps adding the disclaimer
 to the bottom of the messages on every reply. &nbsp;My goal is to have it add the disclaimer the first time and not on subsequent replies.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this requirement cannot be met. Based on my test, when using the transport rule&nbsp;to add a disclaimer for outgoing emails, all the outgoing emails (including new email messages and reply emails) will be added a disclaimer.</p>
<p>Given this situation, I suggest you submit&nbsp;<a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273493-office-365-admin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">feedback</a> to require the feature on new emails only. Our product team will take all customers’ suggestions into consideration and many features
 have been implemented based on customers’ feedback. Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Zoey</p>

            It is easy to do jusntitta.&nbsp; You just need to have Outlook installed on your PC.
