<h2>            the N8 nightmare continues&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I've sent in my N8 to get repaired 3 times since it was purchased in December because it has the dying/rebooting/freezing problem. I just got the phone back from the repair center and it froze and shut off in the first 3 minutes of being on. What would you
 do in this situation? I've had the worst service with this phone and I have no idea what to do. :smileymad:</p>

<p>Considering the phone has been repaired 3 times and the problem persists, maybe it is time to contact Nokia directly using the Contact Us tab to the top right of this screen explaining the situation to see if there is anything else they can do for you.</p>

<p>Hi, sorry to hear about the issues you're having with the N8. Unfortunately you have been one of the unlucky ones facing this issue.<br />
<br />
If it has been in for repair 3 times because of the same issue, I would have contacted the shop and asked for a replacement phone.<br />
<br />
Check out your countries customer code/act and Also check out your country's customer bureau.<br />
<br />
There is a good chance that you can get an replacement phone from the store from just talking to them in an objective way.<br />
<br />
E. g. In Norway shops has the right to get it repaired the 1st and 2nd strike. If the exact same fault happens the 3rd time then you have the right to choose wether you want a replacement phone or your money back. 3 strikes = out as long as it is the exact
 same issue and it's covered by warranty.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you behave and are objective explaining the situation, I think you should be fine.<br />
<br />
If I where you, I would have gotten a replacement phone as the N8 is an awesome device ( when it works).</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I was too slow again CJ. What CJ suggested is also one way to do it, and might be the best option, at least if you bought it directly from Nokia. In my country, if you buy it from a reseller, it's really a deal between you and the
 store selling it to you. But I have sent my phone directly to Nokia with a copy of the reciept resulting in a swap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least, here are some good suggestions and hopefully you will be a happy camper after all even though youre angry and frustrated now. :)</p>

<p>I've contacted NCC each time by phone or email before sending it in. They keep telling me to just send it up and it'll be repaired but then I turn it on and it freezes and turns off. It's the EXACT same problem I keep sending it in for. I even got an email
 from Nokia saying someone would call me about this issue/concern and that was almost two weeks ago. I live in the US and I have asked for a replacement if the issue couldn't be resolved.&nbsp; I feel like I'm wasting time and money sending my phone across the country
 for them to open it, put it in a new box and send it right back to me two weeks later. It's like they're wearing me down on purpose.</p>

            I contacted the seller the 1st time I sent it in (it was bought from Newegg) and they said that if theres any problems with the phone its under Nokia warranty and will not deal with it. Trust me, I tried ;(

<p>It's absolutely not a good situation for you. It is wierd though that this has happened 3 times now.<br />
<br />
Just a hip shot in the dark standing on one leg jumping up and down: You don't happen to have another sim card you could try in the phone just to make sure it isn't a faulty sim card?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: Okey I see. Then I would try Cjlims tips and explain your situation in detail by using the contact us tab. Make sure you mention that it has been sent in for repair two times for the exact same issue and now it has happened the third time. Give it
 a shot.</p>

<p>I totally have another sim card to try in it. Funny thing, it will freeze and turn off even WITHOUT a sim card :smileywink: The N8 gods hate me. Worse part is I've been such a Nokia fan since my first cell phone that I don't even know what to do. Will I
 have to start looking at something like the Android to fill my need for a smart phone?!? I hope not! UGH! *frustration and endless agony!*</p>

            My husband called in. They are supposed to be calling him back because the NCC can't do anything about it and someone from the warranty department needs to call? I don't know.. it's under warranty and was purchased new in the middle of December. I've only
 had the phone physically in my house for about a week since it was purchased. Since then it's been in and out of the repair centers

            Last usless tips from me is to remove the memory card if you have one installed.<br />
<br />
If not you will have to do as Cjlim suggested!<br />
<br />
<br />
Be aware of that youre very unlucky and one of the few suffering from such a experience.<br />
<br />
If you get to the point getting a replacement phone, it will probably be the end of your troubles.<br />
<br />
Going to another brand is absolutely okey, but if you visit forums about HTC, Apple, Samsung, SE etc, you will find the same type of experience there too. There are always someone who has bad luck getting a faulty device or getting an unrepaired device back.
 This happens regardless of brands and every mobile company has a fail rate which is about the same as the other ones.<br />
<br />
It might solve your issue, or it might not.<br />
<br />
Go for the advice posted by Cjlim as mentioned, stay objective the first time, and put some more pressure on them if they just pretend as nothing. It shouldn't be like this. If they cannot repair it, they should give you a replacement device.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Note that the contact us tab is the way o get in touch with Nokia directly here as this is a peer to peer troubleshooting forum. It looks like we cannot help you any further.

<p>Sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>I've been in the same situation, but after I contacted Nokia directly they considered the problems to severe to simply repair(firmware updates were useless), and so they swapped my old one with a new one. The new one works very well, so keep&nbsp; knocking on
 Nokia's door. Believe me&nbsp; - you'll love the phone once it works they way it should :smileywink:</p>

<p>The phone needs to be sent back to nokia for repair,</p>
<p>all an NCP can do in house is a firmwarwe reflash,</p>
<p>If you have the freezing / refusing to start problem then take it in and insist it is sent off for higher level repair, as a large chunk of the circuit board needs replacing,</p>
<p>this should take around 2 weeks</p>

            <p>I don't think this is possible (See here: <a href="http://peltiertech.com/Excel/Hyperlinks.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://peltiertech.com/Excel/Hyperlinks.html</a>)</p>
<p>You could&nbsp;paste your chart as a linked picture into your powerpoint, make it small, assign an action to it so that the Excel file is opened when clicked.&nbsp; Here's how:</p>
<p>Copy your chart in Excel.</p>
<p>In ppt, PasteSpecial and select Paste Link, ok.</p>
<p>Then with the chart in ppt selected, in the Insert tab, click Action.</p>
<p>Set the Object Action to Edit.</p>
<p>Using "Edit" brings Excel to the front, Open keeps the slide show active, so you would have to exit your slide show for Excel to&nbsp;appear (or use Alt+Tab to activate Excel).</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

 to deal with the updates i downloaded after flashing the phone, cuz before i installed the updates, i installed the nokia store app and dropped down the bar. It, it didn't closed as i experienced after downloading and installing the updates.I hope some responds
 with a solution because it's really annoying.<br />
<br />
Thanks

<br />
Try this... I the one that caused that problem is nokia maps suite...<br />
<br />
after hard reset, I reflashed my phone, and updating nokia store...<br />
<br />
then, I installed updates one by another, to see which one cause the problem ... and it was nokia maps suite...<br />
<br />
and lets go for the solution which I found here...<br />

<p>I have the same problem. However, it seems to be a problem of Vista. I checked PC and notebook with WV Home Premium and it didn't work. The next notebook with Win XP Prof worked without any problem. Also a BT connection to Vista works. I really don't understand

<p>hi javier,</p>
<p>based on my experience, this issue may be happen if your organization account is registered as a microsoft account. you may follow the steps below to disassoicate them.<br />
1. go to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=71369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">microsoft account website
</a>and sign in with your organization account.<br />
2. select <strong>your info</strong> and <strong>manage your sign-in email or phone number</strong>.</p>

3. remove your organization account. please note that you may need to add or choose another account to be the primary alias before you can remove your organization account.</p>

<p>2. please let us know the username of the email address in private message. you can access the private message via the link below:<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p>about how to change the onedrive folder and redirect it to the educational account, do you need to move your onedrive personal files to onedrive for business folder and keep it sync with the cloud? here are the steps for it:<br />
1. sync onedrive for business library to your local comoputer.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-onedrive-for-business-or-site-libraries-to-your-computer-23e1f12b-d896-4cb1-a238-f91d19827a16?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-onedrive-for-business-or-site-libraries-to-your-computer-23e1f12b-d896-4cb1-a238-f91d19827a16?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us</a>
<br />
2. exit onedrive application by right click onedrive icon in system tray and select exit.<br />
3. move the onedrive files to onedrive for business folder, then they will be automatically synced to the cloud.</p>

<p>The best option is to cancel my personal account and just maintain the educational account, it is very important to conclude this before the next period in the university starts.</p>
<p>I dont care about loosing any information in my personal account, the most important thing is maintain safe the educational account.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Excel survey not available</h2>
                    <p>I've enabled external sharing for a site collection but still no sign of the excel survey option when I click the "new" link. What other time wasting, assinine process do I have to go through to get this to work as promised?</p>
<p>I followed this by the way, which as usual with Msft support docs, wasn't helpful:</p>

            <p>Hi Webbrewers3,<br />
<br />
To use Excel Survey with New button of a library, the anonymous access links feature is required. That’s to say, we need to enable
<strong><em>Allow Sharing with all external users, and by using anonymous access links</em></strong> instead of
<em><strong>Allow external users who accept sharing invitations and sign in as authenticated users</strong></em> as below. Therefore, could you share with us the result after configurating it?
<br />

<p>In addition, we need to disable Allow management of content types in Library settings &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Content Types as below. Please configure the steps to check the result.
<br />

            Hi Webbrewers3,<br />
<br />
To clarify the scenario and narrow down the issue, could you confirm with us the following information?&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. To determine if the issue occurs on the whole SharePoint level, may I know if it occurs on all site collections or only this site collection?&nbsp;<br />
2. Does the issue occur on other libraries in this site collection?&nbsp;<br />
3. A screenshot about the missing Excel Survey in New menu.&nbsp;<br />
4. A screenshot when accessing the SharePoint admin center &gt; Sharing.&nbsp;<br />
5. A screenshot of Content Types settings as above.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

We understand that you want Excel Survey to work as expected, and we are glad to help you on it. It would be great if you could share with us the screenshots about Sharing settings for a site collection and the drop down menu of New in the library. In that
 way, we can narrow down and troubleshot the issue.&nbsp;<br />

Thanks for your time.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Webbrewers3,<br />
<br />
Generally, after we change the sharing settings, it takes effect immediately. From your description, I can see that you have tried some general troubleshooting steps. May I know if you tried disabling Require Check Out option via Library settings &gt; Version
 settings &gt; Require Check Out &gt; Require documents to be checked out before they can be edited &gt; No?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot about my global sharing settings, please configure it as below to see if there is any improvement:&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a935143-1d63-4493-ad1e-5cd4bf29ae6d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a935143-1d63-4493-ad1e-5cd4bf29ae6d" /></a><br />
If the issue persists, could you confirm the following details?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Are you using the default content types or the custom content types?&nbsp;<br />
2. Do other default content types display normally such as Word, Excel?&nbsp;<br />
3. Some screenshots about the symptom and settings are appreciated so that we can try to reproduce the issue with the same configuration.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shirley

<p>
</p><p>Based on the description above, I understand that you have enabled the Sharing features both for your tenant and site collections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given this situation, one more question, have you applied any customized content types to the Documents library?</p>
<p>If yes, please disable Allow management of content types and switch SharePoint Site to classic experience to check the result.</p>

<h2>            Surface Tablet - Excel problem</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro and there have been a few times when I've clicked on Excel 2013 and it doesn't load. &nbsp;It switches over to the desktop view, like it is going to open, then nothing happens. &nbsp;Does this happen to anyone else or am I missing a step to
 get it to just open up?

 through what is discussed in these communities and blogs . Most of them have long raised and still failed to help . I'm not sure whether the microsoft is working or not to solve this problem . If yes .. I feel sad because they have taken a long time . Please
 share if you have information and other solutions .. I really hope it's extremely different from the other.</span></p>

<h3> ub8jayuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 8GB Spider Man Activation Key Issue - READ BEFORE UPG to V11</h2>
                    Please Please Please before upgrading your phones please back your device up otherwise you will lose the key and not be able to watch this film.<br />
<br />
It cannot be re-sent or downloaded to your phone at present.<br />
<br />
Nokia service centre can re-flash your device as a last resort.<br />
<br />
Far easier to back up and then restore after the upgrade..<br />
<br />
Getting annoyed that we have so many customers saying its Mobile OP/Nokia's fault.. On the NSU screen it clearly says back up your device!!!

            Completely ridiculous to suggest you're getting annoyed at us stupid folks, we make up the vast majority of the world's population. Nokia's lazy programmers are the problem, they should have written their code to preserve this activation key! The Spiderman
 movie remained even though it was not backed up! 100% this is a Nokia issue - we, the stupid, are off the hook on this one.

            Dont be so ir-responsible nokia. Posting in forum will help how many, may be the ppl who are now planning to buy. But hey when you provided a four language catalog for SpiderMan movie in the sales package, arnt you supposed to mention it there that this
 movie works on activation key and hence back up your phone when re-installing.<br />
How can you miss such an important information when you release special edition and then make things which dont keep them special anymore. Its really bad of you nokia, you are hurting your faithful users all over the world.

            Ya, sorry Nokia.. As one of your biggest ever fans and supporters I will have to agree with most users on this.<br />
<br />
Here's why..<br />
<br />
I just got my N95 8GB 2 days ago. The first thing I did when I opened the retail box was look at the Quick Start Guide and teh Spiderman brochure. Having a BRAND NEW phone there was obviously no reason to backup any data at all! In fact, I specifically upgraded
 the firmware FIRST THING, so that I wouldn't have to go throught the backup/restore process later!<br />
<br />
Sorry.. please find us a way.<br />
<br />
Thank you

hi, i`ve just had the same problem. What to do? Service providers are no help and the nokia care stores in Durban South Africa are useless. Do you think formatting your phone will help?

            Restoration of the activation key can be done by a Nokia Care repairer, see the Nokia web site in your country for information on the location of authorised care points.<br />
<br />
All users of any kind of computer equipment, including smartphones, would be well advised to make regular full backups of all data in case of issues of this nature.

            hi all<br />
<br />
as much as it is very IRRITATING as i find myself in the same situation as other users and i dont have use of the spiderman video as well.<br />
<br />
i did back up using the n95 pc suite. i thought all was well but after updating to firmware v15 cannot use spiderman.<br />
<br />
as it is one of the key marketing tools, i am within the 7 day out of box warrantee period and intend on returning it unless someone can shed some light on how to activate it.<br />
<br />
does anyone know the nokia customer care centre in durban south africa who can reactivate it.<br />
<br />
cheers<br />
<br />
also bought a n81 hope no hassles updating that as well

            that is not very helpful as my network is mtn and service provider is Autopage and your search site lists other networks and other service providers. i am looking for the OFFICIAL NOKIA CUSTOMER CARE CENTRE IN DURBAN SOUTH AFRICA.

<h2>            Excel Chart Won&#39;t Recognize Times New Roman Font</h2>
                    <p>Hi, when changing the font in an excel chart my chart won't recognize Times New Roman Font. I can change the font to any other font and it works perfectly but when I change it to Times New Roman it gives me Calibri instead. Anyone know why this is happening.
 I'll attach screenshots for reference. Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Let me try to explain this again - Microsoft does not, cannot and will not develop apps for every possible gadget existing in the world. It is up to the manufacturers of these devices to create the required applications. It is entirely up to them to decide
 whether to do that and only they can tell you what is their strategy. It seems that you need to address your query mainly towards Amazon. I'm afraid that's about the limit of the support we can offer here.</p>

<h2>            Decreased LTE download speed after connecting notebook to Lumia 950 DS Mobile Hotspot</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Mormally I have nearly 70Mbit/s of download speed when using LTE data transmission (SIM 1) on my Lumia 950 DS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After turning on Mobile HotSpot speed on connected notebook decreases dramatically up to 3Mbit/s. Funny that my upload speed is about 18Mbit/s. I have no idea if it is problem with data transmission or maybe Lumia WiFi in line Lumia &lt;-&gt; Notebook.</p>
<p>Is this another bug on WM10??? &nbsp;or hardware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>...This phone, or rather WM10 OS makes me so frustrated...&nbsp;</p>

                    I have files on from My Notebook in OneNote 2003 format that I would like to be able to work with in my OneNote2016. It says the files cannot be opened because they are from an older version, and states that there may be a converter available on Office.com.
 can anyone provide a link to help me find this converter?

<p>This converter was a myth. It never existed. <strong>Onenote 2016</strong> needs at least
<strong>Onenote 2007</strong> file format.</p>
<p>If you have an installation of <strong>Onenote 2003</strong> you can use copy&amp;paste or printing to the
<strong>Send to Onenote</strong> "printer".</p>
<p>If not you are lost. Only 14 years later ...</p>

<h2>            Excel sorting problem</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a small excel problem I need your help with.<br />
Attached you will find the file I am talking about.<br />
<br />
In colum A you can see a random but unique strings containing letters and numbers and in colum B I got a subset of these strings in a random order. The subset in row B has numbers allocated to it shown in colum C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>the combination 6F 2A 83 05 09 00 12 E0&nbsp; corresponds to the number 1 and the combination 63 2F 83 05 09 00 12 E0 corresponds to the number 5.<br />
<br />
Using the formula&nbsp;=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A6;B$2:B$123456;1;0);"") I manged to sort my radom subset (colum B) in a way that it corresponds to colum A. So the same strings are now next to each other (Colum A and D).</p>
<p>Yet it is hugly important that I dont lose the corresponding numbers in colum C. Since I did not come up with the IFERROR formula myself I am not sure how to change it according to my new porblem :)</p>
<p>So what I now need is what you can see in colum E. So I still need the strings in colum D corresponding to my numbers in colum E.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, what I got is colums A B C and I need as a result the colums A D E.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I cant attach an Excel file (which is weird in an Excel help forum btw.) I have to attach an image of my file:</p>
<p>

            No need to sort column B.
<br />
<br />D2:  =IFERROR(INDEX(B:B,MATCH(A2,B:B,0)),"")
