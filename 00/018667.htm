<h2>            Is Nokia C2-01 compatible with &#38;quot&#59;Power Bank&#38;quot&#59; recharging devices&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Is Nokia C2-01 compatible with "Power Bank" recharging devices?</span><br />
<br />
I was at the local ACS Canberra Branch annual conference on Tuesday &amp; Wednesday (23 &amp; 24 Sep 2014) and in each participant's conference satchel there was a "Power Bank" charging system for "mobiles and other small portable devices", as per the following introductory
 paragraph from the included instruction sheet:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Power Bank is a charging system for mobile phones and other small portable electronic devices requiring a 5V/1amp (maximum) current draw.&nbsp; It contains a 2200mah A-grade Li-ion cell which is suitable for 300 charges.&nbsp; It will fully charge an iPhone, Android
 or other common mobile phones one time with each charging cycle.&nbsp; It is not suitable for iPad or tablet devices that draw a higher current."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Made in China.&nbsp; LL9104i]<br />
<br />
My query is:&nbsp; Would this "Power Bank" device be compatible with my Nokia C2-01 mobile phone?&nbsp; I understand that when the USB/microUSB cable is used with the phone the phone can be recharged via the USB port on a PC.<br />
<br />
I can provide a photo of the device and a scanned copy of the "Power Bank Instructions" if required and a suitable return email address is provided for the delviery of same.<br />
<br />
Thanking you for your assistance in this matter.<br />
<br />

<p>Power banks are basically little more than batteries in boxes. Most mobile electronics use the similar voltages, and so the only requirement you need to look for is the same type of charger connection. Most nowadays are Micro-USB, which will work with pretty-much
 all modern phones, if your older Nokia uses the old pin-type chargers then you would have to look for one of the old Nokia powerpacks which may still be available in some stores.</p>

<p>Only answers part of my query.&nbsp; My C2-01 has a microUSB connector on the side and, as I understand it, if I plug the phone into my computer it can be charged this way.&nbsp; As such, and at present this is only an assumption, I could use the Power Bank in place
 of the PC to recharge the phone.&nbsp; Am I correct in this assumption?&nbsp; can you give me a definitive response?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Becca,<br />
<br />
If you want to associate another account to your OneDrive app in Windows 10, you need to remove the account that is currently setup before you associate another OneDrive account. To remove the current account, please perform the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the OneDrive icon in the notification area, at the far right of the taskbar. (You might need to click the "<strong>Show hidden icons</strong>" arrow next to the notification area to see the icon.)</li><li>On the Settings tab, click <strong>Unlink OneDrive</strong>.</li><li>Restart OneDrive and sign in with the account you want to use. You'll need to select the location for your OneDrive folder again. If you select the same location, the folders for both accounts will be merged. If the PC had the Fetch files feature turned
 on, you'll need to turn it on again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if that work for you.</p>
        </p>

<p>It's a common scam that you could have ended with the Task Manager. Now you must consider everything on your computer has been compromised. Passwords, PIN numbers, financial account information. A clean install of Windows is the best option and what I would
 do myself. See the following and decide if you want to tempt fate not knowing what they may have installed on your computer.

<p>Contact the bank that issued your father's checking account and ask them what you should do.&nbsp; Most likely they will simply stop payment on the check, but if they want to cancel the account and open another, then follow their recommendation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overreacting to the mistake is just as foolish as the original error, so stop, take a breath and don't panic.&nbsp; This is exactly what the malicious actors (e.g. scammers, really just another form of con men) want you to do.&nbsp; So stop doing what they want and
 try to think!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sit your father down and ask him exactly what they had him do, what information he provided to them, including any account or login information for his PC.&nbsp; If he truly can't remember at all, only then do you need to do use the nuclear&nbsp;option and change
 or reinstall absolutely everything.&nbsp; In most cases the issue is smaller than it at first seems, with only a single check, account or credit card at true risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is a more difficult&nbsp;decision&nbsp;though, since the question of what the scammer actually did can't be easily confirmed once remote access has been allowed.&nbsp; That's why most people will tell you to completely reinstall the operating system from scratch,
 since that's the only way to be sure the scammers can't gain access in the future, even if the true chances of this seem unlikely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worry about contacting the bank about the check and any other financial concerns first.&nbsp; Just leave the computer turned completely off and unplug the power cable&nbsp;until you have the time to properly address that, since they can't access a PC that's powered
 off and unplugged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use your own PC to review any instructions and download any software required to place on a USB or other removable media, since the compromised PC can't be trusted if remote access&nbsp;had been&nbsp;allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bruce's references will contain more details, but the above is basically an outline of what this will entail, so start with the bank and do your best to protect his finances first, the rest can wait.</p>

            I would (see my post about the OZM scam strongly urge that you get help from Microsoft about fixing the problem. It cost about 1.5% of what your dad paid. I would hope there would be some way your dad can get the money back.

<p>Hi&nbsp;Chigbogu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know where you isntalled the Office 2011 (Outlook 2011 for Mac), from Office 365 Portal? If so, I suggest you install Office 2016 (Outlook 2016 for Mac) instead as Outlook 2016 is more functional that it will fix some problems regarding data base in
 backend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Labels in Word 2010 Not Printing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pav-court  say:</h3>
<h2>            Labels in Word 2010 Not Printing</h2>
                    I want to print labels from Word 2010. I have created the document, I can create a new document from the label dialogue and see the table and the grid lines. I can send it to my printer, but then nothing. I have print preview set in the printer properties
 dialogue. The preview window opens, but the bit at the bottom of the screen just keeps turning and nothing is displayed. If I send a normal document to the printer from Word, I see it displayed in the preview, click on print and it prints without any problem.
 &lt;u printer is a Canon Pixma 3100 series printer. My computer is a HP Pavilion and the operating system is WIndows 10 64-bit.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I did notice that someone raised this same problem back in 2011, but didn't see any satisfactory resolution - at one point it was suggested it may be an actual printer problem, but the printer used was a HP printer, whereas mine is obviously Canon. I have successfully
 printed labels before, but that was on a WIndows 7 pc and I think probably Microsoft Word 2007 or 2008. I have not tried printing labels again since.

            OK, thanks Doug Robbins, I'll give that a try. I still don't quite understand why it shouldn't print, though! I have been using different versions of Word for 10 years or ore and have printed both ordinary labels and CD labels from a variety of computers,
 a number of different versions of Windows and, as I said, several different versions of Word without any problems until now. Whether it is Windows 10, or Word 2010 or a combination that is causing the problem, I don't know. The other variable, I suppose, is
 that I am using the printer wirelessly, so I suppose I could try connecting it up to a USB port and see if it prints that way.

<h2>            Build 10240, after updates between July 22-25, the start menu, search, action center, browser Edge and more no longer work</h2>
                    <p>even after I uninstalled that last few security updates, these items still don't work, also including Settings. I wanted to get to Window Update, but since Settings no longer works, and&nbsp;although I can get to control panel, since Windows Update was removed
 from there for some weird reason, I cannot get updates that might have fixed the problem&nbsp;. I tried to do a system restore, back to the July 22, still no help. I have tried that powershell install trick, but it did not help. Windows Shell Experience Host was
 not running, I tried to start manually, it would not start. I tried to add a new user to test, but when I got to the part click on the + to add, an empty window opened for a second then closed, no matter how many times I tried with an account for someone else,
 or for a family member, same result. I was about to run the setup from my USB installer for 10162 build, but its option only allowed complete wipe, the top two options not allowed due to the Windows installation not being in the normal location (yet its in
 C:\Windows). I'm at my wits end. Can anyone shed any light?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            There are no real copyright issues with user-generated content (well, technically, your son owns the copyright to the content and can determine how you can use it).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, however, Nokia phones have a fixed list ( so called, "Closed Content List" ) of file types that the phones refuse to send/forward. MIDI files are on that list.<br />

            There is no actual "protection" on the file itself to change. If the file is on the phone, and is of a specific type (specific file extension in the name is the only thing that matters, actually), the phone will not send/forward it.<br />
<br />
On some phones you can actuall change the file name to something else (e.g., change .mid to .xyz) and then send it. The receiving device must then be able to save it and name it back, or it might not work as intended.

<h2>            Color palette is not applied in Edge</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've created a palette using the "SharePoint Color Palette Tool" and uploaded it to a site.</p>
<p>I was able to activate it successfully and it shows correctly in IE and Firefox.</p>
<p>However, on Edge, it doesn't seem to be activated. Only the icons near "Share", "Edit" or "New item" are getting the correct color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I the only one getting this strange behavior ? Or am I missing something ?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Flavien,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue seems to apply to all theme colors. Even without the custom color palette and using the default themes, the colors does not apply on Edge. Here is a related thread:</p>
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_sharepoint-mso_win10-mso_o365b/edge-browser-and-sharepoint-online/fdb985c0-3c3f-42cf-8521-19deabfc6be1?messageId=a77c2d87-ef9c-48b3-afd9-726190075e40">Edge browser and Sharepoint online</a>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is fixed on the latest Windows 10 October 2018 Update which was released on October 2nd. It brings an Edge update with it that fixes this issue. We tested it on Edge version&nbsp;44.17763.1.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest updating to the latest version of Windows to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

 help on this problem would be greatly appreciated thanks.</p>

<h2>            From Palm OS to Windows Mobile 6.1, conversation or chat mode in SMS</h2>
                    I have gotten used to the conversation mode for my SMS message in my old Palm Treo 650.<br />
<br />
Is there a setting to move all the same person's text and my sent text to a single place, either a folder or other?<br />
<br />
If not, is there software that can make it easier to manage my SMS messages?<br />

            <span>WM6.1 has already decided to follow, and sms messages are now in "conversation mode" or "threaded sms", where you could see the previous sms to the same contact in one place - sort of easier to follow the
 flow/history..<br />
<br />
However, not all wm6.1 users are happy with such a setting, and some are looking for third party apps to revert to the "normal" mode as wm6.1 does not allow any such preference.<br />
<br />
For me, I agree with you and find the "threaded sms" a good thing, but certainly better if users are given a choice setting...<br />
<br />
Regards..<br />

As explained, WM6.1 already has SMS Threaded Messages...<br />
<br />
From checking on the net, Moto Q9c is bundled with WM6.0 ( unless upgraded to 6.1 as your thread heading suggested )<br />
<br />
So, if you have upgraded to 6.1 and still do not see threaded SMS, then problem with upgrading ?<br />

<p>Is there any other way to disable the threading without going thru the registry?&nbsp; Like, is there a software that can be downleaded to turn it on or off?&nbsp; Threading is ok if you are chatting.&nbsp; But if not, it is very irritating if you have to
 scroll thru the thread especially when the messages are not related at all.</p>

<h2>            VSL AddIn with MSI Installer does not work with Visio 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Years ago I wrote an AddIn for Visio2003 with some stencils, a template and functions in a vsl file. I used the SDK publish tool to create a proper MSI file.</span></p>
<p><span>Right now my customer wants to update to Visio 2013 and I can’t figure out why my installer is not working anymore. Unfortunately I decided (10 years ago) to use Delphi 5 to create the vsl (DLL) file and MakeMSI for the installer. So I am not using
 much of the Microsoft tool chain.</span></p>
<p><span>Now my problem is, that VSL file is not showing up in AddOns after installation. The VSL itself is actually working because when I add the install folder to the ADD-Ons path I see all my functions and they are working.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e90420c-9e2c-4498-add7-818ea42de06a" /></p>
<p><span>I checked the PublishedComponent table and played around with LCID, VisioVersion and Edition in the Visio 2013 Solution Publishing Tool – but without success.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca7b747e-3974-44f3-bab0-2acbc83f0601" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac734c37-f380-491e-b848-5b62270fe374" /></p>
<p><span>Also the Registry entries seem to be all right because the stencils and the template are correctly installed. The SDK VSLs show up in the same registry entry...
</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/710c74f0-02ef-409d-85b7-99d3ff9c4452" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The MSI file is not working with Win7 nor with Win8 - I tried it on two computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope someone can give me a hint what I can try next.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you in advance</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers</span></p>

<p><span>yes, if you goto the "<strong>Settings</strong>" then, "<strong>System</strong>" tab then , "<strong>Memory</strong>" then "<strong>Storage Card</strong>" tab then you have&nbsp;four choices;</span></p>
<p><span>One is; "<strong>Storage Card</strong>". Two is "<strong>iPaq File Store</strong>" and three; "<strong>Network</strong>" of which I found out is Memory setup thru Network on a "Network Computer" of which I
 am still trying to find out how to setup? This new option came when I upgraded to new and latest "<strong><em><u>Activesync 4.5.0 build 5098</u></em></strong>" I am looking for a step by step info.</span></p>
<p><span>The number four option has a tab which says "<strong>Memory</strong>" only?</span></p>
<p><span>Detailed descriptions on tabs;
<strong>1st</strong> "<strong>iPaq File Store</strong>" which I have 8.35mb of 12.56mb in use.
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>2nd</strong> is "<strong>Storage Card</strong>" which I have a 4gb SD card and list 3087.1mb used of 3813.53 and 726.32mb Free.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>3rd</strong> is "<strong>Network</strong>"&nbsp; 0.0mb in use and 0.0mb Free, because I don’t have a "Network drive" associated yet.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>4th</strong> is "<strong>Memory</strong>" and is blank? And I have yet to determine how and what this is?</span></p>
<p><span>Any info&nbsp; on "<strong>Network</strong>" and "<strong>Memory</strong>" tab would be appreciated.</span></p>

<p>It's on the screen below 'run rules now' - it used to work, it seems like - why put it there and make it unavailable?</p>
<p>Well I'm trying to post to UserVoice, but it's just spinning...</p>
<p>I'd also like to know why there are no folder control options in Outlook.com. Mine are a mess, and there is no option to just work with folders.</p>
<p>Also, it is a real inconvenience to have to scroll allllllllllll the way to the bottom of the folders in order to add a new one.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to post those 2 in UserVoice if the page ever reloads~</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have a MacBook Pro (Mojave OS). Ever since I updated my OS, Skype isn't detecting the inbuilt camera of the laptop (the camera does work with Photo Booth and other apps). When I go to the Video settings, 'Facetime HD Camera' (which is the only option)
 is selected. But the camera doesn't turn on. I tried reinstalling Skype. Didn't help. Any solutions?</p>

            Hi Shameer65
<br />
<br />Mojave OS contains new security features, you must give Skype permission to access your Camera . . .
<br />
<br />Select System Preferences from the Apple menu
<br />
<br />Choose the Privacy tab
<br />
<br />On the left side, click Camera to manage app permissions.
<br />
<br />Tick the box next to Skype to grant access to the camera
<br />
<br />That's It!

<h3> jeff998  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 13  &#34;unknown error 0x800CC97&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Outlook suddenly starting giving me an "Unknown Error<span> 0x800CC97" message when it checks for email.&nbsp; It is able to send email OK; the error results from trying to receive mail.&nbsp; I've checked my mail from the web, bypassing Outlook, and I'm
 receiving mail fine there.&nbsp; Outlook eventually downloads the message, but it takes 30-60 minutes before it does.&nbsp; Then I get a message saying that "The following email messages on the mail server cannot be downloaded.&nbsp; Contact your Internet service provider
 or mail administrator if you continue to receive this error." 1544837012.14208.atl4qibmail02pod4,S+129090"</span></p>
<p><span>Web.com says the problem is with Outlook, since the web-based mail works fine.&nbsp; I deleted emails that came in just before the error messages started in case they were the problem, but I'm still getting the error message.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried the MS repair tool, and I've tried re-indexing, but no luck.</span></p>

<p>I was finally able to solve this problem.&nbsp; Someone suggested to me that I go to my web.com webmail page and delete everything.&nbsp; By cleaning out every last email in there, Outlook began operating normally.&nbsp; As is typical with tech support people, the Web.com
 techs insisted that the problem was with Outlook and could not be on their end.&nbsp; They were wrong.</p>

    <title>printing a .jpeg on Excel Online&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            printing a .jpeg on Excel Online&#63;</h2>
                    I have an excel spreadsheet with a .jpeg in it (a small version of the company logo). When I go to print the online excel document, the .jpeg image does not show (pdf reveals a blank area, no logo visible). How do I get the company logo to show up while
 printing? Thanks.

<p>Hi <strong>online_excel1</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let’s have this concern isolated first so we’ll know if it’s due to the web browser being used, the image itself, or the Excel file may be corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you confirm if the Excel file is <strong>created directly from Excel Online</strong> or is it
<strong>saved from OneDrive</strong>?</li><li>Was the logo added as an inserted image? If not, please specify how it was placed in the file.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I’d suggest that you try downloading the file from Excel Online and print it through the Excel desktop app. Once done, check if the issue persists. Check this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/save-a-copy-of-a-workbook-to-your-computer-fbf8a97b-2c6d-4fe5-994d-06ed8e632051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for the steps on how to save it to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you may try using <strong>another web browser</strong> and access the same Excel file, then print it from there. In this way, we’ll know if it’s due to the cache of the browser you’re using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>

            Thanks for the response.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I retried it and have some more info for you:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The original document was generated in Excel, not Excel Online. I used a different browser, the problem remained.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I re-inserted the logo image, but when I went to Print (to pdf), it was still not there.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I downloaded a copy to my desktop, opened it in regular Excel, and printed to pdf, and the logo image was there successfully.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, my regular Excel is unlicensed and opening the copy through it was difficult.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Are there any other solutions you can think of besides the clunky work-around I just did?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks again.

<p>Thanks for standing by on this concern. Based on what was mentioned, you’ve encountered the same behavior as you’ve re-inserted the same logo image. In line with this, I’d like to confirm if you’ve already tried inserting a
<strong>different logo </strong>or <strong>image</strong> in JPEG format. If yes, does the issue persists?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven’t done it yet, you may try to do so. In this way, we can isolate if the issue is with the image itself or could be related to the printer driver of your device.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open Word document</h2>
                    I am trying to open a word document on Word 2016 with Windows 10 and it keeps saying I moved, renamed, or removed the document. I did neither of these things. I had selected enable editing on a document and saved it. To be sure I closed it then opened
 it again and my work was still there. But today it is not.

            Are those documents on OneDrive by chance? Is the document a shortcut link instead of the actual document? You can find out by right clicking the document and going to properties. What does it say?

3. Is this file still there? But shortcut can not open..
4. If not, please check the recycle bin.
5. If Yes, can you right click on the shortcut link &gt; And from properties see the path of the file.

<p>Yes it was opened from email. I'm not sure what location. It only pops up as recent when I right click on Word. The shortcut won't open but the document name is there. It tells me my only option is to delete it.&nbsp;</p>

            When attachments are opened in Outlook, they get saved in temporary folder. If you want to retrieve it, you should be able to retrieve from there. 

You can follow the below help guide to know where is the temporary folder.
