<h2>            Word Auto-Fill in multiple locations</h2>
                    I have a large document and I have a couple of variables that are inserted in multiple locations. For example, I want the client name to be inserted 12 different places throughout the document. Is it possible for me to create a placeholder and in all 12
 locations and then in one place type the name of the client and have all 12 places automatically update? Then when I work on the document for a new client, I can change the value 1 time and all 12 change? I can't seem to find this online. Thanks.

            <p>If the source of the clients name is in a paragraph among other text, change the unique style for the style reference to a Character Style. Mark the source name as this unique character style. Also update the StyleRef field to the new name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To update the other references press the following:</p>

 All,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to utilize headings to make an accessible syllabus for my course (Word 16 on a Mac). &nbsp;My third heading is ROGUE.
</p>
<p>It is listed as "Heading 3" and to modify the heading&gt;paragraph&gt;outline it shows up as level 3, but it WILL NOT show up in my navigation pane. When I go to outline and select my heading, it is listed as "body text". &nbsp;It seems like it would be a simple change
 from body text to level 3, but then the entire paragraph is converted to Heading 3 level 3 and EVERYTHING appears in my navigation pane. &nbsp;No bueno.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going nuts trying to figure this out. I assume it's because the headings are at the start of the paragraph? But why does it still register as Heading 3 without the appropriate level? and why does it SAY it's level 3 in the&nbsp;modify the heading&gt;paragraph&gt;outline
 section? Is there a break I can insert between the heading and the paragraph to separate them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>....SOS HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: the note in the photo is supposed to be pointing out that it says "body text" for the highlighted header in the upper&nbsp;<em>left</em> hand corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emily&nbsp;</p>

            The Navigation pane displays <strong>Paragraph Styles</strong>: styles that are applied to an entire paragraph. When you apply Heading 3 to just the first few words, you are using it as a
<strong>Character Style</strong>, where only the font characteristics are a used. So it doesn't show in the Navigation Pane.&nbsp; You would have the same issue if you created a Table of Contents for your document.

            <p>I answered your question in the second paragraph. I didn't go into more detail, because it was clear that you are a novice and I would have to write a small novel to explain all the various possibilities to you and get more detailed response from you. You
 may want to contact your webmail provider for an explanation (if it is Hotmail, go here:
<a href="http://windowslivehelp.com/product.aspx?productid=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowslivehelp.com/product.aspx?productid=1</a>) or ask a friend who's more advanced with email messages to have a look at your mail and explain why you couldn't forward the pictures.</p>
<p>Once again, this has nothing to do with IE or any browser. (You know, this forum is about IE.)</p>

@ Jeri</p>
<p><br />
Kai's question does have a point of interest for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably you didn't type all those words as they appeared; so, can you remember the sequence of steps that you used to create your post?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such strange, obviously computer generated Subjects appear occasionally
 and I'm not sure that anybody really understands how they happen that way.</p>
<p>BTW I agree with the suggestion to try the Hotmail support portal if that is your E-mail client.&nbsp; However, be aware that you would then be joining a long line of puzzled (to put it mildly) users.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is nothing in your description which would
 help anybody help you very much.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, why do you think that your E-mail account has the problem and not your friend?&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. if your friend is using WLMail for her E-mail client she might be in an another long line of "puzzled" users.&nbsp;&nbsp; Etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>

This "site" (forum) is about IE9 in Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussions about WLMail would be off-topic here, unless you could at least word&nbsp;a question in a way which would try to show that IE was at fault.<br />
</p>

Why didn't you reply to the responder who was trying to help you?&nbsp;&nbsp; You did ask in the correct forum then, though it would probably have helped if you had clarified that your issue was in WLMail.</p>

    <title>How many records will an Access 2000 database hold&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zipone  say:</h3>
<h2>            How many records will an Access 2000 database hold&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have several Access 2000 databases that I sell on ebay.&nbsp; I have been asked various times "How many records will the program hold?"&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Can someone tell me what determines the number of records that can be entered in a database?&nbsp; Is it depended
 on the computer's memory size, the disk space, or what?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Phil</p>

            <p>There is no specific limit on the number of records in an Access database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The maximum file size of an Access database file (.mdb) is 2 GB, and the maximum size for any individual table within a database is 1 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The maximum size of a single record within a table is 2 KB (excluding memo fields and OLE object fields). So if all records are maxed out, a table could hold 1 GB/2 KB ~ 524288 records. But if the records are smaller, the number of records can be (much)
 larger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remark: when you approach the limits, the database becomes unwieldy, since Access needs some free space within the database as temporary storage for data manipulation. It's best to compact the database from time to time and to stay well&nbsp;within the limits.</p>

<h2>            Send new password to new email to recover old account&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been trying to recover my password to an account that I have not signed into in over months. I have tried filling out the forum and provide enough information but each time I get an email back saying that I have not provided enough information.
 I have tried contacting agents with outlook and they have told me that I much call Microsoft to have them escalate my problem. The thing is, I do not have a working phone therefore I cannot call to have this escalated. It is important that I access my account
 as soon as possible. Can a new password be sent to an alternate email for me to reset my old password to access my old email?</div>
                </div>

None of those options help me. Why can't someone just send me a new password so I can get into my account? This is becoming frustrating.

If you need help with regaining access to your account, the options given are the only way of getting it. One of them is bound to fit your situation.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Why can't someone just send me a new password so I can get into my account?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Sensitive passwords should <strong>never</strong> be sent by email. See here: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Help protect your account</a><br />
<br />
You must first prove that the account in question does indeed belong to you. When you have done so, you will be sent a code to an alternative address to enable you to access your account again. Otherwise, anyone having access to your account - e.g. a hacker
 - could take over your account permanently and use it for his own nefarious purposes.</p>

<p>How long its been on charge ? Do you see the charging icon when you put on charge ? Does it at least give vibration when you try switching it ON ?&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Leave on charge for about an hour and see if it switches ON ..</span></p>
<p><span>If problem remains and if you are still using the original Battery, you may have a look at replacing it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If problem remains, try a Hard Reset ( Press Green, Red, Camera keys together and while keeping them pressed, switch the phone ON. Leave the keys only when you see Nokia Logo. You may require a few tries to get it right..) with the resultant effect of losing
 all your data since it will wipe <strong>all</strong> from the Phone Memory.</p>

    <title>Cortana for Android - to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> firespin02  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana for Android - to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So I currently have the Insiders version of Cortana for Android on my Android devices. I downloaded it from the Play Store on my phone, and by APK on the rest of my devices. Recently, the Android mirror notifications option for Insiders appeared, so I activated
 it. Although, my notifications are not appearing on my temporary Windows 10 laptop. I'm not sure if it is because it's a new feature, the laptop version isn't updated, I'm on the Insiders preview, I have more than one device, or something else?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We realize your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mirror notification feature which you're referring might be a new feature which is a part of Android. Currently there is no such feature available with PC. I also see you telling that your laptop isn't updated to the latest build. Also not sure which
 build is installed on your device. Suggest you to check updating your laptop to the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build&nbsp;to see if it makes any difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can follow Windows Blog for information about the features and updates that are rolled out with the latest builds. Go with the below link for the same.

 (assuming there was no update --it happened a couple of months ago). &nbsp;I do have an office 365 subscription.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for sharing the file with us.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tested the document from our side. The Undo and Redo functions worked well. So, I think the issue should be only related to specific device. You may try editing the file
 in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode </a>to see the outcome.

​</p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, please share with us other information mentioned in my last post. Moreover, we appreciate it if you can provide us with some screenshots about the
 issue (“undo literally wipes out all (most?) changes from the document without any way to redo”). These screenshots can help us understand the symptom more clearly.

G'Day All, Some good stuff here but not sure if it helps me - I have sync problems with my inbox - quite simply it tells me sync failed - no error code or anyother indication of the issue. I have minimal emails in my inbox and will try the option of removing
 all but 1 or 2 smaller mails however i'm not sure whether this will help - Any other suggestions? BTW Contacts sync successfully, i can access messenger, it's just my inbox that won't sync... Thanks!!

<p>You can turn off real time protection but you will still have MSE services running in the background. This should not affect your gaming performance unless your system is really low on ram.</p>

            Don't know that you're necessarily doing anything wrong :-) Do the shadows appear when viewing the document on screen?<br />
<br />
Which specific template are you using?<br />

Is Office fully updated [14.2.4]?<br />

<div>as I keep on receiving the error message as stated, i.e. 'Word could not create the work file. &nbsp;Check the Temp environment variable.'</div>
<div>Although it says you receive the message when attempting to save, in my case I receive it upon opening the Word program itself, which only began last Thursday, February 18. &nbsp;It happened when I moved the temp file to its default location, as prompted by
 the program for troubleshooting. &nbsp;And then after that, I had really serious troubles apart from the message stated here.</div>
<div>I already uninstalled the yahoo toolbar (as it was giving me problems already way before this disaster happened) and now, I've resetted my Internet Explorer settings, but then I still received the error upon opening the file.</div>

<h2>            Google Project Fi</h2>
                    <p>I was just searching the internet and discovered Google's Project Fi. The concept is intriguing but I am a Microsoft fan, I like the concept of using Windows and Microsoft software (Office, Outlook, Edge, OneDrive, Groove etc.) across Microsoft devices.
 The devices are Phone, Tablet, Laptop and Desktop; its what Windows 10 was designed to do. My question though is : Does Microsoft offer anything similar to Googles Project Fi ? I like everything about that project, except its not Microsoft software. Discussion?</p>

    <title>Text to Speech voice change problem with Microsoft Word 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bbpatel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Text to Speech voice change problem with Microsoft Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to change the text to speech voice in windows 8.1 so that it reflects and reads aloud my text in Word 2013. I can change the voice in Speech Properties to the voice I want, but when I return to Word and click the 'Speak Selected Text'
 button it always uses the Microsoft Hazel Desktop. I have also tried using the narrator settings dialog to change the voice but same outcome. An MS AnswerTech asked me to use Word online repair which also didnt work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as to why Word cant dictate using the selected voice? Is this a Word or Windows problem?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running as Admin but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing the voice selection many times to different voices, but still always plays in MS Hazel Desktop. I want MS Zira Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I select a different voice, the preview gives the correct sound, but when returning to word its always MS Hazel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, a weird thing is that when I select another voice and change the voice speed, the speed in word also changes to what I selected but with the Hazel voice?!!</p>
<p>So only the voice selection problem is occuring.</p>

            <p>I also have this issue except I want Hazel TTS not Zira or David, both of which are grating to my ears.</p>
<p>Using Win 8.1 and Word 2013.</p>
<p>I have tried all the above with no luck</p>
<p>I read elsewhere it may be related to the proofing language. Added UK and no luck. Made UK default language and no luck. I have not actually deleted U.S. english as I kind of need it, being in the USA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note I have also tried to use the save as Daisey plug in. It only uses the Zira voice for some reason.</p>
<p>I have not found any way to make this work&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my Office subscription trial expires, I will look elsewhere for a solution that works.</p>

            Running as admin did not work. However, finding the text-to-speech properties in Control Panel and changing there did work. For some reason, text-to-speech settings in Windows 10 appear to not affect settings in control panel. This is an annoying redundancy.

<p>Finally my PC no longer sounds like Steve Hawkins.&nbsp; I can confirm that this method fixes the&nbsp;read aloud&nbsp;in MS Word using Win 10, build 14342 on my laptop.&nbsp; However, not all voices worked.&nbsp; David and Zira works but Hazel does not change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To test open WORD and highlight a paragraph, press the read aloud icon.&nbsp; Stop reading (click again).&nbsp; Go to settings as given ABOVE not Cortana's.&nbsp; Adjust speed and voice and press APPLY not OK.&nbsp; Back to word retest.&nbsp; Did it work, is speed ok?&nbsp; No back to
 settings, adjust and APPLY.&nbsp; Word retest....&nbsp; When ok back to settings and finally press ok to close the settings panel.</p>

 and double underlines appear, but when we print the page they don't print. &nbsp;This doesn't happen to all of our spreadsheets, in fact, within the same workbook some spreadsheets print just fine and others are missing the underlines. &nbsp;Nothing else seems to be
 missing. &nbsp;I have recently, discovered that it seems to be related to the page setup. &nbsp;If we change the scaling on the pages we are having trouble with to 99%, then the underlines print. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this doesn't really help, because we need to be able to
 get all the information on one page. &nbsp;Is there some kind of a fix for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>One of the more common reasons to see these weird printing artifacts is the printer driver. What type of printer are you using, and what printer driver? If you connect to a different model printer and print with the most up-to-date drivers available for
 that other printer, what happens? You can also use virtual print drivers to test, for example try printing to a PDF file from a 3rd party PDF creation program like Adobe and look at the resulting PDF (you might also try the built-in PDF export function, but
 I wouldn't rely on that as an end-all, beat-all analysis).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a different version of Excel, but we had a similar problem and our workaround was to print to a PDF, then print the PDF to our normal printer and got the expected hardcopy. Not ideal, but our expensive, large corporate MDF didn't have any drivers
 that actually worked with the nuanced formatting in our documents. Maybe if you find better results with a different printer you can just go that way instead.</p>

<h2>            Outlook cannot always connect to the server</h2>
                    Sometimes when I open Outlook I get an error message that says "Cannot connect to server" and gives me the option to see the details. I have tried changing the server ports as my email provider told me, however it has not made a difference and is also
 tedious! I am using Outlook 2010 using an imap account.
