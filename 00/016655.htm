<h2>            Nokia 701 &#40;or Belle&#63;&#41; missing features and network connection I&#36;&#36;ue&#36;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to own a 5800XM that worked great, then bought a 701 to be able to run all the new apps and take advantage of the new Nokia Belle OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, little disappointment... First,<u><strong> I can't update to 111.030.0609 from 111.020.0307 - apparently because I have an Italian phone.</strong></u> Model number appears to be 059L499, Type RM-774.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, I noticed that <u><strong>data connections (WiFi as well as GPRS/UMTS) are NOT listed in the call log</strong></u>, as they used to be with my old (but good) 5800xm. This is a hell of a problem because I'm
<u><strong>not able to track down data connections that cost me money</strong></u>... and there we go:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I configured my Hotmail mailbox, then tried to set up NOT to do automatic retrievals... but apparently, every now and then,
<strong>it will connect and actually update, without permission</strong>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another data connection issue: in my old (but good) 5800xm, I could configure each access point to be used automatically or after confirmation. I used to set up wifi connections to be automatic, while I requested confirmation for GPRS/UMTS ($$$) destinations.
 Now this setting is GONE, and my 701 will decide autonomously when to connect, without asking me...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if I don't want my phone to become a money hog, I have to deactivate data connection manually, that I don't find very practical as for my user experience...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another issue, not as relevant, is with the Note app: if I open a note and try closing it without actually modifying its content, I actually save it with a new timestamp, as if it was changed. No big issue, just annoying when it comes to synchronization...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would consider all the networking issues as bugs. Hope the new firmware will come and fix. Anyone with latest version of Belle could confirm?</p>

<p>Too bad to hear you have not been totally happy with your new device. You can check from
<a href="http://mea.nokia.com/appmanager/UnitedArabEmiratesEnglishNOKIA_MEA_EN_31/Get_support;JSESSIONID_NCOM=syD2TpQR452hTmJgGbzQjNYhJ21jJJhc3kkB78sLqSlp87fpLQ0p!2117833618?_nfpb=true&amp;_windowLabel=T547708376801303715779666&amp;_pageLabel=P4285981&amp;wsrp-urlType=blockingAction&amp;wsrp-url=&amp;wsrp-requiresRewrite=&amp;wsrp-navigationalState=&amp;wsrp-interactionState=_action%3D%2Fpageflows%2FSoftwareVersion%2FgetVersion&amp;wsrp-mode=&amp;wsrp-windowState" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;what is the latest SW version available for your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To change the priority of the access points go <strong>Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; Settings &gt; Network destinations &gt; Internet &gt; Long press wanted access point &gt; Change priority</strong>. You can set WiFi connections to be priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not wish the phone to connect to internet without your permission, please set all synchronisations to manual or off.</p>

<p>Hi Jampe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish to thank you for your answers. I'm trying to get used to the new Belle interface, thus sometimes I can't do what I was used to on my 5800 XM. Besides, my new 701 is working great, I'm just trying to get past some issues - fixing or getting used to
 them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to work out the "Admin settings" solution but I already set it up to be "when needed" and not "when available". And I already set up wifi to be higher priority than 3G access points. My previous experience was a prompt whenever an app was trying
 to connect using any of my 3G access points, that were set to be used "after confirmation". Since this setting isn't there anymore, I assume they're all set to be used "automatically", that means I don't have control unless I manually switch data connections
 off by means of the notification area icon. Someone might like this new way of controlling connectivity, I don't. Sorry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the e-mail retrieval. I had already configured all synch/retrieval options to off/none, so I removed and re-added my hotmail account (I have an Exchange Active-Sync account as well, that works properly). Kinda think the problem's somehow bound to the
 homescreen widget, because it looks like my phone connects to the network whenever I switch to the homescreen that contains that particular widget... that leads to the unavailability of the widget's offline mode :-(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the data tracking utility, I found something that summarizes usage (say, provides a report of Mb/day or Mb/month) but no actual logger... can you suggest some free app, maybe in private?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a last subject, I checked the link you provided to verify update availability, and it actually reports 111.020.0307 for my product code (059L499). I just can't understand why some devices in my country (a friend of mine has a C7) can update to 111.030.0609,
 and others can't take advantage of the new features (like MS Apps).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm coming back to this post in a couple of days to tell what's up with my mail and network issues. Sorry I'm not marking this as solved, because most of the issues I pointed out are still there...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again. Your answer means that Nokia IS there!</p>

<p>You are welcome, happy to help as much as I can! Hope you get used to the new operating system after a while and learn to like it more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I can't suggest other applications than those found from Nokia Store, they are safe to install and use.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to remove the email widget and see if it makes a difference. If it does, then that is the reason for the random retrieval schedule.</p>
<p><br />
<span>The reason why you have not got the update could be that your service provider has not approved the update, if you have operator locked device.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Tried to remove the email widget. It's the widget that connects to the network when I switch to the homescreen that contains it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even in the mail app itself, I noticed a difference between Exchange/ActiveSync mailboxes and other (Hotmail, in my case). The first will NOT connect until I open it AND press the synch button. The second will synch upon opening, even if I didn't tap the
 synch button and configured it not to do automatic retrievals. This could be worth a fix...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the update, I bought an unbranded phone to avoid these issues... Should I be bound to providers will anyway? :smileysad:</p>

<p>Thanks for your feedback regarding to the mailbox functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you don't have an operator locked device, I don't know why the update is not available for your product code. You could contact your local
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Care point</a> and ask if there is something they can do. In this case the update availability does not depend on operators.</p>

<p>Hi Jampe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pleased to notice that Belle FP1 doesn't show the hotmail widget issue I mentioned in my earlier posts. Now I can configure it for manual only retrieval, and the widget itself doesn't make network connections unless I accidentally tap on one mail item
 - so I can consider solved my issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>If you have not updated to FP1 I suggest you do.Your 701 will work faster :). It is not yet available to update thro' Nokia suite;you have to use OTA. Use software update option from your phone and keep 3G enabled.</p>

<h2>            Deleted files on OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Good day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm honestly so lost and have no idea what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the first time OneDrive has deleted a file on me, however this time it was an entire folder. An entire folder filled with years of my writing. It holds sentimental value, and I'm quite upset with losing the majority of my work twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the search option on both mobile and PC.</p>
<p>I have no other accounts other than my university account.</p>
<p>I have searched the recycle bin.</p>
<p>I have not touched that folder in god knows how long; I didn't delete it myself.</p>
<p>The files are still in my history on word, but when i try to open them it says the folder was moved or deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply put, I want to know if there's any way to retrieve these files.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Eoin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making documents as read-only avoids accidental deletion or modification. It allows everyone to continue reading and copying the contents, but not to change the document in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a document has been made read-only, only the owner or those with Write privileges can remove the designation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to properly isolate your issue and provide an appropriate resolution, kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you the owner of the files in the OneDrive folder?</li><li>Are the files on OndeDrive shared with other users?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

            Are you using the 64-bit version of Excel 2010? If so, it's possible that the add-in uses 32-bit API calls and those won't work with 64-bit Excel.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you rename your account? Or, did you only alter the interface from old to new @outlook.com?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do the latter, then, you can switch back to old Hotmail interface by going on your Inbox page and click on the gear icon beside your name and select
<strong>Switch back to Hotmail</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you decided to&nbsp;rename your account and wants to go back to the old email address, I would like to informed you that once did it, your old account will automatically be an alias of your new email address. The only way to get back to it as a regular
 account to by removing it as an alias. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can do so by following the instructions provided on this <strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-profile/i-renamed-my-microsoft-account-to-an-outlook-or-a/c929c421-8cba-45c9-85b6-5f0e2ce08b60">link</a></strong>.</p>

                    I keep getting emails with @gmx.de, @gmx.net. I have tried using the domain block on Outlook but it doesn't work. Is Microsoft outlook like yahoo allowing scammers or is it that Microsoft just doesn't care or does not have the technology? I will move to
 gmail the moment I get three more of this and if Microsoft does not act in time.&nbsp; Google does a better job and how long have they been around compared to Microsoft?

            Dear Eboto,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Nowadays some scammers have learned how to mask their emails addresses that you can see in the emails. However, in the message source you will find the real one (and the real domain) In order to view message source please check this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiving-email-from-blocked-senders-in-outlook-com-265923a0-b52c-4157-92c8-370385215da1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiv...</a>
<br />
<br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users.
<br />
<br />Please note that Postmaster ( <a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a> ) is actually blocking lots of spammers ( and I quote ):
<br />For example, we've implemented a number of mechanisms to reduce the burden of junk email which currently prevents nearly 4.5 billion email messages from reaching Outlook.com users every day!
<br />
<br />There are couple of ways to deal with scammers and unwanted emails and improve how your anty filter will work (I am sure that you are aware of some and you are using them, but maybe additional information in support articles will help you):
<br />
<br />1. First of all check your spam filters and see suggestions on how to keep spam out of your inbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a>
<br />2. Report the phishing, spam and unwanted emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />3. Add emails or domains to block sender (those that were actually used to send emails - see #5) list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />4. Create specific rules for subjects or common phrases that are present in those emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a> and add conditions, that are common for those emails, for example additional keywords, recipient address includes etc.
<br />5. You can also use the option at the bottom <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/junkEmail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/junk...</a> to receive only trust email from addresses in my Safe senders and domains list and Safe mailing lists
<br />
<br />You can also check tips on how to stay safe online from Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/online-safety-resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this will help your email free from Junk!

    <title>Bug&#58; Snap grid spacing is incorrect &#38; does not match visible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j.h.d.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug&#58; Snap grid spacing is incorrect &#38; does not match visible grid pitch &#40;roundoff error&#41;</h2>
                    There is a bug in the implementation of the "snap to" grid function In powerpoint 2010.&nbsp; The spacing of the snap grid is slightly incorrect due to rounding of the grid pitch to three decimal places, and so does not match the visibly displayed grid (the
 one shown when "display grid on screen" is enabled.)&nbsp; The visible grid is correct.<br />
<br />
For example, when grid spacing is set to 1/24", the snap grid pitch is rounded from 0.04166... to 0.042.&nbsp; This is a relative error of one part in 125, so for every 126 visible grid pitches there are only 125 snap grid pitches.<br />
<br />
Steps to reproduce: &nbsp; (I have a slide that shows this problem, but there doesn't appear to be any way to upload it here.)
<br />
<br />
1) Set grid to 1/24, set grid visible<br />
2) Create 126 short vertical lines, on adjacent snap grid points<br />
3) Group them into a "ruler", and turn snap to grid off.<br />
4) Align the "ruler" to a major division of the visible grid.&nbsp; Notice that there are only 125 visible grid points spanning the same length as the 126 lines in the ruler.<br />
I haven't verified this, but there are similar complaints in the Word 2010 forum.&nbsp; This bug did not exist in Powerpoint 2003.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any idea how to submit a bug to MS on a released product?<br />

            No, that only works for the very few MS products that are "accepting bugs"; Powerpoint is not on the list.&nbsp; Guess that means it's been declared bug-free.<br />

            It isn't <em>sheet</em> protection, it's <em>Workbook</em> protection (specifically for Structure), which is applied separately. Have a look at the

    <title>Outgoing POP Email Shows Sent by Exchange Account on Behalf of POP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outgoing POP Email Shows Sent by Exchange Account on Behalf of POP Account</h2>
                    I'm having a problem with Outlook 2011 for Mac. I have an exchange account set up and three POP3 accounts. When I send an email from one of the POP3 accounts, the recipient receives an email with headers that say:&nbsp;
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>FROM:</b> me [mailto:exchange.email.address] <b>On Behalf Of</b> me</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It never shows the POP3 account email address, only the exchange one. If they reply to me, it comes in to the POP3 account but always shows my exchange account email address in the headers. This can be a problem as I have a POP3 email account I use for
 a small business and when I send people messages it shows my work email address in them. Not something I want it to do.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have the outgoing server set to the POP3 account server, I have tried setting the More Options authentication to require login with the user account for the Outgoing Mail server but it still does this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone have any solutions or suggestions?</div>
</div>

            <p>Hi ASin13,</p>
<p>When you have Exchange services configured with other services, Exchange will usually become the default service.
</p>
<p>The only thing that I can think of to try and bypass this behavior is to change the relay settings on the Exchange server. It sounds like you have relaying enabled and therefore when the Exchange service sees an address for smtp it assumes it can handle
 the email for you and is going to try and help to send the email because the capability is there.</p>
<p>Because I don't know what Exchange server you have and because this forum is not a server forum you might want to either test this theory on your own (if you know how to modify the settings) or you can check with the Exchange server forum and see if they
 can help. </p>
<p>Here is a link to the Exchange forums:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/exchange2010/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/exchange2010/threads</a></p>
<p>There are several forums to choose from you might try just stating with the Exchange Client one.</p>
<p>I am sorry I cannot help you with this further.</p>

            <div>Thank you for the reply. Unfortunately the company I work for uses a third-party hosted exchange system so I can't do anything on the server side. I'm running Outlook 2010 for Windows on a separate machine and tested the same set up. It does NOT do this
 same behaviour in Outlook 2010 so I think this is a Outlook 2011 for Mac issue, not an exchange issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any other thoughts?</div>

            Found something interesting. If I send an email out as a new email, it works fine. The proper POP3 email account is the only one listed. When I respond as a reply, that is when it goes out from the Exchange server instead of the POP3 account. I can duplicate
 it every time. Seems like Outlook 2011 is overriding the outgoing POP3 mail server on the reply and using the Exchange server by default. Any other ideas?

            No. It appears to be an issue with Outlook 2011 for Mac only. Limited audience so no solution or interest in trying to resolve. I have an IT firm trying to figure it out but they aren't having any luck either.

            <p>Hi ASin13!</p>
<p>I tested and i&nbsp;can't replicate the error. But there's an option in preferences &gt; composing &gt; format and account.</p>
<p>Check if "Reply and foward using the default e-mail account" is checked. If it is just uncheck it.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

            <p>I've seen that before with Gmail. You can send through the Gmail server for non-Gmail e-mails but it will add that string.<br />I really don't believe it's a string Outlook adds. It sounds to me like you are sending the e-mail out through the Exchange server for your POP account.<br />Can you double-check the account settings to make sure you are using a distinct SMTP server there?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corentin</p>

            <div>Hi Corentin,</div>
<div><br />
<div>The SMTP server setup for the POP accounts is entirely different and a third-party from the hosted exchange server. If I set up Outlook 2010 for Windows using the exact same settings, then this issue does not arise. It appears entirely seamless to the
 recipient that it came from the POP account. When set up for Outlook 2011 for Mac, something in the outgoing process on replies and forwards is causing this. As mentioned before, if I send a new email using the POP account, it doesn't occur, only on replies
 and forwards. That's why I think it is a issue with Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've come to realization that Outlook 2011 just isn't truly Outlook yet and continue to accept its deficiencies compared to the Windows version.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi Luke,</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d like to confirm where you downloaded the Office 365 student edition. Have you tried to download it from the
<a href="https://portal.office.com/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 portal</a>? If not, please give it a try and check whether the issue persists.</p>
<p>If there is no download option at the Office 365 portal, I suggest you check whether you can see The latest desktop version of Office by clicking View subscriptions at<a href="https://portal.office.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> My account page</a>.&nbsp; If you don’t see this
 option, please contact your school admin to assign you a proper license.</p>
<p>With the corresponding license, try to follow the steps under the topic “My account or product key doesn't work” in this article to troubleshoot the issue:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-installing-office-and-office-365-35ff2def-e0b2-4dac-9784-4cf212c1f6c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>hi fraser,</p>
<p>i have followed the steps you have provided and reinstalled office 365 from the portal. initally the issue seemed to be resolved, however last night i got the same issue "subscription expired to keep using word without interuption, please reactivate now".</p>
<p>i am shown as having an account in the "my account page". i previously had a different key which expired and was removed, although i am not sure if this is contributing to the problem.</p>
<p>see attached photo.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>hi luke,</p>
<p>based on the post, to determine whether this issue is caused by your old office key, let’s try the steps below to remove your office product key and reactivate office:<br />
1.run the following command in the command prompt window:<br />
<strong>office 2016</strong>: <br />
<strong>for 32 bit windows</strong>:<br />
cd c:\program files\microsoft office\office16 <br />
cscript ospp.vbs /dstatus</p>
<p><strong>for 64 bit windows</strong>:<br />

<p><em>%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office\Office15</em></p>
<p><em>%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\Office15</em></p>
<p>Then use the command with the corresponding path to check the licensing status.</p>

<p>Hi Luke,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Please try re-installing Office by following the step I shared above to acquire the ospp.vbs.</p>
<p>And, to focus on the situation of "Activating", could you check and share a screenshot of your license status at

<p>
</p><p>Key word for the answer is "online".&nbsp; SAVE AS works on the desktop version the way you expect. Have you ever been able get the online version to work as you though it would.&nbsp; The only way I know of is to do the SAVE AS immediately after you open the file
 online, then proceed to make the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The online versions of the Office application are "dumbed down". They don't have all of the features of the desktop versions.&nbsp; As well, as you noted, they automatically save changes almost immediately.&nbsp; So the original document is updated without any effort
 from you. Then when you SAVE AS, you are creating a copy of the already changed and saved version.

            <p>Hi Afreen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems your have corrupt Office 2013 x86 files located on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s try troubleshooting the issue and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstall all the remnants of Office 2013 using the FIXIT tool.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you have issues in running the <strong>FIXIT</strong> directly, you may save the file to the Desktop and then run the FIXIT tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have completed running the FIXIT follow these steps to delete the <strong>
Office 15</strong> folders.</p>
<ul>
<li>From Windows Explorer please navigate to the following location.</li><li><strong>C:\Propgram Files\</strong> or <strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\</strong></li><li>Make sure to delete the <strong>Microsoft Office 15</strong> folder. In case you are able to delete the folder then right-click on it and click on
<strong>Rename</strong>. Rename the folder as <strong>Microsoft Office 15 old</strong></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once all files are removed, restart the computer then install Office 2013 (x86 or x64) as desirable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the FIXIT does not help, then follow the manual troubleshooting steps to uninstall Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer to the article below which discusses the similar issue.</p>

            Sorry, I don't see anything in the log entry that helps identify the problem.&nbsp; All I can suggest is working through the following trouble shooting procedures:<br />
<br />
<div>
<b><span>How to trouble shoot Excel 2000-2007 start up problems

<p><b>NOTE:<span>&nbsp;
</span></b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth addin installed. Various BlueTooth addins have been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you
 have a BlueTooth add, disable it.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then try this more aggressive uninstall (followed by re-install) procedure:</p>
<p>Also uninstall Office Trial editions and any other Office-related programs such as "Office Activation Assistant" and any Office Viewer programs from the Programs applet in Control Panel.
 But you don't have to uninstall Office Starter if you have it. Then make sure to reboot TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo” at play here. We do it because it works!) after completing repair or uninstall.</p>

            I have tried all the ways&nbsp; you suggested for troubleshooting , but its ain't working for me !<br />
If this one is not in your logs then enter it and provide its solution if its available ,
<br />
One another thing do we have any parameter for&nbsp; max response time that if&nbsp; program is not able to get response from office file then it does crash ?<br />
i have read somewhere in blogs that 0.25 seconds are max wait time otheriwse program will behave abnormally resulting reporting of error
<br />
<br />
would u please tell me how windows explorer open the office file , this is what i know when opening file through command line with complete path , it opens office program and then load that file into it and it happens in great speed which user can't judge
<br />
<br />
but how it opens directly by windows explorer<br />
<br />
please suggest!<br />

            Whether you type in the command line, or double click on the file name in Windows Explorer, the basic process is the same after that:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>you provide a file name with a file extension, <br />
</li><li>Windows checks the registry to identify the program that is associated with that file extension.
<br />
</li><li>windows passes the file name to the program and opens it</li><li>the program goes through its startup procedure, loading addons and such ...<br />
</li></ul>
<p>Do you put quotes around the 2 pieces, the program and the file name, you need it if there are spaces as in the entry:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE11\EXCEL.EXE" "c:\book1.xls" <br />

            Sure, it could be a DDE problem, I just don't know.<br />
<br />
The error code c0000005 is a very generic windows error. Here is a search of the site for the code. Look through the results to see if there is a problem similar to yours:<br />

            Sorry, I know almost nothing about the mechanics of DDE. If found this one tip that contains all 3: DDE / Excel / File association . I have no idea if it will help you :<br />

<span>This is a partial fix. It will start separate Windows from the Start menu, but not if you use “File &gt; New” or “File &gt; Open”.</span></p>
<p><span>the solution involves making little changes in the registry so i recommend making
<b>back up</b> for just in case:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>start &gt; run &gt; regedit, navigate to:</span></p>
<div>
<p>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/Excel.Sheet.8/shell/Open/commend:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double Click on the “Default” key and add to end of the string so it looks like:</span></p>
<div>
<p>
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\EXCEL.EXE" /e "%1"</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right Click on “Command” key</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>choose "rename" and add something to the name&nbsp; - for example 2 (command2).
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Navigate to
</span></p>
<div>
<p>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/Excel.Sheet.8/shell/Open/ddeexec:</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right Click on the folder ddeexec and choose "rename" and add something to the name&nbsp; - for example 2 (ddeexec2)</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Navigate to
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/Excel.Sheet.12/shell/Open/commend:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double Click on the “Default” key and add to end of the string so it looks like:</span></p>

<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>choose "rename" and add something to the name&nbsp; - for example 2 (commend2).</span></p>
<p><span>no restart needed</span></p>
<p><span>Have Fun</span></p>
<p>It works with Office 2010 also. Just change ref from "Office 12" to "Office 14"</p>

<span>some other options</span></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>Have been using Excel 2010 for the past four weeks.&nbsp;Today, I went to open Excel&nbsp;documents in My Documents, I received the<i>problem sending the command to the program&nbsp;</i>message. I was able to open&nbsp;Excel files previously with no problem
 and I am able to open Word and PowerPoint documents without a problem. However, I am currently able to open Excel documents that are in Recent Workbooks. Suggestions please. Thanks!</p>
<p><span>Try the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. Browse to the following location:
<br />
</span>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office 14<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>32 bit <span>&nbsp;</span>2010<br />
C:\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>64 bit 2007</p>
<p>
<span>2. Locate the file EXCEL.EXE</span></p>
<p>
<span>3. Right click on the file and then click on the Properties option</span></p>
<p>
<span>4. Click on the Compatibility tab</span></p>
<p>
<span>5. Uncheck ‘Run this program in compatibility mode
</span></p>
<p>
<span>6.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Uncheck ‘Run this program as an administrator’ </span></p>
<p>
<span>7. Click Ok
</span></p>
<p>
<span>8.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Verify the status.</span></p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><span>I have developed exactly the same problem today and have carried out the steps outlined above. &nbsp;Neither of the checkboxes mentioned above were checked.</span></p>
<p><span>I found another suggestion to make sure "Ignore
<u>o</u>ther applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)" is <u>unchecked</u>. &nbsp;Sure enough, it was checked and this tip worked.</span></p>
<p><span>In 15 years of using Excel I've never turned that off so how did it happen?!</span></p>
<p><span>The only recent update was a Windows Live upgrade.</span></p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>

    <title>mouse snap to does not work for Office 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve16qo  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse snap to does not work for Office 2016</h2>
                    <p>The Pointers Options tab on the Mouse Properties window in Control Panel has a Snap To option. Its description is "Automatically move pointer to the default button in a dialog box". That feature worked as expected on my old Windows 7 desktop that ran Office
 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded to a new desktop running Windows 10 and Office 2016. The mouse Snap To function works on everything except Office. How do I get the mouse Snap To function to work for the Office 2016 applications such as Word, Excel, etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>To summarize my situation . . . </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 7 desktop computer that ran Office 2007 for several years. Mouse snap-to worked. I upgraded to Office 2016 last year. Mouse snap-to does not work for Office 2016 but does work for other applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months ago I acquired a Windows 10 desktop computer and installed Office 2016 on it. Mouse snap-to does not work for Office 2016 but does work for other applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone out there successfully using the mouse snap-to function with Office 16? Maybe the mouse snap-to function does not work with Office 2016 and I should give up on it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

                    <p>I have this perpetual error that comes up and will, If I 'm not careful and wait for it end up hanging up my computer because if it becomes hidden, other pages stop responding.&nbsp; have to manually close computer and start over. It comes up in a box and floats
 in front of the open screen.</p>
<p>I have xp pro, IE8 installed,</p>
<p>part of office is left, but a lot of other programs are gone and disc I have from Dell is no help.</p>
<p><strong>webpage error <br />

This webpage contains errors that might prevent it from displaying or working correctly.&nbsp; If you are not testing this webpage,</p>
<p>&nbsp;click No.&nbsp; do not show this message again. <br />
</p>
<p>the next box is grayed in and checked&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> use the built-in script debugger in Internet Explorer

<p>then I have boxes for two options </p>

<p>If click yes debugger comes up.&nbsp;&nbsp; screen opens and displays errors it says are on the page and the script
<br />
</p>
<p>If clickbox for :&nbsp;do not show this message again and then click no, <br />
it closes, but if you open a new tab it comes up again. </p>
<p>I had a severe infestation of trojans and virusus.&nbsp; After getting them removed (they invaded xp recovery wiped out msi files for works, money other microsoft programs...had to remove money as it permanently installed an email account user name that the email
 account was corrupted and shut down by microsoft as invaded (not one I use much) but I want to know how to fix.
</p>
<p>I wondered if removing and reinstalling IE 8&nbsp; again might fix it as it says that it is using&nbsp; IE built-script debugger.

<p>I can follow directions, but do not assume I am a "computer Geek"&nbsp; even though I did manage to get back most of my start menu.

            <p><span>Hi cararta,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 1</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you reset Internet explorer settings to default and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information refer the
</span></span><span><span><span>article</span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><b><span>How to reset Internet Explorer settings</span></b></span></p>

<p><span><b><span>Important</span></b></span><span><span><span>:
 Reset Internet Explorer to its default configuration. This step will also disable any add-ons, plug-ins, or toolbars that are installed. Although this solution is quick, it also means that, if you want to use any of those add-ons in the future, they must be
 reinstalled.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 2</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you create a new user account and check if the issue persists in the new user account.</span></p>

<p>Does this happen only when you try to filter on one particular field, or does it happen for all fields?&nbsp; Does it happen for all forms, or just for one form?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it happens only for one particular field, I suspect that the field name (or possibly the value filtered by), which is obscured in the image you posted, may be peculiar in a way that causes Access to think that the constructed filter is not valid.&nbsp; Are
 you sure that it "filters fine" despite the error?&nbsp; Look at the form's Filter property after the filter has been applied and see if it looks correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the field name or its filter criterion really private, such that you can't post them here?&nbsp; It's hard to see whether my suspicion is correct without any evidence to test it.</p>

</p><p>I am using VBA to help with data entry&nbsp;in excel.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sheet 1 is the data entry form and sheet 2 has a row for each record entered.&nbsp; When one record has been inputted the user clicks a command button and&nbsp;sheet 1 is reset for the next entry.&nbsp; The active cell in Sheet 2 moves down one row, ready for the next
 record to be pasted across.&nbsp; I would like to use option buttons in the form but can't work out how to change the cell link for record 2, record 3 etc.&nbsp; Can ActivecCell.Offset be used in some way for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help?</p>

<h2>            OneNote Syncing Error</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot sync any pages of a folder in one of my notebooks. I use OneNote on my Windows laptop and my Android phone, but no other devices. The rest of my notebooks sync fine otherwise. I haven't made any changes to some of the pages in this folder so I cannot
 understand why it suddenly will not sync.</p>

<h3> sandervan abeelen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your Account Does Not Allow Editing On A Mac &#124; Office 2016 &#47; 365 for Mac</h2>
                    
<p>Like a lot of forum members I get this error from within my Office applications;</p>
<p><br />
Dutch: "Met uw account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** **** u geen bewerkingen uitvoeren op een Mac."<br />
English: "Your Account Does Not Allow Editing On A Mac"</p>
<p><br />
After clicking use another account and login again with the same account the message is gone until the specific Office application is opened again.</p>
<p><br />
I tried a fresh installation of Yosemite 10.10.5 with only Office 2016 installed, same issue. Just installed the early build 15.19 (160206) » same issue.</p>
<p><br />
Since other topics had a lot of comments this happens in business environments I checked some 'business' things to see if that could cause the problem. All my Mac's are joined to Active Directory and I found that whenever they are using a network home the problem
 occurs. A account without network home does not have this problem!</p>
<p><br />
Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Sanderrr,</p>
<p>Have you tried the suggestions provided by Kerwin in this thread: 
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/153/t/406707 and this James' suggestion in this thread:
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/153/t/414101
</p>
<p>If the issue persists, to narrow down the issue, may I confirm the following information?</p>
<p>1. What’s the specific Office application? Do you mean the issue only occurs when you using Word, Excel or PowerPoint?</p>
<p>2. What do you mean by “network home”? Do you mean if you change to another network environment, the issue will not occur even though on a same Office application on a same Mac or do you mean if you change to another network on another Mac, the issue will
 not occur? If it doesn’t occur in another environment with the same account, the issue is not related to your account. In this scenario, if the issue occurs frequently, I need to collect some Office application logs from you for further investigation.</p>
<p>Please let me know the updates at your convenience.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Iris</p>

<br />
Tried all suggestions, same problem.</p>
<p>"1. What’s the specific Office application? Do you mean the issue only occurs when you using Word, Excel or PowerPoint?"<br />
<br />
Yes, all applications, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook have the same behaviour.
</p>
<p>"2. What do you mean by “network home”? Do you mean if you change to another network environment, the issue will not occur even though on a same Office application on a same Mac or do you mean if you change to another network on another Mac, the issue will
 not occur? If it doesn’t occur in another environment with the same account, the issue is not related to your account. In this scenario, if the issue occurs frequently, I need to collect some Office application logs from you for further investigation."</p>
<p>I believe Windows calls network home » folder redirection. So the user profile is not on the Mac itself but a fileserver.<br />
<br />
So to be clear, all on the same Mac:<br />
1. With a local account with a local home profile the issue does not occur. <br />
2. With a network account (Active Directory) with a local home profile the issue does not occur.<br />
3. With a network account (Active Directory) and a network home profile the issue occurs.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Sanderrr,<br />
<br />
In order to further investigate the issue, I'd like to collect the following logs:<br />
1.Go to the following path to get the Office 365V2 Log:<br />
<br />
<b>~/Library/Containers/com.micosoft.Office365ServiceV2/Data/Library/Caches/Microsoft/uls/ com.micosoft.Office365ServiceV2/logs</b><br />
<br />
2.Go to the following path to get Excel, Word, PowerPoint and Outlook for Mac application’s log:<br />
<br />
<b>~/Library/Containers/Com.microsoft.Outlook/Data/Library/Caches/Microsoft/uls/Com.microsoft.Outlook/logs</b><br />
<br />
You can go to the path above after replacing the Outlook with Word, etc.<br />
<br />
3.Gathering a system report by referring to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203001</a>&nbsp;<br />

<p>hi jiaxing,<br />
<br />
1. all based on a clean yosemite installation, updated to 10.10.5.<br />
2. install centrify free express to join to your active directory (because apple's active directory implementation is horrible). use the wizard to join.<br />
&nbsp;» <a href="http://www.centrify.com/express/identity-service/mac-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.centrify.com/express/identity-service/mac-edition/</a><br />
3. go to system preferences » centrify » local settings » home directory » use network home directory » network protocol to be used: smb.<br />
my smb share is on a windows server 2008 r2 system, with the authenticated users group having full access to the share.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=28bbe412-40d7-4f6a-bc02-b5250d237db9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d28bbe412-40d7-4f6a-bc02-b5250d237db9" /></a></p>
<p>4. admin groups » add domainusers, so users have admin rights on the mac.<br />
5. active directory settings for the network home, set your profile path like this, screenshot is in dutch, excuse me for that.<br />
centrify wants the path to e.g. \\data01\profiles\username set as //data01/profiles/username<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=88562d86-32ee-4595-b725-bfbdcd72f880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d88562d86-32ee-4595-b725-bfbdcd72f880" /></a><br />
6. reboot and login with your network account. try to activate office.</p>
<p>also i tried el capitan instead, now i get this error, maybe it helps to debug. please note the solution in the support article does not work either.<br />

<p><span>Dear</span><span><span>&nbsp;Gerard,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>From your description, it seems that copying the file content to a newly created file works fine.
 I suggest you check if the issue goes away when opening, editing and saving the new file with the Word 2016 for Mac application. If yes, I suggest you use the new one as the previous file may be corrupted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for your understanding.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Cliff</span></span></p>
