    <title>Windows 10 Pro Insider won&#39;t activate after motherboard - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Insider won&#39;t activate after motherboard replacement</h2>
                    <p>I replaced a faulty motherboard on my system (which took about 3 weeks due to delivery time).&nbsp; I got it up and running, but when I woke it up this morning, I saw the system had automatically updated to Windows 10 Insider Preview 16299.15 (rs3_release), and
 also showed an "Activation Required" message.&nbsp; When I tried to activate, I get a message "We can't activate Windows on this device as the previous version of Windows was not activated prior to upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; Go to the Store to buy genuine Windows.
 (0x803f7001)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 Preview when it first was released to the Insider program, and have never had activation problems.&nbsp; I had Windows 7 on the same system prior to this.&nbsp; I have product keys for Windows 7 and also received one when I first installed the
 Windows 10 preview.&nbsp; However none of these work.&nbsp; Please advise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you for your reply. I actually already tried that, and also contacted Microsoft support. They tried to troubleshoot remotely but couldnt fix it, and also said they don't support Insider builds. They directed me to post my issue here.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Joshua,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't state which version of the Insider Preview you are running.&nbsp; Home, Pro, Enterprise, etc. all have specific generic keys that may be entered to activate them.&nbsp; After entering the key for your specific version you will need to update the entries
 in your Microsoft account, confirming the new and deleting the old device.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John AC</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS:&nbsp; Whatever you do, do not lose the old W7 or the W10 'trade-in' keys.&nbsp; You will need them to maintain all your options should you decide to return to W7 or the Public Release version of W10.</p>

<p>Thanks John. I'm using Windows 10 Pro. I tried the generic key, and also deleted the old devices in my microsoft account. I can see the new device but cant see any option to confirm the new device. I tried my old Win 7 key and the keys i got with the Win
 10 preview edition back in 2015. All to bo avail. I also tried a SLUI 4 command to try a phone activation (maybe i could talk to someone) but that doesnt appear to be an option anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on how i can get phone or chat support for this (since Microsoft Support said they dont support Insider)? Is there a way to see the licenses attached to my Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Your issue is with the changing of the motherboard.&nbsp; In my fleet of HP notebooks,&nbsp; I can swap motherboards or replace a motherboard of equal specs and I do not lose activation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something else to consider is to give activation some time to catch up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I run an Enterprise which is a bit off the beaten path.&nbsp; I just ran it up from Public build to 16299.15 and it lost activation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I lost much sleep over it, the next day it
 activated on its own.&nbsp; This is the pattern on this Enterprise with each new build, it loses activation but catches up in a day or 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will not get&nbsp; much help from MS on Insiders.&nbsp; In a couple of days, we are going to public build with 16299.15.&nbsp; Might be a good time to do nothing.&nbsp; Go with the flow to see if activation catches up with you.&nbsp; If not,&nbsp; stop Insiders and get back to public
 build and then bug MS as a non-Insider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you should inform this group as to why the new motherboard and if you greatly increased the specs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Going by the message you got, a new motherboard&nbsp; does not always equate to a new PC requiring a new license.&nbsp;&nbsp; You current PC was an activated PC
 so Product Keys are sort of moot now.&nbsp; There seems to be a line in the sand with new motherboards.&nbsp; I don't seem to come to that line while you seem to have moved beyond it.&nbsp; There is also an activation troubleshooter as I recall.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.&nbsp; More specs might get you a better answer.</p>

<p>W10 activation applies to PC.&nbsp; In the normal event of things, a valid W7 or W8.1 Product Key was required to get the free upgrade to W10.&nbsp; W10 does not use Product Keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done several times what you have done and never lost activation.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would have been done several months ago so perhaps things have changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have fried several W10 installs.&nbsp; I just use the Media Creation Tool with the bootable USB and SKIP the request for Product Key and I&nbsp; get back to the latest Public Build.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have an Activated W10 but that is now being questioned.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The nice thing about W10 is that you can Clean Install as often as you wish since the PC itself is W10 Activated.&nbsp; It still remains that you have an Activation issue following the swap of a motherboard of equal specs.&nbsp; I think an non-activated W10 will still
 operate with just a couple of nags.&nbsp; A stop gap until you get a good solution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Thank you everyone for your help. I tried all of your suggestions, however was never able to reactivate. &nbsp;I realized that my bad motherboard had caused some overheating and data loss issues, which corrupted part of my registry, so I did a full clean install.
 That also would not activate. I believe my fundamental problem was installing the original windows 10 insider preview without ever having done the conversion from Windows 7 to Windows 10, so never actually acquired a usable license. &nbsp;The original preview had
 a license number, as did a &nbsp;subsequent &nbsp;installation, but maybe I missed &nbsp;an activation code &nbsp;between then and when they &nbsp;switched to digital licenses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;In the end I sucked it up and bought a retail license. Not happy, but shouldn't run into this problem again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thanks again for everyone's input.&nbsp;</p>

                    whenever i start my laptop, always shows "PC at risk" with red colour by Microsoft Security Essential and because of it my laptop runs very slow at start up.
<div>after approx 10 min. it again becomes green in colour and no more at risk.</div>
<div>what should be done to fix such problem?</div>

<h2>            Problem Signing In - Office 365</h2>
                    My .edu account was recently switched to Office 365 and now I can't sign in. &nbsp;When I try to sign in, I get an error that says my user ID does not exist. &nbsp;When I try logging in the old way at outlook.com, I get an error that says "this account cannot be

            Thank you Raju but ultimately the problem still exists of not being able to sign into Office 365. &nbsp;"My .edu account was recently switched to Office 365 and now I can't sign in. &nbsp;When I try to sign in, I get an error that says my user ID does not exist.&nbsp;"
<div><br />
<div>The very FIRST time I tried to sign in, it told me I needed to change my password because it was my first time logging in with Office 365. &nbsp;So I went through those steps, yet nothing happened. &nbsp;It continued to repeat the message to me, that I needed to
 change my password. &nbsp;Now, it tells me that my user ID does not exist.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any information would be appreciated.</div>

    <title>Malware Protection Engine update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamcosner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Malware Protection Engine update</h2>
                    <p>I work on a segregated network with no access to the internet. I use a downstream WSUS server to do updates, so I have no control over the content provided. I am getting hit for vulnerabilities in the Malware Protection Engine file on my scans, but there
 seems to be no way to update it. The Defender definition offline updates do not update the MMPE files, and there is no separate installer to update the engine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried exporting the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Definition Updates folder from a good online system, but it would not let me replace the files as Defender protects itself from tampering, even as the Local Administrator account. Is there a
 way around it?</p>

<h2>            Changing the default template of word 2013 and&#47;or removing the other default templates</h2>
                    <p>My employer&nbsp;has asked me to set up word 2013 for our company, using a specific template for all new documents created. It was easy enough to set up a single custom template for it, but now I must&nbsp;change the default normal.dotm template to be our custom template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second part seemed easy enough, however our company template has both the file name and author name in the footer of the document. Neither of these will update when normal.dotm is replaced with the custom template.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have been told that if I absolutely cannot change the default template to the company template, another solution would be to remove all of the default templates, leaving only the company template when creating a new document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would I go about completing either of these tasks with Word 2013?</p>

            If you are using the code from the Add-In, you need to attach the FileNew macro to the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N. You can also attach that macro to the NewFile QAT icon.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the phone is switched on, perform a soft reset by pressing both the <strong>
Volume down </strong>and <strong>Power button</strong> simultaneously for about 10-15 seconds until you feel a vibration. If phone keeps on restarting, unhook from WiFi connection, turn it off and then remove the MicrosSD card and switch it ON again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            i have the same problem... the phone will not start... and if i try the Volume - and power button it wont turn of. i have to remove the battery. this happened today.. might be a windows update.. i have it with windows 10.. i tried factory reset but the
 phone wont display the exclamation mark. I can get it to show the lightning with the gear but the Microsoft recovery tool will not work, it remains "Reading Device information" and does nothing else (Validated in 2 different PCs). I don't know what else to
 do. any other help would be appreciated. Thanks!!!

<p>Turn your phone off, hold 'volume up' and press the start button. The lightning bolt and gear icon should show up on the screen shortly, release 'volume up' button. The phone is now in a state where you can use the Windows Device Recovery Tool.</p>

<p><br />
When you connect the phone to the PC to use the tool it will not be detected.&nbsp; Select "My device was not detected." Navigate to your phone brand and Model as appropriate. Begin recovery.</p>

            I tested it in 2 different systems, i had an old 530 and was able to use it with the tool successfully. and my 650 works great on both pcs.. its just the 640 that showed the Microsoft logo and nothing more over night. i think it was a update..

<p>on my cingular 3125 phone, the windows media player locks up. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About&nbsp;every third or fourth time I try to use the media player, the menu shows that I have no music loaded onto the phone...and the media player functions freeze up unless I reboot the phone altogether. Is there a update available with this bug fixed - or
 is it just my phone that is doing this. Either way its a royal pain. </p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word  Refusing to Rotate Images &#40;MAC OS&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Word is no longer allowing me to paste in images and freely rotate them. If the image is in-line with text and the image is rotated, a grey border box surrounds the image. This has&nbsp;<em>never</em> happened to me before. If the image is wrapped in
 front of text, the image can not be rotated at all.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for updating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am testing in Insider Fast build 16.14, so if there was a bug it might have been already fixed. I am using Mac OS 10.10.5 (14F2511).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both Page Layout and Web Layout view I am able to rotate a picture that has wrapping set to In Front Of Text.</p>

</p><p>My version of Mac OS is quite old, though. You probably have a newer version. I have another Mac with 10.13 on it and will test tomorrow and see if the OS version makes a difference.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>InPrivate Filtering feature from Microsoft IE8 helps you prevent website publishers or content providers from collecting and gathering information about web sites you have visited during your private session.<br />
InPrivate Filtering feature analyzes the web content of the web pages you are visiting.<br />
It marks the the same content that is being displayed on a number of websites that may give the idea of a common item.<br />
And the InPrivate Filtering enables you to allow or to block the common content that might provide information about your browsing.<br />
As well as you can configure the InPrivate Filtering automatically block, you can also manually turn on and turn off InPrivate Filtering for the related content provider or third party web site.</div>
<div><br />
If you delete the data the computer will delete your browsing preferences.</div>
<div><br />
Read the article below for more information:<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 &#38; office 365 problem</h2>
                    I downloaded windows 10 one week ago. Without warning I lost all my personal folders and information. I have managed to reinstate them but only in "read-only" Although I have a 12 months subscription to Office 365 it has deactivated it and I seem to only
 be able to get to a page where I have to purchase again. What can I do and how do I go back to Windows 7. I was asked if I wanted to but when I tried I was told drivers had been removed and it therefore could not be done. I wish I had stayed with windows 7
 instead of accepting the upgrade.

            1. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />

7. Install latest Windows 10 cumulative update KB3081438 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3081438) which is released on 14-Aug-15. If you want to download standalone KB3081438 then you can download from http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Thanks.aspx?id=140.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
8. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
9. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Properties, In Compatibility tab, uncheck all options. Start the Excel again.<br />
<br />
10. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Run as Administrator<br />
<br />
11. Review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54<br />
<br />
12. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through1 Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.<br />
<br />
13. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
14. If above don't, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license keys ready before
 you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

    <title>Forms crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carolinevan gemert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forms crashing</h2>
                    We have developed a database to collect data for a study we are collecting in Vanuatu using&nbsp;Access 2010 version. First we had several problems trying to use sub-forms for data collection, so we decided to have a separate form for each section of data that
 we are collecting. At this stage I thought the problems were restricted to form design only. Now we are having issues with data entry using form view whereby the datbase crashes when trying to enter any data (in a 2007 version). I would be most grateful for
 any advice on how to fix this problems, preferably explained fairly clearly as I will communicate to our research partners in Vanuatu (I am located in Australia). Thanks, Caroline

<h2>            &#34;The picture is too large and will be truncated&#34; appears when copying entire rows</h2>
                    I have recently encountered this error whenever I select a series of rows and either copy or cut them.&nbsp; The worksheets are not very big -- less than 100 rows and only 3-4 columns, so I know that the file size isn't an issue.&nbsp; In search through Google,
 I found some mention about the Clipart Gallery causing this problem in previous versions, but can't find a way to disable it in Office 2010 (if that is, in fact, the cause of this error).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any guidance you can offer,<br />

    <title>Mac Word update messed up styles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ricardo marten  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mac Word update messed up styles</h2>
                    <p>I just recently upgraded to Word for Mac version 16.9. Since this update, my document styles have gone rogue! If I place the cursor on the text, the style panel sometimes makes the right description, but the actual font has been replaced on the document
 (ie Helvetica Neue Light turned into Helvetica regular). Similar with titles, all switched to regular Helvetica.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several documents following this style, so I don't want to manually go through them trying to change them. Is this a bug or am I missing something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

    <title>Recurring Appointments Changed from every one year to every 12 years - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronemc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recurring Appointments Changed from every one year to every 12 years WMDC&#47;ActiveSync</h2>
                    
<div>I'm using Outlook 2007 (SP2) on two machines. One with XP Pro (work) and the other with Windows 7 Pro&nbsp;(home). My handheld device is the HTC Imagio running WM 6.5 and is set to sync with work's Exchange Server 2003 and my home PC.
<br />
<br />
When I setup a "one year" (annual) recurring event in Outlook 2007 on one PC, then Sync it to my WMD, and then, using my WMD, Sync it to my second PC (also Outlook 2007) it ends up as a recurring event every 12 years.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I created several new recurring events on the Windows 7 machine, sync'd with the HTC, no problem. At work this morning I sync'd and all appeared ok. However, when I got home tonight and sync'd, all the new recurring events were changed to repeat every 12 years.
 Some were even changed to every 12 years from 1:00 AM to 1:00 AM, instead of 12:00 AM to 12:00 AM. It doesn't matter where I create the event (work PC, home PC or HTC) the home PC eventually ends up showing the events as recurring every 12 years.<br />
<br />
I have deleted all recurring calendar events from my home work calendars, deleted the partnerships and recreated. Same thing happens every time.<br />
<br />
The XP machine and WM 6.5 device use GMT as the time zone, where Windows 7 uses UTC. I doubt that matters,&nbsp;that may have something to do with the changing some appointments an hour.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. <br />

I'm hoping that Microsoft will address this with some urgency.

            It is an issue that has caused quite a bit of discussion as Laura indicated in the link above.&nbsp; Like you, I have had it occur and for me, it is random on what items are changed.&nbsp; We are confident that the Mobile device team is aware of it and are working
 on it.&nbsp; Hopefully we will see a fix.

<p>I am having the same issue and I too wish that MS would address this.&nbsp; Besides my personal issue, my company is looking into making win mobile devices standart and this issue will really cause problems.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
My issue is with two outlook 2007 pcs.&nbsp; The mobile device stays correct bur the PC changes to evey 12 years.&nbsp; I have done every test I can think of and it still occurs.&nbsp; I was hoping it was because of an older version of Windows Mobile but then I upgrade my
 phone and now have 6.1 and the issue still occurs.&nbsp; I did fine a few comments on this and one person downgraded his second pc back to Office 2003 and the problem was resolved.&nbsp; I have been using active sync and two pcs for about 3 years now and did not have
 the problem until both PCs went to Office 2007 so I beleive that is where the problem lies.&nbsp; I even tried changing the reoccurance to monthly, and every 12 months but it still changes everything to every 12 years.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If Microsoft wants Windows Mobile to become a business solution, they should take this issue seriously because as it, it will never fly.<br />

            Problem occuring while syncing with two computers through mobile devise using ActiveSync. Change one computer through ActiveSync (tools, options, settings) to "replace items on Desktop". In other words, one computer is slave and one is master.

<h2>            How to edit the &#34;Last modified by&#34; info</h2>
                    Where in Office do I set the information that appears in the backstage view of my document? I'd like to edit the "Last modified by" user so that it reads my company name instead of the user name. If I choose the option to remove personal data, it also
 removes the Author name, which I want to keep.

<br />
So, while i'm pretty happy with the fact that i have the whole operating system in english, there's only one place where i'd like to have it in italian: text autocompletion when typing !<br />
<br />
That's the question: how can i switch autocompletion to Italian mode, while retaining my english configuration? I've already changed regional settings to italian mode, so that date/time/currency are correctly shown in the formats i'm used to, but autocompletion
 is still in english.<br />
<br />
I've also tried changing the registry key that control keyboard layouts but this did not change at all my autocompletion language...<br />
<br />
Any ideas? <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.microsoft.com%2fWindowsMobile%2fWebResource.axd%3fd%3dNySzF1eivP_rMoc50GQJzcvS4MHMOEKwYrCIgDtzuzlw7GsNki3H_INlfYaLgkxFdA4ESFRtesEUXj11MHjIL5WMBvm3Pubiu_iWcnqAaGQ1%26amp%3bamp%3bt%3d633263991144971555" /><br />

            Although I can appreciate what you want, it would see to me that there would be the need for a different database for the auto-completions .... that is probably why they have different language versions

            Sure, but if that is all is required, then i can pick up the correct dictionary from another device with the italian dictionary, and substitute it to the one i have on my machine...<br />

Anyone has any idea on where does WM store this kind of data/settings ?<br />

            <p>Hi Judah -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for raising the issue.&nbsp;We were able to reproduce it internally and have a workaround for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Excel, Word, or any Office app other than Project.</li><li>Go to <strong>File </strong>-&gt; <strong>Account </strong>-&gt; <strong>Update Options
</strong>-&gt; <strong>Update Now</strong>.</li><li>Follow the prompts to update.</li><li>After the update completes, try opening Project again.</li></ol>
<p>Once you confirm that Project works, please install the Office Insider build again.
</p>
<p>This time, because Project is already installed, it will also be updated to receive Office Insider builds and you should no longer see this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if this worked for you and thanks for working with us on this!</p>
<p>

            Word and Excel, and all of the other "Office" programs started totally independently. Some were not even written by MS originally, ie Visio and PowerPoint. 
<br />
<br />That means they handle things "in their own way".  So even though the ribbon and function names look similar, they way things work can be very different.
<br />
<br />Sorry, I don't know of a fix for your problem.

<h2>            Split Database and Data entry issues</h2>
                    I really need some help on this...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have created a database of customers with forms to allow entry of new orders. This was done in Microsoft Office XP Pro. I have been able to successfully open it in Access Office 2007 but I now have trouble editing and adding data. I have 'Split' the
 database so multiple users (in this case, just two) with the 'Back End Database held on an external network drive</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything works in as much as I can create an order but when I try to enter data in the order Form it only allows me to create one record (or order item). As soon as I hit return or tab through to the second line it jumps back to the first record and
 won't allow me to enter any additional lines.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have even tried doing it using the original database without splitting it but without success.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone tell me what I need to change to allow me to Split the database and enter more than one item (record) in the form please?</div>
                </div>

            I don't think this has anything to do with the database being split. It has to do with how the form is setup. So can you describe the form (is it in form mode or continuous form mode?) . What is the cycle property set to? etc.

            Splitting the database should not have made any difference.&nbsp; The conventional model for this type of application would be like this:<br />
<br />
Customers----&lt;Orders----&lt;OrderDetails&gt;----Products<br />
<br />
i.e., the OrderDetails table models the many-to-many relationship type between Orders and Products by resolving it into two one-to-many relationship types.&nbsp; OrderDetails would therefore contain two foreign key columns such as OrderID and ProductID, referencing
 the primary keys of Orders and products respectively.<br />
<br />
The usual interface for data entry would be an Orders form in single form view, and embedded within it an OrderDetails subform linked to the parent form on OrderID.<br />
<br />
From your description my initial guess would be that the relationship between Orders and OrderDetails is one-to-one, i.e. the foreign key OrderID column in Order Details is either designated as its primary key or is otherwise uniquely indexed.<br />
<br />
For an example of this sort of model take a look at InvoicePDF.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
This little demo file is really intended to illustrate how to output a report (invoice in this case) as a PDF file, but it happens to be based on a simple invoicing system so is modelled in the same way.&nbsp; Take a look at the relationships window to see how the
 model fits together.<br />
<br />
The main invoice form in this case includes a number of subforms as it also caters for VAT calculation and partial payments against an invoice, but the main form and the invoice details subform operate in exactly the same way as would be the case with an orders
 form/order details subform.<br />

            Hi Scott&nbsp;
<div>Thanks for the help so far. I have reinstalled the database in its original form, i.e not split and as you rigtly &nbsp;thought I still have the same problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have compared the two database properties...the original created in Access 2002 (Microsoft Office XP) and the database opened in Access 2007 and I can't see any differences in the two. However in the 2007 version in the form that has been created to
 enter order items (free text with no preset order items as it isn't linked to stock control or invoicing) I can type in the first record which is a text box called 'item' and when I press return or press the tab key to take me to the next record, it jumps
 back to the first record again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've looked in Design View at both versions and checked to see if there are differences in the Format, Data, Event Other tabs but I can't see anything obvious.</div>
<div>I tried phoning Microsoft but they want £199 before they even begin to help!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm sure it's an obvious and simple fix but I can't see how.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Where can I find out the answer to your question about form mode or continuous form mode and where do I find the cycle properties?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any further help greatly received as I'm pulling my hair out</div>
<div><br />
<div>Kind regards</div>
<div><br />

            Hi Ken,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply but I'm afraid most of that went straight over my head. I have replied to Scott's response as I think I'm just missing something very obvious. I don't know why opening a database created in Access 2002 should in anyway alter when opened
 in Access 2007.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There must be a simple answer because it just has to advance one record every time I hit Return or Tab through but it just jumps back to the first record??</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this makes sense to you and you might offer an easy fix.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>

            I think I have found the problem!!!
<div><br />
<div>When in the order entry form next to the Record number there is a Filter/UnFiltered button. This defaults to Filtered and so won't allow you to advance and enter new data in the next record. By clicking on this button to change it to Unfiltered it allows
 you to create more records (more items)!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>All I need to work out now is how to make it default to UNFiltered!</div>

            That was one of my questions. To answer how to do that, we need to know more about the form. Is this a subform or a main form? How do you open the form? If you are opening the form from a button on another form, we need to see the code for that button.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Also what is the Recordsource of the form?&nbsp;</div>

            You need to look in the events behind any buttons or controls that might trigger the action and then copy and paste.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to further isolate the&nbsp; issue, we will need to ask you a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did it automatically displayed the error message after turning the screen on from idle mode?</li><li>How many times have you attempted to unlock the phone and entered the wrong PIN?</li></ul>
<p>Let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            I was just surfing on edge and in between my phone get locked. And i dont think that was due to wrong attempt because the phone was in my hand in unloced condition. Besides that my phone is now okay.
