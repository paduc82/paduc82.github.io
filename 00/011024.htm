<h2>            Deleted SharePoint site still visible under &#39;Recent&#39;</h2>
                    <p>So we deleted an Office 365 group called 'Bestuur', because we actually only needed a distribution list. Deleted the group and set up a new regular Sharepoint site also called 'Bestuur'. This was over 60 days ago. Ever since, the deleted group site is still
 visible under 'Recent' on the Sharepoint _layouts page. The link leads to a dead page with a 403 error. This is confusing our users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the deleted group page still visible under 'Recent??' How can we delete it permanently from the layouts page?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey everyone, </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">****January 23rd - I updated the registry keys needed to the January Tech Preview Build below.</span></strong> This should have been updated by a Windows Update, but if you modified they values you can set
 them to the correct targetting by validating the below registry keys. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I wanted to let you know changing these registry keys around will prevent you from getting Windows 10 Technical Preview Builds!!!!</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will want to change the registry keys back to values that the public update servers will recognize and give you newer builds as they become publicly available for Windows Insiders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did change the registry keys a refresher on what they should be is as follows:
<br />
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BranchName = FBL_AWESOME1501<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ThresholdRiskLevel = low<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ThresholdInternal = &lt;should not exist&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ThresholdOptedIn = &lt;should not exist&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use these commands from and Admin Command prompt (Windows Key + X, select Command Prompt (Admin))</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability" /v "BranchName" /d "FBL_AWESOME1501" /t REG_SZ /f<br />
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability" /v "ThresholdRiskLevel" /d "low" /t REG_SZ /f<br />
reg delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability" /v "ThresholdInternal" /f<br />
reg delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability" /v "ThresholdOptedIn" /f</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><strong>Background</strong>: By changing these registry keys you do affect the builds that get targeted to your PC; unfortunately you won‚Äôt be able to get any of these builds unless you are a Microsoft Employee and have access to our internal network. But
 don‚Äôt worry we are working on new builds to send out to the Windows Insiders! </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different factors that can contribute as to why the Office applications on your iPad are not able to open different files stored on your OneDrive account. One possible reason is that the office applications have a pending update that needs to be
 installed. For us to resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any recent changes made or updates installed prior to the issue occurring?</li><li>When was the last time you were able to open the different files using the Office applications on your iPad?</li><li>Have you attempted to download the files locally to your iPad and open them?</li><li>Does this happen on any file type that you attempted to open using the Office applications on your iPad or does the issue only occur when you attempted to open specific files?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response to our queries.</p>

<p>Hi Jordan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response, yes, i checked all your concern:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1/ all office apps are up-to-date, and there haven‚Äôt any changes or updates installed before, it just happened when I wake up and check my work on ondrive, the night before things were still good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2/ As I said, the night before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3/ Yes, I‚Äôve tried, and it‚Äôs ok if i choose to open with Numbers or Office Suite but the Office Exel</p>
<p>
</p><p>4/ I cant check all files in my drive as I have thousands, but all of .docx and .xlsx file I‚Äôve tried to edit sofar are unable to open with Word or Excel Apps, the only thing I can do is to view them on OneDrive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, Jordan, for your kindly support, hope we can solve this problem soon, I do need office apps for my iPad Pro, and only MS Office Pack are powerful enough to meet my need!</p>

<p>Thanks for providing the details we requested. Since the issue is still occurring and you already verified that the Office applications are up to date on your iPad, we suggest that you uninstall the affected Office applications first on your iPad then follow
 the steps on this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-and-set-up-Office-on-an-iPhone-or-iPad-9df6d10c-7281-4671-8666-6ca8e339b628?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to download and set up the Office apps on your iPad once more. Completing these steps will allow us to isolate the concern further if the cause was due to corrupted data files in the applications.</p>

<p>Hi Jordan,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
I could say that there is no difference&nbsp;<span>to the previous error message I encountered, as always, it said: "</span>Can't Open File - filename.xlsx may be locked, in use, or you don't have sufficient permissions" and, of
 course, I updated app to the newest version.</p>
<p>One more thing, I realize that if I open the xlsx or docx directly from the viewer of One Drive, it will always get the error message like above, however, if I choose to open the file by browsing it from the Apps (Word or Excel &gt; Open &gt; One Drive &gt; Folder
 A &gt; Folder B &gt; File.xlsx), there will be no error, but it is quite inconvenient as I work with huge folder systeam on One Drive so it will take much time to browse a file by this way.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Waiting for your better solution, Jordan! And thanks again very much!<br />

<p>Thanks for the update regarding the current status of your concern. Since you're still encountering an error message when you open any file using the Word application as well as if you open the same files through OneDrive online, we would like to confirm
 if you already attempted to download the file in question and then attempt to open the file? If you already attempted the steps mentioned, we would like to verify what were the results?</p>

<p>What happened?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening to me starting today with ALL of my Office files on Android. "Can't open file &lt;filename&gt; may be locked, in use, or you don't have sufficient permissions." At 5:00 am this morning, I used the files JUST FINE, then later in the day, NOTHING
 WORKS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, OneNote crashes every time I open it with "Something went wrong and we can't do what you asked. We're sorry. Error: 0x80070005" I am unable to do ANYTHING relating to my Microsoft files on my android device as of mid-morning today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the apps. I have tried signing out and signing in to my Microsoft account.&nbsp; I have wasted my ENTIRE DAY trying to get your stupid software to work AS PROMISED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FIX IT NOW. I may be fired for screwing up a meeting this afternoon, and it was ALL MICROSOFT'S FAULT.</p>

            I had the same problem and found a solution. You just sign out your microsorf account in Word app, sign in again and enter your phone number in the box popped up. Done.

<h2>            Change of email address.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I used to have an email address that was based in The Netherlands, but for the last five years, I have a new email address .</p>
<p>When I top up my account, the message comes up that a confirmation email will be sent to my old address, which is now defunct.</p>
<p>How do I update that information on my account ?</p>
<p>Where is there the instruction on how to delete old information and replace it with the correct updated information ?</p>
<p>For example, the text below this message asks if I wish to be notified when a response is given, but it will probably be sent to my old email address, now defunct.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5800xm &#58; Ovi Maps 3.04 No search results on or offline</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone, this may have been covered already but I'm new here (is that an excuse?).</p>
<p>I can't get any search results with ovi maps on or offline, constantly say `No Results Found'. By manually searching the map I can then start navigation that but not by searching. &nbsp;At the moment I am reinstalling he maps via the map loader to see if that
 works.</p>
<p>Any help much appreciated.</p>

<p>Same problem here, no results found in either offline or online search.</p>
<p>Updated all the maps with "Nokia map loader", still the same problem.</p>
<p>Really frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems like the new ovi map update brings more problems. So if you haven't updated yet, wait until they (or someone)&nbsp; resolve this problem.</p>

<p>Same here. No search results whatever I enter - tried all sorts of formats, even obvious stuff like "regent street, london" and my own postcode. Ovi Maps web page on-line also not returning any results for me at the moment so looks like a server problem
 maybe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried switching phone off and on, no change.</p>
<p>Searching did work but not sure if it's v50 of firmware or v3.04 of Ovi Maps as both updated at same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ÔªøÔªøUPDATE: I</strong><strong>t is an on-line server problem!! </strong>
I tried setting phone Internet connection for the Maps to off-line and searching works.</p>

<p>Also, as an aside, has anyone downloaded and used the world cup application from orange (I got a multimedia message with a link from them), I'm getting a http 500 error whenever I select anything like fixtures, is it just cos the servers aren't there?</p>

<p>Spoke too soon about switching off and back on and then all being alright. Problem has returned, but off-line seems OK. Looks (hopefully) like a problem at the remote end. Can only hope they sort it quick.</p>

            Yes it seems like a server problem. As m_a_r_k said, it does in fact work in offline search.

<p>I also update (new firmware) my 5800, week ago. Now I try use Nokia maps, but it can not search anything.</p>
<p>I have got V. 3.04.</p>
<p>Now I remove it. After this procedure, phone has V. 3.03 and it works!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, try to remove Nokia maps aplication from your phone, after removing procedure there should be V. 3.03 installed in you phone.</p>

    <title>Smart duplicate prevention - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emilyftw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Smart duplicate prevention</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I want to insert some code on the BeforeUpdate event of a field whose data source is a primary key.&nbsp; The code would provide a more elegant way of preventing duplicates than the standard errors that pop up for primary key duplicates.&nbsp; This process lets me provide
 a more helpful message to users, and also gives them the message as soon as they enter the duplicate, instead of when they try to save the record (by moving to a new record or closing the form).<br />
<br />
The code I have been using is similar to the following:<br />
<br />
Private Sub Docket_BeforeUpdate(Cancel As Integer)<br />
'inserted 8/11/12<br />
<br />
'if there is a duplicate Docket value in the Cases table<br />
If (Not IsNull(DLookup("Docket", "Cases", "Docket = '" &amp; [tbDocket] &amp; "'"))) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'throw a msgbox warning and cancel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myanswer = MsgBox("No duplicates!", vbOKOnly, "Dupilcate Docket Number")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancel = True<br />
End If<br />
<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
This works fine most of the time.&nbsp; But if the user tries to close the form immediately after entering a duplicate, then (after the MsgBox displays and they click OK) another messagebox appears with the following error:<br />
<br />
<i>You can't save this record at this time.&nbsp; CaseTrackingForm may have encountered an error while trying to save a record.&nbsp; If you close this object now, the data changes you made will be lost.&nbsp; Do you want to close the database anyway?</i><br />
<br />
How can I prevent that second message from displaying when users who have entered a duplicate value try to close the form?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Emily<br />

            To prevent the form closing you need to set the return value of the Cancel argument of its Unload event procedure to True.&nbsp; This means setting the value of a module level Boolean variable to True if your validation code detects a duplicate key value, and
 examining that variable in the form's Unload event procedure.&nbsp; You also have to set it back to False of course if the validation code detects no duplicate key value.<br />
<br />
I tend to adopt a different strategy in cases like this, which is to force the user to save the record and&nbsp; close the form via command buttons, the close button only being enabled when the record has successfully been saved.&nbsp; You'll find an example as SaveDemo.zip
 in my public databases folder at:<br />

<br />
The demo file includes validation on the first and last name controls, so try leaving one of these Null to see how it works.<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t Change&#47;Update Credit Card Number in Payment Options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gian paolo bernardo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Change&#47;Update Credit Card Number in Payment Options</h2>
                    I have ordered and received three apps through the Windows Market Place through my phone. These were billed to my debit card. However, three days later, I was notified that my debit card could not be charged. I would like to change the card number (from
 my debit card number to my credit card number). Forums provide instructions on how to edit the payment options, but these were posted years ago. Also, there seems to be no way to edit the card number. I am also prevented from removing and replacing my payment
 option since there are pending transactions. I am given a link to "update my credit card" but it doesn't allow me to "update" the card number.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to change my card number to my credit card number in order to finally pay for the apps which I have just purchased.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            I could probably give you the proper steps to take to update your payment method since I recently did this on my own account, but since there are transactions pending, it probably won't work.&nbsp; I think you need to initiate a Zune Chat session so you can
 get someone from Microsoft to help you do this.&nbsp; <a href="https://support.live.com/default.aspx?productkey=oepzunecf&amp;brand=oepzune&amp;mkt=en-ww&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
You can initiate a Zune Chat session by clicking to the CHAT button at this link.</a><br />

    <title>Canceling subscription for deceased user with no Microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Canceling subscription for deceased user with no Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>My mother had a Skype account, but as she was using a much older version of Windows (and because she didn't know how to upgrade Skype), she never connected it to a Microsoft account. My mother has since passed, but her monthly Skype payments are still coming
 out of her bank account. I have all her old log-in information from the time I set up the account for her, but every time I attempt to cancel her account, I am asked for her Microsoft log-in. I no longer have access to her personal computer, if that makes
 any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As her estate's in probate, it's very important that I stop these payments as quickly as possible! Can anyone help?</p>

 and welcome to the Skype Community!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so sorry to hear of your loss. Must be tough times for you. My prayers goes to you and your family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend that you cancel the recurring payments first before you proceed with closing the account. When an account has been set for closure, it will take 60 days before the account is completely removed from Skype's database. During these times,
 if you haven't cancel any recurring payments, it will still renew.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have your mother's log-in credentials, you can cancel the subscription by:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign in to her account on the Skype website.&nbsp;</li><li>Under your mother's profile photo, click the name of the subscription you want to cancel.&nbsp;</li><li>Click <strong>Cancel subscription</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Select the radio button most applicable to why you are cancelling the subscription.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You can also refer to <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1881/how-do-i-cancel-or-change-my-skype-subscription?q=cancel+subscription" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong> for additional details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After successfully cancelling the subscription, you may now proceed in closing the account. However, if you are being asked for information you do not have at hand, you may

                    I have a Windows phone as my work phone. I needed to download an attachment yesterday &amp; had to install adobe. When i&nbsp; installed it i needed to sign into windows live &amp; not thinking, I logged into my personal hotmail account. Now all of my contacts from
 hotmail (most of which are just email addresses...) have appeared on my phone. I need to remove this as I do not want these contacts on my work phone.How do I do this? Fingers crossed someone can help me...It is a Nokia Lumia but I am not sure which model....

            <p>If you added a Microsoft Account (Hotmail) to your phone, you need to factory reset your phone to remove it. This is because everything in your phone is associated with your Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this was a secondary Hotmail account added to your phone, you can simply remove the account by going to
<strong>Settings &gt; email+accounts</strong>. Then tap and hold the account and finally tap
<strong>delete</strong> in the popup menu that appears.</p>

<p>Hi Chas,<br />
<br />
On the Structural Navigation, for the sub-sites, we can't delete them manually, but we can
Structural Navigation.</span> If we manually add some links to the navigation, we can delete them directly.<br />
<br />
If that's not your situation, please share the details about how your created the links and share related screenshots with us.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

                    I have created a large document with&nbsp;styles&nbsp;already applied, for example heading one and heading 2 (in order to create the table of contents), and normal, for the body of the document.

<div>I have now been asked to number each paragraph.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<div><b>1.0 Heading</b></div>

<div>1.0.1 Subtext in normal font here.</div>

            Hello Nayana,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) I have a licensed copy provided for no cost through my University (Indiana University).</div>
<div>2) Yes, Office 2013 is installed and activated.</div>
<div>3) When I say register, I mean, in the past, activation and registration were two different processes (e.g., Office 2003). Registration ensures you get technical support and updates as far as my understanding goes.</div>
<div>4) I have a Microsoft account, but for some reason Office keeps giving me the error: "Temporary server issue. &nbsp;Please try again later." I cannot log into my Microsoft account, and the only way I was able to activate the product was to go through the install
 process again, where I was had the choice to re-install or activate. I chose to activate without re-installing and it's been working fine. Just need to know about registration, if that is necessary or can be done.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this information helps.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div>Randy</div>

            Yes, for MS products activation and registration are 2 separate processes.<br />
<br />
Registration prior to 2013 was simply an invitation for spam. AFIK it had nothing to do with technical support, and I know for sure it had nothing to do with Windows updates.<br />
<br />
Actually, I don't recall seeing any mention of registration when I did my "local" install of Office 2013 (not 365).&nbsp; I did screen captures of the install and don't see registration mentioned there.<br />

<h2>            Onedrive for Business Credential needed</h2>
                    
<p>Is it me or is it Microsoft? I have seen alot of people posting this same issue. My Outlook will only sync folders. If a file is in a folder I get the error that my credentials are needed.</p>
<p>I have tried everything I have found on the internet that says it will correct the issue. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared cache, etc, Nothing has corrected the issue yet.</p>
<p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>I have an Office365 E3 plan.</p>
<p>Thanks, Glen</p>

<h2>            Sync memory cards fine tuning&#63; I really don&#39;t need to sync all the CAB files from my card...</h2>
                    Any chance that I can explicitly exclude specific files (.cab for instance) or folders from synching?<br />
<br />
Besides .cab, I've got a GPS software with more than 400 pictures and icons, which are also synchronised with myphone...<br />
<br />
I can exclude "documents" file types from syncing, but I really need to sync my Word and Excel though<br />
<br />
Thanks

<br />
Thank you for using the service.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately you cannot customize the folders/File types&nbsp;you want to synchronize. I'm sorry if this is a constraint for you.<br />

Thank you,<br />

    <title>OneDrive for Business Mac client questions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simon d. s. mason  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive for Business Mac client questions</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to figure out how this works - downloading the various options and reading the forum results. &nbsp;Can someone confirm or deny the following things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a OneDrive for Business Mac client coming. &nbsp;The preview is closed and it says coming soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you install the Onedrive Mac client you can set it up with your business account, and it appears to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you add in your OneDrive personal account then you are stuck because the folder synchronization options only show the personal folders.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Based on that last comment, I am not sure why the app even has the option of adding a business account unless it assumes you are only going to use one or the other?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the web OneDrive there is also a sync option in Groups with Office 365. &nbsp;This appears to try and launch OneDrive for Business sync under Windows. &nbsp;Presumably I can't sync groups at all on the Mac at this time as there is no official OneDrive for Business
 Sync app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere in the Microsoft product team there is probably a roadmap that makes sense with all of this. &nbsp;But unless I am missing something - the way it manifests to the end user on a Mac with both personal and business accounts is quite confusing.</p>

            Hi Simon,<br />
<br />
Here are the answers for the questions:<br />
1. The OneDrive for Business sync client preview is closed. Now in Windows and Mac, we have the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-on-Mac-OS-X-d11b9f29-00bb-4172-be39-997da46f913f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client </a>(OneDrive.exe and OneDrive app). There's no official article mentioned another OneDrive for Business Mac client.
<br />
<br />
2. Yes, we can now add business accounts in the OneDrive for Business Next-Gen Sync Client.<br />
<br />
3. You should be able to add personal accounts using the OneDrive for Business Next-Gen Sync Client.<br />
Please note that we can select folders/files to sync. You can unlink and re-add your account, make sure you've selected all folders/files and try syncing again.
<br />
<br />
If the issue persists:<br />
&nbsp;a. Check if the admin have <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deploying-the-OneDrive-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-on-OS-X-and-configuring-work-or-school-accounts-eadddc4e-edc0-4982-9f50-2aef5038c307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
blocked the configuring and syncing of personal accounts</a>.<br />
&nbsp;b. Share a screenshot and let us know more details by saying "the folder synchronization options only show the personal folders".<br />
<br />
4. If you refer to syncing with your SharePoint library, the feature is still under development and will be added to the OneDrive for Business Next-Gen Sync Client in the future.<br />
<br />
5. To check the roadmap which lists all planned updates, please click this<a href="https://fasttrack.office.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> link</a>.<br />

Regards,<br />

            <p>It is not working. &nbsp;When I add my personal onedrive account and then go to the Account Settings option in Preferences I get this:</p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ccfac26-2819-4ce0-8fa4-5013018e5cc7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ccfac26-2819-4ce0-8fa4-5013018e5cc7" /></a><br />
<p>
</p><p>I am able to choose folders, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I then click on Add Account and add my Business OneDrive account and go back into Account Settings I see this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4b3ed651-e0cb-45d4-919e-66ad5beb9ad4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4b3ed651-e0cb-45d4-919e-66ad5beb9ad4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case I can (in theory) add more syncs from my business account but I have no way to modify the folders that are being synchronized in the personal account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, if I add my personal account back in there is no way to modify the folders that are being synchronized from my business account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently there is a different Account setup screen depending on whether you last added a business or a personal account and it does not let you modify the other type without re-adding the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, regarding the sharepoint - just to confirm. &nbsp;We have a group setup under our Office365. &nbsp;This group has it's own files section. &nbsp;The synchronization here is the sharepoint sync and that isn't currently available on the Mac?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Simon,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the comment. Please check the following information:<br />
1. To modify the other type of accounts:<br />
We can add a personal account, then click "add a business account" to add multiple business accounts one by one. After that we should be able to find multiple OneDrive icons in the top menu bar and perform a selective sync for each account/OneDrive icon by
 clicking "Choose Folders". We'd suggest you manage these local synced folders/libraries separately.<br />
</p>
<p>2. There's only one account setup screen and it will switch to Office 365 account login page/Microsoft account login page. It depends on your account type.<br />
</p>
<p>3. Please also share the version of your OneDrive app with us.<br />
<br />
4. For the second question, yes, using the next gen sync client with a business account, we can only sync our own OneDrive for Business library, syncing other libraries are not supported yet. For more details please refer to:</p>

            <p>I think I am figuring it out but it is not obvious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that group file shares in OneDrive (sharepoint?) cannot be synchronized locally and this will require a future release of the software for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a personal account entered into the Mac desktop client then the Account section shows the settings for that folder. &nbsp;There is NO way to get to the Business settings in the account page of the desktop client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you click on the sync button on the OneDrive for Business web site it opens the desktop client and takes you to the Account settings page and allows you to specify the folders. &nbsp;Once you close this screen, and then go back into the desktop client
 directly the account page only shows you the personal account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At no point do I get more than one onedrive icon on the taskbar - even with my personal and business account loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly things are not working the way you describe them - but in a roundabout and somewhat convoluted way - I have managed to maintain the folder settings for both my personal and business account. &nbsp;You are describing very different behavior in your response
 - should I be seeing it the way you mention - two different icloud taskbar icons - each with their own settings - one for personal and one for business?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app version is&nbsp;Version 17.3.6517 (0809)</p>

            Hi Simon,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your update.<br />
<br />
Here are my answers for your concerns.<br />
<br />
1. Document library sync (including Office 365 Group files) is already in development. You can find it in
<a href="https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/roadmap?filters=#I-42804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Roadmap</a>.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Office 365 Group files are stored in separate SharePoint libraries, instead of the OneDrive for Business library.<br />
<br />
2. Normally, each time we click <strong>Add an Account</strong> (either Business or personal) in the OneDrive next generation sync client, it will create a new OneDrive sync instance and display a new OneDrive icon on the top Menu Bar, and we can change the
 settings for each instance separately.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To better understand the exact scenario, please confirm the following information:<br />
1. Try to unlink both of the OneDrive accounts, and then restart syncing.<br />
2. Uninstall the OneDrive sync client, and reinstall from App Store to check the outcome.<br />
3. Share some related screenshot of the issue.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jiaxing

            <p>I posted pictures in one of my previous posts. &nbsp;It shows the same app running after I added one account and then the other. &nbsp;These are NOT pictures of two different apps - they are of the same app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the latest version of the OneDrive Mac app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that adding a Business account and then a personal account, or vice versa, does NOT create two instances of the app running in the menu. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app does appear that it is synchronizing both accounts but only one version of the app shows in the menu bar and it only shows the account configuration for the last added account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear that there is a bug here?</p>

<p>This is just one way to go, I choose a random price for a person, follow your rules and finish when no more prices are possible. I've not sorted the output, so you can follow the code logic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The consequence with your data it is that not all prices are awarded. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When we have to award all prices, means John Doe wins 20 and 15 always, because nobody else is interested in this prices. If you like I can rewrite the code and solve the puzzle by starting with the prices...</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint 2010 - Skipping Page Numbers</h2>
                    <br />
<br />
I have a new PowerPoint Template done by an outside agency.<br />
I noticed my presentations were skipping page numbers.<br />
The outside agency corrected the problem by adding the page number that was missing on the template page.<br />
As I save the new template in my theme folder, it's still skipping page numbers when I apply to an old presentation.<br />
Is this a bug with PPT or a template issue?<br />
Has anyone encounter this issue?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
<br />
ps. I understand there is a quick fix by click on insert master, insert slide number and click on apply all.<br />

            <p>After assigning the Template to the ppt, you can just mannually add page numbers to the slides. I think u already know how to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just go to "Insert" Tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then click on "Slide Number" or "Header &amp; Footer" Button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then tick the "Sllide number" check box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally click the "Apply to All" Button.</p>
