<p>What kind of sound device / speakers do you have?</p>
<p>With some updates my desktop with USB speakers has lost all sounds as well. Only "repair action" has been disconnecting speakers USB cable, wait few seconds and connect it back.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>LINEST and Regression Add-In doesnt appear to work correctly or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewrixom  say:</h3>
<h2>            LINEST and Regression Add-In doesnt appear to work correctly or consistently</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting error messages from LINEST(y,x,TRUE,TRUE)&nbsp;inconsistently in Excel 2010 running in a corporate Windows 7 which are mirrored in the regression Add-In. y and x are named arrays.&nbsp;I now understand why I'm getting the error message when I do, but have
 found examples where I don't get it when I should. There is also no indication in the help files of what error codes LINEST can produce in what circumstances. Does anyone have information on this, and what strategies do you use for dealing with it when they
 occur. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I started with a constructed data set of 25 observations of y=x when I was setting up LINEST to use in a workbook</p>
<p>
</p><p>It returns #NUM! in the F position in the array, because&nbsp;SSresid is (and should be) zero and F is calculated by dividing by SSresid which would produce infinity and an error. I got there in the end but it took a while. The same appears if I use the regression
 Add-In</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I have 50 observations&nbsp;of the same y=x function SSresid is non zero, but vanishingly small (4.98E-28) and I get no error. SSresid should be zero and I should get an error. I get the same results from the regression Add-In. Several other examples
 using different number of observations produce the same absence of an error when there should be one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both examples R^2 in the LINEST array is <em>exactly</em> 1, which it should not be with a non zero SSresid that occurs&nbsp;when there are 50 observations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My purpose for using LINEST was to set up alternative models on one spreadsheet to be able to switch in different data sets and not have to run the regression add on each time and the consequent problems of managing multiple sheets or inadvertently over
 writing previous results (it happens).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I therefore&nbsp;was also&nbsp;looking at 2nd and 3rd order polynomials with LINEST(y,x^{1,2},TRUE,TRUE) and LINEST(y,x^{1,2,3},TRUE,TRUE). Using
<em>the same y=x trial data </em>set the 3rd order LINEST version produces an error in F&nbsp;for the 3rd order with 50 observations (the x^3, x^2 and b are all zero in the LINEST matrix as they should be), but no error with the 2nd order version (x^2 coefficient
 and b are both non zero but vanishingly small when they should be zero) as there was incorrectly a non zero SSresid. In both cases R^2 is
<em>exactly </em>1 in the LINEST matrix, and again it should not be when there is a non zero SSresid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is important for me to calculate the significance of my models. I may be able to use #NUM! as a flag to set p=0, but as the error values appear to be undocumented I don't know what else will generate this error code, or what other error codes can be generated
 and why.</p>

            <p>(A) If you're not familiar with the topic, use Google or Bing to search for "overfitting regression" to learn more. An example is the article "The Danger of Overfitting Regression Models" at&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/the-danger-of-overfitting-regression-models" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/the-danger-of-overfitting-regression-models</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When there's no known physical or theoretical model that you know your data should represent, I recommend you "look at the data," i.e., plot an XY chart. If there's a simple upward or downward cluster, use a linear fit. If there's a single "bulge," use a
 quadratic (2nd-order polynomial) fit. If there's an S shape, resort to cubic (3rd-order polynomial) fit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(B) With a 3rd-order polynomial, depending on the relative magnitude of the X and Y values (and particularly the differences in magnitude between X^3 and Y), the LINEST algorithm (or any computer-based finite-precision calculator) may have problems with
 numerical computation. (For example, Excel stores and calculates with fifteen significant digits of precision.) Some discussion of LINEST accuracy and its handling of collinearity is at&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/LINEST-function-84d7d0d9-6e50-4101-977a-fa7abf772b6d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/LINEST-function-84d7d0d9-6e50-4101-977a-fa7abf772b6d</a></p>

            <p>Thanks. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft support page on LINEST doesn't document error messages for the function or what generates them. I may be able to use the #NUM! it returns for F as a flag. But I'd like to know that nothing else generates the same error. There may also be other
 possible error messages in different elements of the LINEST array. The page does say which elements in the array are #N/A, but these are not errors, they are unused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the purposes was to demonstrate what the trend lines of the different types of model would look like and how R^2 behaved. My test data on this occasion is y=x, so only one variable that's perfectly correlated so I didn't think that would be a case
 of over fitting? I take the point about finite-precision calculator in the polynomials, ln, power and exp regressions that I've also included.</p>

</p><p>It is possible that you have set a rule which redirects your received mails to another folder. Does this happen to every email message that you are receiving? Also, the folder that you've mentioned is not a default folder in Outlook 2016. Do you remember

 is correct because I my inbox page of Hotmail open on my Surface pad and I have filled out your silly form 4 times now even though I cant see new emails the page is still open and I can see my files and such so the information im filling in on your stupid

                    I have an Access DB that I must have somehow changed a control setting!!??&nbsp; I have 5 Modules built and I am trying to build another one but when I select CREATE then click on the Module icon, nothing happens (same with Class Module and Visual Basic) --
 Macro does open however.&nbsp; I am in Access 10 and the database is a .mdb (2000 format).&nbsp;&nbsp; I've built a lot of databases that include Modules and have not run across this before.&nbsp; Other databases (also .mdb's) allow me to accomplish adding more modules.&nbsp; I've
 even tried copying a module but I get the message "Name conflicts with existing module, project, or object library."&nbsp; Any ideas what I&nbsp;need to do (besides&nbsp;cuss!!!)&nbsp; THANKS!!!!!!&nbsp;

            As a side note... sometimes, and I have no explanation as to why, Modules would not show up until saved.&nbsp; So if that happens again try saving *anything* and you should see the Module show up asking for name.&nbsp; Maybe someone will pass by and explain why
 that happens (sometimes!).

<h2>            Outlook search has stopped working &#40;Outlook 2016, running on Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am running Outlook 2016 on Windows Home 10. &nbsp;The search function has completely stopped working.</p>
<p>When I type in the name of a sender (that I can actually see has just sent me an email (to test obviously!)) it simply says "searching" and then "no results found".</p>
<p>This is causing me massive problems.</p>
<p>I have rebuilt the index repeatedly and this has made no difference whatsoever. &nbsp; I have switched off windows search and then switched it back on again. Again this has made no difference. Please help me I am at the end of my tether.</p>

            <p>Hi Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We totally understand the importance of the Search feature in Outlook specially if you have a lot of email messages. If you updated to
<strong>Build 7870.2020</strong> and higher you will encounter Outlook search not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-search-stops-working-after-updating-to-build-7870-2020-and-higher-0bcf0b06-320d-40c3-8cf0-7e3df90793ed?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a></strong>that you can check for some updates and when a fix is available, you can also see workaround from this page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you need further assistance and we appreciate your patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>I have the same problem and it arose earlier last week when I received a notification that there was an update to be applied - it did not specify which update or what update was being applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note that the moderator of this forum (I assume a Microsoft person) has indicated that there is a problem (thought this was said in a sort of roundabout way) but didn't actually confirm that the update contains an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When giving a build number it would always be good for us non-technical types to know how to see the build number of the Microsoft&nbsp;application with the issue. Gone are the days where you simply clicked on Help&gt;About to see this information. Everything keeps
 being moved around so it become like a "treasure hunt" or a "where's wally" exercise to see where standard functions got moved. It's not even list in the File&gt;Info section which one would believe would be the logical place for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also notice that the moderator did not identify when this will be resolved or whether there is some form of workaround. I have over 17,000 email across over 100 folders that I need to cross reference/search on a regular basis at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question I ask is are there any interim work arounds that can return some level of functionality ? and when will the issue that now exists be fixed ? days/weeks/months ??</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that Comments in the Show Markup section is enabled. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Review</strong> tab.</li><li>Click <strong>Tracking</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Show Markup</strong>.</li><li>Make sure that there is a check mark beside <strong>Comments</strong>. If there is none, click
<strong>Comments</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is already enabled, check if <strong>Show Comments</strong> is selected. If yes, click it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre still getting the same results, <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">update Office</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I've done all that, but the problem isn't that Comments are hidden.&nbsp; It's that they show up in the Reviewing Pane, but not balloons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recipe that I've found to work thus far is to get out out of the mode of comparing two documents (which shows the initial version, final version, and the difference as tracked changes) by saving the comparison document, then restarting Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then set Balloons to "Show Only Comments And Formatting....".&nbsp; Then I turn off visibility of tracked formats.&nbsp; I wish I didn't have to impose all these extra constraints.&nbsp; It's very intensive on the buttonology just to toggle between imposing the constraints
 and removing them.</p>

            This suggests that the Building Blocks.dotx template is damaged and needs to be replaced, which Word will do automatically if you delete the existing one. See the "Generate a New User Copy of the Building Blocks Template" section of

<h2>            How to change your birthdate in your Microsoft account profile&#63;</h2>
                    This question is unrelated to Office, but I have no idea where to post it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am 65 and accidentally did not enter my year of birth when registering for a Microsoft account so that I could post a question about Word 2011 for the Macintosh. The Microsoft system believes that my birthday is 5.12.2013.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have spent 2 hours trying to rectify this and am no further than I was before, except that I did create an account for my father (who would be 94 and has been dead since 2001) so that I could give permission for myself to open an account. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Birthdate is the one item that I apparently cannot change in my profile.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I solve this problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks.</div>

            I am aware of that.<br />
<br />
But if you go to live.com, you see listing for Skydrive profile and Messenger Profile.&nbsp; You have to have a Live.com account in order to use Skydrive. (I signed up for Sky Drive as soon as a desktop program was available for Mac. Back when they were allowing
 20GB free space.) <br />
<br />
Or at least it was when I signed up for SkyDrive, no LiveID, no SkyDrive.&nbsp; And Now that I have LiveID am unable to sign up for Hotmail.
<br />
<br />
As For Skype, they bought rights to use their slightly Altered version of Skype. Skype Itself still exist as a Free standing program. you have the option now to tie to Microsoft and you can still use your Skype Sign in or Through Microsoft. And Once you do
 all updates come through MS I can still sign in using Skype username if I wish or Microsoft Name.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Access has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>On a Windows 10 platform, I appear to have an issue with the InStr function when used in a Query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the SQL:</p>
<p>SELECT Left$([tblClientEnquiries]![Client],InStr(1,[tblClientEnquiries]![Client],",",1)-1) AS [Last name]<br />
FROM tblClientEnquiries;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run this and start to scroll down the output I get the "Microsoft Access has stopped working " message.</p>
<p>When I take out the first and fourth parameter of the InSTr function, which are both optional, again I get the "Microsoft Access has stopped working " message and Access restarts.<br />
</p>
<p>This used to work, but now does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you require any more information, then obviously please shout!</p>

<p>Thank you for that. I probably did not make my issue clear. The symptons occur when I use a Query, there is no VBA involved. I copied the SQL from the SQL View.</p>

            You made yourself very clear. When a built-in Access function (like Left()) ceases to work, very often the reason is because there is a Missing Reference. That's why I suggested you check it.&nbsp;

<p>Thank you very much for that helpful reply. If I may take each point in turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>A backup copy at this point is not important as I am using a skeleton of the full database to try and resolve this issue.</li><li>The database can be saved as an ACCDE file without errors. The same symptom occurs with that file.</li><li>I have used Compact and Repair, which does not alleviate the symptom.</li><li>I have been through the process of a Decompile, Compact and Repair, Compile, Compact and Repair, again without alleviating the symptom</li><li>I have tried a brand new database, importing the Table and recreating the Query from scratch, same symptom</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>With the clues from the reply, I created a brand new Table having generated some random Filed values as letters with the characteristic "AAAA, BBBB". Any yes, the symptom did not occur. Ergo, the issue must be with the original Table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Onwards and upwards.</p>

            <p>Is the crash happening in both the .accdb file and the .accde?&nbsp; The calculation will return an error if the Client field is Null or doesn't contain a comma, but that shouldn't crash Access.&nbsp; Maybe it would crash in an ACCDE, but I don't think so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suppose you prevent that error from happening, by filtering out any records where Client doesn't contain a comma:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT Left$([tblClientEnquiries]![Client],InStr(1,[tblClientEnquiries]![Client],",",1)-1) AS [Last name]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM tblClientEnquiries</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE Client Like "*,*"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it crash then?</p>

</p><p>So far:</p>
<ul>
<li>The crash happens with ACCDE and ACCDB files</li><li>It used to work</li><li>Its is theInStr function that is causing the problem by a process of elimination. It did not require the two optional parameters either. When you leave them out, Access crashes as soon as I run the Query, let alone scrolling through the records.</li><li>When I manufacture a new file, with a new Table and a new Query,leaving out the two optional parameters, crashes Access immediately</li><li>Another test proves Scottgen's point. I removed a comma from one of the records in my manufactured file. Access crashes.

<h2>            Home Use Program</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I purchased the MS Office 2016 for download on my home pc through HUP. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The company I work for may not renew the license with Software Assurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>People in the company are worried that Microsoft will come looking for their product keys. I've assured them they won't but none of us are lawyers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will Microsoft 'disable' the product keys used to activate our purchases of the MS Office applications?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>thanks....</p>

<p>If you were a lawyer, you would probably advise your client that they should cease using the software IF they know that the company is no longer maintaining its Software Assurance coverage.</p>

            <p>Thanks, I did see that but I'm going a bit looser with my interpretation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They could do that, but would have to return the purchase price to every home user that purchased the home use product under the employer's contract. I don't see that happening. It's a logistical nightmare to return the funds (people move addresses, change
 bank accounts). Plus, it's just plain badwill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I left my employer or my employer left the Software Assurance program, I would no longer be
<em>eligible</em> to purchase under the home purchase program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My prior job had 6,000+ desktops and I used my purchase under that HUP account on any new upgraded PC I got over the 7 years. I gave a product key away that someone gave to me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current job has about 900 desktops and until recently, has been quite slow on upgrading equipment and technology.&nbsp;</p>

</p><blockquote>They could do that, but would have to return the purchase price to every home user that purchased the home use product under the employer's contract.

<p>
</p><p>No, there is no reason that MS would have to refund anything. The HUP is a benefit of the "SA" .&nbsp; When an employee takes advantage of this benefit, the HUP license terms clearly say:</p>
<ul>
<li>employee must have an Office license on their work computer<br />
</li><li>employee may use the HUP license only while they work for the employer</li><li>employee may use the HUP only as long as the employer maintains the SA license</li></ul>
<p>In theory, if any of those terms no longer apply the employee is supposed to uninstall their HUP license. But MS also has the option of disabling those product keys in the activation system.&nbsp; Not that I've heard of that actually happening.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No refund is going to happen or necessary. The employee was simply taking advantage of an employer provided benefit that has explicit terms. This is exactly the same situation as the recent case where a girl could not travel on an airline employee discount
 ticket because wearing tights did not meet the employee dress code.&nbsp; The headlines glossed over the FREE employee discount ticket part causing unfair public backlash against the airline.

<p>In Word 2010 when I go to 'Quick Parts' and save a string the formatting is not saved. Since I use various fonts in my emails I would like to save text without the formatting codes Outlook 2010. However I seem to be unable to do this. How can I save text
 in an Outlook 2010 which will be formatted with the current font?</p>

            The router was not being recognized by the computer.&nbsp;The router was being by-passed and only the modem was recognized&nbsp;by the IP provider.&nbsp; A check of settings at IP Configuer verified this.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once this condition was corrected, the router functioned properly
 and there have been no further problems.&nbsp; Both the IP Provider and Router support team contributed to this fix.

<h2>            short date format display dd&#47;MM&#47;yy regardless of the Region and Language Settings</h2>
                    
<p>Just installed Windows 7 Home Premium (fresh install).</p>
<p>In Excel 2007, I mostly use dd-MMM-yy as format to display dates. All the date fields with this format now show as dd-MM-yy (ie 03-06-10 instead of 03-Jun-10).</p>
<p>I've checked every setting in the Language and Region Settings in the Control Panel, changed to another language and set again to my preferred setting [English (Australia)] as a potential fix found on another forum.</p>
<p>I have the same issue with my old MS-Money 2005 which I managed to re-install on W7. Dates used to show as dd-mmm-yy, and are now showing as dd-MM-yy.</p>
<p>In Excel, I've noticed that these cells show with a * in front of the format, indicating they are based on the default regional setting - which is not working, as the default short date is also set with dd-mmm-yy.</p>
<p>I've seen this issue reported in other forums, including in the MYOB forum for users who updated to Windows 7.</p>
<p>I can change it manually in Excel (I have 1000's of spreadsheet though ...) but not in MS-Money.</p>
<p>It seems like a bug to me, so hopefully this will be picked up and fixed in a soon-to-come update.</p>
<p>Cheers, P-F, Sydney</p>

<h2>            Blackberry Connect 4.0 for E70&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I don't expect much here, but does anyone have any clues as to when the BBC 4.0 client for the E70 might be released? I've emailed the question directly to customer service and had no response at all. It would have been nice to at least get a 'we can't give
 you a release date' email!<br />
<br />
It's really amazing to me how little information there is on this. Web searches reveal very little information - official or rumours. Are there really so few people using the BBC client?<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for any gossip you might have!

            The current version supports only 'push pull' email and calendar services. It effectively works using an older BES server functionality. As I understand it, the 4.0 version supports the BES 4.0 feature set. This should allow for full synchronisation of
 email, contacts, and calendar / to-do items. It apparently also supports the latest admin features such as enabling the device over the air (rather than using the desktop client for this).<br />
<br />
While the current version is certainly better than nothing, having the full BES 4.0 feature set would be a huge step forward in my opinion.<br />

            did you read the sticky at the top of the board about supported bluetooth drivers?<br />
<br />
its here: http://discussions.nokia.co.uk/discussions/board/message?board.id=connectivity&amp;message.id=114<br />
<br />
you do not have a supported bluetooth driver installed for use with pc suite, you will need to update to the latest in order to connect.<br />
<br />
you can get the latest from www.ivtcorporation.com

i thought i had the latest version.<br />
but now i have updated my software versions (both pc suit and blue soleil)<br />
<br />
my pc suit now shows bluetooth connection and it also proceeds with searching devices, it also lists my fone in the list. but when i select my fone it asks for the passcode, i entered the passcode in the pc but nothing came on my fone (i mean passcode window).<br />
<br />
pc suits gives me the msg that this connection is available and u can now use pc suit to browse .........<br />
<br />
but when i try any service of the pc suiut it says no fone connected<br />
<br />
:(<br />
<br />

            What version BT drivers are currently installed? <br />
<br />
When using IVT drivers, allow the IVT software to indentify the phone by name (not only by BT ID number) before using PC Suite, and try using 1 as the pairing code.
<br />
<br />
Make sure there are no active BT devices connected to the phone.

            Hello Mel, <br />
<br />
Check out what's new in Build 16188 for PC.<br />
<br />
‚Ä¢ The <strong>PDF form filling</strong> feature allows you to fill out forms in PDF documents. This feature works exactly like it does in other applications that provide the functionality. All you have to do is simply click on a field, then use the keyboard
 to enter characters into it. You may save the PDF document afterwards, or have it printed.<br />
<br />
‚Ä¢ Second feature is the <strong>PDF annotations</strong>. This extends the browser's "make a web note" feature; you can drawn on PDF documents just like you can draw on regular web pages. This gives you the option to write on the PDF document, use the text
 highlighter, or erase annotations again. Also, the edited document can be saved for later use.<br />
<br />
‚Ä¢ The <strong>Table of Contents</strong> feature, allows you to pick up the table of content of a PDF document for easy navigation. This can be accessed from the PDF toolbar ToC button on the left side of Edge.<br />
<br />
‚Ä¢ <strong>Better viewing and navigation</strong> allow you to rotate PDF documents for better readability, or change the layout type from one to two pages that are displayed next to each other when selected.<br />
<br />
