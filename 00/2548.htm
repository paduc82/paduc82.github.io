    <title>Fraud - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigger o  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fraud</h2>
                    <p>On July 17th 2016 my bids were fraudulently changed from .24 cents to $24 dollars. I changed my bids back to .24 cents and I filed a claim through chat support due to the fact that my balance had jumped FROM $0 to $340.00&nbsp; in less than 1 hour...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I know what most of you may be thinking, you forgot to add the decimal in the front. NOT TRUE, KEEP READING..</p>
<p>
</p><p>An hour later I saw the balance was still rising for an additional $148.00 and decided to look into what is going on again, I saw that my bids were still $24.00&nbsp; OMG!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted support again and asked them who changed my bids again, bing chat support told me that according to the records in the system, I changed it to $24 again ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next time I waited for customer service to be available due to the hours available and called in and spoke to a rep who told me that only 38 keyword bids were changed&nbsp; back to .24 cents as opposed to the regular 2000 bulk keyword changes, that I normally
 do. (This is were there is obvious fraud and system issues not including my daily spending limit of only $17.00 per day)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also my user screen has two options, select 100 keywords or select bulk keywords for all 2000 keywords. So I know for damn sure I did not manually select 38 out of 100 keywords or 38 out of 2000 keywords during editing my keyword bids. For example if you
 go to the bottom of a campaign you will see a dropdown menu that say (show rows: 20,50,100, 200).&nbsp; THERE ISN'T A NUMBER 38.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My bids were either changed by someone else or there was an extreme system cliche and it exceeded my daily spending limit of $17, and now I need someone to investigate the office in the Philippines. Their chat reps are telling me there is nothing they can
 do to help with these fees.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my balance is $488 and I cannot afford to pay it.&nbsp; I have a feeling that this fraud was done internally by the bing office in the philippines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a feeling that bing ads chat support in the Philippines needs to have a certain amount of satisfied profitable claims in order for their department to bee seen as credible, relevant and worthy to stay in business for this a business expense to bing,
 not income, however my $488 will be seen as a positive for their department and extremely profitable when they only pay their employees $1 per hour.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have anything against filipinos I just cant afford to fund their entire department.</p>

<h2>            Nokia n96 WONT BOOT UP HELP</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;my phone froze. i left the&nbsp;phone for a min and then checked again but the phone was still frozen so i removed the batterie left it for a couple of mins and put it back in. now all my phone does is turn on the nokia logo loads but then it turns of and restatrs
 and does the same again white screen nokia logo no hands coming in at all and then it goes off and starts again. do i need to do the three finger restart I have herd about a member on this site he said :</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/23D979A0-433A-4829-8D0C-0FD844EB4DCB">/t5/Nseries-and-S60-Smartphones/IMPORTANT-Don-t-RESET-N96/m-p/352801</a></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><font>I hope this gets out, But DO NOT RESET N96. YOU WILL HAVE TO RETURN IT TO SERVICE IF YOU DO!<br />
<br />
If you use the *#7370# or the 3 finger method then you WILL delete MANY things like:<br />
<br />
<strong>- LICENCES to pre-loaded content like MAPS, GAMES, MOVIES, MUSIC!<br />
- PRE-INSTALLED applications like Ngage application<br />
</strong><br />
<br />
The N96 has User Data Protection but that doesn't mean that if you re-format the device all data is protected. It means that DATA is protected during firmware update and other NORMAL operations.<br />
<br />
HARD RESET, is NOT a user tool. Is a repair tool. It FORMATS the phone so many things are deleted.<br />
<br />
Do you FORMAT your PC when something happens?<br />
<br />
THIS SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT AND YOU SHOULD NOT DO IT. YOUR N96 WILL NEED TO BE TAKEN BACK TO SERVICE IF YOU DO.</font>
<p><font><br />
</font></p>

            You could try to remove the memory card if you have one installed. Sometimes faulty memory cards or corrupted memory cards, or even faulty simcard could be the issue.<br />
<br />
At least try that first.<br />
<br />
<br />
If your phone won't boot when bot simcard and memory card ar e pulled out, youre left with little choices. Either try the hard reset or take it to a Nokia care point.

<h2>            Missing app folders on the startscreen &#38; podcast has stopped working</h2>
                    The issue I having is that all but one of my app folders are missing, I am unable to pin anything to start. Also the one folder that did reappear after install windows 10 mobile had the wrong apps in it. Also&nbsp;the podcast app doesn't seem to be working
 with a number of different apps. I think the new design has some plus but I still like 8.1 better, its moving picture under the tiles in 8.1 has a better aesthetics. Also some UI elements are off-screen on my 929(icon) making it next to impossible to access
 setting and other UI elements. I am unable to add my username and password for yahoo as their isn't a next or an ok just a window with username and password.

<br />Hello Norman
<br />
<br />First, '2019 Home &amp; Student is the updated version of '2007 H&amp;S
<br />
<br />Recommended approach would be to uninstall '2007 first and then install '2019 but you can install '2019 and still retain '2007 - just don't know why you would want to do that.

            Hi Norman
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. My name is Margarida, I'm a member of the Microsoft Expertise Network. We are experienced users who assist the Support Staff by helping out fellow users in the community. 
<br />
<br />Do you mean your files / documents?
<br />
<br />As a safety precaution you should save them in another location prior to upgrading Office. 
<br />
<br />Once you have saved the files, you should install your new Office.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! If this still persists, please let me know. 
<br />Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida

            Hi creativehearts52 
<br />
<br />You can install Office 2019 alongside Office 2007 and keep both versions on your PC, according to Microsoft, that is no Problem
<br />
<br />The reality is you will get file association errors, with documents trying to open in the different version
<br />
<br />it is better to uninstall Office 2007 completely before installing Office 2019, however, please note, Office 2019 has less applications and if you use the applications that are not in 2019, then you need to keep 2007

            Hi normanchoy1
<br />
<br />Yes, you can go into Settings - Apps - Default Apps and set the File Associations form there. Though from time to time, you would need to do that, because updates may change your file associations . . .

    <title>Lost ability to view YouTube videos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gs-parker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost ability to view YouTube videos </h2>
                    
<p>OS is Windows 7 (64bit) and IE-8(32 bit verson)</p>
<p>&nbsp; Not sure what I messed up, but unable to find / fix issue.&nbsp; When I got the new PC, I was able to view YouTube videos from links and website direct.&nbsp; But I made some changes to something and now I get to the website and it looks like it is trying to load
 the video, but never plays and NO ERROR messages.</p>
<p>I have unistalled and re-installed &nbsp;Adobe Flash Player 10, Java, Silverlight.&nbsp; I have reset all the IE8 defaults.&nbsp; I have tried turning off all firewalls, but still only get the wonderful dots moving in a circle on the video box.&nbsp; Note, it does play videos
 from Comcast home page and other websites like Crutchfield, but never from YouTube.</p>
<p>I Think it might be that the Flash Player is not the default for the IE8 for that format, but not sure how to see or set ?&nbsp; Maybe I am way off in my guess.&nbsp; Thanks for any help</p>

<h2>            Cannot format text in HTML for a calendar appointment in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>Before I upgraded to Office 2013 from 2010 I could drag an email to the calendar to create an appointment. With 2010 the appointment would keep the source email text format the same, for example in HTML. Now with Outlook 2013 the email is converted to plain
 text and the options in the&nbsp;"FORMAT TEXT"&nbsp;tab are all greyed out as below.</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>I need this function because 90% of appointments I create are by dragging emails to the calendar and I do not want them in plain text</p>
<p><br />

<p>Can some one help please</p>

<p>I have also updated my Outlook client with my Outlook.com profile, actually did a fresh install of Office365 and then added it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find now that when I drag an email to the Calendar, it is displayed in Rich text format, not plain text as before. It also has the HTML format option there as well, which you can change to.</p>
<p>But then I have to select all from the email and paste it across after I have changed it to HTML.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pretty close, but instead of dragging the email to the Calendar and have it keep its HTML format, I have to open a new appointment, change the Format text option to HTML, select all on the email and paste across. This would be a lot quicker to be able
 to drag it across and bang, it keeps it's HTML format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked for an option for the Calendar to keep the source format when adding Calendar items, but couldn't find any.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried your method and you are right. This is the only way in which it changes back to rich text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open up an appointment and copy paste the text into the new appointment and it will stay HTML. I can use the button in the ribbon to create a new appointment, but I cannot drag and drop without having it changed to RTF.<br />

From a security point of view I'm quite happy about that. Are you on a Mac? Because I would prefer changing from drag and drop to using the button that is meant for the same purpose. Without the need of opening up a second instant of the application.<br />
<br />
When I drag the mail into an appointment by the way, it is added as an attachment and it also stays HTML formatted. Sorry to hear the drag and drop to the calendar changes the format. Never really needed that kind of functionality before.</p>

<h3> forrest shields  say:</h3>
<h2>            Authentication Failure - Can&#39;t login during initial My Phone setup</h2>
                    I too am having a problem getting logged on for the first time.<br />
<br />
<em>Background info:<br />
</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an HTC Touch Pro phone (touchscreen) on the Sprint network<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm running Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional - CE OS 5.2.19965 (Build 19965.1.2.3)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've installed <em>Microsoft My Phone</em> 01.05.2128.0401 for the first time (I've never had a beta version of this product on my phone.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I installed the touch version. Filename: myphone-1.5.2128-wm-pro-touch.cab<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My phone has a 3G data connection (although I have also tried this tethered to a PC...unsucsessfully)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can open Internet Explorer on my phone and sucessfully log into login.live.com<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My&nbsp;Windows Live ID is tied to my regular non-hotmail, non-live, non-msn e-mail address<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can also then goto myphone.microsoft.com and log in (However, it tells me that it is "Awaiting first sync")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have uninstalled <em>My Phone</em>, rebooted the phone, and reinstalled <em>
My Phone</em>.&nbsp; Same problem.<br />
<br />
Firstly, I am presented with a strange screen during setup (first time I ran the application).&nbsp; It asks me to sign in with a Windows Live ID (which I have had since 2003).&nbsp; But it presents the following input text boxes to me:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Email address:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ] @ [<em>dropdown of:</em> hotmail.com, live.com, msn.com, Other]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Password:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]<br />
This is very odd!&nbsp; How am I supposed to put in my regular (non-Microsoft) e-mail address?&nbsp; Tho only way that I can figure is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Email address:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [&nbsp;x(at)y.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ] @ [ Other ]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Password:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [&nbsp;********&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]<br />
which is <em>retarded!</em> (does Microsoft really expect people to think that a login of&nbsp;x(at)y.com@Other makes sense?)<br />
<br />
In any case, I am always presented with a screen that says:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Authentication Failure<br />
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either the Windows Live ID or password you entered is incorrect. Click Back to try again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not have a Windows Live ID, create a new one <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
here.</span><br />
<br />
I have followed all of the advice I could find on this topic (except to load a beta version and then upgrade...I can't find the beta version).<br />
<br />
Please Help!

            Forrest, thank you for trying My Phone.<br />
<br />
To log on please place the input cursor&nbsp;(scroll right or use the touch interface) in the box that contains the default domain (the one after the @ sign). The text that's in that box by default can be deleted and replaced with whatever domain your Live ID uses

<h2>            alarm settings on Nokia 5800</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to use an mp3 as a wake up alarm but when I go to alarm settings in options the only sounds that come up are aac - can anyone share any light on this please. And what is wrong with Nokia's firmware people that they cannot add 'use as alarm' and
 use as a message tone when you are in the gallery and choose 'use as..' the only sttings they give you is 'contact ringtone' and use as ringtone. Its pretty frustrating when you know things like this that technicall they could have added 'use as message tone'
 and use as 'alarm clock tone' but they chose not to making you have to go into profiles settings to change message tone an other tones :-(</p>

<p>I think I sorted the problem, I remved the memory card and copied the mp3 to phone memory/ sounds and then the mp3 showed up in alarm settings. cheers.</p>

<p>Hi Fred,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The updates for a device's BIOS are being published by computer manufacturers. And issues related to updating the BIOS should be addressed by the computer manufacturer. For us to provide an effective solution, we would need you to answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build of Windows 10 is currently installed on your computer?</li><li>What changes were made to your device before this issue occurred?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps were performed on your device?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, <span>we suggest performing a<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to
 avoid software related conflicts. Run the </span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">automated troubleshooter for Windows Update</a></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to
 repair the damaged or corrupted Windows Update components.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the same issue persists, we suggest renaming the SoftwareDistribution folder. This folder temporarily stores files which may be required to install Windows Update on your computer. Follow these steps to rename the SoftwareDistribution folder:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open File Explorer and then click on your C drive.</li><li>Open the Windows folder and then look for the SoftwareDistribution folder.</li><li>Right click on SoftwareDistribution folder and then rename it to <strong>SoftwareDistribution.old</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer and run the Windows Update.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

                    I recently upgraded to the Windows 8 Dev Preview from Windows 7. Unfortuanantly, I neglected to write down my Office 2010 product key :( I was wondering, is there anyway that I could use the Windows.old folder that the installer made&nbsp;to regain that product
 key? Thanks!

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(29, 33, 41, 1)">About half the time when I insert a PDF or eps image into PowerPoint (2016 Mac, version 15.27), the image is flipped (mirror image) and rotated 180 degrees. This happens with all three insert methods:
 (1) Insert -&gt; Picture -&gt; Picture from file..., (2) copy and paste, (3) drag and drop. This only happens about 50% of the time for a given image. The other times it imports normally. This behavior is reproducible with blank (new) presentations.</span></p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has been fixed in the newly updates as you mentioned above. It's works to insert a PDF of an image in PowerPoint 2016 for Mac. However, if you have PDF files with&nbsp;multiple pages, it's not a good option to proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest customers keep updated with Office applications to have the best user experience. Thanks for your time on this and I believe it will help others in the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>William</p>

<h2>            Slides in PPT notes view become blurry when saved in PDF</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Office 365 (subscription from my school) for years. After updating my Mac OS recently, I noticed that I was starting to have issues with exporting my PPT into PDF files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week, I tried to re-size the resolution of a poster I made in PPT as I was trying to print it into PDF. I changed the dimensions from something like 1600 to 3200 and 2000 to 4000 with no issues. When I tried to do it again, I could not type the 3200.
 It would cap at 2300 and 2999. Even at these capped dimensions the proportions were completely off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I tried saving my PPT as Notes (slides with text/transcript underneath), and the slides were completely illegible and blurry. The text/transcript below the slides were fine though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've saved my Notes pages many times before, and have never had an issue with the resolution of slides. Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Appreciate the update. Your version of Office is far behind in updates that the AutoUpdate itself is too old to work. We suggest downloading the latest copy of AutoUpdate&nbsp;<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=830196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>
 and check for updates again.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Since you mentioned that it also happens in a new presentation, please provide us the test files (PPT and PDF) via private message for further investigation.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Lastly, the Print Quality settings may be still not available on your version of Office.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Regards,<br />
Justin</div>

    <title>Using VBA to Return Specific Values in a Query - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don wolfeye  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using VBA to Return Specific Values in a Query</h2>
                    
<p>The following code is what I need help fine tuning:</p>
<p>Me.lstCUSTOMERS.RowSource = "SELECT [qryCUSTOMER_LISTING].[RT], [qryCUSTOMER_LISTING].[SIC_CD], [qryCUSTOMER_LISTING].[CUST_NO], [qryCUSTOMER_LISTING].[CUSTOMER], [qryCUSTOMER_LISTING].[ADDRESS], [qryCUSTOMER_LISTING].[CITY], [qryCUSTOMER_LISTING].[ST] FROM
 qryCUSTOMER_LISTING WHERE " &amp; _<br />
<strong>"[qryCUSTOMER_LISTING].[RT] LIKE '*" &amp; Me.txtSEARCH &amp; "*'" &amp; _</strong></p>
<p>"ORDER BY [qryCUSTOMER_LISTING].[CUSTOMER]"</p>
<p>The bold text is where my question comes up.&nbsp; I'm trying to return every record that has a particular "route number" (<strong>[qryCUSTOMER_LISTING].[RT])</strong> but when, for instance, I select route "3" in my form, the listbox returns all records with
 route numbers "3", "13", "23" and so on.&nbsp; If there is&nbsp;a 3 in the route number, I get any number that has a 3 in it.&nbsp; I think the word LIKE in the code is causing this problem.&nbsp; How can I re-write this code to get only the number--which happens to be a text
 value--to return only the value I'm looking for?</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Your problem is in your where condition.&nbsp; You are using a LIKE statement and applying wild cards to either side of the criteria value.&nbsp; So of course you are going to get every record where the field contains a 3.&nbsp; You need to correct your where statment
 to perhaps equality (=)&nbsp;versus LIKE.</p>
<p><strong>"[qryCUSTOMER_LISTING].[RT]&nbsp;= " &amp; Me.txtSEARCH</strong></p>
<p>It appears that you're querying for numbers only.&nbsp; However, be aware that if your field in your criteria is of type Text, you will need to supply quotations on either side of your sought value using the Chr() function.&nbsp; (i.e. Chr(34))</p>

<h2>            Command Button Wizard &#38; delete queries</h2>
                    In Access 2010, the command button wizard does not show (or allow) any delete queries.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; Is there some obscure trick related to trust &amp; security (like having to choose to show all actions in the macro design window).&nbsp; And yes, i know i could
 - and can - write a piece of code or a macro and assign that to a button, but it would be easier &amp; faster if i could just use the wizard.

<p>CurrentDb.Execure "DELETE&nbsp;* FROM somethable WHERE somecriteria", dbFailOnError</p>
<p>Or, depending on how you have to identify the record to be deleted and where the table is located, it might take many lines of code.</p>

OpusVidum</a>. Are you still having trouble accessing the phone's store? If yes, does this happen regardless if you're connected to WiFi or mobile data? Have you already tried rebooting the phone by pressing and holding the power &amp; the volume down keys simultaneously
 for 10-15 seconds? BTW, what's the latest build and Firmware version of your Lumia 640? We'll wait for your response.

<h2>            Excel - Count by Color and Specific Text within Cell</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am working on an excel sheet, and I need a formula that counts all of the cells with a given color and a specific text. For example, I have multiple "bad" colored cells with Monday written in, and I have multiple "good" colored cells with Monday written
 in. Then I have similar situation with Tuesday, and so on. How do I count a cell that has a given fill color and a given text within the cell.</p>
<p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no built-in&nbsp;formula that counts by color. There is a UDF that you can insert that uses VBA to do that. Instructions&nbsp;are

<p>
</p><p>Another way that may work for you is if you apply a filter to the data -&nbsp;one of the filter options is to filter by color. You can also&nbsp;try that method.

<p>Hey Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately that UDF did not help me. I am trying to count by the color and text within the cell. I have green mondays and red mondays which I need to count. My excel has data from a day to day basis and there are separate sheets for the months. I have
 people that come in to the office which are marked with green; however, if they scheduled and did not show up then that is marked red. I'm trying to find a UDF that only searches for the red mondays, but I want to use the same UDF to find green mondays.&nbsp; Is
 there any UDF that can help with that?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Derek Cunningham,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just modify the UDF.&nbsp; Say cell A1 will hold the word Monday and the background color red.&nbsp; Then you could modify the UDF to be this:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Function CountCcolor(range_data As Range, criteria As Range) As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim datax As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim xcolor As Long<br />
xcolor = criteria.Interior.ColorIndex<br />
For Each datax In range_data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If datax.Interior.ColorIndex = xcolor And _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; datax.Value = criteria.Value Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CountCcolor = CountCcolor + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
Next datax<br />
End Function<br />
</p>
<p>Then you would call it like this&nbsp;&nbsp; =CountCcolor(F:F,A1)</p>

<p>Karen_E,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just installed the new version of Skype (8.25 I think).&nbsp; How do you add a contact?&nbsp; You can't.<br />
<br />
There's a "+Contact" button that takes you to an, "Add a new contact" screen but you can't enter and save a phone number with the person's name.&nbsp; I just want to add my grandson's name and phone number to my Contacts.&nbsp; Why is that so hard for your programmers
 to understand?&nbsp; I don't want a new group, I don't want to invite anyone to Skype, I just want to and a name and number to my Contacts list.<br />
<br />
Additionally, I can't go into an existing contact and change the phone number.<br />
<br />
You're getting closer but you've still missed the mark.&nbsp; The programmers or software engineers at Skype or Microsoft need to rethink their use case.&nbsp; This is useless.</p>

<h2>            Filter 2 separate groups of columns in Excel at the same time</h2>
                    <p>I have a spreadsheet that lists players on different sports teams. &nbsp;Column A is the sports team, and columns B-N include the name and stats of each of the players. &nbsp;I would then copy this same list to columns P-AC, so that I have the same information in
 two sets of columns and rows &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to apply a filter in column A - sports team - and display all the players on that team. &nbsp;At the same time I would like to apply a filter to column P - sports team - of the second group of records and display all the players of a different team.
 &nbsp;This way I could compare the statistics of the players of two teams side by side. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible? &nbsp;When I select Filter I can't seem to figure out how to tell Excel to separate the two sets of data. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option besides filtering is to leave your tables alone and use the VLOOKUP() function to implement a search.</p>
<p>Do this by completing the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Set the first of your data ranged and insert an excel table, then give it a name like Teams (the arbitrary names i will use for this example). Note you only need one copy of your table for this example so we will not discuss the second table.</li><li>Choose two cells to be your input - these will be reserved for typing in a team name. If you'd rather a dropdown list, with these two cells selected (we will name them t1_ and t2_ arbitrarily) go to Data on the ribbon and select Data Validation &gt; Change
 the type to list and put this in the formula bar: =Teams[Teams] (assuming the first column in the Teams table is named Teams)</li><li>Now your t1_ and t2_ cells should have dropdowns that select between the teams. Create another quick table or tables where data for one team will be shown, either one atop another or side by side (however you like). For the data for the first table make
 the formula in the data cells: =VLOOKUP(t1_,teams,2,false). The '2' in this formula picks a column so you will need to change it to get different data columns, but if you have 3 data points per team, you just have 3 different VLOOKUP()s with 2, 3, and 4 in
 that parameter.</li><li>Repeat for the other lookup table but use t2_ instead.</li><li>Now you should be able to lookup exactly two teams from your tables by selecting the dropdowns accordingly.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if this helps and if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
EBW</p>

    <title>how to block saving in the old Office 97-2003 file formats and batch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willem weetjewel  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to block saving in the old Office 97-2003 file formats and batch convert the remaining&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Environment: small company using Office 365 Business Premium on standalone PC's/laptops with Windows 10, no Windows Servers. I'm the
</span><span>Office 365 administrator.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In short: I'm looking for a way to&nbsp;convert all our&nbsp;</span><span>old Office 97-2003 files without bothering my users.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On our OneDrive and SharePoint libraries I found over 3000 documents in the old Office 97-2003 file format (.DOC, .XLS etc.). Over 300 of them have a change date after 2011 when the last PC with Office 2003 left the company. It seems that many documents,
 mostly for internal use, keep being re-edited. Up to Office 2013 we did not run into any problem with that, but since we moved to Office 365/2016 nasty little problems start to occur and users are complaining they cannot edit old Word documents on their iPads.</span></p>
<p><span>To my dismay Word 2016 still allows you to save in the old file format. It doesn't even warn if you save in .DOC, it only mumbles a bit about "compatibility mode" when you open an old document. I keep telling my users not to save in the old format,
 but that doesn't work, they are way too busy. Is there a way to permanently remove the option to save in the old file format? Strangely only PowerPoint has a setting for that in Trust Center &gt; File block settings!?! Why not in Word and Excel?</span></p>
<p><span>Is there a registry setting for it that I can export to a .reg and deploy? We have no server to use AD and I wouldn't know how anyway.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have installed <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 2016 Administrative Templatefiles (ADMX/ADML)</a> and now I have settings in the local group policy editor (gpedit.msc) that seem to control this, but it does not work. Could it be that this group policy is not working for click-to-run versions of Office?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Another option would be to batch convert all old documents. I would expect something to be available on the SharePoint server, but cannot find it.</span></p>
<p><span>There are some 3rd party tools available, but only from unknown small companies.&nbsp;In this case I would prefer to use something from Microsoft itself. The only thing I can find is
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179019%28v=office.14%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OfficeFile Converter (OFC)</a><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>That is a very fiddly and spartan tool. You have to run it from the command line after editing a .ini file with many cryptic parameters. Hello, this is the year 2017, isn't there anything better? And it has more disadvantages:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>In my tests it&nbsp;only converts .doc and .ppt, not .xls</span></li><li><span>It doesn't replace the old files, it makes copies in the new file format</span></li><li><span>It has a maximum subdirectory depth of 10 for a directory tree. With SharePoint you lose 4 levels to C:\users\&lt;username&gt;\&lt;companyname&gt;\&lt;libraryname&gt;\ leaving only 6 levels and my users frequently go deeper than that.</span></li><li><span>After conversions the documents still open in "compatibility mode". Hell, I want them 100% Office 2016, otherwise we'll get the same nightmare in 2021 when Microsoft introduces the Office YML format.</span></li></ul>

<p>Hi Willem,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OFC is an officially recommended tool. If your requirement can not be satisfied with it, you may consider 3rd party tools available.</p>

<p>Hello Dora,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OFC works fine for .doc and .ppt but reports "failed to convert" for any .xls. See the many complaints from others about this at the end of
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/dcac6aee-9305-442d-8788-fc0348fef17d/ofcexe-failed-to-convert?forum=officesetupdeployprevious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this thread</a>. It uses the converters in the Office 2007 compatibility kit in the background and I guess one of the last Office 2007 updates broke OFC. More details about the problem I have posted
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/f113c022-1148-4dc6-84da-0b1d652e26fa/ofc-works-for-doc-and-ppt-but-fails-for-all-xls?forum=Office2016setupdeploy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish Microsoft would fix its officially recommended tool!</p>

<p>Hi Dora,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already put it on <a href="https://office.uservoice.com/forums/285186-general/suggestions/19151491-fix-ofc-office-file-coverter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
office.uservoice.com</a> because it is not specific to Office 365. But I'm about to give up using uservoice.com. It is a black hole. You can shoot anything in it but nothing comes out. The search function is unable to group similar idea's; often your idea stays
 in "awaiting moderator approval" forever; on very rare occasions a MSFT official responds and I have seen idea's being closed with a "BOOM, it's done" while the solution has no relation with the idea at all. It is completely dysfunctional. Microsoft's management
 should ask people like you and MVP's monitoring MS Answers and the Technet forums what needs to be improved on their products. You have a much better picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>kind regards,</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. In order to install apps from the Store,</p>
<p>2. In order to update apps on my phone,</p>
<p>3. In order to download apps I had on my previous Windows Phone,</p>
<p>4. In order to update the OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently the available Windows 10 Mobile update is 10.010586.494. However, whenever I select the "update" button, the update status remains at 0%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of pending updates which are not pulling through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have a number of downloads which I believe are from my previous Windows Phone which are also not pulling through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have data on my phone at all times and I have attempted downloading and updating with my phone plugged in to a charger.</p>

Thank you but I need a more detailed answer. How do I get a MS Lumia consultant to answer? I tried doing so after I got an email from Microsoft but the link for that option just brought me here again. I have now tried using WiFi for the Windows Phone update
 but with no success. Someone from MS, PLEASE HELP!

<p>I just need clarity on a few things. Firstly what do I need a Wifi connection for, i.e. do I need it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In order to install apps from the Store,</p>
<p>2. In order to update apps on my phone,</p>
<p>3. In order to download apps I had on my previous Windows Phone,</p>
<p>4. In order to update the OS?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need wifi to download files bigger than a certain size (that size depends on your phone variant).</p>
<p>it doesn't matter if they're app installs, updates, OS updates. what matters is their size. Phone updates are usually much larger than the maximum file you can download on cellular connections.</p>
