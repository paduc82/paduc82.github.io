<h2>            Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL</h2>
                    I just read that Microsoft will be offering the new&nbsp;Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL phone on AT&amp;T's system. Why? Why can't I get one thru Verizon. I want the best phone out there. Please change your mind if this is so! More phones mean more exposure and I can
 use the Windows 10 on everything. I don't want to different operating systems on all my stuff.

            <p>I'm sorry but the Lumia 950 and 950XL will be GSM only. &nbsp;They do not support the CDMA bands required for use on Verizon or Sprint. &nbsp;T-Mobile "should" work, they are a GSM carrier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft may release CDMA versions of the 950 models at a later date, but nothing has been announced or even suggested that this could happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could call or write to Verizon and ask them to work with Microsoft to get a Lumia 950 for the Verizon network. &nbsp;The chipset used by the 950 is probably a global chipset, Microsoft should be able to enable the CDMA bands and sell the phone directly
 to consumers. &nbsp;Motorola is doing this with the Moto X Pure. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Moto X Pure is an unlocked Android phone that will work with all the US carriers.</span></p>

            It does not appear to make sense for Microsoft to ignore over half of the US market by not coming out with CDMA models. &nbsp;All we can right now is to petition MS to release a true global version of 950 and sell it unlocked, directly to the consumers.

            <p>Hi Bulldawg77</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just going to steal this from Christopher Miller</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">It does not appear to make sense for Microsoft to ignore over half of the US market by not coming out with CDMA models. &nbsp;All we can right now is to petition MS to release a true global version of 950 and sell it unlocked,

<p>
</p><p>As I am UK based i have just read WITH interest this issue unfold.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Microsoft may release CDMA versions of the 950 models at a later date, but nothing has been announced or even suggested that this could happen.</span></em></strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These two parts of the dialogue are sublime.</p>
<p>So this is my take: I believe that the exclusivity deal the Microsoft signed with AT&amp;T is also MUST have a non disclosure (gag on any deals that Microsoft sign with any other US network prior to and set time after AT&amp;T launch)</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE both Microsoft &amp; Verizon are simply banned from mentioning it as it would undermine AT&amp;T</p>
<p>
</p><p>re CM comment</p>
<p>Microsoft HAS to; if Verizon were NOT going to take up the 950/950XL as it is commercial suicide not to no if no buts</p>
<p>this is why I believe a&nbsp; gag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 950/950XL to launch in the US just need regulatory approval Verizon cannot simply ban the 950/950XL from its networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UK break a phone No insurance, you have to replace it so some "broken" phones will be replaced by the 950 /950XL, you don't in thenUK have to replace the contracted phone with the same make or model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again UK you can opt for the standard contract which includes the phone , or a DIY buy the phone and attach a sim only contract ie voice/ data/ sms, DOWNSIDE front end cost of phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network loses the benefit of the phone contract, with the exception&nbsp; of Apple iPhones there is always a saving to be made this way. my lumiiais BOUGHT unlocked attached this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So based on CM posts Verizon would <strong>lose </strong>if it chose NOT to, so either it is a gag or Verizon trying to get a better deal out of Microsoft but this is a flagship phone, Verizon could choose NOT to sell the Lumia 550 however the 950 / 950XL
 will be allowed on verizon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know the relationship At&amp;T / Verizon but AT&amp;T if Verizon were not to&nbsp; PR disaster AT&amp;T adaverts etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I believe that Verizon will have either / both 950 /950XL&nbsp; due to the above just a frustrating wait
</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks Chris</p>

            <p>The latest article on this topic from windowscentral.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Verizon reportedly blocking new Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950 XL phones from their network</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/verizon-reportedly-blocking-new-microsoft-lumia-950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowscentral.com/verizon-reportedly-blocking-new-microsoft-lumia-950</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>excerpts</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The radios in the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL should technically support Verizon's CDMA band for phone calls, leading many to wonder why Microsoft just doesn't sell the phone unlocked with Verizon's bands.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>According to Mary Jo Foley, she heard that Verizon won't authenticate the phones to work on their network. The reason is due to the nature of CDMA, which has
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_equipment_identifier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">MEIDs (Mobile equipment identifier)</span></a></strong> that must be added to the Verizon system and network even if they are unlocked. Without Verizon adding
 – and in a sense blessing – these phones on their network, they would never work. (Customers typically need to call the carrier and manually enter in the MEID in order to activate the phone. However, if the phone is not listed in the database or the unique
 ID device code is blocked, it cannot work.).</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Due to the complexities of the situation, it would make sense that a new owner of a Lumia 950 would blame Microsoft for the situation when it was Verizon's refusal to accept the phone. As a result, Microsoft has reportedly disabled the CDMA portion of
 the radio since Verizon would not allow it. </em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>For what it is worth, Verizon has done similar things in the past. The <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/verizon-blocks-nexus-7-and-will-probably-get-away-with-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sounds&nbsp;like Verizon has made a choice. Could all this be connected to the fact that Microsoft is taking phone updates away from carrier control?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Verizon doesn't have much, if any, relationship with Microsoft these days. &nbsp;Verizon also refuses to mention their own carrier exclusives, like the upcoming Droid Turbo 2, until they are ready to announce it. &nbsp;Also, an AT&amp;T exclusive would not prevent Verizon
 from commenting about about plans to carry new Lumia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what we know for the US market:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>AT&amp;T is the exclusive wireless carrier offering the 950. &nbsp;It does not mean that they have an exclusive deal with Microsoft, it just means that they are the only one carrying it.</li><li>The 950 uses the <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon/devices/all?processor=808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Qualcomm Snapdragon 808</a>, which has support for the CDMA bands used by Verizon and Sprint. &nbsp;Unless Microsoft explicitly disabled the CDMA bands in the unlocked 950XL, that phone "should" be able to work on&nbsp;Verizon and Sprint. &nbsp;Actually being able to be used
 with&nbsp;Verizon and Sprint is another story.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is a Verizon reseller named TCC that actually says that they can get the 950 on Verizon. &nbsp;I was in one of their stores and the salesperson said she could order it. &nbsp;I have my doubts about that, but a representative from TCC reached to me over Twitter
 to confirm that they could get the 950 and <a href="https://twitter.com/tcctalk/status/655758559544655872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
asked to call them at 844-822-7625</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Note the "should", I'm still not convinced that this is true. &nbsp;I still have a couple months left to pay off my Lumia Icon, so I'll let the dust settle before swearing off the platform.</p>

            <p>Hello everybody </p>
<p>
</p><p>@garym123 I read whatever comes my way and as is it simply did not make any sense, so with the information I tried to get to a position which could explain it and predict a possible outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly as you posted this, I presume you want my views which have not changed, this is my take my personal view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 are GSM phones, the North American version were CDMA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article is incorrect as the specs listed by Microsoft ONLY mention GSM bands NOT CDMA so what has Microsoft disabled and why would it?
</p>
<p>Sprint is also a CDMA network is it not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know the issues behind Nexus 5/ Nexus 7</p>
<p>so I can't comment as I will almost certainly be wrong and both phones are Android</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Lumia Ico is the CDMA equivalent of the GSM Lumia 928. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The AT&amp;T 950 appears to be the international version CDMA banding is not incorporated according to the specs, it will like the Icon be a separate model</p>
<p>
</p><p>My broken phone please activate my 950 is going to be blocked by Verizon en masse well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as there is no CDMA model what was switched off. In India Airtel needed Microsoft to provide an OTA update to switch on 4G LTE devices to 4G capable phones</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was to get 4G after already being HSDPA.</p>
<p>Switching off CDMA prior does NOT appear to be user reversible, I mean you NEED a CDMA service active if it requires an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The source both these commentators use is not stated as it first appears you can adapt the GSM and then the CDMA has been switched off from the 950 which would be problematic for any one purchasing the phone.</p>
<p>
In the absence if facts speculation abounds, best not to comments further</p>

<p>
</p><p><em><span style="color: rgba(79, 98, 40, 1)">So this is my&nbsp; take: I believe that the exclusivity deal the Microsoft signed with&nbsp; AT&amp;T is also MUST have a non disclosure (gag on any deals that&nbsp; Microsoft sign with any other US network prior to and set time after&nbsp; AT&amp;T

<p>
</p><p>Verizon could easily just clarify this but appears NOT to want to or be able to, so my take was to apply other "market" practices to this void, as with&nbsp; all my other assumptions ( based on your post!) this is
<br />
the least likely to be wrong - The opposite is&nbsp; verizon WON'T get the 950 /950XL which is not my belief<br />

<p>
</p><p>Yes if AT&amp;T learned anythiong fromthe NEXT &amp; JUMP situation&nbsp; of 2013, (all I know is some set-to) exclusivity means AT&amp;T paying&nbsp; more per unit so less profit per unit.</p>

<p>Verizon would add the 950 series if there was sufficient demand for it and if Microsoft did whatever tweaks that Verizon usually demands. &nbsp;In their eyes, there is not enough demand for it. &nbsp;They dropped the Icon after 7 months because there was not enough
 demand for it. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Verizon has a long history of antipathy towards Windows phones.&nbsp;I have actually had to talk their salespeople INTO selling them to me - it's no wonder there's so little "demand" for them in their stores. I also joined the Insider Program in order to get
 8.1 and subsequent updates in a timely manner. That said, I own two Lumia Icons and planned to replace them with unlocked 950s when my current contracts end and are converted to no-contract plans in a few months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be a shame to have to choose between the excellent (if grudging) service and coverage Verizon offers and a product I would really like to purchase. If it is within MS's power to get their new phones approved to use the largest system in the country,
 it would be sheer stupidity not do so. If there is a petition somewhere urging MS to do just that, I'll add my name to it in a heartbeat.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Disabled users in Office 365 are now shown as disabled in Yammer</h2>
                    
<p>hi all,</p>
<p>we use office 365. users are synced to office 365 (azure ad) via adsync.</p>
<p>we also use yammer. recently, we disabled the yammer dirsync service, since we want to manage the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-yammer-users-across-their-life-cycle-from-office-365-6c4c8fff-6444-404a-bffc-f9da0bcc3039?ui=fr-fr&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=fr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
yammer life-cycle from office 365</a></p>
<p>the following behavior was observed :</p>
<ul>
<li>when we disable a user on-premise, the user become disabled in office 365. that means that it's sign-in status is blocked. however, the user still in yammer (just offline)<br />
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce3cd319-dae8-4b9a-ad2f-d67e582fb508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce3cd319-dae8-4b9a-ad2f-d67e582fb508" /></a></p>
</li><li>if we delete the user from on-prem, the user is disabled (removed) on yammer.
</li></ul>
<p>my question is : what is the expected behaviour when we disable (not delete) a user form office 365 towards the yammer user status ? is the user removed from yammer or it will be just offline ?</p>

<p>thanks for all of you</p>

<p>Thank you for your inquiry. The expected behavior when a user is deactivated in Office 365 is that, the user will not be removed from Yammer (when the user is reactivated from Office 365, access to Yammer will be reactivated as well).&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you just want to display the contents of the pdf file for the user to see, then you just need to open the file in one of the numerous applications which display .pdf files. Gina's FollowHyperlink suggestion will use whichever app you have defined as the
 default pdf viewer on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to link or import information IN the pdf file into your database, that's a whole lot tougher. Generally .pdf files don't contain data in computer readable form; the file is more like a graphical image of the data, and you would need to use Optical
 Character Recognition software to translate the dots and background into text strings.</p>

            <p>Hi, Nayana. I could not confirm my account status as I do not see anything related to product activation as per your instruction above.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The error messages are:</p>
<p>"0x800705B4: This operation returned because the timeout period expired."</p>
<p>"Excel cannot open the file because the file format or file extension is not valid."
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've created these documents using 365 before I started having problems. None of the documents I've created can be opened. I've also followed the repair instructions, both quick and online, but still no luck.</p>

    <title>force display mode for inline equations &#40;word 2016 mac&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pieffebi  say:</h3>
<h2>            force display mode for inline equations &#40;word 2016 mac&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I often insert equations in my documents. What annoys me is that the display/inline mode is automatically set by word.</p>
<p>I did not find any satisfactory way of forcing the equation style (LaTeX allows to do that with \displaystyle or \textstyle).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inline mode is nice and useful when one has to include equations in the body of the text. But sometimes the equation is not really part of a chunk of text. Sometimes it is just a matter of a few words in the same line as the equation, or maybe&nbsp; a bullet
 or number in an itemized list. In that case I'd like the equation to be in display mode.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whenever there is any text on the same line as the equation, the latter becomes inline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "change to display" option in the dropdown menu of the equation is pointless. It simply introduces a newline, so that the equation is not any more on the same line as the text.<br />
</p>
<p>I found two kind of cumbersome ways of having display equations in a numbered list
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) insert the number of the numbered list in the equation. In this case it is not really a numbered list.</p>
<p>2) introduce a table with hidden borders. Put the numbers in the first column and the equations in the second.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither of these methods is very professional. Is there a better way?</p>
<p>
<br />
</p><p />

            I'm not entirely sure I understand how you want it look, but have you experimented with inserting a frame and then inserting the equation into the frame? You'll find the Frame command on the Developer tab of the ribbon.

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>I'd like it to look like it's in display mode even if there is some text in the same line as the formula (e.g. a line number in a list of formulas).<br />
I guess that a frame would do that, provided there is no text in it. On the other hand a frame is a floating object, so I expect some trouble in aligning the frame to the text outside it.</p>
<p>All in all I do not see an improvemebt over using tables. However I seldom use frames, so some possibilities may elude me.</p>
<p>I'll look into that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Francesco</p>

            <p>The situation with inline/display equation appears even worse if one needs to produce an accessible document.</p>
<p>Putting equations in 'dummy' tables helps to keep the equations in 'Display mode' but it causes problems when your document is checked by Acrobat accessibility checker. The Acrobat checker: (a) fails to appropriately tag the equations; (b) interprets the
 'dummy' tables as regular tables and wants them to bear alternative text, tags, etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And again, </p>
<p>(1) we need 'dummy' tables because our equations have to be numbered (we are writing a scientific document with many equations) and<br />
(2) MS Word forces inline mode if there is any symbol (even tab symbol!) besides the equation on the same line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latter Words feature is a source of many complaints during the years but nothings changes besides the Word's version numbers (2010, 2013, 2016...) and the Word's appearance and licensing. :(</p>

            As far as I can tell this issue occurs whenever you use Illustrator to create a PDF containing effects like drop shadows or feathered fills. Word can't handle it. I have zero problem with PDF files that do not contain feathered fills or gradients, just
 the ones that do, whether I use CMYK or RGB colorspace.<br />
<br />
This is not a limitation of the program used to make the PDF, it is a limitation of Word. The only workaround I have been able to come up with is to save as a PNG and insert that instead. It works better than a JPG because the lossiness of JPG make any kind
 of line art or text look terrible.

            <blockquote>
<p>I’m having the same problem. I created a graphic in Illustrator, set the document color mode to “RGB color,” saved to a .pdf, and inserted in a Word document. When I save the Word document, the entire graphic converts to a fuzzy grayscale version.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The only solution I’ve found is to save the Illustrator graphic as a PDF 4.0-compatible file, which is a poor solution because the image quality suffers in Word (hidden borders become visible, feathered edges look bad, etc.).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Surely Word can handle a simple Illustrator drawing.</p>
<div><br />

Send feedback and see if it changes later on. <br />
As of now all reports are of the issue without much of a resolution other than third party utilities.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand&nbsp;that the you're having difficulties with using Camera App on your Windows Phone Device.</p>

            <p>Hi FaradayNwonu.<br />
<br />
Thank you for a quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the situation you're describing, the cause of the issue could be hardware related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend to try&nbsp;two&nbsp;things to confirm this assumption.<br />
<br />
First of all, please make a backup of any data that you've saved on your device.<br />
Both processes I'm about to advise will wipe the content of the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/back-up-my-stuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/back-up-my-stuff</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After backing up your data, please perform device's Reset.</p>
<p>You will find that function in Settings &gt; About.</p>
<p>Check if the issue persists after the Reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, please try additionally to&nbsp;process&nbsp;full software recovery with the use of Lumia Software Recovery Tool.<br />
This program has to be installed on your PC and it will allow you to download and completely reinstall your phone's Operating System and it's Firmware after downloading the latest available for your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lumia Software Recovery Tool can be downloaded from the web site below.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/mobile/support/faq/?topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/mobile/support/faq/?topic=FA142987</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists even after processing the&nbsp;Full Software Recovery, Please contact the place of purchase or Nokia Care in your vicinity&nbsp;to service the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Marek&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for your assistances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I noticed:</p>
<p>I have an app "Flahlight" that uses the phones camera light too.</p>
<p>but the light does not also come up when I on the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to this problem I remember&nbsp;the camera light&nbsp;failed occasionally to come up when I on</p>
<p>the flashlight app and gradually it stopped coming on at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am putting up this information so that it can aid you to digest the problem better.</p>

            Has the issue been resolved for you? A latest camera app update seems to cause the problem. Has the below answer solved the issue with both the flashlight and the camera for you?

            <p>Thanks for your concern.</p>
<p>The problem is not solved yet. But I'm planning to run the "Software Recovery Tool" please, do let me know if there's any discovered solution to it.</p>
<p>
</p><div>Before attempting to run the "Software Recovery Tool", I would like to confirm the following things to avoid any accidental lost of any of my stuffs in the phone.</div>
<div>1. Does backing up the phone using (Settings&gt;Update and Security&gt;Backup) back up all the whole stuffs in the phone? Or do I need to back up the text message and the pictures separately?. Please educate me more on this. Also on this point, I will like to
 let you know that I did not see the provision to "Back up Sms" in messaging settings unlike windows 8.1.</div>
<div>2. Will I need to reinstall the windows 10 mobile after running the recovery.</div>
<div>3. Is "software recovery" same with "resetting the phone"</div>
<div>4. Can I install and run the "Software recovery tool" directly on the phone or do I have to install and run it via the computer.<br />
<p />

            <p>So far no proper solution seems to be available. Downgrading to 8.1&nbsp; and then upgrading to 10 insider preview seems to have solved the issue for a few while others still suffer. It is worth a shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Resetting will not downgrade your phone. Resetting will simply erase all data and it will retain your phone in WIN 10.
</p>
<p>2. The Software recovery tool is windows device recovery tool. It will downgrade your phone to 8.1 and you have to run it in a PC. It basically flashes your phone. (Phone connected to the said PC via USB connection)</p>
<p>3. About the back up I am not sure as I did not keep the text messages.&nbsp; Although if you are planning to stick with 8.1 then I have to say rolling back does not solve the problem at all. Lumia Camera does not work either.

    <title>Office 2010 Ribbon won&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rpwilso  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010 Ribbon won&#39;t work</h2>
                    Not always, but often, I can't access the ribbon on the top of my Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel and Outlook are the three I use). I see it fine; and I can hover over it - but can't click on anything other than the 3-part exit bar. When I click
 the "X" to exit, it exits immediately without saving my work or asking me to save. And it won't let me manually save, print, etc.<br />
<br />
This is getting very annoying, as it often takes me twice as long to do work when I need to redo it. I still have FULL access to the spreadsheet, e-mails, etc., just not the ribbon. I DO like the ribbon overall, but this is costly.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can give.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will assist you in resolving the issue working with the Office applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow these steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try working in application safe mode and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start an Office application in safe mode, hold the Ctrl key from the key board and then click on the Office application shortcut or the icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are able to work with the Office application in safe mode, then disable the add-ins:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a. </span></span><span>Click on <b>File</b> menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b. </span></span><span>Click <b>Options</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c. </span></span><span>Click <b>Add-ins</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d. </span></span><span>Click on <b>Go</b> button besides <b>Manage: Com-Add-in</b>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>e. </span></span><span>Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, repair the Office suite and verify the results.</span></p>
<p><span>Check this link to know how to repair the Office 2010:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, rename the .qat file from the following location:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: renaming the .qat file will reset all the customizations done in the toolbar.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reply with the results to help you better.</p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

subfolders as well. This is for file explorer.</p>
</div>

<div>However, when I go to c:\ or c:\windows\ properties<br />

            I guess I do not understand what it is you want. In my second post in C: or Windows you can set even hidden files to show what ever columns you want and then you can drag them in any order you want. For Special Folders that you want just right click on
 View tab then Add columns then Choose&nbsp; columns and you can set almost any thing you could want. Just keep playing with the View and Options and each time apply to all folders.&nbsp;

            <p>
</p><p>Let me explain it another way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to c:\windows\boot\ for example</p>
<p>click on properties and you&nbsp;see a customize</p>
<p>option where you are offered a checkbox to </p>
<p>apply the settings to all subfolders below it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you go to c:\windows\ there is no </p>
<p>customize option. C:\ has no customize</p>
<p>option&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to set the folder columns displayed for C:\ (root) as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>NAME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;FILE EXTENSION&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; FOLDER PATH&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; COMPUTER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TIME MODIFIED&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SIZE</p>
<p>
</p><p>and no others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I need a customize option at the C:\ level to apply this fully downward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or of course there might be some other technique entirely to populate this</p>
<p>to all the folders and subfolders throughout the entire c:\ entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A customize option is available at my d:\ folder.</p>

    <title>Excell 2010 format cells to special set to the wrong locale - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rbbolin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excell 2010 format cells to special set to the wrong locale</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to format a 10-digit number to a phone number format using “format cells”/special.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Intermittently, it will use locale Chinese (Taiwan) instead of English (U.S.) which is the default on my system.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I do not have any non-English keyboards or other features enabled.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Region and languages Location is United States.<span>&nbsp; </span>This problem occurs on a Windows 7 64-bit system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Text Services and input languages” general tab shows on English (United States) as the only installed serves.
<br />
</p>

<p>There is a good reason to use Microsoft’s special formats over text and custom.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is no way to tailor text to the needs of the end user of a spreadsheet and custom formats leads to the display format to reflect the taste of the person that inputs the data.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The fact that “Format Cells” / Number /Special dialog box sometimes fail to work as expected is an unfortunate bug and I am looking for an answer to that problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>As to how phone numbers should be formatted, I have no idea how they should be formatted as there is no consensus on what is the correct format.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I only know what format I like in the list of popular formats.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The advantage of ‘Special’ is, it has some stamp of approval and has eliminated complaints about it not matching someone else’s tastes.</p>

            <p>The reason that I wish to use a number rather than text is to have the maximum level of abstraction.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The phone numbers were originally entered as text according to the taste of the people that entered the data over time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If I was to have the phone number according to my taste it would be a custom format as 000"."000"."0000.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In the US, Microsoft uses custom format as <span>
"("000")" "000"-"000</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>I chose to use special over text or custom is so other users can see phone data in their own default format.</p>

<h2>            OneNote keeps signing out</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneNote on iOS is consonantly logging off. Everytime when I open the app after a while, it prompts on top to sign back in in order to synchronize. This is super annoying and I can never make a quick note because then I won't synchronize with my other machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already "cleared" the login details in settings and even re-installed OneNote. I can't remember it ever kept singed in on my iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this and how to not get logged out all the time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thnx&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Problem with Windows Defender</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Running Windows 10 Recently unable to open Defender from the Task Bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I type "Defender", I click on the file to open it I get asked how I would like to open this ".settingcontent -ms file".</p>
<p>Nothing worked (for me!).</p>
<p>However, I can open it by opening the Security Setting and pressing "Open Windows Defender".</p>
<p>I have it disabled but still allow it to run periodic scans as I us a reputable AV Company. All virus/ malware scans are always clean.</p>
<p>Any help &nbsp;would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Rachelle&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, &nbsp;i get no error messages, just a drop down asking how I want to open this file, &nbsp;ie Defender. I can open using through update and security in Windows Settings.</p>
<p>I do not know of any software changes and have no hardware changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All my programs are up to date, &nbsp;as is Windows itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have ran both online and offline scans using Defender, both came back clean.&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you for the information.<br />
<br />
There could some reasons why you're having issues with opening Windows Defender. We suggest that you try first to unpin it from the taskbar and pin it again.<br />
<br />
Feel free to let us know if you need further assistance.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>No that did not solve my problem!</p>
<p>I cannot open Defender by typing Defender into the "Search Windows" dialogue bar. The "Defender Control Panel" icon appears but when I press on it the following messages always comes up "How do you want to open this -settingcontent smsfile?"</p>
<p>If I open it thru "Setting and Security" it opens and operates as normal though....<br />

            <p>Hi. ...</p>
<p>The plot thickens......</p>
<p>Problem may not be too do with Defender. I tried to open my Bluetooth settings by typing Bluetooth in to the Window's Search bar . I got asked again how I would like to open the program. I can open it only using the settings tab in the Notification Centre.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the &nbsp;rambling responses but I'm feeling completley lost right now. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>It appears that a small number of Windows 10 or 8.x systems have experienced this issue, usually those have been upgraded or reverted to the earlier operating system version, though that's not consistent.&nbsp; However, the common issue is that they have apparently
 experienced registry corruption for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following will take you to an unsuccessful attempt to fix this on Windows 10, but that also contains a link in the first post to a similar thread for Windows 8.1, where at least a couple people appear to have figured out how to fix it for themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_cortana/settingcontent-ms-filetype-no-longer-recognized/4509f704-6512-490b-ab4d-99f6b0590222">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_cortana/settingcontent-ms-filetype-no-longer-recognized/4509f704-6512-490b-ab4d-99f6b0590222</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, the corruption issue is complex enough that none of the Microsoft support personnel appear to have the skill to aid in fixing it.&nbsp; So if you're not skilled enough to solve the problem using the information from the 8.1 thread, which of course
 might be different for a Windows 10 system, then performing a Windows 10 Restore operation might be the best course to fix it permanently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, you'll need to backup all your personal files before starting and insure that you can reinstall all of the applications, especially older ones if this was an upgrade once the process is completed.&nbsp; If you're also having other issues since an operating
 system upgrade this should fix those as well, but it's not an easy&nbsp;process if you have either lots of older data or programs you'll need to recover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry there isn't better news, but simply understanding what you're up against is the most important thing to understand before beginning any type of repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck,</p>
<p>

<p>I'm afraid I can't say Doug, since I haven't experienced this myself so I don't know exactly how deeply this affects other functions of Windows.&nbsp; I just know that I'd be concerned if I didn't understand what caused this that it might relate to deeper problems
 which caused the corruption, so I wouldn't trust the operation of the computer myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if that other issue you mentioned had anything to do with this, but the corruption that caused this originally may have caused both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't think that either of these could directly cause any drastic problems, but I do think I'd make some plans to rebuild the system at some future date if I planned to keep it for the long term.&nbsp; Just like leaving something unfixed on your vehicle,
 it might eventually lead to larger problems that none of us could anticipate.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have MS Office 365 + MS Visio 2016 Standard. As I need to use BPMN 2.0 I understand that I need Premium version. Is that correct? If so, is there any price plan for such upgrade? I am not willing to buy Premium version for full price if I already have
 Standard version.</p>

    <title>Application update problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivanvit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Application update problem</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem with Windows Phone 8.1 application reinstall:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Install an application from Windows Store;</p>
<p>2. Run it, works fine;</p>
<p>3. Try to install a new version using Windows Phone Application Deployment (8.1) tool - get an error:</p>
<p>Error - Package could not be registered</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. If I uninstall the Store version before, I have no errors with new build installing using&nbsp;Windows Phone Application Deployment (8.1) tool</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the question is, if I have a chance to reinstall the new version of the app using&nbsp;Windows Phone Application Deployment (8.1) tool over the Windows Store version already installed? Or I should uninstall the old Windows Store version before the new one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ivan.</p>

<p><span>Hi Noevir_L,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have a the same issue.
</span>I tried to restart the skype and my smartphone but none of them helped. After of course I tried to reinstall the Skype but it also didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After your message I decided I try it again, steps:</p>
<p>1) I opened the Apps</p>
<p>2) I force stopped the Skype app.</p>
<p>2) I used the Clear Cache and Clean buttons</p>
<p>3) I uninstalled the Skype app</p>
<p>4) I turned off my phone and after a few seconds I turned back it</p>
<p>5) I installed the Skype</p>
<p>6) I started the Skype but nothing has changed, Skype app crashes after the login process</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.x Skype could work, so I'm sure the new version is not compatible with Intel CPU:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone: <strong>ASUS_Z00AD</strong> (Asus ZenFone 2 ZE551ML -- <strong>Intel Atom Z3580</strong> -- http://www.gsmarena.com/asus_zenfone_2_ze551ml-6917.php)</p>
<p>Android: <strong>6.0.1</strong></p>
<p>Skype: <strong>8.3.0.52046</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can't use the Skype on my smartphone for more than 1 month...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Zsolt</p>

<p>In case anyone missed it, this is just the way things are now that only phones based on ARM chips are
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_prevandroms-skype_startms-skype_installms/help-cannot-run-the-latest-version-of-skype/5ca83c7d-4378-48b9-852a-ef4415911539">
supported</a>&nbsp;by current versions of Skype. That doesn't quite make sense to me, since what does it matter that Intel discontinued their mobile CPUs (it's not like your existing Intel mobile CPU would have ever been updated--it's a CPU and is a fixed thing),
 but anyway....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing left to do now is uninstall Skype 8, enable Android's ability to install APKs, grab the last Skype 7 version from a place like apkmirror, install it, disable autoupdates for it, and forget Skype 8 even exists (no one seems to like it anyway).</p>

<p>It's true Intel discontinued their mobile CPUs but more millions smartphone still work with these ones so it can't be a reason for Microsoft's attitude. Moreover the Microsoft is the only one who does not support this kind of CPU.</p>
<br />
Furthermore you can't be serious when you wrote that I should download the Skype 7 from somewhere in the Internet... We can download affected App from even Google Play and you suggest me down it from an unreliable website? At least we could download from Microsoft
 website but the App updates would be a nightmare because I would have to install all app manually and I couldn't use the Update All button.<br />
<br />
So all in all if Microsoft is not so smart to could solve the Intel CPU support then they should upload Skype 7 for Intel CPU app into the Google App. I'm sure Skype 7 contains security bugs and in that case they could update it and doesn't leave along Intel
 CPUs smartphone owers...

<p>I agree that it's not a great reason, but it is the reason anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's a very well-known site, but if you don't trust it, go on a top forum like xda-developers and get it there (or ask for it there). If you don't trust even that site, well...no Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know how to download an old version of an app from Google Play? &nbsp;Do tell! &nbsp;I don't, which is why I mentioned a well-known place where you can get it. Sure, MS should provide it, but I don't think that they do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates for Skype 7 wouldn't be a nightmare because it's not being updated. It's EOL. Just be thankful that it works.<br />

release notes</a>, 8.5.0.55324 was released on Aug 28th and will be rolled out gradually over the next few weeks. Presumably, that version definitely has the fix, given the previous post about a beta version which did.

            I have a similar problem Received spurious e mail which forwarded it self to all contacts in my address book .Tried to e mail the sender of the spurious e mail who is known to me but when I type her e mail address in the to box I get several spurious e
 mail addresses shown in my list . Neither the sender nor these spurious address appear In my address book . They only appear as part of a list when I type the specific e mail address in the to box . None of the normal methods to delete the entries work how
 can I get rid of them ? I should add I have no group or linked contacts in my address book

 may. The account is 25yrs old and had many important emails &amp; folders &amp; is my main communication for business.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The code to unlock it will be sent to an alternative email account but the problem is that the alternative email account also
 is blocked. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I have still got access to my older messages&nbsp;on my phone and used that information to fill in the verification forms perfectly
 but it gets rejected.. I keep being sent to the verification page at every turn &amp; have filled it in numerous times. When I get an email from Microsoft escalations team, they merely send me back around in circles again to the same place.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Why isnt this working to verify my account?. I desperately need to access my account.</span></p>

 Cant you link&nbsp;them together??</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems no one at Microsoft cares at all about this. I just get automated computer generated replies or people that don't read my support email requests properly &amp; send me
 back around in circles again.</span></p>
