<div>So this event started randomly after the computer has been operating with the same hardware for over a year. It only seems to occur when the computer is under load(I am a gamer and specifically when using graphical games, it has occurred during Diablo
 3, WoW, FarCry 3 etc). The computer goes from running just fine, with no latency or lag, and then suddenly my screen blackens, the sound goes to a buzzing sound and the computer crashes. It initially occurred infrequently, but now prohibits me from really
 play games as it will crash every 30 mins - 1 hour while under high load. The computer works great and NEVER crashes during low usage(using internet browser, emails, playing music etc). I've reformatted the computer and it didn't not fix it. I came to the
 assumption that it must be a faulty power supply, replaced it earlier this week, and unfortunately the same crash just happened earlier tonight. I am at a loss, and although I think of myself as pretty tech savvy I have been unable to resolve this issue.&nbsp;</div>

<div>I found this link and attempted the fixes that were recommended. No luck</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>_______________________________________</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At this point I would be happy to replace hardware to fix the issue, but am unsure where to even start and dont want to rebuild my whole computer!!! I have tried drivers, I have also even reformatted the computer, with a fresh install and clean partitions,
 and as mentioned have replaced the power supply and still am unable to fix the problem.</div>
<div>PLEASE HELP!</div>

Stop 0x124 is a hardware error</strong><br />
<div><em><em><font color="#FF0000"><b>If you are overclocking try resetting
 your processor to standard settings and see if that helps.</b></font></em></em></div>
<span>If you continue to get BSODs here are some more things you may want to consider.</span><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is"possible" that
 it is driver related (rare).</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
Stop 0x124 - what it means and what to try</strong><br />
<span>Synopsis:</span><br />
<i>A "stop 0x124" is fundamentally different to many other types of bluescreens because it stems from a hardware complaint.<br />
Stop 0x124 minidumps contain very little practical information, and it is therefore necessary to approach the problem as a case of hardware in an unknown state of distress.<br />
</i><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;Generic "Stop 0x124" Troubleshooting Strategy:</strong><br />
<br />
<span>1)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that none of the hardware components are overclocked.</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hardware that is driven beyond its design specifications - by overclocking - can malfunction in unpredictable
 ways.</span><br />
<span>2)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that the machine is adequately cooled.</strong><br />
<span>&nbsp;If there is any doubt, open up the side of the PC case (be mindful of any relevant warranty conditions!) and point a mains fan squarely at the motherboard. That will rule out most (lack of) cooling issues.</span><br />
<span>3)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update all hardware-related drivers</strong><span>: video, sound, RAID (if any), NIC... anything that interacts with a piece of hardware.</span><br />
<span>It is good practice to run the latest drivers anyway.</span><br />
<span>4)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update the motherboard BIOS according to the manufacturer's instructions and clear the CMOS.</strong><br />
<span>Their website should provide detailed instructions as to the brand and model-specific procedure.</span><br />
<span>5)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Rarely, bugs in the OS may cause "false positive" 0x124 events where the hardware wasn't complaining but Windows thought otherwise (because of the bug).</strong><br />
<span>At the time of writing, Windows 7 is not known to suffer from any such defects, but it is nevertheless important to always keep Windows itself updated.</span><br />
<span>6)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Attempt to (stress) test those hardware components</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>which can be put through their paces artificially.</span><br />
<span>The most obvious examples are the RAM and HDD(s).</span><br />
<span>For the RAM, use the 3rd-party memtest86 utility to run many hours worth of testing. (6-8 passes to stress the ram out)</span><br />
<span>For hard drives, check whether CHKDSK /R finds any problems on the drive(s), notably "bad sectors".</span><br />
<span>Unreliable RAM, in particular, is deadly as far as software is concerned, and anything other than a 100% clear memory test result is cause for concern. Unfortunately, even a 100% clear result from the diagnostics utilities does not guarantee
 that the RAM is free from defects - only that none were encountered during the test passes.</span><br />
<span>7)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>As the last of the non-invasive troubleshooting steps</strong><span>, perform a "vanilla" reinstallation of Windows: just the OS itself without any additional applications, games, utilities, updates,
 or new drivers - NOTHING AT ALL that is not sourced from the Windows 7 disc.</span><br />
<span>Should that fail to mitigate the 0x124 problem, jump to the next steps.</span><br />
<span>If you run the "vanilla" installation long enough to convince yourself that not a single 0x124 crash has occurred, start installing updates and applications slowly, always pausing between successive additions long enough to get a feel for whether
 the machine is still free from 0x124 crashes.</span><br />
<span>Should the crashing resume, obviously the very last software addition(s) may be somehow linked to the root cause.</span><br />
<span>If stop 0x124 errors persist despite the steps above, and the hardware is under warranty, consider returning it and requesting a replacement which does not suffer periodic MCE events.</span><br />
<span>Be aware that attempting the subsequent hardware troubleshooting steps may, in some cases, void your warranty:</span><br />
<span>8)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Clean and carefully remove any dust from the inside of the machine.</strong><br />
<span>Reseat all connectors and memory modules.</span><br />
<span>Use a can of compressed air to clean out the RAM DIMM sockets as much as possible.</span><br />
<span>9)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>If all else fails, start removing items of hardware one-by-one in the hope that the culprit is something non-essential which can be removed.</strong><br />
<span>Obviously, this type of testing is a lot easier if you've got access to equivalent components in order to perform swaps.</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>Should you find yourself in the situation of having performed all of the steps above without a resolution of the symptom, unfortunately
 the most likely reason is because the error message is literally correct - something is fundamentally wrong with the machine's hardware.</strong></span></div>

<div>I have also loaded the PC-Specs for the computer I have, but I have a couple upgrades that differentiate from the generic specs. Keep in mind all the hardware I am using is the same hardware I've been running successfully for over about 2 years so there
 is no reason to suspect incompatibility as there has been no recent changes.&nbsp;</div>

<div>I am still working through your troubeshooting strategy</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) There is no hardware that is currently overclocked.</div>
<div>2) I have opened the side panel and aimed a fan at the computer and still experience crashes.</div>
<div>3)I have vanilla installed Windows 7, reinstalled all drivers, and still experience crashes.</div>
<div>4) I have NOT updated the motherboard BIOS at this moment, I do plan to do so today though.&nbsp;</div>
<div>5) Again, vanilla install of Windows 7. And as you mentioned there are no known bugs for Windows 7 for this step.</div>
<div>6)I have NOT stress tested the components yet individually. Although I do know the computer only crashes under stress so this is my next step.</div>
<div>7) Already done, vanilla install.</div>
<div>8) Already done, cleaned entire computer top to bottom with canned air it's literally spotless including the power supply(which I have replaced in my foolishness thinking this would fix the problem, so I now have two 600w power supplies)</div>
<div>9) I have obtained another computer to swap parts with today, so that is also on my to-do list for today.</div>
<div><br />
<div>_________________________________________________________</div>
<div><br />
<div>At this point my crashes still persist. I will implement the rest of this troubleshooting strategy today. I hope that my sys info, mini-dumps, system specs, and driver view provide the information needed to pinpoint the culprit for this crash.</div>

<div>7) Already done, vanilla install.</div>
<div>8) Already done, cleaned entire computer top to bottom with canned air it's literally spotless including the power supply(which I have replaced in my foolishness thinking this would fix the problem, so I now have two 600w power supplies)</div>
<div>9) I have obtained another computer to swap parts with today, so that is also on my to-do list for today.</div>
<div><br />
<div>_________________________________________________________</div>
<div><br />
<div>At this point my crashes still persist. I will implement the rest of this troubleshooting strategy today. I hope that my sys info, mini-dumps, system specs, and driver view provide the information needed to pinpoint the culprit for this crash.</div>

<div>I again thank you for your assistance</div>

<br />
Just a note in passing.&nbsp; As JMH3143 indictated this is a hardware issue and the fact that you re-installed vanilla win 7 and it continued confirms that.<br />
<br />
The specific error points towards the CPU<br />
<br />
FAILURE_BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; X64_0x124_<b>AuthenticAMD</b>_PROCESSOR_BUS_PRV<br />
<br />
I would therefor run the cpu stess test.<br />

            The problem I've been encountering is the PC is crashing during the stress tests. It crashed during the memory test with Memtest86, and also during CHKDSK repeatedly. I am unable to complete the stress tests to determine exactly what the problem is. I
 am removing non-essential items at this point while continuing to stress test after each change in hopes of removing the problematic hardware.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Obviously if the hardware in question is my CPU that's not going to identify any items as the culprit other than confirming the problem still exists running barebones.</div>

    <title>Running a Scheduled Backup Task on Windows XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terv61  say:</h3>
<h2>            Running a Scheduled Backup Task on Windows XP</h2>
                    I've setup an "Auto Backup" job to run the ntbackup.exe program once a week under the Scheduled Tasks utility. The job starts and says it's running but it still hasn't completed after 4 hours. While the job is running it's using only 1% or less of the
 CPU. But if I run the same backup manually from the Windows Backup Utility it completes in 20 minutes and uses 20% to 25% of the CPU.
<br />
<br />
How can I get the scheduled task to run as fast and efficiently as the manual task? I've tried increasing the priority of the scheduled task from normal to high but this does not seem to have any effect.

            After researching the question further, I found the solution to my problem. Although the scheduled task was running the ntbackup program, no files had been selected to back up, so it probably would have run indefinitely and accomplished nothing.
<br />
<br />
After creating a new backup job using the Backup Wizard in the Windows Backup Utility and selecting the folders and files to backup, the job now runs at the scheduled time and completes in the same length of time that the manual backup did.

<h2>            Xbox One&#58; Online Status Unknown</h2>
                    For the past few days when I go on my xbox it says I'm last seen: ** mins/hrs ago and when I change my online status it says Online Status Unkown. It seems to affect some of my friends too but not all of them. Is there a way you can fix this problem. I
 have heard it has affected other xbox users recently but most people don't have this issue. I have tried a hard reset, Wifi on/off, restarting, unplugging my xbox and what others have told me to do but nothing seems to work. This is a big problem because not
 only do I appear offline (as well as friends) but I can't accept or receive party invites unless I'm on the xbox app on my phone/pc and. But at around 6.00pm (Australia time) it all of a sudden works again then the next morning it doesn't work creating an
 infinite Offline/Online loop. I hope someone can help me fix this issue as I'm not the only one who is annoyed at this continual issue. I would like this to be fixed because I pay for my xbox live membership and want to have all the

    <title>Unable to switch back to Normal startup from Diagnostic startup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to switch back to Normal startup from Diagnostic startup</h2>
                    <p>To get better performance from my laptop, I was trying a few things including disabling startup programs, etc. While doing this, I inadvertently switched to Diagnostic startup. After this, I am unable to login to Windows using my administrator login because
 the PIN login is disabled (because of the diagnostic startup mode) and Windows is not able to verify my password against the Outlook.com account since the Diagnostic startup does not start with the network enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Safe Mode with Network, but again for some unknown reason, the Safe Mode also doesn't have networking, so again it cannot verify the password supplied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the refresh OS option to retain the data, but reset all applications. It won't accept that either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I do have access to the 'Visitor' account and can login through the same. But I am unable to login to the Admin account nor am I able to access its data.
<br />
<br />
1. How do I switch back to Normal startup</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>2. How can I enable PIN based login</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>3. How can I enable networking in Safe mode or in Diagnostic mode so Windows can verify the admin password?</p>

            Thank you Smith. The option to backup Data &amp; Apps is by logging into Windows 10 with an Admin account, isn't it? In my case, I am not able to login to any Windows Admin account. All I can access now is a Visitor (Guest) account without Admin rights. So
 the above solution will not work in my case.

            You do not need to log in to an account, you are going to make a new installation, you have to check the second link so you can see how you are going to keep your files.

            My ideal solution would be that I can get Windows to recognize the Admin login's password by looking up Outlook.com when booted in Safe Mode with Network. This is currently not happening since for some reason the network is not enabled. I feel the Admin
 account's password in the system is not in sync with the actual password online. Hence it is resulting in an invalid password error.

            Try to restore the BIOS to factory values, then enter Safe Mode with network function, to see if it recognizes the network.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network function to repair
<br />
<br />Turn off your computer; Then, turn it on.
<br />As soon as you see the Windows logo with the rotating dots, press and hold the power button until the computer turns off. Do this process twice.
<br />.-Turn on your computer for the third time, and let it load.
<br />.-You should receive this message: Preparing Automatic Repair.
<br />After entering Mode Update the network driver may be outdated

<p>How did you originally get Windows 10?&nbsp; If you paid for it before, you don't have to buy it again.&nbsp; And if you got it as an upgrade from Windows 7/8 during the free promo period a few years ago, you can install it again for free forever (as long as you install
 it on that same computer).</p>

<div><strong>Standard Hardware Troubleshooting</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</font>
<div>
<div>First lets test what hardware we can. Hardware faults can appear as many software faults, therefore we need to test hardware first..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Please do the following in order. Memory faults can cause disk corruption, disk faults can cause disk corruption. Disk corruption causes corrupted files (which SFC may be able to fix). If you get an hardware error stop and post back.
<strong>Do not run chkdsk with faulty memory</strong>.</p>
<div><font>&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Memory Diagnostic</strong></div>
<div>If you haven't run a memory diagnostic then please do so. Click <em>Start</em> -
<em>Control Panel</em> - choose <em>Classic View</em> in left hand pane - choose <em>
Administrative Tools</em> -&nbsp; then<em>&nbsp;Memory Diagnostics Tool</em>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>S.M.A.R.T</strong></div>
<div><em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disk drives in Windows monitor themselves for impending failure.&nbsp;The feature is&nbsp;called S.M.A.R.T. It will detect impending&nbsp;failure&nbsp;30% of the time.&nbsp;In an elevated command prompt type (it's one line)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><em>wmic /namespace:\\root\wmi PATH MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictStatus get active,predictfailure,reason /format:List</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it's on Active will be true, if not on turn it on in the computer's BIOS.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Predict Failure should be False if everything's ok.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In Vista and later if SMART predicts failure Windows prompts the user to run Backup.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Run Chkdsk</strong></div>
<div>In <em>Computer</em> right click all your drives and choose <em>Properties</em>, then
<em>Tools</em> tab, then click <em>Check Now</em>. Tick <strong>BOTH</strong> checkboxes then Start. Reboot. This will take overnight.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>SFC</strong></div>
<div>Check for file corruption by clicking <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click

<div><font><strong>Dump Files</strong></font></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dump files are files containing the state of the machine when it crashed. We can analyse the file to identify the driver (or program) causing the crash. See the last section on how to get them analysed by a volunteer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Analyse Dump Files</strong></div>
<div>If you want to analyse your own dump files. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You need to start Explorer as Administrator to access the files in <strong>C:\windows\Minidump</strong>. Right click Explorer and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>.</div>
<div><br />
Download and install Debugging Tools for Windows<br />
<div><font color="#0072c6">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363</font><br />
<div>Install theWindows SDK but just choose the debugging tools.<br />
<br />
Create a folder called <strong>Symbols</strong> in C:\<br />
<br />
Start <em>Windbg</em>. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Symbol File Path</em> and enter</div>
<div><br />
<em>srv*C:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Close and reopen WinDbg. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Open Crash Dump</em><br />
<br />
This will analyse the crash dump. You need to close and reopen WinDbg for each dump file analysed. Because you are downloading symbols from the internet WinDbg will appear to be doing nothing. But it's downloading. Be patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You are looking for a driver or system library that the crash occurred in at the end of the listing. Find the file, right click then
<em>Properties</em> - <em>Details</em> tab. If it shows a driver you'll need to update the driver identified. Most drivers are in c:\windows\system32\drivers.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Search the Drive for a File.</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;replacing <em><strong>drivername.sys </strong>
</em>with the name of the file being searched (or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>dir c:\<strong>drivername.sys</strong> /a /s</em></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it shows a system file see if you can get a program from analyze -v.<br />
<br />
Type in theWinDbg command prompt</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><em>!analyze -v</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-v stands for Verbose and if&nbsp;the crash was originated by a program, as opposed to hardware or a driver,&nbsp;it will appear in the middle of the listing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>eg</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>PROCESS_NAME:&nbsp; java.exe</font></div>
<div><font>IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; ntkrnlmp.exe</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>PROCESS_NAME only appears in the analyze -v output and only if a program originated the call that faulted.<br />
<div>
<hr />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Upload Them for Analysis</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Or upload the minidump files to your Public folder on Skydrive and copy the link from the address bar and I'll analyse them.</div>

    <title>recording using line in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin mee  say:</h3>
<h2>            recording using line in</h2>
                    <p>I used to record a live mix using my cdjs + external mixer. Normally id just connect&nbsp;the red and white&nbsp;RCA lead from record on my mixer which goes to a 3.5 ml stereo jack which id place into the line in. I would never have a problem. How ever ive just&nbsp;recently
 got a Toshiba satallite&nbsp; what used to run on windows 7 originally but has recently been up dated to windows 10.
</p>
<p>I was looking at some of the FAQs saying that they also used to used the line in but no longer could&nbsp;and although they were similar questions they weren't quite the same. I would be really grateful if you could help me. Is there something I can do ?</p>

<h2>            The new Skype UI is a disaster</h2>
                    <p>Never seen a so horrible UI. When you see what Discord does, you should take this in consideration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Moreover, the sending message animation makes everything look slow (and I have this sensation on all devices)</p>
<p>- Unable to desactivate notification's sounds without desactivating all notification (visuals)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't belive we'll have to use this design for years from now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone knows how to download 5.5.0.1 deb? Can't find any link online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>AMD - Windows 10 Xbox Games how to enable Crossfire for Radeon Dual - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            AMD - Windows 10 Xbox Games how to enable Crossfire for Radeon Dual Gpus in Radeon Crimson Softwear&#33;</h2>
                    <p /><p>Guys,</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can one of you Contact AMD for support with Windows 10/Xbox Store/Xbox App/Xbox Games, etc. Work something out with AMD&nbsp;to enable Radeon Crimson Software to make a profile for all the Xbox Store Games on Windows 10. Currently we cannot make a Gaming Profile using The Radeon Crimson Gpu Software. All your games are Encrypted and all the Program App folders are hidden.&nbsp;there are going to be a lot of people upset if we can't use your Games and make a Radeon Crimson Game Profile. The reason we need to make A&nbsp;profile using Crimson software is because we need to enable Cross-fire, since a lot of us&nbsp;have Dual Gpus/Dual Gpu Cards. Like the Radeon 7990HD. So please contact AMD and sort this out because we need to get the most out of our Gpu&nbsp;Cards, I don't want to buy another GPU. So please contact AMD! Work something out. :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks, I am really looking forward to playing some Great Games on Windows 10!</p>

However, there are some games that also requires or allows you to create an in-game profile.

            <p>You cannot make a Gaming profile using Radeon Crimson Software&nbsp;any of the Windows 10 Xbox games, that is why you should Contact AMD and work something out. All your Games are encrypted,&nbsp;Folders are hidden and links do nothing. There is no way to make a Gaming profile in Crimson. There is no answer in that link. Here is my conversation on the AMD forum board and they said to "Contact" You guys at&nbsp;Microsoft!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://community.amd.com/message/2828919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.amd.com/message/2828919</a><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>I really hope you guys can work together and sort this out, shouldn't be a big deal. There are a lot of us who have Dual Gpu/ Dual Gpu Cards and we would love to play Windows 10 Xbox Games.

<h2>            Unexpected Reboot</h2>
                    
<p>Sometimes when I turn on my computer, my screen will go blank for a second, then show a blue box that say something like "there has been an unexpected system shutdown." The computer then reboots itself, i log in, and a Microsoft statement comes up saying
 that Wimdows has had an unexpected shutdown, and it searches for a solution, that it never finds. The computer runs fine after the reboot, I am just tired of recieving the blue box message.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred
<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Media player app not seeing files on USB flash</h2>
                    
<p>i formatted a USB flash drive but the xbox &nbsp;one is not seeing the files on it. tried both fat32 and ntfs. when it does work, usually after a full format of the drive, the console is unable to read it after a reboot. Note this is a USB 3.0 drive.</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>hello Mister Mascot, &nbsp;thanks for the reply. As of now &nbsp;i have tried MKV, AVI and MP$. the odd this is that it doesn't even show mp3's or folders in the drive. if i format and load the files back it works, but the second i reboot, nothing..</p>

<p>If you have another USB drive laying around, try placing one of the files on it and see if you get the same issue. If the issue is no longer present, it may be the drive itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Is the USB drive generic or an off-brand?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest to download the attachment before you open it in your computer and make sure to scan the file for any viruses that it may contain before opening it.
</p>
<p>You may also suggest to your friend to put the said file in a container such as winzip before sending the file as an attachment and see if the issue will persist.
</p>
<p>We would like to confirm if you can allow the file to be downloaded and opened even if there is an error message that the file is prohibited.</p>
<p>Lastly, are you also unable to download the said attachment when you access your email account through the web browser?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern about deleting the applications from My Libraries in Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Unfortunately its not possible to delete the applications from Windows Store. So in future if you want install any of these apps again in your computer you don’t to have search for that in the whole App Store. You can just select “My Apps” and from
 there you can install that once again very easily.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows DVD player</h2>
                    I downloaded this yesterday but cant play any DVDs. Either nothing happens at all, or I get a "playback error" message Ox8004027d. I'm not very tech savvy but have tried following suggestions in forums about applying the troubleshooter (got a message saying
 windows store cache may be damaged) so read another page on how to clear the cache &amp; tried again with the DVD - still no joy. I'm very unhappy that I've paid good money for this app but cant use it. Grrr !!

            <p>If the files are not returning to its original format, those file are now data loss. The solution that I gave you is to clean your pen drive. And make sure that this virus won't destroy anymore files every time you save, copy, or move files.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> It could be that any third party software is causing the conflict,<b>

            First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - Press Windows key + X &gt; Click Control Panel &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; Hardware and Sound
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows . Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level

<p>I am struggling to understand while the suggested steps are needed, the sound is working correctly in every application apart from Sudoku.</p>
<p>Why do I need to do what's been suggested, surely the problems with the Sudoku executable.</p>

            Do me a favor.
<br />Launch Sudoku
<br />Start playing the game
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in the Taskbar
<br />Click Volume Mixer
<br />Check if the volume level for Sodoku is high or low.
