            Hi Cláudia
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues! My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor Specialist on Microsoft. We are experienced users who assist the Support Staff by helping out fellow users in the community. 
<br />
<br />I am sorry to bring bad news here, messages that were sent and receive using the New Skype version 8.xx is saved on the cloud hence it cannot be exported. 
<br />The only alternative for now is to copy and paste the conversation.
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/export-chat-history-skype-8x/ee2224f7-105c****-b217-3e168f7d69dc?page=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum...</a>
<br />
<br />Several user have raised the request with the Microsoft team which are working to make it available in a coming version
<br /><a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-welcome-to-skype-ideas/suggestions/35074018-retain-all-chat-history-locally-regardless-of-the" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-welco...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this clarifies.
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community Forum. Allow me to assist you with your concern with the language setting sof your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have simulated this issue on my end based on the simulation done. You have the option to chnage the langauge of the pages inside the Outlook.com interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set my language to spanish on account.live.com but it did not reflect on the mail.live.com interface. This is because the mailbox of Outlook.com has it's own language &nbsp;settings on the Options tab that will show when you click the gear icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Customizing Outlook.com click Language and select the language that you wan to use on your mailbox interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you will still need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 1520 Overheating &#38; Battery Drain</h2>
                    I'm having a similar problem to a number of users, in that my Lumia 1520 has started to heat up and the battery drains very quickly. This seems to be intermittent behaviour, and all started a couple of weeks back after a Windows 10 Mobile technical preview
 update.(I had already been running the preview, but a particular update started the problem)......It's weird. Yesterday the phone lasted all day and all night, it was on 65% when I plugged it in this morning, but after it charged, it just drained away to nothing
 in about 4 hours..... I appreciate that there are warnings about the unreliability of beta software, but this seems to be quite common regardless of the OS version.....anyone got any other thoughts?

I have noticed the same issue for my 1520 after the update to Windows 10. Have you got any solution to that??

            Well, it seems to be ok now, and has been for a week or two. I somehow got the idea that what was draining the battery was that it kept trying to sync to One Drive, failed , and then continually kept retrying...Photos weren't getting uploaded, so I tried
 switching off sync..and the problem stopped. I left it for about a week, and then switched sync on again...It's fine now, syncing normally, not overheating...battery lasts all day and all night.... It might work for you...

    <title>Can&#39;t verify domain in Office 365 Admin Portal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t verify domain in Office 365 Admin Portal</h2>
                    <p>I've looked through the community and at MS online help but am still having an issue.<br />
It is similar to the one shown at:<br />
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_o365admin-mso_domains/cant-verify-domain/7b66c208-91db-4fce-a4ed-2ed5a57d78bd</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Friday 10-Mar-2017 we acquired another company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took over their DNS registration and pointed DNS to our local DNS servers here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also setup a web page and a zone pointing the @ and www records at our main web servers.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is all working
 swimmingly.<br />
<br />
However, when we went to the Office 365 admin portal to add this domain for email we got messages implying (but no explicitly) stating it was already registered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no existing TXT record in the original DNS setup for that and the MX records did not
 point to any Microsoft/Office 365 server.&nbsp;&nbsp; The help article at https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2812881/error-message-when-you-try-to-verify-a-domain-in-office-365 says one can contact MS Support to find out who owns it but when we did that on Friday
 and even asked for next level they said they could not tell us who owned the registration.<br />
<br />
We have been in contact with the previous owner, the company they used for adding/deleting/changing email accounts and the email hosting provider that company uses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of them know of any registration for this domain for Microsoft/Office 365.&nbsp;&nbsp; They also
 say they aren't using other Office 365 services in the cloud so I don't believe they were a tenant for any other purpose.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Today oddly enough we were actually able to get to the step in the Admin Portal where it asked us to add a TXT record to DNS to verify ownership (which we couldn't on Friday).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On doing that today and clicking verify it thought about it then gave another
 TXT record to add saying it couldn't verify.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is despite the fact I am able to see the new TXT record via other internet lookups such as those at DNS Stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; On adding the second TXT record to replace the first again said it couldn't verify and gave
 yet another TXT record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some time later we tried again and it gave another TXT record which we did not add and on doing verify it showed the 2nd one I'd added above which suggests it is at least now asking our DNS server for the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have the TTL set to 300 (5 minutes)
 so we added the new record it was prompting for (a 3rd&nbsp; change) waited more than 5 minutes and tried to verify at which point it gave the same errors as this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; We changed the TXT record again then did "Save and Close" rather than verify to give it
 time to propagate beyond 5 minutes.<br />
</p>
<p>On rechecking the domain in the portal more than an hour later (we had closed and refreshed in between as per prompt) it displayed the same TXT record that we had gotten on the save and close that had been added to DNS.&nbsp;&nbsp; On doing verify with that it again
 went to the same prompt as we saw this morning wherein it gives yet another TXT record to add.<br />
<br />
This is a maddening loop.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
MS needs to have a way that users can prove ownership outside the TXT record method if they are not going to accept it because they say it was already registered.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a domain was previously registered by someone who is currently unknown or by people who don't
 know anything about the registration MS should have a way that users can prove "ownership" to take it over. &nbsp; &nbsp; The only other option is to NOT use MS for email at which point we can point it at any MX record we want.
<br />
<br />
Questions:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
1) How do we get MS to recognize the TXT record - it seems clear they are interrogating our DNS server since we did see them report the 2nd record when they prompted for the 3rd.</p>
<p>2) How do we get MS to let us prove "ownership" other than DNS if they're saying it is already registered and we can't find out who registered it?<br />
3) How can we determine if a domain is already registered prior to actual change of DNS?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've known this acquisition was pending for more than a month but of course couldn't make any changes to it prior to the actual closing date (Friday) of the acquisition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 It would have been helpful to know MS thought it was already registered by someone so we could have spent that month tracking it down.</p>

            <p>Hi Jcldss,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me answer your questions one by one:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the first one, I suggest you check this article to do some basic troubleshooting steps:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2515404/troubleshoot-domain-verification-issues-in-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot domain verification issues in Office 365.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the second one, in Office 365, changing the DNS records is the only way to prove you own your domain. Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the third question, the simple way is try to add the domain in your Office 365 tenant and if it is registered by other users, you will get the following error messages:<br />
<em>&lt;Domain_Name&gt; has already been verified for your account, or for another Microsoft Online Services account.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Can't verify the domain</em><br />
<em>&lt;Domain Name&gt; was already added to a different Office 365 account XXXX.onmicrosoft.com.</em><br />
<em>Sign in to that account as an admin, and remove domain &lt;Domain Name&gt;. Then come back here and try adding &lt;Domain Name&gt; to this account again</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, you can share the domain with us and we can check it for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, if you still can't verify your domain after following the article I provided above, I’d like to collect some related information about the domain to check the details. To protect your privacy, I’ve sent you a private message for it. You can access

            <p>Fraser Xu - Ultimately the issue turned out to be due to the fact that someone at the acquired company had at some point in the past signed up for a Power BI demo.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any MS cloud offering like Power BI, SharePoint in the cloud or Office365 mail "registers"
 the domain at MS so it can't be used for any other service except under the original "tenant".&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
There was nothing in what we got that told us who the other tenant was nor anything about which specific service (Power BI in this case) was registered previously.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Original issue on Friday was it wouldn't give us the option for a TXT record - it kept asking us to enter an email at the domain so it could send one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we couldn't receive email at the new domain without registering it this was a catch 22 situation.<br />
On Tuesday it actually quit asking for the email (possibly because of DNS propagation after Friday) but on each TXT we added to DNS it failed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The verification would appear to be processing then it would give us another TXT record to use instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; It did
 that each time.<br />
On contacting MS Support on Tuesday again the technician told us about the Power BI registration and gave us a special TXT record (not the normal one the tool provides) to put in DNS.&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing that he was able to confirm he saw the special TXT and open
 an internal ticket to engineering to&nbsp;clear the previous registration.&nbsp;&nbsp; That process can take up to 7 days though for us they had completed it the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
After they cleared the previous registration we were able to register this domain with our "tenant" that we use for multiple domains.<br />
Our frustration was that on Friday the technician we spoke to would only say "yes it is registered" and would not tell us by whom nor did he offer this alternate step to have engineering clear the original registration.<br />
Also the fact that ANY employee using a domain email address can tie up a registration by signing up for a demo seems a bit harebrained to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine if you worked at IBM and couldn't register ibm.com because some janitor somewhere in your thousands of
 employees had thought it would be neat to try a demo.&nbsp;&nbsp; How would you ever track that down?<br />
The moral of the story for us is to try to determine ahead of time if it is registered but based on this experience it is not clear we could do that.&nbsp;&nbsp; We wouldn't be able to change DNS records until the actual acquisition date because we wouldn't own it until
 then and as was seen here even after acquisition trying to get the information was problematical until we got someone at MS who was willing to work on it instead of blow us off.</p>

Thanks for your answer, however I saw I have already installed Service Pack 3 on my computer, I was reading more about this issue and I saw that this control comes from Access, but I don't have this application installed. Do you know if this is the only way
 to get this control or does exist a Microsoft page to download specific controls and libraries?<br />

Thanks for check this issue, I reviewed the link that you passed me, but it is not an official page from Microsoft, and in my work they are very strict with this and I will require to download it from an official page :(<br />

Maybe these kind of controls are not able to download&nbsp; in a separate way from Microsoft.<br />

<br />
If you relied on only official pages from Microsoft you would get no work done. Microsoft does not provide such controls separately from the products they are provided with.
<br />
<br />
It could be that the OCX is present but not registered, so search the hard drive for it and make sure that it is both in the correct folder for the operating system and then register it.
<br />
<br />
If you need instructions how to do that then they will be in a PDF file at <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/57986755/Installation%20instructions%20for%20mscal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>mscal.ocx is not downloadable in Microsoft Download center, it was included in the Office 2003 Service Pack, as you have SP3 installed, I guess may be someone or some software delete the file by mistake, please repair Office and also reinstall SP3 to try
 to reload the mscal.ocx file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If above does not work, please try to manually copy the file from another PC with Office 2003 and check the result.</p>

<h2>            text wrap splits words incorrectly</h2>
                    Excel splits some words incorrectly when wrap text is turned on.&nbsp; There is plenty of room for the words but it does things such as split "it" into "i" on one line and "t" on the next.<br />
<br />
Most of the words appear to be wrapping correctly.&nbsp; The problem occurs in only some cases.<br />

<h2>            Disable &#42;Nag&#42; redirect screen when opening Outlook mail</h2>
                    <p>Recently Outlook has started to prevent me from going directly to my mailbox *inbox* and is now redirecting my browser to their *sign in* page for Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started two days ago, up til then I never had any issue with the cookie that was saved &amp; my bookmark taking me straight to the inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm using Firefox, but that hasn't been an issue unless Microsoft is deliberately keeping Firefox from doing what it used to do and now is forcing me to be redirected to the Outlook sign in page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not appreciated, </p>

<p>Hi there:</p>
<p>
</p><p>that thread is a near 4 year old thread,</p>
<p>
</p><p>what was going on there does not apply to me at all. Outlook did not exist back then, Live mail was the Microsoft mailbox for non office users. I am continually *redirected* to the login web page instead of going directly to my inbox.</p>

            Again it is not the answer. Nokia did release that months ago to charge the phone from thhat tiny port to the USB connector/jack of the PC.<br />
But the question how to possible to charge off the mini/mcroUSB port to the USB jack.

<h2>            Outlook will not open full screen. Cannot find a solution&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has lately been an ongoing issue within our office. It seems to come and go without any cause and the users experiencing the issues seem completely random as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is somewhat hard to explain but this is the best I can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have outlook open it and you select an&nbsp;option to open a new window and you maximize the window, it does not fully maximize. Instead, there are a few inches at the top and no matter what you do, you cannot make the window fill the full screen. Sometimes,
 if you continuously open the windows it will keep going lower and lower about a half an inch at a time until it hits the bottom the monitor, and then it goes right back up to the top and starts all over again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e6c0ae4-849a-44d8-a487-21db2afd3ef0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e6c0ae4-849a-44d8-a487-21db2afd3ef0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>We are using Windows 7 Pro - Outlook version 1811 (build 11029.20108)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have tried everything from uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, swapping monitors, swapping desktops, disabling and enabling hardware graphics acceleration, reseating RAM, replacing RAM, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We were having issues before-hand with this users&nbsp;PC so most of this work was done to solve other issues. (HDD crapped and roaming profile issues)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            What happens to my files when a Team or Channel is deleted&#63;</h2>
                    I can find information on how to delete Teams and Channels, and understand that all conversation history will be lost when one of these is deleted.&nbsp; But what happens to any files shared within these Teams or Channels?&nbsp; Are they deleted as well, or can
 I find them on Sharepoint somewhere after the Team/Channel has been deleted?

<p>Hi Amy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you delete the Teams and Channels, you are right that the conversation history will be lost. For the files you uploaded or shared in Teams or Channels, when you delete the channels, you can find the files in SharePoint site (Documents). Your channels
 and shared files in channel are still be retained in SharePoint site. But when you delete the teams, you cannot access to the SharePoint and of course you cannot recover it from SharePoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once Teams was deleted, all the contents will be deleted and it’s not feasible to recover at present. You can submit your valuable vote via
<a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/18643102-provide-ability-to-fully-recover-deleted-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/18643102-provide-ability-to-fully-recover-deleted-teams</a>.
</p>
<p>Thus please note that if you want to delete the Teams, remember to retain the important contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

            I heard that the capacity of processor for this model 3110c is 233ghz.they are telling that its capable of loading web pages 15times the speed of a s60 or n series phone. Its mainly tested in this phone for future upgrades. But the fact of the matter is
 the phone sometimes restarts while browsing irrespective of mem card. Any suggestions

            Hey All,<br />
I too had this issue with Nokia 3110. One resolution for that issue I found is like,<br />
1. PLEASE KEEP ALL UR SONGS UNDER "Music" folder in the SD Card.<br />
2. DELETE ALL SUBFOLDERS OF "Music" Folder.<br />
<br />
The device wont get that much task for updating the Music Library next time.

            Those who still have this restarting problem on Nokia 3110c ... Im telling the solution again, step by step.<br />
It ll work . you dont need to go 4 the firmware v5.05<br />
<br />
<br />
If ur phone restarted 3 or 4 times and switched off automatically. Try this<br />
method<br />
1] Remove the battery and Micro SD card<br />
2] wait about 5 minutes<br />
3] Then switch On the phone WITHOUT the memory card<br />
<br />
Now ur phone working well without restarting<br />
<br />
4] Then you must restore Factory settings frm the Settings Menu<br />
[default security code:12345]<br />
{i know most of people have done this thing,but remember u have 2 go<br />
with the correct order.Unless it will not work.OK}<br />
<br />
5] Now apply a theme. The theme's size should be below 100kb<br />
<br />
6] Now ur phone working fine without the Micro SD<br />
<br />
7] Then wait about 5 minutes and Switch off ur phone<br />
<br />
8] Remove the battery and insert the Micro SD<br />
{Don t Format the memory card}<br />
<br />
9] Switch On ur Nokia 3110c phone.<br />
10] Now Keep ur free Phone memory space [Not the memory card's free space]<br />
between 470kb - 499kb.<br />
<br />
Now surely ur 3110c working fine about 5<br />
months.During these time u can<br />
1] Send/receive any file via bluetooth.<br />
2] Enjoy Music,video, GPRS,Yahoo Go .....etc<br />
3] Also u can Update music library anytime.<br />
but remember below DONTs<br />
1] Don t try to change themes.{u have to stick with a theme}<br />
2] Charge ur phone in ON mode<br />
3] Dont fully discharge the battery<br />
4] Start charging ur phone when there is only a bar on Battery indicator<br />
5] Dont erase calender notes<br />
<br />
Make sure about above 5 Donts<br />
<br />
Dont worry if ur phone restarted once.{U know the problem is restarting several times<br />
and automatically swiched off.}<br />
<br />
After 4 or 5 month there is a possibility to occur the problem again.<br />
if so Follow the above steps again.<br />
Good luck<br />
<br />
If there is an uncleared point,send me an email. I have tested these steps<br />
on my 3110c and friends' 3110c s made by nokia having the fimware v 5.01<br />

<p>hi mario,</p>
<p>this issue may be related to the <strong>custom script</strong> feature. if you enable custom script in your sharepoint admin center, it will release the
<strong>add and customize pages</strong> permission to the site collection admin. (it takes about 24 hours for the change to take effect.)<br />
<br />
to enable custom script, please follow the steps below:<br />
1. go to your <strong>sharepoint admin center</strong>-&gt;<strong>settings</strong>.<br />
2. scroll down to locate the section of <strong>custom script</strong>-&gt;select <strong>
allow users to run custom script on self-service created sites</strong> and <strong>
allow users to run custom script on personal sites</strong> -&gt;click ok.<br />
3. wait 24 hours for the change to take effect.<br />
for more information, please refer to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-scripting-capabilities-on-or-off-1f2c515f-5d7e-448a-9fd7-835da935584f?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
turn scripting capabilities on and off</a>.</p>
<p>if the issue persists, could you please go to this subsite and navigate to <strong>
site settings</strong> &gt; <strong>site permissions</strong> &gt; <strong>check permissions</strong>, type in your account &gt;
<strong>check now</strong>, and capture a <strong>screenshot</strong> of the result?<br />
(to upload screenshots, you can click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> under the reply box in the forum and then click the icon of

<h2>            Microsoft Self &#8211; Improvement&#58; First Step.</h2>
                    <p>Every time Internet Explorer security settings are set to reasonable (slightly elevated) levels of security the many websites, starting with&nbsp;all&nbsp;Microsoft websites, stop working.&nbsp;Under such IE settings, all&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;websites work in completely bizarre way.
 For example, I would be able to logging to my Microsoft Office 365 online account and to Hotmail, One Drive, but wont be able to open Azure, or some other Microsoft websites which are normally opened with the same Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though, all the important Microsoft Websites, are added to the trusted folder, they are not functioning properly, with slightly elevated IE security settings. It leads to a situation when such demanding Microsoft websites force users to lower the security
 setting. The lower security settings, subsequently used when Internet users browse &nbsp;other none Microsoft websites, which by itself is an absurd situation, and leads to decreased state of security for the whole system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, when cookies are set first party: prompt; third party: block, the prompts to add coming from Microsoft websites are numerous and include, in fact, thirds parties websites. Those prompts designed incorrectly: misdisigned. It does not really allows
 users much of a choice to add the prompts to restricted folder, for example, internet folder. There is only one option to add to trusted folder, or to close the prompt.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Such tendency of Microsoft to design their software (staff) in a particular way, reveals that they design the staff for their convenience, and to satisfy their informational needs used data about all of us, instead designing the staff for our convenience,
 and to satisfy our needs for the staff to be manageable and secure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Such tendencies of Microsoft should be recognized as a problem. Then this Microsoft Problem should be described (formulated). And finally, Microsoft should start to be recognized as a growing problem, unless they adapt more satisfactory ideology how to design
 their staff. Considering large number of people using Microsoft around the world, even though a private company, it&nbsp;provides a public service, and as such must be regulated. Much better regulated, unless the regulators want it that way for us to stay less
 secure, more exposed, more open-minded sort of. Such harmful activities of Microsoft as forcing users to decrease EI security settings, Microsoft software often reverts settings by itself, and finally Microsoft design software to be less manageable, unmanageable,
 or poorly manageable, or requiring specialized (exotic) knowledge to manage it all contributes to decreased users security around the globe.

            I too have found the security prompts to be very annoying when trying to browse the web using Internet Explorer. For quite some time now, when after upgrading to a new Windows 10 build, I've always needed to go back in and readjust at least two security<br />
settings plus check on a couple of other settings to get the IE browser to perform decently. I applaud Microsoft for getting better at keeping custom personalizations mostly intact across builds, but Internet Explorer still sorely gets missed on this.

            hi mate, your device cannot play YouTube videos as far as i know, you can double-check this by checking that you have the latest firmware update for your phone thru checking in Nokia Suite on PC. a lot of the older Series40 phones never supported online
 video streaming, including services such as YouTube.

<p>Bump.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appear to have the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia E75: with 202.12.01 s/w.</p>
<p>PC: Vista UItimate x64</p>
<p>Nokia s/w: PC Suite 7.1.40.1</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Nokia s/w: OVI Suite 2.1.1.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Nokia software products show similar symptoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Messages just do not appear on the PC, despite being visible and readable on the handset.</p>
<p>Oddly older and newer messages arrive - the "selection" by PC Suite seems quite random (ie. different contacts).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried using Bluetooth and cable connections; both result in same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone experienced this issue and more importantly has it been resolved or recognised by Nokia as an issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I can't find any way to change this. &nbsp;I read somewhere that it uses the Windows 10 setting for date formatting...but not for me. Grateful for any suggestions</p>

            <p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen this article but it refers to Windows 7, Vista and XP, not Windows 10. &nbsp;It points me towards Control Panel and I have already tried this. &nbsp;Though Control Panel shows the format I want (dd MM YYYY) it doesn't make any difference to Outlook Calendar
 which &nbsp;remains in the form &nbsp;MM dd YYYY. &nbsp;I have also changed &nbsp;the Settings facility for Windows 10 (the OS I am actually using) to show the date format I want. &nbsp;It too has no effect on Outlook Calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have run out of options.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Critical Service Failed&#34; after &#34;Reset to factory&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there. I have a Lumia 520. I wanted to give it to some one , therefor I copied all my data and then hit reset to factory (+ erasing sd card). the phone turned off, and when it came up and I was expecting to get a reseted phone , instead I got a blue screen
 with:<br />
<br />
(0% complete) or this if you'd like to know more, you can search online later<br />
Error : CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED<br />
<br />
by the way, nothing was wrong with my phone, and I had it for about 2 years. and please don't recommend going to a Microsoft center or anything, because Microsoft doesn't have any center in my country.<br />
<br />
so what should I do to solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance..</p>

            <p>Your phone reset with what was stored on the phone. </p>
<p>Use the <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Windows Device Recovery Tool. Install on the PC., This will give a downloaded install of software to the phone.

<h2>            Nokia 2310-not displaying caller name</h2>
                    I've just bought a Nokia 2310 as they're very cheap as a standby phone but have a problem. I've copied the numbers from my simcard to the phone but if someone calls the phone, when it rings it only displays the number and not the name. This is obviously
 pointless as I would never know who's calling and makes missed calls a nightmare.<br />
<br />
What have I done wrong?

            it's because you have a double entry of names &amp; nos. in your phonebook and sim card, you can do one thing go to contacts&gt;settings&gt; memory in use&gt; select phone. Now check if it worked...

            The number in your phonebook has to match the one which is calling EXACTLY. So not 0489/235647 for instance, but you need to enter this number as +33489/235647 in your phonebook (the sign is important too). +33 is the country number of course.<br />
<br />
If you're still not sure, save the number from messages you have recieved and enter that in your phonebook. Doing this will ensure that the messenger's or caller's name is displayed.<br />
<br />
This is something I feel the manual should have adressed. You have no idea how much this **bleep** me off, until I found it a day later.<br />
<br />
k thx

            I think the problem is that either ur sim doesn't support caller ID (which is highly unlikely) or else you may have to call ur network customer care and check it out with them! :)
