            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />

            Hi Emanuel, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.

                    <p>Original title: "no such interface supported"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help. I am wanting someone to post all the Reg entries for Actxprxy.dll. it is a long story and it is hard for me to type all of it because I am disabled. Here is the short of it. I went to facebook and it had been a while since I was on. The first
 thing I noticed was a friend request for someone who I was already friends. I figured he made a new page and accepted it. It was not him but a scam. I unfriended. him. I inspected elements on the real and fake friend and they were totally different. The fake
 page was all about sound. I went on later that night to see if his brother had deleted him as friend and a bell kept coming up and making a ring. I then lost sound on &nbsp;my laptop. After not fixing it I went to dell and downloaded a driver and installed it.
 It did not help. I am not able to do SFC and CHKDSK takes 2 minutes to run where it used to take hours. I downloaded tweaking windows and SAS and ran them. First I ran Tweaking and it restored my sound with the built-in SFC. I am not sure if the problem started
 with that or not, I also did a restore using Tweaking. I then did not notice "microsoft" when opening things. Then I used the SAS and deleted a few bluetooth items. I remember the name was actxprxy. I have searched the registry and I am missing the files in
 the 32 folder. they still exist in the wow64. However they may not be complete. I have tried to add them but I dont understand the 32/64 thing. I am familiar with the registry and can add if I have the correct information. I tried to register my dll's but
 a popup said "ole32 or oledb32 is missing. I cant reinstall because my disk says "incorrect for your system" I bought this from dell 1 year ago. Paid 80$ extra to get windows 7 and it is full of windows 8 &amp; 10 along with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>could someone upload all the files from a W7 64bit home professional so I can try to repair my laptop. It works great other than cant open anything.</p>
<p>Also depending on what I try to open sometimes it is just a plain&nbsp;"no such interface supported" and sometimes two windows both have the&nbsp;"no such interface supported" but one has a string of numbers&nbsp;26ee0668-a00a-44d7-9371-beb064c98683</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for providing a detailed information on your issue. I appreciate the step-by-step troubleshooting and the pains you took to resolve your issue. However, there are a few more steps that we can try to diagnose the root cause&nbsp; in order to fix
 the issue permanently.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When oledb32.dll is for some reason unregistered SQL Server is missing providers after installation.<br />
During installation of SQL server there is no message in the user interface or in the installation log that dll is not registered.When the oledb32.dll provider is not registered it's not possible to connect to SQL Server with eg. visual studio, excel etc. It's
 also not possible to make a linked server connection via server objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><span>As per the issue description you are facing lots of issue with your Windows 7 computer. The issue could be if there is some system file corruption. So I would suggest you to perform Automatic repair before reinstalling the OS. For performing the task
 I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you use the Recovery Environment (Windows RE) to troubleshoot startup issues, first try the
<strong><span>Startup Repair</span></strong> option in the <strong><span>System Recovery Options</span></strong> dialog box. If this does not resolve the issue, or if you have to manually troubleshoot additional issues, use the Bootrec.exe tool.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Since you are unable to boot the computer, you may have to create a bootable Windows&nbsp;installation media and then perform an Automatic Repair and if it doesn't help then you may try to restore your computer to the previous date.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
</span><em><span>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></em></p>

</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to rebuild <strong><span>BCD</span></strong> using the <strong><span>Bootrec.exe tool</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>To run the Bootrec.exe tool, you must start Windows RE. To do this, follow these steps:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Put the <strong><span>Windows 7 installation disc</span></strong> in the disc drive, and then start the computer.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press a key when you are prompted. Select a <strong>

            Thanks for your response. I need you to know the computer boots fast. No problems other than I can't open files and folders. I deleted a couple reg items. I would first like to try putting back the entries I deleted. Can you post them? I can open cmd,
 and all system tools. Just no folders. Is is possible to see whats missing by looking at the regdll.bat? I will try the above, thanks again.

<br />
&nbsp; If it an integrated web cam( installed in the laptop) or usb attached, you need two items,,the driver and the application program- the application program has snapshot, video,ect, look at your manufacturers web site to find these, download and install them&nbsp;,
 then click on the camera software.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheers

<h3> anadia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t turn off computer, Stay in &#34;Logging off...&#34; mode forever.</h2>
                    It started a week ago, I always turn off my laptop (A Dell Inspiron 1720) off every night, and it always take a few seconds. But that time it didn't stop. I thought it was an update, although I selected to do the updates manually, and the next morning
 my computer was still on, still in "Logging off..." mode.<br />
<br />
The only way I can turn it off, is if I press the power button, and the next time I restart it, I get a message telling me that Windows didn't turn off like it should, give me a safe mode option, and start Windows which I always select.<br />
<br />
Also noticed that some icons next to the clock are broken. Like the Wifi icon will say that I'm not connected on the internet when I am. And if I do CTRL ALT DELETE to get the Task Manager, it doesn't work. I get the icon next to the clock but not the actual
 window to see what is going on and close programs that way when they freeze.

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the
<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the
<strong><span>Scan</span></strong> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<strong><span>
</span></strong>removal process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Professional 64 is Locking Me Out of my Folders&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Windows 7 is slowly placing locks on my folders. It started with 'My Documents.' I am unable to access or create files in 'My Documents' or any of its subfolders. Next it locked the folder bearing my name in the 'Users' folder. Hidden folders appear to be
 locked as well. I have 'Administrator' access but the locks are not very concerned about this.</p>
<p>Why are my folders being locked? (Windows Explorer displays a lock to the left of each folder.) How do I unlock these folders? I have already established that I own these folders and supposedly have Full Control of these folders.</p>

    <title>re-initialize offline files cache - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alanfreeman  say:</h3>
<h2>            re-initialize offline files cache</h2>
                    The offline files cache on my Windows 8 machine is corrupt and I want to delete and rebuild it.<br />
There is a fix for Windows 7 and earlier, using the registry, and this does not seem to work.<br />
Any suggestions as to how I can force a re-initialize of this cache?<br />

            Hi thanks for the Technet link, where I found the following (mildly abusive) correspondence on Technet, which suggests that the method proposed in your cited article (<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/230738/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0563c1">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/230738/en-us</font></a></span>)
 is certified as still valid in Windows 8.<br />
<br />
http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/deed0c7c-c481-4ccb-81a8-b334f753a96a/windows-8-offline-cache?forum=w8itprogeneral
<br />
<br />
where it is suggested to run the following script:<br />
<br />
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Csc\Parameters /v FormatDatabase /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f<br />
<br />
Thus the Technet guys seem to be saying that the same fix works on Windows 8 as on Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I did try this fix at one point, though I used Regedit to apply the fix as suggested in the article above. The cache didn't get re-initialized. However I didn't follow up on this, because the problem 'fixed itself' after the measures I took on Big Laptop, described
 above. Maybe I could have deleted the cache with more persistence.<br />
<br />
I suspect that the greying-out of the 'always available offline' options is somehow a reaction that Little Laptop had, to the policies or permissions it found on Big Laptop. So fritzing around with Big Laptop, where the share resides, eventually fixed the problem.<br />
<br />
This problem is solved for me for now, so I'm leaving it here, however posting this response in case anyone else gets the same problem.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Dell Inspiron 3542 tuned in windows 10 Home</h2>
                    <p>Finally after so many months of daily efforts I have managed to tune this laptop and today has been working as it should have since day one. Now, I am not certain how long it will last but it seems solid .</p>
<p>It has been clean installed the Windows 10 Home UK 64-bit version from the media creation tool and from the Dell Drivers and Downloads page only specific drivers have been installed and re-installed as two of them are not in good standing , one is failing
 to install the other causes interface problems and battery crazy consumption and it blocks sleep .</p>
<p>The Device Manager is the way to manually update the drivers and check them one by one if they need new version.</p>
<p>So far this is a detail from this operation </p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e12e1d3-9acb-47cf-993a-3dc76d4004bc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite all the months passed in bad function and daily problematic conditions I have used whatever was left from my good will to contact the Dell Greece Support and get more info by those tech guys . Of course after talking to 4 different of them I gathered
 different info on the same subject and I had to continue personally trying solutions and experimenting until I got this perfect formula to keep the laptop in good conditions even in hostile and heavy duty incomings .
</p>
<p>Yes I truly believe I have mastered this tuning technique over the Dell and Microsoft combination .</p>
<p>By the way from the Dell Greece Support they have offered to get my laptop in their laboratory and fix it but they refused to give me another to use while they would have to keep mine so I had to say no to that, which was no offer because they would have
 probably messed it up worse, at least now&nbsp; I know what I have done to it and how it is everything placed in .</p>

            Hi there!<br /><br />Skype Credit is a convenient and easy way to pay for Skype features that are not free. You can use it to make calls to mobiles and landlines, and send SMS text messages, all at Skype’s low rates.<br /><br />When your Skype Credit runs out, you can simply purchase some more if you need to. You’re not committed to anything.<br /><br />You can also use your Skype Credit to purchase Skype products, such as subscriptions and Skype Numbers.*  Simply start the purchasing process of a subscription or Skype Number and follow the instructions. When you need to choose a payment method, select the Skype Credit icon The Skype Credit icon.. Complete the purchase and the total will be taken from your Skype Credit balance.<br /><br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA571/what-can-i-use-skype-credit-for" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA571/what-can...</a>

<h2>            Disable CTFMON.EXE WIN10</h2>
                    I want to know how to disable CTFMON.EXE on Windows 10 as I have no need for it. How do I do this on Windows 10? I am not experiencing any kind of performance problems either-- I just have absolutely no need for it and want as little stuff I need running
 as possible for max performance, and it's just how I am.

<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What Does the Ctfmon.exe File Do? </strong><br />
Ctfmon.exe monitors the active windows and provides text input service support for speech recognition, handwriting recognition, keyboard, translation, and other alternative user input technologies.

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I Remove the Ctfmon.exe File? </strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>this computer basically feels like it gained 116 lbs and developed asthma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>before today i'd never seen the program open on windows before and I check task manager frequently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW didt his program, with a very unique icon in task manager sneak by without me knowing (because if I need it for my Bluetooth keyboard to function, it must have been enabled some how...... amiright?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>anyway my computer is so effin slow right now the keys are delayed. it's obnoxious,. I went searching for things to close in task mgr so I could do some work on photoshop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been in the same situation as&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e20b11e1-1738-48ca-8336-2436a6395502" title="digitalbath">digitalbath</a>&nbsp;the
 past few days - on my laptop and desktop. They are both&nbsp;<strong><em>crawling.&nbsp;</em></strong>I don't even want to use with computer. I've been using a super cheap Android tablet lots more than either computer cuz they're so slow.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e20b11e1-1738-48ca-8336-2436a6395502" title="digitalbath">digitalbath</a>&nbsp;I have been
 searching Process Explorer - looking for hogs. Today it took over 5 minutes for my laptop to respond after it hung when I started Proc Exp. I too saw a few things that I wanted to inquire about and one was ctfmon.exe . Once I learned it's purpose (and I use
 that term loosely) I knew I shouldn't need it. It took a good while to find how to stop the process, and longer still to prevent it from starting with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found many sites telling how to remove the ctfmon.exe file, but all for old Win versions. FInally found the service that starts it up and disabled it.&nbsp; I do have Office 2013 and was concerned about it having issues but I started Word and all was fine -
 so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And&nbsp;<em><strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e20b11e1-1738-48ca-8336-2436a6395502" title="digitalbath">digitalbath</a>,
</strong></em>my Bluetooth Mouse and Keyboard are both still working. This is on my laptop. I always use Logitech mice and keyboards. Just curious, what brand of Bluetooth keyboard are u using? If you don't have big bucks invested in your keyboard, and you're
 not closely bonded to it - check out a Logitech. They have zillions of keyboards, from $8 to $100. The one I'm using on the laptop cost me about $20, and today they have come up with a couple of new versions with some added features - at about $35-$40. It
 has about 50 programmable keys/options with the SetPoint software that comes with it, and it's somewhat compact - which I wanted for my laptop. Compact, but it has full keys, 10 key pad, and the function keys at the top are about half the size of most F keys.
 And they are programmable with several options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I heard your KB stopped working, I was worried about my touch pad on the laptop being disabled without ctfmon. Nope, anyway not yet. I've not done a reboot yet so we'll see the true story after I do that. Then I'll be going to my desktop and doing
 the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled just 2 other services that were running, and my laptop started acting like it's supposed to. I was working on Chrome with 2 windows open, about 10 to 12 tabs on each window. I wish I knew what fixed it, but something tells me it was ctfmon. The
 other 2 items I stopped in services were 1. An Add-On service for Fox-it PDF Reader and 2. Dropbox Update Service.&nbsp; I have a program that I run periodically that checks installed programs to see if they are running the current version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are instructions from a site telling me how to change my settings so ctfmon would not try to run. I'm running Windows 10 Pro 64 bit, and I did NOT have any option like the site listed here:<br />
</p>

 Click&nbsp;</span><strong>Apply</strong><span style="color: rgba(48, 48, 48, 1)">&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong></em><span style="color: rgba(48, 48, 48, 1)"><em>.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe they were using Windows 10 Home, dunno why my ctl panel was different. I doubt that the latest Windows upgrades would have made changes to the content of the ctl panel.</p>
 have an answer to this?</span><em><strong>Thx,&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

            Hi Shane.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's one of the store apps that installs with Windows, can be easily uninstalled in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Candy Crush &gt; Uninstall.  Any other apps you don't want that have the Uninstall button can be likewise installed.
<br />
<br />If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I made a mistake. When I saw it on the Start menu, I thought it was installed. However, the Microsoft Store shows it as being "purchased" and it is in the "Ready to install" section of My Library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing Microsoft purchased it for me? and there is not way to prevent this in the future?</p>
<p>

 Billing to see this option. </span></p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question. In the Start menu, you can right-click Candy Crush and uninstall from there.

            About all we can do is file Feedback and post a share link back so others can vote the Feedback up until MS decides to stop including it.  My guess is they want a few things included in Windows 10 that appeal to kids.  I know when I reinstall WIndows I always uninstall it first thing.  But someone with kids may see it differently.

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have been trying, with a friend, to create a keyboard layout for the Shavian and Quickscript Alphabets that will work for Windows 7. He's made one that works on his computer on Windows XP, and he sent me that one, which I installed. Once installed, we
 tested it on various programs on my computer. We found that I could successfully type in the desired alphabet, but my computer did not recognize what I'd typed. Where he saw the characters of the Shavian alphabet on his computer, I saw boxes on mine. This
 problem persists on every program I've tried it with. I have all the same fonts installed that my friend does, but even on Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4, the program simply does not seem to recognize the characters, nor does the control panel or the
 start menu when I use the keyboard layout to try to type in those.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to install the program in Windows compatibility mode for Windows XP and check whether you are able to see the desired alphabets on
 the system. Follow the steps mentioned in the article given below to install the program in compatibility mode.</span></span></p>

<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4 is not compatible with Windows 7 and that is the reason the program is not working properly on the system.</span></span></p>

<strong>blue screen</strong> with a message, &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>Recovery,&nbsp;</strong></em></span>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>It looks like windows did not load correctly, the two choices on the screen
 are,&nbsp;</strong></em></span>&nbsp;<em><span><strong>Restart</strong></span>&nbsp;</em><strong>or&nbsp;</strong><em><span><strong>See advanced repair options</strong></span></em><span>.</span>&nbsp;If we click re-start, the computer will
 re-start and operate fine. If we chose see advanced repair we are given several choices, none of which fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure why we have not received the Windows 10 update, but will use the Media Creation Tool to install if we do not get the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have updated some of the computers using the Media Creation Tool, they still get the start message to&nbsp;<span><em>Restart or See advanced repair options.
</em></span></p>
<p>I have tried troubleshooting, no problems found, I tried all of the suggestion in Replies to my previous posting to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I should mention that during updates going back to August, all indications of Windows 10 updates have failed. All other updates were successfully installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is becoming very frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Robert,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to know some information.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Are you connected to a domain network?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the Methods.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>Mayank,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for attempting to assist me with this continuing problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First let me say we are not connected to a domain network.</p>
<p>I have attempted your suggested fixes but none helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I have 17 computers acting up the same way, i am sure this problem started when we did&nbsp;</p>
<p>updates back in August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I started all 17 computers, none showed the "restart screen". I then shut them all down and when I restarted them they all showed the
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"Recovery, it looks like Windows did not load properly, "</span></em></p>
<p>I am at a loss. I hate to do a<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Restart
</span></em>on all the computers, as it is so time consuming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Half of the computers are now running Windows 10 and the rest are still on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>If you or anyone can come up with another solution, it will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bob</p>

            In answer to your inquire "did you resolve the problem" I am sorry to say that Mayank's suggestions did not solve the problem. I have completed the update to Windows 10 on all 17 computers and am still receiving the Recovery message, and it appears every
 other start-up. . I have done a restart on one of the computers (184 updates) and the problem has gone away. I sure hope someone can come up with a better solution. Help, Help!

<p>Have the same problem&nbsp;on new Dell 8930 just installed?&nbsp;All updates look&nbsp;good but still get this&nbsp;on power recovery, but Windows works fine once hit continue!</p>
<p>The issue for me is the unit is 85 miles away and cant hit continue&nbsp;remotely!&nbsp; I have the nic card set for never going to sleep and the screen to never go off or the unit to not go to sleep.&nbsp; Remotely power off screen and PC as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for what else to adjust so it will do a power recovery back to sign on screen without the not loaded correctly&nbsp;setup, guess new "Safe Mode"</p>

<p><em>Windows.old</em></p>
<p>Inside the Windows.old folder, you will see three folders: Documents and Settings, Program Files and Windows. We are going to look at using Documents and Settings to restore our personal files such as Documents and Emails. One of the changes Microsoft made
 is&nbsp; to remove programs previously bundled with Windows such as email, video editing, instant messaging. You can download the successors to these programs for free at
<a href="http://explore.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com</a>, it’s now called Windows Live Essentials 2011.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Windows-7-Desktop.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fWindows-7-Desktop_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><em>Windows 7 desktop</em></p>
<p>So, you don’t see any of your Documents and Music files you had in your folders in Windows XP, after doing the custom clean install. Before you panic lets first look if the Windows.old folder was created.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Documents-files.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fDocuments-files_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>If it’s there, open the Documents and Settings folder, look in your old account folder, in my case it’s
<strong>adacosta, </strong>there you will see all of your files.</p>
<p><strong>Recovering your personal files</strong></p>
<p>After discovering your personal files, all you need to do is copy and paste them to their respective folders in Windows 7 such as Documents, Music, Picture, Videos, etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Select-All.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fSelect-All_thumb.jpg" /></a>

<p>Click <strong>Organize </strong>on the command bar, click <strong>Select All, </strong>
click <strong>Organize </strong>again, then click <strong>Copy. </strong>(Quick tip, press CRTL + A on your keyboard, then CTRL + C).</p>

<p>That’s it, of course, the My Music folder will be placed here, if you want to have it situated in the
<strong>Music </strong>folder instead, select, press <strong>Alt </strong>on your keyboard, click
<strong>Edit </strong>drop down menu, click <strong>Move to Folder </strong>&gt; select
<strong>Music </strong>&gt; then click <strong>Move. </strong>The same can be done for your
<strong>My Pictures </strong>and <strong>My Videos </strong>folder if you have any files stored there.</p>
<p><strong>Recovering your Email Messages</strong></p>
<p>Now, this is one of the big concerns when moving from Windows XP to Windows 7. Where is my email program, where are my emails? As I noted earlier, there is no built in email program in Windows 7, you have to download one, you are not limited to the free
 Windows Live Mail program, if you prefer an alternative such as Microsoft Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird, you can use those too. Just for this article, we are going to be using Windows Live Mail. Before importing our messages into Windows Live Mail, we first
 need to find where the messages are located, then copy and paste the folder in a location that is discoverable by Windows Live Mail. Click Start, open Computer, click Organize on the Command Bar &gt; Folder and search options &gt; View (tab) &gt; in the Advanced settings:
 list, select ‘<strong>Show hidden files, folders, or drives</strong>‘ under <em>
Hidden files and folders. </em>The click <strong>Apply </strong>and <strong>OK. </strong>
</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Searchfordbx.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fSearchfordbx_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Click Start, open Computer &gt; open the C: drive, open the <strong>Windows.old </strong>
in the search box, type the following extension: <strong>.dbx </strong></p>
<p>You will now see multiple files with the extension <strong>.dbx </strong>select all of these files, click
<strong>Organize</strong>, then click <strong>Copy. </strong>Click Start, open the Documents folder, create a new folder, call it
<strong>Backup Mail. </strong>Open it, click <strong>Organize </strong>then click
<strong>Paste. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Import-Messages-WL-Mail.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fImport-Messages-WL-Mail_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Once you have configured Windows Live Mail, press <strong>Alt </strong>on your keyboard (this is for Windows Live Mail wave 3), then select
<strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Import </strong>then click <strong>Messages. </strong>
</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Import-Messages-WL-Mail-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fImport-Messages-WL-Mail-2_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Select Microsoft Outlook Express 6, if you have upgraded from from Windows Vista and used
<strong>Windows Mail </strong>that came built in as the mail client, select that. If you upgraded from Windows XP or Vista and used a previous version of Windows Live Mail such as version 2008 (build 12.0.1606), select that option, then click
<strong>Next. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Import-Messages-WL-Mail-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fImport-Messages-WL-Mail-3_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>At the <strong>Location of Messages </strong>screen click <strong>Browse </strong>
navigate down to <strong>Backup Mail </strong>folder we created earlier containing the
<strong>.dbx files. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Import-Messages-WL-Mail-5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fImport-Messages-WL-Mail-5_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Click <strong>Next</strong>, you will now see the <strong>Select Folders </strong>
screen, go with the default<strong> All Folders, </strong>then click <strong>Next.
</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Import-Messages-WL-Mail-6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fImport-Messages-WL-Mail-6_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>You will now see your messages import, click <strong>Finish </strong>to complete. If you don’t see your emails populated, make sure you expand the
<strong>Storage folders</strong> tree in the Folder pane, expand the <strong>Imported Folders
</strong>then expand <strong>Local folders</strong> then click <strong>Inbox. </strong>
If you don’t see this folder, restart Windows Live Mail and try again.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Live Mail 2011 </strong>users can start the import process by clicking
<strong>File </strong>menu then click <strong>Import Messages </strong>follow the same instructions for importing. That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>Should you delete the Windows.old folder?</strong> The Windows.old folder can take up a considerable amount of disk space, but I don’t recommend you immediately delete it, just in case you might need to copy over a missing file or folder. Also, if
 you need to reinstall Windows XP or Vista in the future and you don’t have access to your recovery media, Windows.old might be all you got left to do so.</p>

            You need to sign out of Skype on that other computer or set up Skype not to remember your password on that computer.&nbsp; If you do not sign out of Skype or keep the password saved on a public computer, then of course, anyone would have access to it.

<p>That's exactly what I am running, well with the exception of 16GB of RAM. The processor supports SSE4, so I assume that includes SSE2.</p>

<p>Homegroup Error code 0x80070035 The network path was not found</p>
<p>Two laptops (A &amp; B), both&nbsp;running windows 7 and macafee.&nbsp; Laptop A was upgraded from vista.&nbsp;&nbsp;I made each laptop a "trusted" computer in macafee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Laptop A can see and access laptop B.&nbsp; Laptop B can "see" laptop A (it displays the name of laptop A under the
 Homegroup in windows explorer) but&nbsp;it can't access it (due to "Error code 0x80070035 The network path was not found.") &nbsp;BTW: For some reason, on&nbsp;laptop B, the Homegroup&nbsp;lists<em><strong>both</strong></em> laptop A and laptop B (itself) as part of the Homegroup
 but on laptop A the Homegroup lists only laptop B.</p>
<p>Any ideas??</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
If your computer is having problems viewing computers or shared files in your homegroup, try using the HomeGroup troubleshooter to fix the problem. It makes sure that your computer's different network services are running correctly, and that your computer is
 a member of a homegroup.<br />
Refer to the article below for steps and more information.<br />
<strong>Open the HomeGroup troubleshooter</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-HomeGroup-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-HomeGroup-troubleshooter</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong><br />
The issue may be caused also by your security program such&nbsp;as anti-virus or a Windows Firewall /Defender which might have conflicting settings as to not to perform certain tasks. I suggest that you temporary disable the anti-virus and firewall and check the
 result again. You would need to turn on the security programs again which you had disabled.<br />
<strong>Disable antivirus software</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a><br />
<strong>Important Note: </strong>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 3.</strong><br />
Ensure NetBIOS over TCP/IP is enabled on both computers<br />
a. Go to “Control Panel - Network Connections”.<br />
b. Right-Click on the connection and click Properties. <br />
c. Find Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Version 4 in the list.<br />
d. Click Properties, and then click Advanced. <br />
e. On the Advanced TCP/IP settings windows, go to “WINS” tab.<br />
f. Under NetBIOS setting, click Enable NetBIOS over TCP/IP, and then click OK.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.<br />

            <p>SOLVED</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, i managed to solve the issue very easily myself. As it turns out if have to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Right-click the&nbsp;<em>OneDrive</em> icon in taskbar</strong> -&gt;&nbsp;<em><strong>Settings</strong> -&gt;</em>&nbsp;<strong><em>A</em><em>uto-save
</em>tab&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here I could change the default save location for <em>Documents and Pictures</em>&nbsp;from
<em>OneDrive</em> to<em> This PC only</em>. This fixed the issue. Strange that the native win10
<em>System Settings</em> menu (e.i.&nbsp;<em>Storage</em>) does not have full control of / power to change settings and that you have go through the OneDrive app. Perhaps Microsoft baked this new functionality a little to strongly into win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bonus: this fix also solved the (for me) annoying fact that the <em>Pictures</em> and
<em>Documents</em> folders under the&nbsp;<em>This PC</em>&nbsp;library in <em>File Explorer
</em>linked to the corresponding OneDrive folders and not the user folders.&nbsp;Hope this can help others experiencing the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
