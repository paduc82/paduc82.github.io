</div>
<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Over the last 5-6 days I have been continuously getting BSOD'd — sometimes even between a span of 10 mins. The error
<b>(system thread exception not handled)</b> I get pertains to<b> 'iastor.sys' </b>
which pointed to my Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver. I immediately updated it through my Dell update application, following which the BSODs have increased, this time putting<b> 'iastorA.sys'
</b>as the cause. Though now it says<b>&nbsp;IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I go about this? Please provide me a resolution,</div>
<div><br />

We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file
<br />
sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy
<br />
them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there.<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files<br />

<strong>BCCode: 0A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000000A<br />
<br />
</strong>Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security products are<br />
just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to corrupt or go out of bounds.<br />
The video driver or something affecting it would be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers are all updated by manually checking<br />
at the System maker and device makers' sites.<br />

<br />
<strong>BCCode: 0A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000000A<br />
<br />
Bug Check 0xA: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</strong><br />
<br />
The IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x0000000A. This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.
<br />
<br />
Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
<p>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Parameters </p>
<p>The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</p>

</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p><br />
This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high.</p>
<p>The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.</p>
<p><br />
If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution </strong></p>
<p><br />
If a kernel debugger is available, obtain a stack trace.</p>
<p><br />
To resolve an error caused by a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Restart your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option from the Windows
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>To resolve an error caused by an incompatible device driver, system service, virus scanner, or backup tool
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for error messages that might identify the device or driver that caused the error.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Try disabling memory caching of the BIOS.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Run the hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer, especially the memory scanner. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Make sure the latest Service Pack is installed.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If your system has small computer system interface (SCSI) adapters, contact the adapter manufacturer to obtain updated Windows drivers. Try disabling sync negotiation in the SCSI BIOS, checking the cabling and the SCSI IDs of each device, and confirming
 proper termination.</p>
</li><li>
<p>For integrated device electronics (IDE) devices, define the onboard IDE port as Primary only. Also, check each IDE device for the proper master/subordinate/stand-alone setting. Try removing all IDE devices except for hard disks.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If the message appears during an installation of Windows, make sure that the computer and all installed peripherals are compatible with the version of Windows being installed. For example, you can get information about compatibility with Windows&nbsp;7 at the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=246806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Compatibility Center</a>.

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>

<br />
<strong>Translate these to Windows 8 methods (there is little real difference) :</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7 and Windows 8.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (<strong>also update the BIOS and low level<br />
chipset drivers - see the System/Motherboard Maker's site</strong>)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>&nbsp;<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to
<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same but turned out that the reason for it was that "<strong>Intel Rapid Storage Technology</strong>" had the option</p>
<p><strong>Accelerated Mode</strong> that I forgot that I set to <strong>Maximized
</strong>once I changed it to <strong>Enhanced</strong> that problem was gone for good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for being start windows again in order to change this setting if you weren't able to boot up I suggest you use your Windows Recovery CD or Recovery options to start
<strong>CMD (Command Prompt)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then Run the following</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>C:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CHKDSK C: /F</strong></p>
<p>Then write <strong>YES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Once finished you should be able to start your windows again then change the Accelerated Mode to Enhanced.</strong></p>
<p>Hope this works for you!</p>

<h2>            Fifa 13 Disc Unreadable</h2>
                    
<p>I have had this game for a couple weeks now and suddenly I can't even get the game started. I just tried again and got the same error. I don't know what to do...</p>
<p>I've got a slim system so I can't detatch my HDD and I've tried clearing my system cache. I can't think of anything that could be causing this as it's the only game that does so.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>yes - I verified... it is 1511 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 1607 installation WITHOUT error message, after everything seamed to get installed... the machine reboots and "rolls back"&nbsp;to 1511 without notification why the 1607 installation is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened on 2 out of 3 machines. 1 machine was successfully updated to 1607.</p>

            <p>Hi Prahalad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did use ISO file and I did follow instructions. This is clearly stated in m problem statement above. So please do not copy/paste a standard answer to my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I upgraded additional machines... so I know how to do it :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have 2 machines where the upgrade fails WITHOUT error and roles back to 1511 after reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure I am not the only customer with this problem. I already have seen similar posts...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how can I solve the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Steffen</p>

                    Hello. &nbsp;I am using Windows 7 Home Premium in an HP Pavilion dv6 with Windows 64-bit operating system. &nbsp;For about the last week, my CPU usage has been extremely high (between 40-100-percent) upon start-up. &nbsp;Prior to this, I had not downloaded any programs
 or done any updates to my computer. &nbsp;I have tried running Microsoft Security Essentials, scanned for viruses, used a PC clean up tool, ran disc-drive checks, ran CCleaner and a malware program. &nbsp;Some of these programs said they "fixed" removed, or whatever
 various things wrong with my laptop but none of them have fixed the problem. &nbsp;What else is there to do? &nbsp;Pls help!!!!

<div>I would run msconfig.exe and disable each and every task under the Startup tab. If this solves the problem then you can restore them selectively until you find the culprit. If it does not then you could do the same under the Services tab. Remember to hide
 all MS services before disabling anything. The MS services are essential - the rest isn't.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To be absolutely sure that you do not end up with an unbootable system, do this:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Create a System Restore Point.</li><li>Burn a Repair CD.</li><li>Use the Repair CD to boot into Repair Mode.</li><li>Make sure that the restore point from Step 1 is visible.</li></ol>
You could try Process Explorer or Process Monitor in an attempt to find out more about these processes. This requires a lot of patience. http://technet.microsoft.com/de-ch/sysinternals

            <p>I downloaded the windows phone recovery tool provided in your link.&nbsp; It was incompatible with my windows Surface 2 running Windows RT.&nbsp; I then tried it on my Asus laptop running windows 8.&nbsp; The recovery tool failed upon it's initial download.&nbsp; It gave me
 an error file.:</p>

<h2>            Windows keeps asking to set up a PIN</h2>
                    I just updated my PC (in the middle of the day instead of 12AM like I said to, but I can't complain about that right now) and now every time I log on, Windows asks me to set up a PIN. I do not want one. It is much less secure than a password. Can someone
 tell me how to make Windows stop asking for a PIN? (If you are going to respond with "setting up a PIN is not that bad just deal with it" or "just set up the PIN it is secure enough" you may as well just not reply, I just need to know how to turn it off)

</p><p>I did read the link about the pin. The fact that it is unique to each device is not better it is worse. That means I have to have three more pins for each of the devices I have, instead of one PW. A password is still something you have remember whether it
 is called a pass word or a pin.&nbsp; Come on, ask your boss if you can show me how to avoid the PIN at sign in. Otherwise, I may have to set the sign in to 'never' which will make my computer less secure. &nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks. JB</p>

<p>I use the same PIN on all my devices.</p>
<p>might be if you have an item capable of the windows hello feature, you need to remove windows hello in accounts.</p>
<p>might be something you dont see has hello available - hello from something I've read relies on the PIN and TPM, so try disabling TPM in your bios/setup.&nbsp; Maybe looking at Tpm.msc would give a hint. &nbsp; Set a PIN then Remove it might quit it from asking for
 one.</p>

            I fully agree with you very annoying. The security guidelines say to have a long password, that 1234 was not a good password. Suddenly, 1234 is good enough. It does not makes sense to me. Microsoft, I do not want to set a PING, how to remove the very annoying
 request?

            I found an answer. The next time you log into your computer, at the log in screen, where you type in your password, there are 2 icons under the field for you to enter your password. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>RIGHT
</strong>icon prior to entering your password. Then enter your password and hit enter. Presto! No more Pin question!

It's not the having to enter the PIN I don't like, I just don't want it to be an option to get into my computer. There are a lot less 4-digit codes out there than there are passwords.

            Helo JOHNTOWELL,
<br />
<br />Can you explain a bit better what are you looking for?
<br />
<br />You want to increase the Dedicated Video RAM of your GPU?
<br />1. Restart your computer and enter the BIOS settings at the next startup by pressing the dedicated BIOS key repeatedly during the bootup. Try pressing F2, F5, F8 or Del key repeatedly. If that doesn’t work, search online for specific steps on entering the BIOS settings in relation to your motherboard manufacturer.
<br />2. Once you reach the BIOS menu, look for a menu similar to Graphics Settings, Video Settings or VGA Share Memory Size. You can typically find it under the Advanced menu.
<br />3. Then, up the Pre-Allocated VRAM to whichever option suits you best.
<br />4. Save the configuration and restart your computer. At the next startup, use the procedure above to see if the VRAM count has been increased.
<br />
<br />How to check the amount of video RAM:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows key + R to open up a Run box. Then, type “ms-settings:easeofaccess-display” and hit Enter to open the Display tab of the Settings app.
<br />2. Scroll down and click on Advanced display settings, then click on Display adapter properties for Display
<br />3. You can check out your VRAM count under Adapter information at Dedicated Video Memory. But keep in mind that if you have both a dedicated GPU and an integrated graphics card, this window will show you the integrated solution if your PC is in idle.
<br />
<br />Hope it helps, have a good day       
        </p>

    <title>Which is better&#63; Windows Disk Cleanup or CCleaner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daffyduckkangaroo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Which is better&#63; Windows Disk Cleanup or CCleaner</h2>
                    <p>I like to clean my&nbsp;operating system&nbsp;on a regular basis, to wholly delete "deleted" files, what's in the trash, Internet searches, etc. I have used both Windows' Disk Cleanup and CCleaner, and CCleaner always seems to take much longer, so that a process on
 Windows Disk Cleanup that may take 5 minutes, will take over an hour on CCleaner!!! Is this because CCleaner is much more thorough? It seems to be something called "passes," which I don't see on Disk Cleanup.</p>
<p>I understand this is a Microsoft website, and therefore loyalty may demand nothing bad is said about Windows Disk Cleanup in comparison to CCleaner, but I would like a frank answer.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Emptying the Recycle Bin, or perminentally deleteing a file deletes the file, of course as you are aware some third party software may be able to recover it</p>
<p>Using Disk Clean Up or CCleaner makes no difference to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to make it more difficult for a third party to recover deleted data then there are many third party tools that overwrite any 'empty space' on the drive by basically writting a series of zeros to that empty space on the drive</p>
<p>And of course you could use file encryption software, but be warned if you lose the encryption Key you will have most likely lost everything.</p>

<h2>            microphone is detected but does not pick up sound.</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to use a microphone with my computer.&nbsp; In the Control Panel Sound dialog it says that the microphone is "Working".&nbsp; It is not muted and the volume is up all the way.&nbsp; However, when I speak into it, it does not register that there is any sound
 input, and the bars do not move up and down like they should.&nbsp; So of course I can't record anything, because it doesn't seem to "hear" me.</p>
<p>I have been Googling this all day and I feel very embarrassed that I can't figure it out :(</p>

            As it turns out, it seems it was the microphone itself that was the problem.&nbsp; I went and took my brother's other mic and it works fine.&nbsp; Ugh!&nbsp; Sorry to have wasted your time with my STUPIDITY.&nbsp; Thank you for the suggestions, I ended up updating my drivers
 anyway so I guess some good came out of it ;)

<h2>            Surface Pro 2017 &#40;Latest Edition&#41; Hibernating randomly due to Microsoft Windows Kernel Power &#40;Error 88 &#40;85&#41;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I just bought my surface, I'm absolutely loving it, however there is just a big concern that I always encounter in the middle of my task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever my surface is slightly heated up (like, really, just slightly heated up because I am only using a microsoft powerpoint) my surface HIBERNATES randomly out of no reason whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After digging around with my windows event log, I found out that it was&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft-Windows Kernel Power&nbsp;</strong>that is&nbsp;<strong>randomly hibernating my Surface Pro</strong>, it is&nbsp;<strong>Error 88 (85)
</strong>that is executing the hibernation and <strong>Event 42 (64) </strong>that is putting my computer to hibernate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering<strong>, how do I disable Microsoft Windows Kernel Power from randomly hibernating whenever my computer is "overheatted"</strong> (I never had a problem with Surface Pro 3, I wonder if it is a new feature that microsoft brought in to annoy
 the heck out of users) . I&nbsp;<strong>Do not </strong>want to disable any background apps, clean up my disk (I only got my surface for a couple of months) , or perform a reset of my surface!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Pro is hardly half years old and it is already "overheatting" from doing microsoft powerpoint (like seriously, that's the only thing that I use my surface pro for). I do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> have an external program or a third party program that
 is controlling over my surface. I turned all timer that puts computer to sleep and shutdown in
<strong>Power Options </strong>to Never (because my surface is always plugged into my surface dock), but still no hope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips or help is very, very, very much appreciated! Thanks!</p>

</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reaching out to solve this issue for me. I found a method that just simply solved everything in this issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my Kernel Power detects that my surface pro is above temperature, it is reasonable that it will automatically hibernate my surface to protect my computer cores.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>Kernel Power <em>Hibernates&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>my surface, so I just simply disabled hibernation of my surface via cmd /</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><strong>powercfg.exe
 /hibernate off</strong>&nbsp;</span><strong>since I never really used the feature </strong>
(I prefer Sleep option)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This method will allow Kernel Power not only unable to hibernate my surface when it overheats, it solves alot of my power issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Numerous attempts at installing Windows 10 as a Microsoft Update failed; with the c-1900101-20017 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What finally worked for me was to un-install the RAM upgrade I had done; and go back to the original machine RAM installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Windows 10 installed OK; and I upgraded the RAM again from 2 to 4 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any RAM changes have been made, might be good to temporarily revert back to the original RAM installation and try installing Windows 10.......</p>

<h2>            Xbox App Will Not Open. W10</h2>
                    The Xbox and Xbox Smartglass apps will not open on Windows 10. When I click the app the green window shows up for a second then closes. I have tried WSReset.exe and updating the store and the apps, but these suggestions do not work. All other apps work
 without any problems; it is only the Xbox and Xbox Smartglass apps.

<div><br />
2. In the list of hardware categories, find and expand the <strong>Display</strong>
<strong>Adapters</strong> and double-click the device name.</div>
<div><br />
3. Click the <strong>Driver</strong> tab, click <strong>Update Driver</strong>, and then follow the instructions. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</div>

    <title>Surface Pro2 power usage with Windows 10 in Tablet Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russell taylor_au  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro2 power usage with Windows 10 in Tablet Mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've had a Surface Pro 2 for the last couple of years and it's been performing really well.&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 10 and it's mostly been fantastic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I have is that since Windows 10 when I use the device in Tablet mode it gets really hot, fan runs constantly and the battery runs down in about 2 hours or less.&nbsp; If I use it in desktop mode, this problem doesn't occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've applied the recent Cumulative rollup but still have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to reproduce</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Remove keyboard and put into tablet mode</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Start a web browser and just browse the internet</p>
<p>After about 30mins or less, you can notice the heat and fan running.</p>
<p>Battery drains really quickly.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Put the keyboard back on and go into desktop mode and it slowly cools down again and fan eventually stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched the community and there doesn't appear to be this exact issue logged, so just putting it out there to see if anyone else&nbsp;is experiencing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>Russ</p>

            <p>That link is not helpful. My Surface Pro 2 power management and battery life were fine until the Win10 installation. I do not think is it reasonable to reduce screen brightness to conserve battery life when I did not need to on Win8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>CPU utilization is usually above 50%, even if I am not running any apps other than the standard ones I ran live on Win8.1 (finance, news, email) that update in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 is using a lot more computing power and I can't see what it is doing. Checking Task Manager just shows typical Windows services running, although a driver service is using a lot of CPU time. That does not make sense, because there are no new devices
 on my Surface Pro 2 (just using the Microsoft click keyboard I bought with it a year and a half ago. My system should not need any work on drivers to be going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrating. Really did not expect this or the wifi driver failure when I first installed Win10 a few days ago (fairly quickly resolved that day),</p>

            Thanks for the reply Uttam, but it doesn't appear to be a power management related setting or battery issue.&nbsp; The issue for me presents itself only when the device is in Tablet mode.&nbsp; If in desktop mode, I can use it all day long without problems.

    <title>Unable to Boot into Win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vinayak bendale  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Boot into Win10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was working on my computer, when suddenly it hung up and haven't been able to boot into it again! All my data is on the drive and I am unable to recover it by the means mentioned below.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system: 1 TB HDD with 5 partitions out of which one (C:) has Windows 10. Rest all contain data.
</p>
<p>Motherboard: Gigabyte GA MA785GMT US2H (rev 1.1) (NOTE: doesn't support UEFI!)</p>
<p>4Gb DDR3 RAM, 550W Silverstone strider essential series PSU<br />
</p>
<p>What all have I tried? Hmm pretty much all in my capacity. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have a spare HDD. I fresh installed Win10 on it and it is working all fine!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When I connect my screwed up HDD as secondary drive, it is not detected in Win 10. However, when the computer boots up, I am able to see two HDDs being detected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. While attempting to boot into the screwed up HDD with no other HDDs attached, it never boots and gets stuck at different stages. Sometimes, it gets stuck just after BIOS screen and then I get a message of DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS
 ENTER.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sometimes it gets stuck while attempting to load Win 10 and I get a message INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DRIVE</p>
<p>Sometimes it gets stuck in Recovery, File: \Boot\BCD ERROR: 0xc0000098</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30f8f262-eb83-49e4-b2cc-724be1740362" height="429" width="765" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. When into Recovery, under Troubleshoot in while trying to Refresh, I get an error that "The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again."</p>
<p>While trying to Reset, I get an error "Unable to reset your PC. A required drive partition is missing."</p>
<p>I face the exact same issue as you may see in the video (link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXsXNZHRC8U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
YOUTUBE - LINK</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/zXsXNZHRC8U?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/zXsXNZHRC8U?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue persists while into Recovery even after trying to do from a USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; I tried to clean install Win10, but to my dismay no drives are detected and cannot proceed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Tried to boot into another computer, but I face the same issues stated above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft gurus in dire need of your help! Please RESCUE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All your comments are much appreciated! Thanks!<br />

</p><p>I tried what you suggested, however it didn't do any good. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do the repair using Win10 on USB drive. But it threw me the same error# 0xc0000098 again. I can see my drive is detected in the BIOS.

</p>
<p>But when I checked for the partitions in the Command Prompt, none of the drives are listed except for the USB drive which had the Win10 installation/repair media.
