<h2>            windows 10 desktop icons and taskbar don&#39;t load on startup</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 version 1709 is not loading the desktop icons and taskbar on startup from time to time. I have been looking through a lot of solutions offered on the internet and I have tried many fixes that do not work. The only thing that I changed recently
 was to go to "metered mode' for updates because I can't afford the data (I use a mobile phone to connect to the internet) if Windows tries to update every time I go online. It's hard to even shut down without holding down the on/off button. Also, right clicking
 on the blank desktop gets no response, and neither does CTRL + ALT + DEL or CTRL + ALT + ESC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Lenovo Ideapad laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance appreciated</p>

            Hi dancingdolphin,
<br />
<br />I'd like to help you with this issue, that must suck. You could venture on making a new user profile. Hit Windows key + R and enter the following: netplwiz
<br />
<br />In the new window, make a new user profile, and log in from that.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, and there's no other way to interact with the computer, I'm afraid your user profile is badly corrupt and you'll have to reinstall Windows.
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows by using the Media Creation Tool, here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You will need a flash drive of 8 GB or larger in capacity, and another computer to do this on, apart from the one that has the issue.
<br />
<br />If you have any questions about any process I've mentioned here, please let me know, and I wish you luck.

    <title>Windows 10 Activation Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willston  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation Issue</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting the error code 0x8007232B, which I looked up and and error message 1 says, "DNS Name does not exist" and the second one says, "Windows could not be activated. Key management services (KMS) host could not be located in domain name system (DNS),
 please have your system adminstrator verify that a KMS is published correctly in DNS." Both of these messages I am not getting. The message I am getting says, "Windows can't activate right now. Try activating again later, (and I've been getting this ever since
 the newest update, which was a couple days ago, so I've tried several times) If that doesn't work, contact your system administrator. (Which I'm not sure if that means the computer administrator, which only one person uses this computer, me of course, so not
 sure what that means) Error Code: 0x8007232B.</p>
<p>So yeah, I've been looking up solutions, and I was going to downgrade, but the thing about that is is that it's obviously been over a month since Windows 10 has been out and I'm not sure that if I go back, I can also go back to Windows 10 for free, at least.
 I also see that I didn't remember if I got a product key or not while upgrading to Windows 10, there is that "Product Key" in the Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation, which of course it's 20 X's and 5 numbers of the code, and one of the help pages on
 "Activation in Windows 10 says that it would create a "digital entitlement" and I don't know what that is.
</p>
<p>Gonna be honest, at first it wasn't bothering me until I wanted to change my theme to feel the holiday spirit, and it didn't let me, so that's what led me to look up all this stuff and go to here asking this very question of how do I actually activate my
 Windows 10, if I can even, I hope.</p>

            <p>OK so after reading the page you linked me (thank you very much for doing so), I've come to the conclusion that I need to wait a few days for it to activate, as it does say: "
<strong><em>Activation servers&nbsp;might be&nbsp;overwhelmed at the times because of the volume of upgrades, so give it some time if you get an error message such as (0XC004E003, ,0x8007000D, 0x8007232b or 0x8007007B)&nbsp;Windows 10 will eventually activate as long as you
 upgrade using the appropriate method</em></strong>." I did upgrade from Windows 8.1 by the way, if that helps.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday I had my laptop freeze on me twice, once early in the morning, then once a couple hours in the afternoon. Do you think that could relate to this activation problem?</p>

            Do product keys change? Because I downloaded the ShowKeyPlus program, and the ending numbers for my product key are H8Q99, and I remember it was that in the Update &amp; Security too, but now in that section, the ending numbers are WFG99. I would like to know
 before I change my product key because I do have the November Update.

<p>
</p><p>My guess is that whoever changed it inserted a MAK or VLK meant for use at businesses, schools and other large organizations which can cause the error you quoted.&nbsp;

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
There are a few reasons why you're still unable to connect to the internet after performing troubleshooting steps. For us to narrow it down, kindly answer the questions listed below:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What's the status of your Internet connection?</li><li>Were there any changes in your system before experiencing this issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your reply.</p>

<p>I can use internet normally if I don't use much internet. But the problem happens when I use a bigger amount of internet like playing online games or downloading and I cannot fix it by troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't change anything before experiencing the issue. I used Windows 7 and the internet worked perfectly. But since I upgrade to windows 10, the problem happens everytime I use a big amount of internet</p>

<p>Can you help technologists who may be reading your post, help you be please posting some additional technical information?
</p>
<p>When diagnosing issues which are complex and not widespread it is helpful to get a 'full picture' of the device and how it is interacting with the operating system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that being said, if we could help us by answering these following questions, it would be appreciated:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) What exact, (full/complete) model number Asus laptop are you experiencing issues with?</p>
<p><em>(</em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Full Model Number means: </span>
<em>Asus QS24UQ would not allow a technologist to look up detailed hardware information about a device. Instead, what is helpful and what's needed could be: Asus Q524UQ-BBI7T14, i7, 15.6" touchscreen laptop)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) What is the name of your Windows Operating System?</p>
<p><em>Windows OS Name Example: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>3) What Version of Windows are you running? </p>
<p><em>Windows Version Example: 10.0.15063 - Build 15063</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>4)What model wireless NIC is on-board your device? </p>
<p><em>Wireless Network Interface Card Model Example: Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC Network Controller</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This information will professional technologists who may be reviewing your post to get a full picture of what's going on with your device in order to see if there's an application issue or a hardware issue which is impeding your ability to access wireless
 functionality. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'System Information' page which you can find by typing "System Information" into Cortana's search feature, will contain the majority of the information being requested in a single page; On Summary and on Network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, feel free to post images of screenshots with the Windows OS name, Build/Version, and Wireless/Wi-Fi NIC Network Interface hardware information.</p>

<p>Hello , &nbsp;</p>
<p>So your issue right now are freezes.</p>
<p>Try this.</p>
<p>Sometimes your internet does not process things right , remember errors are pretty common when downloading.
</p>
<p>1. Un-Plug your modem box for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>2. Plug your wired cable back into the Xbox 360 console.</p>
<p>3. Delete your game from the location that its on.</p>
<p>4. Clear the cache on the same location that you deleted it from.</p>
<p>5. Re-Download it.</p>
<p>6. Play</p>
<p>Option 2 </p>
<p>1. Un-Plug your modem box for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>2. Plug your wired cable back into the Xbox 360 console.</p>
<p>3. Delete your game from the location that its on.</p>
<p>4. Clear the cache on the same location that you deleted it from.</p>
<p>5. Download demos that amount to the size that your game takes up.</p>
<p>6. Re-Download your game.</p>
<p>7. Play</p>
<p>( It could be your game , was downloaded on a bad sector of the drive and just needs to be placed some where else.)</p>
<p>* Please let me know how it goes, Thanks.</p>

    <title>Migrating Windows 10 in Boot Camp - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shiftregister  say:</h3>
<h2>            Migrating Windows 10 in Boot Camp</h2>
                    <p>I used to have Windows 7 running under Boot Camp on a Mac. I then got the free upgrade to Windows 10 and that works fine under Boot Camp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now upgrading my hardware to a new Mac and want to migrate Windows 10 to a Boot Camp partition on the new machine. But, of course, I don't have an install disk or Product Key for Windows 10 because it was all done online by the Get Windows 10 app. If
 I install an ISO download of Windows 10 will it ask me for a Product Key? If so do I just use my old Windows 7 Product Key? Or can I get a new Product Key for the upgraded Windows 10? How?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old iMac will be wiped and sold so I am not trying to get two copies of Windows 10 from one upgrade, I just want to stop using it on the old machine and start using it on the new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<h2>            BSOD...base filtering engine stops working</h2>
                    I've been getting intermittent bsod. When I looked at my reliability history it appears that what is causing it is the base filtering engine stops working. After the reboot the computer may work fine for hours and then unexpectedly I will get another bsod
 sometimes minutes apart. This has been going on since Dec. 1, 2017. I am a senior who is ZERO tech savvy so this problem really scares me. I have done virus/malware scans (McAfee, Superantispyware, Malwarebytes, Microsoft Safety Scanner and everything comes
 back no problems. If someone could suggest a solution in simple terms I would really appreciate it. I am using Windows 10.

            Hi blueskyrm, Blue Screens are a sign of a bed driver, not of a malware infection . . .
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Mini Dumps
<br />Select Everything in that folder, right click and choose Compressed (zip) folder
<br />
<br />Upload that Zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Post a link to that file on the cloud and we can have a look for you

            Hi,
<br />
<br />It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes which has the potential to pinpoint the cause.
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.       
        </p>

            You have a lot of security utilities installed, I suggest you remove all except McAfee and Malwarebytes. 
<br />
<br />Also:
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters.

            I will remove the excess&nbsp;security programs as recommended. McAfee is my real time program and the others I only run on demand&nbsp;from time to time. Can you explain how I would go about updating the things you recommended. I am unfamiliar with all those terms.
 Again thanks so much for your attention.

    <title>VAIO CPU overuse problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            VAIO CPU overuse problem</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
The problem is that my CPU, almost all the time, is clocking at about 3.5GHz or near to 3GHz (3GHz is max) with about constant 30-40% CPU usage all the time. This results in overheating of my laptop. From the task manager, it's clear that system.exe and system
 interrupt.exe processes are the culprits. Using sysinternals procexp tool, I traced down the thread that is overusing the CPU - ACPI, which is related to the power supply. A high system interrupt CPU usage means CPU is "interrupted" much more frequently than
 usual.</div>
<div style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
This problem occurred in windows 8 and 8.1 after I upgraded my inbuilt HDD with a solid state drive. This HDD was used to replace the inbuilt DVD drive, so that I could use the enormous space of HDD. I feel this is entirely a software problem related to the
 power distribution that is not optimized for the hardware modification that I have done.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
There are several solutions suggested on the internet. These includes a faulty bluetooth driver, so it was suggested to disable it. But this didn't help me. I even tried upgrading to Windows 10, but this problem has still persisted. Can anyone suggest a troubleshooting
 guide to solve this problem?</div>

            <p><span><span>Hello Aamir,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Microsoft system protection background executes under the SYSTEM account within Windows with extensive privileges on the local computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>High CPU usage can halt the system entirely, forcing you to manually shut down and restart the computer. There are several causes of high CPU usage, like Malwares they comes in many different forms---virus, Trojan, spyware,
 worm---and can increase, or even max out, CPU usage. The issue could also be due to Malfunctioning or Incompatible Software.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Did you make any recent changes on your computer before this issue occurred?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to follow the methods given below.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1. Run Performance Troubleshooter</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The Performance troubleshooter checks issues that might slow down your computer's performance, such as how many users are currently logged on to the computer and whether multiple programs are running at the same time.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>Press windows key + X key.</span></strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>then clicking </span></span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></p>

<p><span><span>If issue didn’t get resolved try method 2</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to try following steps and check</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 1: Try to login into Safe Mode.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Boot the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue persists. </span>
<span>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To go into safe mode refer the link given below

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the problem does not exist in safe mode, try to perform a clean boot and check.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot. </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Refer: How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:<em> </em></span></strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If issue still didn’t get resolved try method 3</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3</span></span></strong><span><span>: <strong>Run Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>
<br />
Run a full computer scan with the Microsoft Safety Scanner to make sure that the computer is virus free.</span></span></p>

            My sincere apologies. Currently Photos app doesn't provide the ability to put more than one music. 
<br />
<br />The option is to join all the 3 files together in the order which you want and then put this single music file in Photos app.

<p>How sad Microsoft got rid of a great program for an inferior one. &nbsp;I was on the phone with them and they just kept talking about the features that photo app has which is almost nothing compared to movie maker. &nbsp;Ask how to file a formal complaint and was
 basically sent to a suggestion box. &nbsp;Not a happy camper.</p>

<p>I have the same problem, I tried almost&nbsp;every solution I found online. It seems windows 10 will automatically download and update your drivers, so I disconnected internet and&nbsp;turned that off (you can google how to do it), then installed the old driver comes
 from my laptop's manufacturer. It works!! I got my sound back! only for few hours!! until the next reboot!&nbsp; I turned that automatic update off!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was so upset about it and seriously&nbsp;thinking of&nbsp;using a mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How could Microsoft forces us to install faulty drivers?</p>

<h2>            Windows live mail missing newsgroups</h2>
                    I lost all my data on my entire computer because the repair man had to do a complete restoration. Thank goodness I have Carbonite, and that back up is re-populating my computer.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, unlike the person above, my issue is with Windows Live. I signed in and nothing is there. I did sign in as recently as a a few weeks ago, right before winter break ( I teach online and these newsgroups were actual classes I was teaching).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thought Windows live was all web based, and so I would expect my newsgroups to be there.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. How do I access the newsgroups on the internet, shouldn't they be there?</div>
<div>2. What is the relationship between my pc and the windows live application account?&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

<p>my issue is with Windows Live. I signed in and nothing is there ...&nbsp;I thought Windows live was all web based, and so I would expect my newsgroups to be there.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Windows Live is a loose descriptor, now deprecated, for a number of Microsoft applications and services that&nbsp;were an early attempt to&nbsp;integrate local activity with activity on the web.&nbsp;I think the only two things left bearing the name are the mail client program
 Windows Live Mail and the custom domain service known as Windows Live Admin Center.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Signing in only determines which contacts list and calendar to load. It has nothing to do with sending or receiving mail messages or newsgroup posts.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. How do I access the newsgroups on the internet, shouldn't they be there?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Newsgroups are much older than Windows Live. Newsgroup posts are stored on dedicated servers&nbsp;and accessed from news clients over the Internet using a special protocol. Windows Live Mail is&nbsp;such a client, and while its local copies of newsgroup posts may
 have been backed up by Carbonite, you're much more likely to get good results by simply subscribing to your newsgroups again. You'll have first to set up the news account.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />

<p>2. What is the relationship between my pc and the windows live application account?&nbsp;</p>

Sorry, I don't understand the question.</p>

            Thx much FireDog,
<div><br />
<div>Good recommendations here though the newsgroups are no longer active. The university i work for archives them at some point. All these newsgroups were classes I facilitated. I will have to check with them to see if they have a solution.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I am trying to understand is should I expect any back up service to have captured what had been in my Windows Live 2009 version?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ultimately, how do i recover the data, and if I understand you correctly, I would need to re-subscribe as my best option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will work with Carbonite too, but...was the data ever actually on my personal computer like outlook?&nbsp;</div>

            <p>OK. If Carbonite backed up your Windows Live Mail store folder, then any newsgroup posts you had downloaded should be included. Unless you had consciously moved your store folder, you would find them in a folder named something like</p>

<p>
</p><p>after I first upgraded to Windows 10 things were fine. But here we are a few weeks later and I am having some issues. One of the programs I use frequently has stopped working. Originally I thought it was the program itself having issues, so i tried uninstalling
 then reinstalling. I keep getting the same error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>I had the same issue until yesterday when I stumbled across someone with same issue in a Steam forum. The URL where I found the solution is at the bottom of this post.&nbsp;<strong><span>Here are the instructions I've typed up.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PLEASE READ: THIS SOLUTION WORKED FOR ME AND SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE; HOWEVER, CHANGING SYSTEM FILES IS ALWAYS RISKY AND SHOULD BE DONE WITH CAUTION</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open file explorer and find the file location</p>
<p>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727</p>
<p>(<strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong>&nbsp;Windows will prompt you for administrator privileges. Just select "Yes" on these prompts.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>copy the CONFIG file and place a copy on the desktop or wherever works best for you. Because we will be deleting a system file, I like to have the original just in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpuu.sh%2fjOU0k%2f4b62169ef0.png" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Now enter the CONFIG file (C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\CONFIG)</p>
<p>and delete the&nbsp;<em>machine.config</em>&nbsp;file</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpuu.sh%2fjOUus%2f9f7a46b806.jpg" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In the same folder should be a different file named&nbsp;<em>machine.config.default</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;copy this file to the desktop. Rename the new file on the desktop&nbsp;<em>machine.config</em>&nbsp;and copy this back into C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\CONFIG to replace the file we just deleted.</p>
<p>(<strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong>&nbsp;Windows may prompt a warning about changing file types while renaming the<em>machine.config.default</em>&nbsp;file, just confirm the prompt and continue.)</p>
<p>(<span><strong>NOTE:</strong></span>&nbsp;I've already fixed the problem on my computer so I did not re-delete the<em>machine.config</em>&nbsp;file; meaning that in the screenshot below I have a&nbsp;<em>machine.config</em>&nbsp;file
 in my&nbsp;C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\CONFIG folder whereas yours should not until it is replaced.)<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpuu.sh%2fjOUGV%2fd459cde252.jpg" /></p>
<p><span><strong>DONE!</strong></span>&nbsp;Right after I moved the new file into the CONFIG folder I restarted Puush (program I couldn't run due to the error) and the program started successfully. Hopefully this solution works for everyone
 else.</p>

    <title>Freezing Toshiba Satellite C655 running windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tali10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freezing Toshiba Satellite C655 running windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Toshiba Satellite C655 running windows 7 randomly freezes every 20 minutes or so. I have had to, on occasion, do a hard reboot since ctrl alt del had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the advanced performance tool and it shows a number of programs that are running at start-up. I have the option of preventing them from running, but some seem important. Which ones should be blocked from startup and would doing so prevent freezing?
 My thoughts are it will not help since the speed of startup is not always an issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regularly clear cookies, delete unnecessary data, run disk defrag, etc. - basically use all the tools available to maintain the system. Any help would be appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Lauren</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Which operating system is installed on the computer?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A <strong>MAC (media access control) address </strong>is a unique numeric code that is permanently assigned to each unit of most types of networking hardware, such as network interface cards (NICs), by the manufacturer.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The purpose of MAC addresses is to provide a unique hardware address or physical address for every node on a local area network (LAN) or other network. A node is a point at which a computer or other device (e.g., a printer or router) is connected to the
 network. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sometimes abbreviated as sn or s/n, a <strong>serial number </strong>is a unique number used for identification and inventory purposes. A serial number allows a company to identify a product and get additional information about it, for replacement, or as
 a means of finding compatible parts.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this information helps.</p>

<p>Hmm, odd thing to have disappear.&nbsp; Have you run a virus scan or checked for malware?</p>
<p>The file mouhid.sys is <em>supposed</em> to be in %systemroot%\system32\drivers.&nbsp; You&nbsp;<em>may</em> find a copy of it in %systemroot%\dllcache.&nbsp; If it isn't in ..\drivers and is in ..\dllcache, copy it back to ..\drivers.&nbsp; (You may have to do this in Safe
 Mode.)</p>
<p>Barring the above little bit of luck, there are several ways to get it back.</p>
<p>1. Use msconfig:</p>
<p>&nbsp; Either mount your installation CD-ROM or locate an online copy<br />
&nbsp; From an administrator account, run msconfig (<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpublic.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pdZ81R5jlg40svpjCSdGkUO3FEWUM9tGLLT_Dr2vxk9t6Jo-wvVt3RO8A4q_mOVxMP7_7MF7MbCRGAvPP4cj0aQ%2fwinkey.png" />
 -R, msconfig&lt;enter&gt;)<br />
&nbsp; When "msconfig" opens, select the "General" tab and the click on the "Expand File..." button<br />
&nbsp; (This will open the "Expand One File From Installation Source" window)<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Enter "mouhid.sys" in "File to restore:"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Enter the path to the DRIVER.CAB file in the \i386 directory on your installation media.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; (or browse to it...)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Enter "c:\windows\system32\drivers" in the "Save file in:" entry.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Click "Expand"<br />
&nbsp; "mouhid.sys" is now where ever you told expand to put it....</p>
<p>2. Use the System File Checker (SFC) utility to check for missing file and restore them as necessary.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; You will again need your installation media and, if you've installed Service Packs, the CD-ROM for<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; the latest Service Pack you have installed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; From an administrator account, type: <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpublic.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pdZ81R5jlg40svpjCSdGkUO3FEWUM9tGLLT_Dr2vxk9t6Jo-wvVt3RO8A4q_mOVxMP7_7MF7MbCRGAvPP4cj0aQ%2fwinkey.png" /> -R,sfc
 /scannow&lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>SFC will call for, first, your installation media and then later the service pack CD-ROM.&nbsp; If SFC wants to replace files, let it.&nbsp; If SFC rejects your Service Pack CD-ROM, read Microsoft knowledge base article&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/900910" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB900910</a>
 .&nbsp; Note, this article applies to SP2 but is just as applicable to SP3.&nbsp; Just use common sense and employ SP3 where the article refers to SP2.</p>
<p>If you don't have a Service Pack 3 CD-ROM, either order it (<a href="https://om2.one.microsoft.com/opa/start.om?StoreID=CE6E3AFC-6B25-4F99-8913-3E3453AD966D&amp;LocaleCode=en-us&amp;NewTrans=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">US/Canada</a>

<p>I have 2 folders on my PC that take forever to open. The folders have all types of files from pictures to videos to Microsoft Office files. When I open the folder in Windows

            <p>Hello LD,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is usually attributed to the folder type you have the files in. The folder type is set by default to whatever the first file is, if the first file is an image then the folder will be set as a “pictures” folder. Next time you open the folder, Windows
 will scan the folder for images. The delay is more obvious with large amounts of files.</p>
<p>You can fix this problem by doing the following:</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Go to the folder one level higher than the target folder</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right-click on the folder, and click
<b>Properties</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the <b>Customize</b> tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Set the <b>Optimize this folder for</b> setting to
<b>General items</b></span></p>
<p><span>Opening the folder should be much faster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Universal Serial Bus Controllers Not Found&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am having a strange problem. I formatted my friends&nbsp;desktop and now what<strong>&nbsp; THE USB IS NOT GETTING DETECTED.</strong> I checked the device manager and it did not show the
<strong>Universal Serial Bus Controllers. </strong>How do I get it back.</p>
<p>PS. I checked the BIOS the USB keyboard is working in BIOS. But as windows boots its not working. So now he is using the PS/2 keyboard.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any solution to this would be grateful.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
