<h2>            my computer crashes when I try to connect usb gps receiver</h2>
                    My usb gps receiver works well on vista but crashes the computer on windows 7. I am hoping to use it with Navigator 10.

            <p>OK, here is a couple of threads on the Haicom forum:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.haicom.com.tw/forum_topic.aspx?topicID=56" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.haicom.com.tw/forum_topic.aspx?topicID=56</a></p>

<p>In those threads there is a link to the USB driver for Windows 7.</p>
<p>The same driver can be downloaded from the following link - it is the "USB driver (for Windows 7)":</p>
<p><a href="http://www.haicom.com.tw/support.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.haicom.com.tw/support.aspx</a></p>
<p>This may be the same driver that you previously tried to install that the "computer would not accept".</p>
<p>Try again with the above driver from Haicom.</p>
<p>Disconnect&nbsp; the GPS device and uninstall the old driver first using "Uninstall a &nbsp;program".</p>
<p>Then install the new driver and reconnect the device.</p>
<p>The downloaded driver file is in .zip format so make sure you are extracting the driver installation file and then click on the "PL2303_Prolific_DriverInstaller_v10518.exe" to install the driver.</p>
<p>When the GPS device is connected it apparently shows up in the Device Manager as a "Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port".</p>

<h2>            Zoo Tycoon Friends - &#38;quot&#59;Biodiversity&#38;quot&#59; achievement not unlocking</h2>
                    
<p>Currently, I and others are in a race against time to unlock all the achievements within Zoo Tycoon Friends prior to the server shutdown on April 28th.</p>
<p>The achievement "Biodiversity" states that you need to:&nbsp; Unlock 20 different Star Animal Habitats.&nbsp; After performing the associated task, it has not unlocked on either my Windows Phone or my Windows 8.1 version of the game.&nbsp; Both use the same online 'cloud'
 save, as the game is completely server-based, so I can't roll-back or anything.</p>
<p>Per comments on other forums, the similar achievement "Taming the Herd" is unlocked after 10 different Star Animal Habitats are unlocked, which is immediately after the Giraffes are unlocked.&nbsp; You do not have to build the Giraffes, which is a good thing
 because they require the rare 'GEM' premium resources you can't buy.&nbsp; Thus, after all 20 habitats are unlocked, "Biodiversity" should be granted.</p>
<p>I am currently on Chapter 15.&nbsp; The last Star Animal Habitat, "Wild Horse", was unlocked for building once I completed Chapter 14.&nbsp; This is the last possible Habitat, as unlocking the Habitats is completely linear with no possible diverging from the unlock
 path.&nbsp;After doing so, "Biodiversity" did not&nbsp;unlock.&nbsp; As I thought&nbsp;this might be a case of needing to actually build the Wild Horse&nbsp;Habitat, I spent about 3-4 days farming the&nbsp;1.47&nbsp;MILLION coins required to&nbsp;purchase the plot, then the 3 days or so it took&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Habitat
 to actually build.&nbsp; The build finished today.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I have also gotten two wild horses in said Habitat, which took a few hours.&nbsp; I even grinded more money to complete the mission that includes building the Habitat (specifically, to upgrade area "C"
 after it is built).&nbsp; Nothing has unlocked.</p>
<p>Going by the build and money-grinding times, that would put the original&nbsp;date of supposedly obtaining this achievement around April the 3rd.&nbsp; Why hasn't it unlocked, and what can be done to 'fix' this?</p>

<p>Thank you for the response, Misses Quinzel.</p>
<p>To add to this, I checked out TrueAchievements for information, as it has stat trackings for many users. &nbsp;In particularly, who they've identified as winning certain achievements, and on what dates. &nbsp;It may not be 100% complete, but it's probably a good indicator
 of when it has been earned.</p>
<p>WP8 version: &nbsp;Last earned by someone on March 9th, 2015. &nbsp;Previous dates were the 6th and 4th of March.</p>
<p>Win8 version: &nbsp;Last earned by someone on March 22nd, 2015. &nbsp;Some previous dates include the 12th, 9th, 8th, and 4th of March.</p>

<p>Any update at all? &nbsp;This thread hasn't been updated, and servers are set to go down in only a few days.</p>
<p>I've already had a scare where my Tablet (a HP Stream 8) went kaput in less than 4 months use. &nbsp;Took a whole week to get a new one shipped, which meant a BUNCH of days without being able to earn diamonds for speedups/upgrades, and the fear that delisting
 would prevent me from reinstalling the game on my replacement tablet.</p>
<p>I've gotten everything else, and I have my Wild Horses (used to get the 200K visitors achievement), which is also the last Star Animal Habitat unlocked. &nbsp;What is missing, for me to 100% this game?</p>

<h2>            Surface 3 Camera App Appear Black</h2>
                    <p>Today, I decided to take a picture using my Surface 3 Camera App, but when the app opens, it just appears black. All the functions are there, but I can't tell whether they're responsive or not. The light of the front camera also lights up, but I can't see
 the image appearing in the app. I've tried restarting, hard restart, and updating the driver as well as uninstalling it and reinstalling it through Device Manager. But nothing seems to be working. How can I fix this?</p>

<h2>            Western Digital My Passport X suddenly stops working</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; So I have the external hard drive listed above, and it just stopped working all of a sudden.&nbsp; Like I was literally using it yesterday afternoon, and today, the drive isn't recognized.&nbsp; The drive itself seems to be working fine (I can detect it by plugging in to a PC), but none of the three ports seem to totally recognize the external drive.&nbsp; I say that because going by the light flashes, it seems to be working, but the OS just won't read from it anymore.&nbsp; Aside from assuming the hard drive crashed (which I don't think is the case, since again, the PC recognized it), is there anything else I can try?&nbsp; I have a LOT of data on that drive (mostly Rock Band 4 songs), and I don't think it'll all fit on the internal drive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fault offset is a really brutal way to try to figure out where the crash is, but those would be the two lead thoughts given that crash region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If neither of those guesses is correct, putting up the actual DMP from the crash might be quite helpful.</p>

            <p>I don't know how, and this doesn't seem to be the same error, however it looks like it's the same behaviour auto re-fresh in Windows Explorer, Many users have asked Microsoft to take this feature out, and if there are/or going to be any new updates for Windows,
 I believe this should be one, because you could be working and the explorer randomly crashes it can also lead to work being lost, or the os stop responding, I have recently installed AMD'S, New Windows Beta Driver, Windows is faster, much much better, however
 the driver is causing this issue. The last driver caused the same issue.</p>

            That's correct it's an fault with AMD's graphic drivers, and that link you've given, I have tried this driver it's for window 8, and it didn't work much.

<h3> ladysayeh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Avatar App wont load on my profile, works on all other profiles...even wont load on PC</h2>
                    <p>I'm at my wits end with this....i haven't been able to load the avatar app since November. All it does its load for about 3 minutes then tell me it couldn't load my avatar, that something went wrong. I've tried to google options and haven't gotten anywhere.
 I've power cycled my system, I've uninstalled/reinstalled the app, i moved where it was stored, i soft/factory reset my Xbox...heck i even bought a new box in November....but it still won't load...its just my profile what else can i do...besides deleting everything
 because that would take forever to re-download and I won't do that for just one app that isn't working.</p>

</p><p>first time I have heard this one, are you using the "old" avatar of the new one? can you get into the application at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know some of the older items are not compatible with the new avatar frames. If you can get into the app, have you tried to make a new one?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I get any luck or other suggestions, I will post it here for you, if you manage a fix, could you let me know in here, so if I see it again I can help other.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello LadySayeh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums. We understand how it can be frustrating when your profile will not load your avatar so that you may edit it. There is an option to
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/avatareditor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">edit the avatar</a> through our website. We suggest making a change to your avatar through the link we provided. If you are able to edit the avatar through our website, we recommend
 power cycling your console and loading the Xbox Avatar Editor App. Be sure to let us know the results!</p>

            Im having simular issues, only thing I can suggest is maybe deleting your profile and starting again, having backed up your data so you keep all of your gamerscore and achievements.

    <title>Xbox360 Slim RDOD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eeisner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox360 Slim RDOD</h2>
                    
<p>Alrighty.... Last August I bought a refurbished XBOX Slim 4GB from gamestop. Had no problems with it until I drove it to school out in Arizona, where for the past 8ish months I've been getting a red dot randomly. Wasnt too bad of an issue until recently,
 where now I can't get through a full game on NBA/MLB 2K. So here's essentially what happens....</p>
<ul>
<li>Game starts, load season or start quick game. no problems </li><li>playing game, in MLB get to 7-9th inning no problem. In NBA, get to 3rd or 4th quarter no problems
</li><li>Most of the time, the systems fan will speed up and get decently loud. This tends to be the warning because right after, the screen goes black and I get a solid red dot. However, sometimes I will get the red dot without the heavy fan. That is much more
 rare </li><li>have to wait a while before I start my next game, because although the console is not hot, it will tend to red dot pretty fast if I boot it up again right away
</li></ul>
<div>I've read multiple things that can cause the red dot. First I've read that there is an issue with the hard drive. I DO NOT have a hard drive. Never have in this console. I've read that it could be a dying power brick. The light remains orange when on which
 I believe is normal. Lastly, I've read that there could be an issue with the A/V on the XBOX. I've tried both HDMI and standard, and both lead to a red dot. I read that it could be an internal issue tha has to do with the soldering of the A/V ports coming
 out, but thats against these forums rules to discuss so I'll forget about that for now.&nbsp;</div>

<div>I assumed something got messed up internally in my car on the 8 hour drive... obviously heat and electronics dont go well together.&nbsp;I have tried leaving the console horizontal and vertical, but that going vertical only fixed my problems for a small period
 of time. I could leave the console on for hours and hours and have no issues. That lasted a couple months before the red dot returned.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Anyone have similar issues? Am I way overthinking this and its just a dust issue or a dead power supply, or is my XBOX f-d and I gotta deal till the next XBOX is released?</div>

                </div>

            <p>Hey there Camo512! From what it sounds like is the console is overheating and has shut down to protect itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this being a refurb console from Game Stop, more than likely it has been opened by there 3rd party refurb company and will not be able to be repaired by Microsoft as the warranty sticker has more than likely been broken. On the off chance it has not been opened, you may be able to request a repair by filling out a repair order <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/en-US/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. You will first need to register your console by scrolling to the bottom of the repair page and selecting "Register a Product".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would personally take it back to the Game Stop if you are able to, and see if they will replace your Console with a working unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>

<p>yea sadly i'm way past the 30 days gamestop gives as a warranty. gotta open up the console to check the warranty sticker, right?</p>
<p>i thought the slim was supposed to prevent overheating? if thats the case, something really got messed up in there.

            <p>NO. Don't open the console under any circumstances. The warranty sticker on the 360 S is right next to where you plug in the power brick on the back of the console, it should be black and white and say Xbox 360.</p>

<h2>            Surface pro 3 not charging to 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>While it is normal few days ago, after I installed update to 15063.138. I found that the battery meter is very inaccurate.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday my battery drop directly from 70% to 7%, and today, when I boot up my surface, I found the battery charging topped at 80%.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I use it without charging until run out of battery, I found that I can use it for about 4.5hrs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now I charge my surface again, and it topped at 62%, stating "plugged in, not charging".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to figure out whether it is a hardware or software problem, does anyone experienced this?</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>

<p>Thank you for your answer, it will try it.</p>
<p>Does it mean that I use my sp3 without charging until run out of battery, and charge it again until full?</p>
<p>Does it need to be consecutive or just let it use normally?</p>

    <title>Freezing after reading black book - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bearswithme  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freezing after reading black book</h2>
                    
<p>I've had trouble with the game freezing since I installed Dragonborn. I finally cleared my cache and &nbsp;uninstalled it and re-installed, and it works better other than an occasional freeze. But last night I got the black book in the dwarven ruin, read it,
 and froze up. I reloaded twice, and the autosave it made in apocrypyha was corrupted. Does anyone have a solution other than re-installing the mod again? That will probably be a game breaker for me. Would something as simple as turning off autosave work? I'm
 used to bugged, broken products from Bioware, but I've never had this problem with Bethesda.</p>

<p>Turn off the autosave. Pick back up at an earlier point in your game and try again. Autosave has corrupted more of my game than anything else. I turned it off ages ago. Those Black Books do cause weird things but I have read 7 of them now without any freezes.
 Skyrim in particular has not been very good to me either but I have over 750 hrs on one character so it is possible.</p>

<p>If turning off autosave doesn't work try doing some system maintenance and reduce to amount of saves you have 15 max I would try to keep it below 5 this has stopped many freezing issues for me when I couldn't walk into my own home with out freezing.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when the feature doesn’t work how it is supposed to, we will look
 into this for you. I suggest you to refer the section <strong>Troubleshooting verification code issues
</strong>in the article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-verification-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try using other options to request the verification code i.e. requesting the code over a call
 or through email and see if you are receiving the code. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please reply with the status of the issue, we will be glad to help you further.</span></p>

<div>How is it okay that you take one month before I can try again., especially when trying again is not guaranteed to resolve the problem happening again - the problem being that your software isn't working properly and not sending the verification code to
 my phone - thereby I am not able to set up my account correctly and securely</div>

</p><p>I have tried again to send a notification through MIcrosoft's online form but it does not allow me to enter the full details of the problem and it insists that I enter certain data when I don't know where the problem is.&nbsp; WHat a load of rubbish.</p>

<p>I haven't made a change to my security information, I would have liked to have made a change but your system has refused to ALLOW ME.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This thread is meant to resolve this problem, I am not sure why you expect me to set up another one, as I would only be providing you with the same information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You seem to be suggesting that Microsoft seems to think that I have made a change to my security information and therefore I am unable to get a CALL verification code if I want to make any changes and need to wait for another 30 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will see if I get the option to (actually ) make the changes that I was planning on making in the first place.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 doesn&#39;t recognize my DVD drive...</h2>
                    My DVD drive worked in Windows 7,works in BIOS,but doesn't appear in Windows 10 at all. It's not even shows in Device manager. If this can't be solved I'm rolling back to Windows 7.

            <p>I did solve this problem, but it involved going into the registry and deleting the entries for the value for LowerFilters and UpperFilters completely then rebooting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The entry was at <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e965-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}</strong></p>

            <p>I can, yes. Note that this is a suggested repair for an "Error 19" message, there are no guarantees and I take no responsibility for anything that may happen to your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK...first print out the instructions in case you get lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is for Windows 10, but should work for Windows 8.1 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the little Windows icon in the lower left hand corner of the screen. Right mouse click and choose "run".</p>
<p>
</p><p>A dialogue box opens up. Inside the dialogue box type, "regedit" (without the inverted commas).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A box opens up and asks you if you really intend to do this. Click 'yes'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A box opens up called "Registry Editor". This is what you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, take a copy of your registry. Go to "File", then "Export".&nbsp; Create a copy of your registry in a place and with a name you will remember. You may wish to write this name and place down. Exporting the registry will take a little while, so don't panic
 if it's not instant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have done this, start looking down in your registry. Go to <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
</strong>and choose that. </p>
<p>Then go to <strong>SYSTEM</strong>, and choose that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to <strong>CurrentControlSet</strong> and choose that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to <strong>Control</strong> and choose that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to <strong>Class</strong> and choose that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you have to find an entry which reads <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
exactly</span> <strong>{4d36e965-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318} </strong>and choose that.
<p>
</p><p>Once you have chosen that, there should be entries (values) called <strong>LowerFilters</strong> and
<strong>UpperFilters</strong>. It doesn't matter what they are, delete them both. If only one exists, delete that. You will be asked to confirm deletion, but do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save your registry and then reboot. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it worked properly, you should find that your DVD drive comes back on reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no guarantees here, but this worked for me when nothing else did. </p>

<p>Very disappointed in the way the "non-recognition by Windows 10 of dvd issue" is being handled by Microsoft. &nbsp;This does seem to be an O.S. design error. &nbsp;If so then Microsoft should go all out to provide users of the system with a quick fix. &nbsp;I was trying
 to load Turbo Tax so I could get my taxes started. &nbsp;I have wasted about 4 hours on this problem and still don't have a fix. &nbsp;Additionally I got caught up in the ongoing scan scams......."let us scan your computer for free", &nbsp;uh, huh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I repeat the one gentleman's previous question "Why didn't Microsoft handle this register problem with an update?"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been going with Microsoft since DOS. &nbsp;I should never have gone for the Microsoft 10 program until the bugs were mostly taken care of. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Here is&nbsp;a solution that worked for my&nbsp;two computers running Windows 10, after upgrading, dvd not working or showing up at all in Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to another person who posted it on another forum. I cannot remember who, but indebted to him.</p>
<p>(DVD drive must show up in Bios to get to work.&nbsp; If it is not there, Windows will not find it &amp; won't work.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Open Control Panel-locate Device Manager &amp; click, once-to open.</p>
<p>Step 2: Find IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers in the list &amp; click-twice to open.</p>
<p>Step 3:&nbsp; Six devices will show up. They are:</p>
<p>ATA Channel 0 &nbsp;&amp; Channel 0&nbsp; (two devices total)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To be removed)</p>
<p>ATA Channel 1 &amp; Channel 1&nbsp;&nbsp; (two devices total)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To be removed)</p>
<p>Two PCI controllers, (bottom 2 devices) Leave&nbsp;those 2&nbsp;along. (Don't remove)</p>
<p>To remove the 4 devices-Click "Drivers" of these 4 ATA&nbsp;devices and "Click" remove devices&nbsp;from computer.
</p>
<p>Restart computer, Windows 10 should&nbsp;then find&nbsp;the&nbsp;4 you removed and your DVD drive, too.
</p>
<p>Don't restart until you have removed all 4. Windows will ask to restart after one of them is removed,</p>
<p>wait until all 4 are removed, then reboot, otherwise you will be stuck in a loop. Your DVD drive</p>
<p>should now show up in Device Manager as working-along with those 4 you removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked for me &amp; I am retired &amp; 73 years old-so I am not responsible if you destroy your computer.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

            <p>Hey Jerome,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would help if you could answer these questions to understand the issue.</p>
<p>- When exactly do you get this error? Is it while booting the computer or while opening Google Chrome?</p>
<p>- Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these steps and let us know the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open Task Manager and check in the processes tab if there are many instances of Google Chrome running in the background. If there are, then select it and then click on End process.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/open-task-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/open-task-manager</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Uninstall Google Chrome from the computer using the Microsoft Fixit.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/program_install_and_uninstall?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/program_install_and_uninstall?wa=wsignin1.0</a>
</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Download and Run the fixit.</p>
<p>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When it asks, select the option: Detect Problems and apply the fixes for me (Recommended).</p>
<p>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click Next.</p>
<p>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Select the Option: Uninstalling.</p>
<p>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In open list, choose Google Chrome and click Next to uninstall.</p>
<p>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once done, restart the system and then try to install Google Chrome and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, then provide us the event viewer details tracked when the error message occurs.</p>

<h2>            Password issues</h2>
                    I am attempting to upgrade to Windows 10, but seem to be having a problem with administrator passwords.&nbsp; I keep getting the question box "Do you want to allow the following program to make changes to your computer?"<br />
<br />
It will name two different programs and asks for an "administrator password".&nbsp; There is no place to enter the password and the "yes" button is grayed out, with only the "no" button active.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I have never set an administrator password on this computer since it's purchase new in 2014.<br />
<br />
What can I do?&nbsp; It won't even run my System Backup disc or the ASUS Repair disc.

            This situation comes about if the last-remaining administrator-level user account got removed or disabled for some reason. &nbsp;There's lots of good guides online about this, but here's one good one:&nbsp;<a href="http://techgage.com/news/uac_pop-up_with_no_password_box/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techgage.com/news/uac_pop-up_with_no_password_box/</a>

    <title>BSOD on Windows 10 1903 build, Error code&#58; CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darksould04  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD on Windows 10 1903 build, Error code&#58; CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED and Unexpected store exception.</h2>
                    <p>So.. yeah, this is a bit of a though one cause there arent any dump files to scan (i'll explain later why)</p>
<p>
</p><p>CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED is the code</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all happened when i woke up my pc from sleeping mode. I got the "unexpected store exception" bluescreen, i thought nothing to myself and thought it just messed up something and it would work after a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well then everytime i got a critical process died bsod either when i open google chrome, updated my pc, moved something via windows explorer or just leave the pc on for like, 10 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, i did try to install the new update for 1903 for fixing problems, but the update would hang and then the bsod would come.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting the PC is a no go for me as even if i'd check the "keep my files" box, alot of files would just vanish...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All recently installed drivers and stuff are uninstalled, google chrome uninstaller does a bsod, i tried doing chkdsk, i tried doing the sfc/scannow.. no errors, all non microsoft services off, safe mode has the same problem, i did DISM.. again.. didnt work.
 Wifi driver uninstalled, doesnt work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think its important to note that the bsod occours when i wanna delete the chrome folder in local appdata, too, something might be glitched there, cant even delete it through my windows install disk, it doesnt bsod, but the file is just still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no dump files because the PC disconnects my SSD when it bluescreens, but only for those bluescreens. Its very odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have 3 ram-sticks, 2 of them are 2 gigabytes and 1 of them is 4 gigabytes, never had issues, and tried to run the PC with only 1 of every ram stick, only the 2x2 gb, only the 1x4 gb, tried other combinations, ran memory test, no errors, still bsod..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware:</p>
<p>Asus M4a88t-v evo\usb3 motherboard with an amd phenom X II 1055T Processor, 2.8ghz, overclocked to 3.1 ghz, 8gb ddr3 ram (2x2Gb, 1x4Gb), gigabyte GeForce GTX 470 tripple fan, 60gb SSD, 680gb HDD, 600watts power suply from corsair, soundblaster fx soundcard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is a very tricky one but any help would be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hello Akshay,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, even </p>
<p>without the external devices it still crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i said, safe mode crashes too, dism was successful but the bsod still appears. Same with sfc, no problems found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forgot to mention that disabling fast startup was actually what caused this issue, enabling it though didnt fixed it, disabling again didnt fix it, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out that my bios needs to be updated though, maybe that can fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be back after a bios update.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything that you have tried and a bit more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried disabling virtual settings and hypertheading in BIOS as they can cause issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing processor power options as I thought it could be the battery not rationing enough power out to the processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm all out of ideas of what the issue could be. If it was a hardware issue, the computer wouldn't turn on... right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is driving me mad at this point. I will continue investigation and update if I find some form of solution.</p>
