Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and giving an opportunity to assist you.</div>

From the description, it looks like you are unable to send and delete emails. You also don’t receive new emails.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

I would like to ask some questions on this issue in context to this issue:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<br />
1) Is it a web based or client based mail provider?<br />
2) With which app are you having issues on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Disconnect from the Internet and then go to the outbox and see if you can delete it then.&nbsp; Or reboot and stay disconnected and then see if you can delete it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might also consider accessing mail via webmail if you have that option, as the Win8 mail App has several issues such as the one you are experiencing, and it is an extremely limited email "program".</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, couldn't find your post yesterday and have just come across it today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note though the Bennet has answered most of your questions already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have to disagree with him regarding point #7 onwards (<em>Sorry Bennet, but having run a System Image recovery myself recently, I can attest to the procedure you describe as being incorrect</em>).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To restore to a System Image, proceed as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hit Windows key + i to open the extended Charms menu and click "Change PC Settings".</li><li>In the menu which appears, click "Update and Recovery" and then click "Recovery" in the submenu.</li><li>Click "Restart Now" in the menu at the bottom which I've ringed in red in the screenshot.</li></ol>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f0733e3c-39c5-49ca-b8f9-b04e1c672a42" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>When the machine restarts, you'll get a number of options on a plain blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click "Troubleshooting" to take you to the next menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click "Advanced Options" to go to the following menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click "Restore from a System Image" to start the Recovery process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type your Administrator password and click Next. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The rest of the procedure is more or less automatic and the Recovery process will detect System Image and restore to that after which the machine will restart and you'll see the familiar Lock Screen again.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Michael,</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>The old system restore points are not deleted as a new restore point is created. The old system restore points are deleted when the disk space allotted to restore points is reached. Generally 3-5% of disk space is allotted to each disk
 for restore points. If you have more disk space, you can allow more disk space as you desire for restore points. It is not mandatory to keep the disk space slider to maximum.</span></li><li><span>For which purpose are you planning to use the EHD? If you are planning to use the external HD as a storage device, then yes, you can use the models you have mentioned earlier. However before purchasing, I would recommend checking the
 EHD features in manufacturer’s website to make sure that it is compatible with Windows 8.1.</span></li><li><span>A recovery partition will contain only the Windows system files. So if you use a recovery partition, you will be able to only set the system back to its factory settings. The system image is an exact copy of the drives when the system
 image was created. It includes all personal files, settings saved in the drives. So you can create a system image or recovery partition based on your needs.</span></li><li><span>Yes, you are right. You can create a system image by clicking on the ‘System image backup’ link at the left bottom of File history settings.</span></li><li><span>File history constantly creates a backup of included location when any changes are made. So it is advisable to use an EHD rather than a pendrive, so that there won’t be any space constraints. It is recommended to leave the EHD connected
 all times so that a backup would be created when you make any changes.</span></li><li><span>Like I said earlier, a system image is an exact copy of the drive including all files. So any new files or changes made after the last system image backup would be not available in the last image backup. So, if you are creating a system
 image backup, it is recommended to make a new system image backup at regular intervals to keep the backup data up to date.</span></li><li><span>To restore from a system image backup, you need to boot from the system image disc to enter the Windows recovery environment. You can refer to these steps:</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be F12.
</span></li><li><span>The boot menu key might differ with each manufacturer. If you are unable to find the boot menu key, you may refer the user manual.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer, when the manufacturer's logo is displayed, keep pressing the Boot menu option key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to CD\DVD ROM.
</span></li><li><span>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.
</span></li><li><span>Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </span></li><li><span>Click Repair your computer in the lower left corner </span>
</li><li><span>Click on Troubleshooting, advanced option and then click System image recovery.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span>I have also included some good articles on these backup features which you can go through for more information:</span></p>

<h2>            Device is Unknown &#40;Link in Compliance Mode&#41;</h2>
                    I have a Garmin device with Garmin Express installed. Four USB 3.0 ports have been tried, but none recognize this device. It never shows on the USB list (Safely remove and eject media). This time I looked in Devices and Printers and saw this (last device
 in Unspecified).&nbsp; What is Link in Compliance Mode? The troubleshooter only states unknown problem (LiCM). What can I do besides use another PC?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5e91642-4644-4ef5-b3ed-ba5d30c6201a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5e91642-4644-4ef5-b3ed-ba5d30c6201a?upload=true" /></a>

            I finally got the Garmin to connect . I plugged it in before starting Garmin Express it disconnected, reconnected, then disconnected. I fiddled with both ends of the cable and it connected! It's just really finicky /flaky. Thanks for all your help.&nbsp;

    <title>Computer constantly locking up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> voco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer constantly locking up</h2>
                    
<p>After hours of searching the internet I have given up and decided to ask. I got my computer custom built by a shop a few months ago and have been having the same problem the whole time. My computer will lock up completely and I will have to hard reset to
 use it again. After my computer has been off for a few hours it can take up to 6 or 7 resets before it starts up properly. After that it seems to run for abit then will lock up every so often.</p>
<p>When I say lock up I mean that everything on the screen will freeze and i can't do anything. This means I cant move my mouse or type or anything else and the only way to stop it is by resetting my computer.</p>
<p>Now for the weird part. I have found a way to stop my computer locking up when I get the chance. My computer will NOT lock up whenever I am playing a song, watching a video or playing a game. This is how I use my pc. However it takes a few resets before
 I can even open a song, which I then run in the background on mute. Another thing I have just found out is that it won't lock up while playing a song when my speakers are set to the default sound output. However if I set my usb headset as the output for audio
 my computer will lock up like normal.</p>
<p>Any help will be great because I am sick and tired of having to reset my computer so much. Hopefully someone can help me fix it.</p>

            It is ridiculous that you would have to go through all that. Take it back to the shop and insist that they either fix the computer so it works properly or give you your money back. It could be bad hardware (doesn't matter that it's new) or software (drivers)
 or some weird combination. The main point is that the computer is *new* and it should have worked perfectly from the get-go.

            I have taken it in 2 times already and they say it isn't damaged hardware. The 2nd time they charged me $65 to look at it.They said my antivirus was clashing with spybot, so they removed spybot. When I got it home it froze straight away. They are a good
 shop but they aren't much help :S

            It may not be damaged hardware - it could be faulty hardware (splitting hairs). &nbsp;Does the CAPS lock key work, when the system is froze? (Can you use it to toggle the indicator light?)

            I haven't tried the CAPS lock key when it has frozen, but next time it locks up I'll have a try. However sometimes the light on my backlit keyboard will go out as soon as my computer locks up. Things such as the clock will even freeze on the time it froze
 and the computer will go completely silent except for the sound of the fan.

            Is there no warranty? If yes, then exercise it firmly and get your money back. If not, then tell the shop you will take them to Small Claims Court (or your equivalent if you're not in the U.S.) because the computer has never worked right and you no longer
 care why, you just want your money back. Then buy a computer elsewhere. Different people will give you varying opinions, but my partner and I buy Dells for our clients and have been satisfied with them. There is really nothing anyone can do from here. If you
 feel you need more ammunition (and I personally don't think you do), spend the money and have a different and reputable shop do the diagnostics and give you a written report.

</p><p>Upon checking the Skype account linked to your community profile, we found out that you have multiple Skype accounts. The possible reason why you are not able to make any calls is that the subscription is linked to a different account. In this case, you

                    I am attempting to use remote support included in W7 to assist a user that has a DSL modem.&nbsp; The person can send the request for help to me fine, but when I attempt to connect to his computer, I am unable to.&nbsp; When I examine the file that comes in the
 email, I see it is using a private IP address, and not his real address.&nbsp; How do I overcome this so I can successfully start a remote assistance session?&nbsp; Since my own systems are on a private network in my house, it becomes confusing at best.&nbsp;

            Hi <strong>R_f_m</strong>,<br />
<br />
<strong>Note this issue might occur if the below criteria are not met</strong>.<br />
<br />
a. Both computers aren't running Windows 7. In order to use Easy Connect with Remote Assistance, both of the computers must be running Windows 7.<br />
b. Access to the Internet is limited. If access to the Internet is limited on either computer, Easy Connect is disabled. Internet access might be limited if you’re on a corporate network.<br />
c. Your router doesn't support Easy Connect. Easy Connect uses the Peer Name Resolution Protocol to transfer the Remote Assistance invitation over the Internet. You can check your router by using the Internet Connectivity Evaluation Tool on the Microsoft website.
 If you're running Windows Server, you need to install the Peer Name Resolution Protocol.<br />
<strong><br />
Method 1:</strong><br />
<br />
Let us try to disable the antivirus/firewall and check if it is working. If it works, please contact the security program manufacturer for further assistance.<br />
Note: Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software’s after completing the troubleshooting and identifying the issue.<br />
<strong><br />
Method 2:</strong><br />
<br />
Check for the compatibility of your router with Windows 7, to do that you need to follow the<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why an update fails can be due to corrupted Windows Update components. Running the Windows Update Troubleshooter will help us determine if there are corrupted components connected with the Windows Update. To download the troubleshooter,
 click this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/512a5183-ffab-40c5-8a68-021e32467565/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows Update Troubleshooter">link</a></strong> and select the appropriate
 operating system. After running the troubleshooter, run Windows Update again and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results of the Windows Update Troubleshooter.</p>

<p>Hi NeilDK,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Windows.<br />
<br />
I will suggest you to remove GLB*.TMP listed in the notification area. You may click the icon in the notification area that you want to remove.<br />
<br />
For more information on adding and deleting a file or icon notification area, you may visit the link mentioned below.<br />
<br />
<strong>Change how icons appear in the notification area of the taskbar</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
I will also suggest you to run online scan to remove any malware or spywares from the system. To do this, visit the following link and run the scan:<br />

<h2>            I&#39;m sorry</h2>
                    <p>The case review i sent wasn't what i meant to say i meant to say that i would avoid using inappropriate communication with anyone so i could continue to play with my friend's , and other people that requires teamwork or more players. I hope that this changes my recent case review and that sorry for my past activities and that i get to talk to my friends tomorrow so i can do the raid or shorten the time. I was going to reply to the message Xbox sent me but i couldn't because of the ban. Anyway i hope that&nbsp; you read this and reply to Source Energy z if not , unban so i can talk to my friends , or shorten.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

    <title>Multiple BSODs on a fresh installation of Windows... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple BSODs on a fresh installation of Windows...</h2>
                    <p>This is a last ditch effort. I've contacted Microsoft and they remoted in and tried fixing it. Nothing is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few of the BSODs I've had:</p>
<ul>
<li>MEMORY_MANAGEMENT <em>(multiple mentions</em><em>)</em></li><li>IRQL_GT_ZERO_AT_SYSTEM_SERVICE</li><li>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</li><li><em>(blank... occured when I was afk)</em></li><li>SPECIAL_POOL_DETECTED_MEMORY_CORRUPTION</li><li>DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION</li><li>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>sfc /scannow</span></li><li>Windows memory diagnostic test
<ul>
<li>once with both sticks, and then once with each stick individually</li></ul>
</li><li>memtest86</li><li>disabling XMB</li><li>enabling XMB</li><li>updating BIOS, updating Windows, and updating all drivers (again)</li><li>contacting Microsoft Support
<ul>
<li>They remoted in, determined it was my GPU driver, updated all of my drivers with DriverPack, gave me an in-place upgrade (re-installed Windows)</li></ul>
</li><li>running Driver Verifier
<ul>
<li>BSOD upon startup (minidump attached), had to go back to a restore point</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>NOTHING WORKED. :( All scans come back clean and all of the error codes are different. I'm not sure what triggers them because they seem to be random. They even come when I am away from the computer and nothing is running. Please help!</p>
<p>

<p>3) wmic memorychip get banklabel, manufacturer, partnumber, speed, MemoryType, devicelocator</p>
<p>4) When these have completed &gt; right click on the top bar or title bar of the administrative command prompt box &gt; left click on edit then select all &gt; right click on the top bar again &gt; left click on edit then copy &gt; paste into the thread<br />

<p>https://www.memtest.org/</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) If the RAM is DDR4 then Run Memtest86 version 8.0 for 8 or more passes</p>
<p>https://www.memtest86.com/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Testing is not done by time but is done by passes.</p>
<p>The more the passes the better the testing environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A false negative is a test pass when there is malfunctioning RAM.</p>
<p>The incidence of false negatives can be high when fewer than 8 passes are made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier in the thread version 4.3.7 was used instead of version 5.01</p>
<p>And earlier in the thread only 5 passes were made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sometimes takes passes into the 20's to find malfunctioning RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Testing must be continuous.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of the testing can be performed overnight</p>
<p>
</p><p>Testing time is approximately 1 -2 hours / GB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer had 16 GB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the motherboard has multichannel capability testing both RAM modules simultaneously can test this feature of the tested DIMMs.</p>
<p>If the RAM modules are tested one at a time the RAM modules can be tested but there will not be any multichannel testing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just one error is a test fail and testing can be aborted.</p>
<p>Then test one RAM module at a time in the same DIMM for 8 or more passes to differentiate good from Malfunctioning RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) For all RAM testing please make sure pictures are taken with a camera or smartphone camera and images are posted into the thread.</p>

            Hi SavEm.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Install CoreTemp and monitor temps from System tray, set an alarm and have it Sleep if it reaches Max temp:  <a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/core-temp-monitor-cpu-temperature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/core-temp-monito...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 10 standard image licensing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluewwol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 standard image licensing</h2>
                    <p>I am so confused by windows licensing and am looking for some guidance on how to proceed without creating a problem for myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently we have a small number of systems that are all the same hardware and were purchased with windows 10 home edition installed.&nbsp; We have spent a good deal of time customizing the windows environment.&nbsp; In the coming months we will be adding 10 to 20
 of these systems a month, and I would like to create standard image with Clonezilla or Ghost in order to streamline this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current understanding is I can not simply create an image of one of my current systems and use that image, however I have not been able to locate a concise explanation of what I need to accomplish my task in a legitimate and cost effective manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance in this regard would be much appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Movie Maker &#47; Windows Essentials in unknown language, can&#39;t change</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I went to launch Windows Movie Maker, and it launched in a language which looks kinda Russian, but I'm not sure it is. I tried to launch langselector, and that launched Windows Essentials 2012 in the same language. I haven't the faintest idea on how
 to fix it - a quick search showed to launch langselector and choose English, but just remains the same. Here is a screen shot....</p>

</p><p>OS is Windows 10, language for everything else is English (UK), and everything else works fine.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here is the window it displays when it has finished installing, and I clicked on the right hand button as it was highlighted, I take it that is the correct one to click?</p>
