<h2>            Where can I report&#47;send an obvious phishing&#47;scam email&#63;</h2>
                    I received an email asking to update my info for PayPal.,.<br />
I was immediately suspicious so I checked PayPal directly and saw the problem..<br />
I would like to report this before this type of email does damage to someone....<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

            <b>This solution article provides information on how to report abuse and SPAM in Windows Live Hotmail.<br />
<br />
To report spam or unsolicited emails:</b><br />
<br />
* Windows Live Hotmail customers should click the "Junk" button to report Spam.<br />
<br />
* Non-Windows Live Hotmail customers should address an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Depending on the originating mail domain: hotmail or msn or live). Attach a copy of the spam email to this email and send it.
 If we do not receive a copy of the email as an attachment our ability to take action against the spamming account is severely impacted.<br />
<br />
* We ask for a full copy of the email so that we have conclusive evidence showing from which Windows Live Hotmail account the SPAM was sent. It is possible that the email address was spoofed, and we don't want to mistakenly close a non-spamming account.<br />
<br />
To report abuse:<br />
<br />
* Customers who wish to report abuse about harassment, impersonation, child exploitation, child pornography etc, received from a Windows Live Hotmail account should send their complaint to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with all the pertaining information.<br />
<br />
* If you are being threatened please call your local law enforcement.<br />
<br />
* If you wish to report abuse against a non Windows Live Hotmail account, please send the complaint to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** , where xxxxxx.com is the text that appears after the "@" symbol in the sender's e-mail address. For example, if the unwanted email came
 from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** then report the email message to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. You can also use the site http://abuse.net to identify the correct abuse reporting address.<br />
<br />
* In addition to these ways of reporting Spam you can also click the "Report Spam," button in your email program.

<h2>            Unable to open the website www.FreEPOC.org</h2>
                    FreEPOC.org used to be a website for downloading free Psion 5mx programs. I have tried to access the website on Google Chrome and Edge with pop-up blockers, ad blockers and cookie blockers all disabled but all I get is the FreEPOC logo on the tab but a
 completely blank page. I have tried entering the URL directly and clicking on search results with the same result. Is FreEPOC.org still active? Can you help me figure out what I may be doing wrong? Thanks.

<h2>            No video only sound.</h2>
                    <p>Trying to play back my old videos (Mpegs) and I am only getting sound. Not on all of my Mpegs though. Some of them are decades old but ones that wont open are 4-5 years old but all made at about the same time.
</p>
<p>I was wondering if its a codec thing as I am one of those 'Home Insider Previewers' running on build 10166. Maybe when the buids were installed with Windows 10 that a codec has been removed for that Mpeg.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my assumption as to why this happens... I have had this issue as well...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Media Center has been removed from Win 8 as a default, and Win 10 completely...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems as though Media Player had previously been using codecs furnished by the Media Center... Since it's gone, so are the codecs...</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a machine that was upgraded from Win 7 Pro, I can play the .mpg\.mpeg files...</p>
<p>On the same machine that is a clean install of Win 10, I can not..</p>
<p>
</p><p>VLC is a good free player, but it is another application to add...</p>
<p>Another option is to add K-Lite Basic Codec Pack at it's default settings...</p>
<p>The company that provides this also provides Media Player Classic for free...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had any junk of any type appear on my machine from using any of them...</p>
<p>Just make sure if there are any optional "trials" along with the installer that you uncheck them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may find in the future that you may need one of the players or codec pack anyway, should you want to playback any .flv flash video...</p>

            You may purchase a license for Office through HUP exactly once per version.&nbsp; Since the original Office Home and Student license was not purchased through the HUP program, you are entitled to purchase&nbsp;a Pro Plus license through that program, provided you
 fit the other Home Use Program criteria.&nbsp; That is, you must be currently employed with a company participating in the Software Assurance program and you cannot have previously purchased a license through the HUP program for the same version of Office (either
 Windows or Mac) being currently offered

            I think you misread the original post.&nbsp; Since Office Home and Student is not offered through the HUP program, it cannot affect the OP's ability to purchase a license through the HUP program.

<h2>            where is the toolbox and why is it important&#63;</h2>
                    You are very keen to keep information to yourselves.(So it seems) In Microsoft Word basics Tutorial you mention the 'Toolbox' several times, yet it never appears in the Pdf file that conducts the tutorial, nor in the WordFile.<br />
<br />
Please explain.<br />

            The <b>Toolbox</b> in Word 2004 can be accessed in either of 4 ways:<br />
<ul>
<li>By clicking the button with the <i>red toolbox icon</i> ﻿on the <b>Standard Toolbar</b>, or</li><li>By going to <b>View&gt; Toolbox</b> in the main menu, or</li><li>By assigning a custom keyboard shortcut to the <b>ToggleOfficeToolbox</b> command, or</li><li>By selecting 1 of its 4 panes from the <b>Tools</b> menu.</li></ul>
The Word 2004 Toolbox appears as a floating palette &amp; comprises 4 panes:<br />
<ol>
<li>The <b>Scrapbook</b> pane</li><li>The <b>Reference Tools</b> pane (includes Dictionary, Thesaurus &amp; Encyclopedia)<br />
</li><li>The <b>Compatibility Report</b> pane</li><li>The <b>Projects</b> pane</li></ol>
<br />
I'm not familiar with &amp; can't find a Tutorial in PDF format for Word 2004. If you can provide details about where you found it I'd be happy to take a look.<br />

<h3> dario de judicibus  say:</h3>
<h2>            I get white thumbnails in Win7 Explorer for some Powerpoint 2003 files</h2>
                    Operating system: <i>Windows 7 Professional 64-bit ENG</i><br />
Office application: <i>Powerpoint Professional Edition 2003 SP3 ITA</i><br />
<br />
Problem: looking at PPT files in Explorer, some file has the expected thumbnail, some other file has a
<b>white thumbnail</b>.<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
<ol>
<li><b>Save Preview Images</b> is ALWAYS <u>checked </u>in properties of all PPT files</li><li><b>Save Preview Images</b> is ALWAYS <u>checked </u>in properties of all corresponding templates</li><li><b>Show thumbnails instead of icons</b> is <u>checked </u>in <i>Performance Settings</i> of Windows</li><li><b>Always show icons, never thumbnails</b> is <u>unchecked </u>in <i>Folder and Search options</i> of Explorer</li></ol>
I cannot understand why some file <u>has thumbnails</u>, some has not. All files have been saved in PPT format.
<br />
Saving in Powerpoint 95/2003 compatible format does NOT fix the problem. <br />
Creating a PPT from scratch based on default template and copying/pasting slides does NOT fix the problem.<br />
<br />
I cannot think of any other test to do&nbsp; :(<br />

            <span>Hello Dario,
<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting the question.<br />
<br />
From your description, I understand that some PowerPoint files are displayed as white thumbnail in Window Explorer.<br />
<br />
I will assist you with this issue, however I need additional information:<br />
<br />
1) Is there any difference in the problem files and the files that appears correctly (E.g. types of content in the file)?<br />
2) Did you download the problem files or create them? <br />
3) Does this issue occur when you create and save new PowerPoint file?<br />
<br />
<br />
Let’s try the following and verify the result:<br />
<br />
1) Repair the problem files and verify the result: <br />

            I do not know for sure, but I assume it might not be a prerequisite to have 10052 on your phone. Installing Win Insider on 8.1 will take you straight to the latest build supported, which is 10080.

            As I understand it, Microsoft has disabled the Upgrade Advisor functionality.&nbsp; You may still be able to upgrade under the Windows Insider program.&nbsp; Try installing the Windows Insider app (it is still available in WP8.1 Store) and using that.&nbsp; You will
 be need to be signed up as an Insider.&nbsp; I suggest selecting the Release Preview track in the first instance.&nbsp; Please keep us posted on whether this works out.

<p>I work with a considerable number of searchable PDF documents (deposition transcripts)&nbsp; that have been "highlighted" (ie, a 300 page depo may have several pages throughout the document that have the relevant data highlighted in yellow).&nbsp; These highlighted
 lines are then extracted out to another application (Excel, Word, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in the day, we used to receive our deposition transcripts in Excel, and I was able to write VBA scripts to loop through the text and extract the highlighted data (VBA can recognize the text properties of a value in&nbsp;a cell).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm wondering if this is possible with a PDF?&nbsp; Is it possible to open a PDF file, loop through it's text, identify and pull (extract) any lines that have been highlighted, and perhaps copy them out to another application?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any and all help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Craig</p>

            <p>Craig,&nbsp; With luck on your part someone will come along and make a liar out of me, but...&nbsp; I don't think you can do this with Excel.&nbsp; To work with files created by another application you must create an object that is that application and then use various
 commands associated with that application to manipulate the file.&nbsp; I don't believe that Adobe Acrobat exposes the properties and methods so that you could take control of it through Excel or even Word VBA.</p>
<p>There are tools that can take a .pdf file and provide a reasonably accurate file in the "original" type of file format such as .xls or .doc.&nbsp; One of the better ones that I'm aware of is OmniPage, see:</p>

<p>And before you click, nope, it's definitely not free.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender Unstoppable</h2>
                    <p>Currently using Win8.1.&nbsp; Up until a few days/weeks ago, I could manually stop and start my Windows Defender.</p>
<p>Now, I no longer have the ability to do so in services.msc nor is there an Administrator option within Windows Defender itself that allows me to say I don't want to use it, even if temporarily.</p>
<p>

<p><strong>Please do re-read the post.</strong>&nbsp; I said there is no Administrator option within Windows Defender; this is normally what's found under Settings that allows you to disable it.&nbsp; That is no longer there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's some other setting that does this now, please do elaborate.&nbsp; Telling me to just go to the settings isn't helpful to me in this situation.</p>

<p>I read your question.</p>
<p>You were looking in services.msc.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Carolyn,
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It’s possible that the compatibility mode will appear in the title bar of Word if the document was created from the older version of Word application. Compatibility issue
 may cause application gets frozen or not responding. Just to verify, which version of Office is installed on your computer? Which Windows operating system are you using?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you follow all possible solution provided in this

<h2>            one note android lines of text too wide for screen</h2>
                    <p>I have onenote on my pc and my chromebook and my android phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT.... when I read the text on my android phone it is too wide for the screen. So I either have to make the text very small (not possible with my eyesight) or keep moving the page left and right to read it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On other apps such as simplenote the text is automatically 'flowed' so that it just fills the screen nicely even if you have a large text size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to do this with onenote??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<p>I agree that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>this issue needs to be addressed</strong></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am new to OneNote and I noticed this problem of text flow / text wrapping right away. IF everything on the notebook Page is in
<strong>one </strong>container the text will re-flow properly switching between screen sizes and orientations. But if there are any images or containers in addition to the first container, the text does not flow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the need to preserve the layout of text and images on a page,

</p><p>That's a very interesting reply.</p>

</p><p>I hope MS have a look at this issue. It seems a fairly important one otherwise the app is more or less unusable for me. Which is a shame because onenote seems very good.</p>

<p>
</p><p>OFFTOP: Why I like Google Keep is because it fast, easy in use and works as expected. But sadly enough OneNote slow, confusing sometimes and at last have small and annoying bugs like this.</p>

    <title>N73ME newest FW 4.0736.3.2.1 kills equilizer. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moee---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N73ME newest FW 4.0736.3.2.1 kills equilizer.</h2>
                    This new firmware killed the equilizer in the music player. First I was able to add new presets and edit them the way I want. Now they are non functional. Just the rock preset changes treble a little, but that's a default preset.. Which I never use. I
 use my own which don't work anymore. As soon I make a new one, edit it and check it.. It goes back to default settings. Nokia killed the equilizer.

            And also its photo shot outputs still in smudgy, watercolor like, and bluish noise when used darker places. Found Nokia N70 far better handling in non-lighted places.<br />

Nokia Engineers, please do something on this!

            if the update does this then i will not. our music should be listened to how we like, and the equalizer does that, and to cripple it in the music edition is just plain ridiculous. hope they fix this

            How ya doin korngear.. eid mubarak. Man.. I don't wanna brag about usin s60 ever since there first release, but I did whatever may cross your mind to solve this. Oh man.. I have the bh-500 BT stereo headset and the music on it now crackles up now. I did
 the reinstalll, the *#7370# and the power-green-star-3 combo. I tried an untouched new memory card. Everything except beat the heck out of it. I've had this phone since dec.'06 and it's the only handset that lasted with me so long (Ichange alot). All it's
 done is satisfy and diapoint me as much or more of the latter. I'm startin to give up. It's bitter sweet. Dead equilizer is dead, bitter. The digital zoom is incredible! Sweet! Zoom in to whatever, extended or not and then "auto-focus" and WOAW!! It gets it
 like a pro camera. Weird for this "device". But let us stick to the dead equilizer and a solution Bro.. Peace.

            I can confirm that after activating each of the equaliser preset and exiting from equaliser setting. The presets get initialized. Thanks to mpennala for hint!<br />
<br />
But sadly when you exit away from the Music Player and when you return back all equaliser preset get reset to defaults.

            Unlocking refers to the process of unlocking the SIM card for using it with another network operator for phone calls / data etc, it has nothing to do with the product code and the O2 branding of the phone. You will need to contact your network operator,
 as to whether your device will receive the Belle Refresh update. If O2 say they are not pushing the update to you, then you will need to contact your local Nokia Care to see what they can do for you:

<p>How did you get the Belle Refresh v111.40.1511 update when it isn't available for O2 UK branded N8's?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;As stated above, it is entirely upto O2 UK to approve the update so all you can do is either wait or try contacting them to see if they have any plans on releasing the update.</p>

<h2>            Access &#39;Field Length&#39; setting on column does nothing</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are working through a process to convert an Access database to SQL Server using SSMA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've noticed an issue however, on the columns that have a 'field length' specified in *access* that field length is meaningless, there are columns with way more letters than 10 in a column with a field length of 10 but when we export the data to SQL it
 gets truncated to whatever the 'field length is'. Does anyone know why it is like this? We don't really care about those field lengths, is there any way to detect which columns have data that exceed 'field length' without checking manually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's super annoying to export an access db and then find out that data has been truncated for no reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>I'd suggest just setting all the field lengths of Text fields to 255 prior to exporting. Access doesn't store trailing blanks anyway so this won't affect anything (as you've seen), but this should allow you to avoid what I'd consider a bug in SSMA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be easy enough to write some VBA to loop through all the fields, check to see if they are Text or Memo/Long Text, and just remove the field length property.</p>

            What even is the point of that field if nothing enforces the limit?

            Durned if I know! It seems it's enforced (brutally!) on export to SQL but I've not seen it have any effect elsewhere.

<p>I would like to better understand your scenario. Try this:</p>
<p>Create new database&nbsp; (Btw, tell us which version of Access you are using)</p>
<p>Create new table. Give it an Autonumber ID and PK, and a "Text5" field with Field Size (not Field Length - where did you see that?) of 5.</p>
<p>Save. Try to enter more than 5 characters. You won't be able to.</p>
<p>I must be missing something. What is it?</p>
<p>
