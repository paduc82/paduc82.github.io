    <title>Input devices having not working correctly with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Input devices having not working correctly with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a desktop PC which runs Windows 10, and recently got the creators update. Just today I started having problems with both my keyboard and mouse. My keyboard began having issues first. When I hit the backspace key, the previous character would be replaced
 with "a", and when I hit the "L" key, the character "l" would be displayed, immediately followed by "1".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted my computer when this happened several times, which seemed to fix the problem at first, but then it would come back. I then took my keyboard to my friend, who also runs the most recent version of Windows 10 on his PC and the keyboard had the
 same issues. After this, I figured the keyboard was defunct and moved on. However, later today my mouse started acting up as well. Every time I left clicked a link, Windows would try to save the link to a folder, every time I double left clicked a folder in
 the File Explorer, it opened the Properties window of the folder, and right clicking did not do anything at all. I find it very peculiar that I would just start having both of these issues right away and am curious if it is a Windows 10 glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since restarted my computer (for about the 8th time today) and both are working now, but I am curious if anyone else has had this issue and if there is a fix for it. Thanks.</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer?
Which version of Windows 10 did you originally upgrade from?

Did you check the manufacturers website to determine if your make and model is compatible? Learn how:

Also, I would recommend try resetting your system to see if it helps.

            I have a custom built PC. I checked the motherboard manufacturer's website, but it just says compatible with Windows 10. The motherboard is an ASRock Z170A-X1. Also, I would like to avoid resetting my PC if possible.&nbsp;

            Hi Cameron,

I recommend you download the latest drivers for the motherboard and install it:
http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z170A-X13.1/?cat=Download 

If you have non-essential devices attached, I recommend you disconnect them to see if it helps. 

Best,
Andre

            So, there is bug.<br />
<br />
Example: <br />
1. Open Windows Media center and Internet Explorer. Both are maximized and Windows media center is top of IE.<br />
2. Right-click on IE taskbar item and after that left-click on IE taskbar item. It will be minimized. How I can avoid that?<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            And:<br />
<br />
3. When IE will be minimized and I click on Windows media center taskbar item, it will be minimized too.<br />
<br />
Maybe some fix for this? :P<br />

            And one more situation:<br />
1. Open windows media center ja Internet explorer. Both are maximized ja windows media center is top of IE.<br />
2. Left-click on IE taskbar item and left-click again, to minimize it. After that left click on media center taskbar item and it will be minimized. When you have more programs opened and you click on their taskbar items, they all will be minimized until you
 maximize one of them.<br />

            Hi ,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to "Getting Ready for Windows 7" community forum.<br />
<br />
We will work to assist you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let's start by communicating a&nbsp;little bit of information involving your issue.<br />
<br />
Please let us know what kind of Wireless card is being used?&nbsp; Is it a laptop or desktop?&nbsp; Is it an addin card or did it come with the system?&nbsp; What&nbsp;is the make and model of the&nbsp;system&nbsp;you&nbsp;are using?<br />
<br />
<br />
For general troubleshooting purposes I believe if you use your wireless card let's try the following.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Click Start ORB / Select Control Panel / Network and Internet / Network and Sharing Center / Select Troubleshoot Problems listed at the bottom of this page.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; If it finds problems and resolves them, are you able to connect to the internet now?&nbsp; If it finds problems and doesn't resolve them does it give you any suggestions of what to do in the details field of the window?&nbsp; Please list that information in the forum
 if available.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; After running that troubleshooting step, repeat step 1, but instead of running the TROUBLESHOOT PROBLEM section Click Change Adapter Settings from the left hand side of the window.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Your wireless adapter should be listed - Double Click the adapter and select Details.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; In the Details section and IPv4 address should be listed.&nbsp; Please document this address and the Default gateway and report that information to the forum.&nbsp; It may be it is not seeing the router, so depending on what IP address is being shown will help us
 in determining if that is the case.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
6.&nbsp; After you have the IP address of the adapter, Close the Window.&nbsp; Click the Start ORB / in the Search line type COMMAND PROMPT - then hit enter.&nbsp; From the programs list Right Click Command Prompt and select RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp; When in the command prompt type PING 127.0.0.1 and then hit enter.&nbsp; List what information it responds with after issuing that command.<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp; Finally, obtain all the information about your router configuration that you may need from your Internet Service Provider and have it documented somewhere for your usage.&nbsp; Then power&nbsp;off the router&nbsp;for 30 seconds or longer then power it back on.&nbsp; This will
 reset your router.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
9.&nbsp; After the router is reset and any changes that you need to make to the router after the reset takes place have been done, then try connecting to the internet again.<br />
<br />
Please let us know on this issue if any further assistance is needed or if any steps assisted in troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />

    <title>Default gateway is not available WiFi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wayne_mcse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default gateway is not available WiFi</h2>
                    <p>When my computer goes into sleep mode the WiFi adapter does not seem to wake properly. A search of other threads shows this problem is on going. I have tried every applicable solution.&nbsp; This is a relatively clean install and has been going on since I bought
 the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the solutions do not apply as there is no "Power Options" on the network adapter, no Advance power saving options for WiFi are also not there, updating drivers (changing drivers) and things like flushing DNS do not work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I read the threads it is not brand computer specific and most of the threads are closed even though no solutions have been found. If I was guessing I think it has to do with Windows waking up and not fully starting the Networking services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sure would like this fixed as it is annoying, but, the work around is to go thru the "Troubleshooting problems" options on the wireless settings or I created a batch file (run it as administrator) :
</p>
<p>
</p><p>netsh interface set interface Wi-Fi disable<br />
pause<br />
netsh interface set interface Wi-Fi enable</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should add I am MCP, MCSE, A+, ACMT ... etc etc etc</p>

            Hi Wayne.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible fixes for Sleep, based on ten years troubleshooting it almost daily.  If you need help performing any step just ask back:
<br />
<br />First confirm you have the Sleep options configured correctly as shown here:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change-power-plan-settings-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change...</a>.  
<br />
<br />You might want to try Hibernate to succeed Sleep, or use Hibernate in place of Sleep - it's just a deeper sleep that actually powers off because desktop stored in RAM during sleep is written to hard drive hiberfile then powered off.  
<br />
<br />Most Sleep problems are caused by the Display driver, so try updating yours from the PC or Device maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag.  While there make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Network, Sound, USB and all other drivers by comparing those posted for download with the version and date of the corresponding ones in the Device Manager.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then in Device Manager on Display device Driver tab choose Roll back, Uninstall (then restart to reinstall) or try another one previously installed at Device Manager&gt;Display adapter&gt;Driver&gt;Update Driver&gt;Browse&gt;Let me pick.  
<br />
<br />In addition there are steps here to specifically troubleshoot Sleep mode problems:  <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sleep-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sle...</a>
<br />
<br />What I do is go into Advanced Power options and set Display and Sleep to 1 minutes, Hibernate to 2 minutes, then after completing each step restart the PC and observe what happens for 3 minutes.  
<br /> 
<br />Also did it previously work?  Do you have a System Restore point from when it did?<a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if an Update reinstalls and causes the same problem uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>In short ... No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went thru all of theses steps except for Display driver. I have 2 display adapters the NVidia is just updating, but, the display drivers is a long way from WiFi adapter.&nbsp; However I will test this, I have seen odder things. The other drivers are up to date,
 using Hibernation mode does the same thing, and it was doing it almost from the first day I bought the computer so roll backs and restore points will not work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted ASUS support on this, they gave me the standard send it back to us and we will warranty it. Seeing as how the device works, and it does not shut off, it just refuses to launch properly after Sleep/Hibernation mode I do not see the physical computer
 as having a problem.&nbsp; With the multiple threads on the subject I would say it is not unique.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 16 GB RAM and SSD so it is very fast. In fact I would hedge my bet that it is too fast and the OS does not fully wake the adapter in its timely manner. Putting in things like manual address also does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see you mentioned 9 years experience, I have over 20.</p>

            I suggested Video driver because everything about sleep depends on it and will not sleep without it being correct. 
<br />
<br />Did you update the wireless driver as well, from the adapter or PC maker's Support Downloads web page?  Using Update drivers for troubleshooting is not enough.

<p>Well the new 1903 Windows 10 came out, and with it new drivers for the wireless device. It has a new look and I was hopeful this would fix the problem. It was awesome for 2 days then ... a big
<strong>NO</strong> same problem, in fact blue screen of show up more often. The blue screens are not related to the wireless issue, these are issues related mostly to unplugging the power charging and then opening (taking the device out of sleep mode).<br />

<p>I wonder if I should have bought a MAC.</p>

<h2>            UNABLE TO INSTALL ANY UPDATE</h2>
                    Dear Subscribers and Contributors:<br />
After three hours and probably 2 dozen reboots, I have given up and I will no longer try to update Windows 8 and will probably turn off automatic updates. It seems that I'm not alone in this issue and the internet is full of posting with frustrated and angry
 clients.<br />
Updating Win 8 has become more annoying than a root canal and at least the latter is purposeful.<br />
It's hard to believe that Microsoft can't get its act together after all these years.<br />
If anybody has found a viable solution to this problem (without returning to Win 7 or buying a Mac) please let me know.<br />
<br />

Dear Sir,<br />
Thanks for replying and consider my frustration.<br />
Getting into details, I can't install KB2779768 nor KB2785094, both installations fail returning error code 800F0922.<br />
Same as usual ,it downloads installs, reboots , configures than reverts all changes I think twice.<br />
There has to be a solution.<br />
Please advice.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to the internet after reinstalling Vista using a wired connection to my Belkin router</h2>
                    Dell Inspiron 530. Windows Vista 32-bit. Reinstalled Vista. Normally have a wireless connection to a Belkin router (which still works with my laptop). Tried to connect it to the router with an ethernet cable but it doesn't detect the router. Do I have
 to install the "driver" discs that come with the computer - there are loads of them! Tried one disc labeled "Drivers and Utilities" and downloaded those with a tick by them which seemed to be compatible with the desktop computer. Don't know where to go from
 here? Should I be able to connect to the internet having just reinstalled Vista or is there something else I need to do? Many thanks for any advice

            If the 'Drivers and Utilities' disk was supplied with the computer, install the nework interface drivers. This will allow the computer to connect to the router.. If you do not know how to do this, go to the manufacturer support webpage and contact them
 for instructions.. &nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Just been having a look at the detailed network statistics on the Xbox One! (Cabled using cat 5e)</p>
<p>Download Speed = 70.51 Mbps</p>
<p>Upload Speed = 18.26 Mbps</p>
<p>Download Packet Loss = 0%</p>
<p>Upload Packet Loss = 1% /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not Good ******</p>
<p>MTU = 1480 /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May not be correct ? ******</p>
<p>Latency = 153 ms /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is really terrible for online gaming as a UK user where am I connecting to!!! USA? ******</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pc Cabled (Speedtest.net)</p>
<p>Download Speed = Same</p>
<p>Upload Speed = Same</p>
<p>Packet loss = NONE (Upload + Download)</p>
<p>MTU = 1472 / This is correct with an over head of 28 (Max MTU 1500)</p>
<p>Latency = 5 ms / GOOD ******</p>

<p>Hey gang! Have you made sure that your ports are being forwarded correctly? The Xbox One has a LARGE number of TCP and UDP ports which need to be forwarded to make sure all forms of communication are not being blocked or throttled. And, all of the ports
 have to be forwarded, because different games may use different ports. The ports you will need to forward for the Xbox One are:</p>
<p>Port 88 (UDP)</p>
<p>Port 3074 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>Port 53 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>Port 80 (TCP)</p>
<p>Port 500 (UDP)</p>
<p>UDP Port 3544 (UDP)</p>
<p>UDP Port 4500 (UDP)</p>
<p>Also, if you play Ghosts, you will likely also need to forward ports 3075 and 3076, as many gamers have issues if those ports are still closed. The details on Xbox One network ports can be found here:</p>

<p>And the instructions for how to forward ports specific to your brand/model of router can be found here (just navigate to your brand and model, and the steps should be specific):</p>

<h2>            how to empty mailboxes</h2>
                    I am getting messages that my mail box is full and soon I will not be able to receive e mails. I can delete e mails but then I have a lot in my deleted file and I cant delete them unless I do it individually. I thought I should be able to hightlght and
 choose a delete all option, but I cant find this. Any suggestions?

    <title>Every PATCH installation fails after installing Windows Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radu.dnl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Every PATCH installation fails after installing Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to report an issue which I think is a Windows bug introduced by one of the Windows updates (unfortunately I wasn't able to find out which one of them).<br />
<br />
Here is the test case:<br />
1. install a fresh copy of Windows on a test machine<br />
2. install all available Windows Updates (so the system is up to date)<br />
3. create a sample MSI installer which only installs some dummy files (let's say Product Version 1.0.0) and host it on a web server</p>
<p>4. install the MSI from the online location using a command line like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">msiexec /i http://server/share/package.msi</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. create a .MSP patch (e.g. v1.0.1) which only adds a new file to v1.0.0<br />
6. install the v1.0.1 patch<br />
<br />
RESULT: the patch installation fails with the following error message: "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: bold">The filename , directory name , or volume label syntax is incorrect"</span><br />
<br />
NOTES:<br />
1. the issue was replicated on Windows 7 and 8 machines UP TO DATE<br />
2. the issue is not replicated on a fresh installation of Windows without Updates applied</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone aware of what could cause this error? Once again the patch installation fails only on Windows machines with the latest Updates installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>
<p />

<p>W gruncie rzeczy czego tak właściwie oczekujesz po grze tego typu, że w nowej części komandosi będą umieli zapuścić skrzydła ? To znaczy że co, skoro w poprzedniej części korzystali z lin i pontonów to już nikt nigdy niema prawa czy jak ? W poprzedniej części
 był np Kałach, tak że nie powinno go już być w kolejnych... ;-] Najpierw się zastanów czego tak właściwie chcesz... Poza tym nikt Ci nie każe kupować kolejnej części.</p>

<p>Ale w jakim sensie nowego ? Ta gra to fps który w pewnym sensie próbuje udawać prawdziwego żołnierza w realiach światowych konfliktów lub czegoś na ich pokrój. Tak że poza podbiciem grafiki, dodaniem / wymianą broni i zmianą scenariusza nie oczekiwałbym
 raczej że John Price nagle wyjmie świetlny miecz i użyje mocy, lub też jego M4A1 przemówi ludzkim głosem i zmieni się w Transformersa... ;-]</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting up a Workgroup in Windows 10 allows users to share files, network storage, printers and any connected resources. One of the possible reasons why this issue occurs is when there are several restrictions that have been set in a Workgroup. For us to

</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your Workgroup being managed by an Administrator?</li><li>Are there any restrictions that have been set to your Workgroup?<br />

    <title>Problem with HDMI output, it is recognized as DVI - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with HDMI output, it is recognized as DVI</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have my xbox 360 connected to a monitor through HDMI. I have always had the Auto-detect screen on, and used to work well, but unfortunately now the console thinks that I have a DVI connection so I wasn't able to hear anything.&nbsp;I decided to switch off the
 auto-detect screen, so I was able to configure the HDMI output, but when I configure it to 1080p, the image is showing in a rare way, it shows red pixels in some places and sometimes the screen goes black.</p>
<p>I have tried it in a FullHD TV and with another HDMI cable and continue with the same problem.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what is happening?</p>

<p>Could be a number of things. Off the top of my head, faulty HDMI cable, faulty HDMI port on your T.V, faulty HDMI port on your Xbox 360. Try a new HDMI cable first, if the same thing happens try a new HDMI port in your T.V (if you have more than one) If
 it still does it after that then you may need to send your Xbox away for repair.</p>

<h2>            Cortana in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded to Windows 10. This happens to be version 1607. I had saved it on a CD sometime back but used it only now. I find that the system does not have CORTANA and MICROSOFT EDGE. I have tried to get it from Microsoft site but have not able
 to do it.</p>
<p>Is it possible to get these two. Please advise the steps to be followed. Shall appreciate if you can send the links which I can use. Thank you.</p>

            Hi Purshotam, 1607 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, in fact it is a very old version, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, from File Explorer, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

<p>DaveM121</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt response.</p>
<p>I would like to know the following before I attempt to upgrade:</p>
<p>Will I need a new activation key after the upgrade?</p>
<p>Would you advise me to download ISO files of the later Version 1803 on a new CD or can I do it on laptop itself.</p>
<p>Once I hear from you, I will proceed to upgrade.</p>

            Hi Purshotam,
<br />
<br />No, you will not need a product key, this is just an upgrade from 1607 to 1803
<br />
<br />Do not burn the ISO onto a DVD or USB stick
<br />
<br />Use the Media Creation tool to just create the ISO on you hard drive
<br />
<br />Then disconnect from the Internet 
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803 
<br />
<br />Then, from File Explorer, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . . 
<br />
<br />Cheese to keep your files and apps
<br />
<br />Choose not to download and install updates       
        </p>

            Hi Purshotam
<br />
<br />When you start up the Media Creation Tool
<br />
<br />You should get the option to create Installation media for another PC
<br />
<br />Then be given the option of creating a USB or ISO - choose ISO

<p>I have been able to download the ISO file as suggested. Once I start the upgrade it is asking for a Product Key. Is there any way out for this. I had two keys which did not meat their requirement.</p>
<p>I will wait for your reply.</p>

            Hi Purshotam,
<br />
<br />Is your current Windows 10 activated?
<br />
<br />That upgrade from the ISO should not ask for a Product key - I did this yesterday on a laptop and it never asked for a Product Key . . .

<h2>            Uninstall Button Missing</h2>
                    Hi guys,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've upgraded to Windows 8.1 without much of a fuss, however I noticed that my "Programs and Features" page is missing the uninstall button next to the "Organise" drop-down:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b45bcaa-02d1-4bed-9704-10132f1eed26" /></div>
<div>Also, when I try to use the right-click menu to initiate an uninstall for some items they just fail with a "Would you like to remove ___ from the Programs and Features list?", and even if I click on "Yes" in those circumstances, nothing happens.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone experience something like this?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Wilhelm,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>- By any chance do you have AMD Catalyst installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the System File checker scan on the computer to see if there are any errors detected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- In the Search Charms, type command prompt. Right click on Command prompt and select Run as Administrator.</p>
<p>- Type SFC /SCANNOW and press enter.</p>
<p>- Wait till the process completes. Restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are errors found after the scan, then go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\&nbsp; and open CBS.log file to check for errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            First, try signing out of the Microsoft Store. Click your Profile picture at the top right, click your account then sign out.
<br />
<br />Restart your computer, launch the Microsoft Store app, sign in again, then attempt downloading again. 
<br />
<br />Other things you can try...
<br />
<br />Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Store:
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

</p><p>The Ethernet switches that I manage can copy the configuration to a TFTP server.&nbsp; I need to save copies of the configurations and compare before and after each vendor firmware update.&nbsp; So I'm seeking such a server.</p>

<p>No, that's typically a "server" function... so, you'd expect to see that on Windows Server 2016, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you can install a 3rd-party web server suite (such as Apache) that includes a TFTP server</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t remember my log-on password for my Vista laptop&#33;</h2>
                    I lost my log-on password for signing onto my laptop computer. (I have Vista) I have tried every password I can think of, but since I always try to use something unique I know I'll never remember it and my list of passwords is, where else, on that laptop!
 Please help!

"Microsoft policy about lost or forgotten passwords"<br />
<br />
Microsoft&nbsp;cannot help you retrieve passwords of files and features in Microsoft products that are lost or forgotten.<br />
<br />
You are quite welcome to search for 3rd Party Password Recovery&nbsp;Products on the Net.<br />
<br />
But,&nbsp;use 3rd Party Products at your own risk.<br />
<br />
Cheers.
