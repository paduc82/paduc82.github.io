<h2>            Can&#39;t add Exchange Online to EMC</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I'm prepping my environment for a hybrid installation and everything has gone well including directory sync until I have reached the part where I am trying to add Office365 to my EMC, I get the error:</p>

<p>The Attempt to connect to <a href="https://ps.outlook.com/PowerShell/Powershell.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://ps.outlook.com/PowerShell/Powershell.htm</a>&nbsp;using "Basic" authentication failed: Connecting to remote server failed with the following error message:&nbsp;</p>
<p>[ClientAccessServer=MEXPR01CA0011,BackEndServer=,RequestId=e905fe1.. 7:31:29AM] [FailureCategory=Cafe-HttpProxyException] Failed to resolve tenant name from SMTP address 'myemail@domain'.</p>
<p>I have tried creating a new Global Admin with the same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't know if worth mentioning but I'm not using SSO.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi xrbrett,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates.<br />
<br />
From your screenshot, I can see the domain <strong>@cruisefinder.com.au</strong> (I have removed the username in your screenshot in order to protect your privacy information). After checking this domain, I found this is an<strong> Office 365 Business</strong>
 tenant, which doesnt provide Exchange Online service at all. Therefore, it is not feasible to build the Exchange hybrid deployment with this tenant. And that's why the error "Failed to resolve tenant name" occurs.<br />
<br />
What you need is an Office 365 tenant which contains Exchange Online service, such as
<strong>Office 365 Business Premium</strong> or <strong>Office 365 Enterprise</strong>. Please see the details in

<p>Thank you so much Allen, I thought this may have been the case so I contacted both the chat on the Office365 products page who advised me that all Business products support a 'Hybrid Deployment'</p>
<p>as well as calling Office365 technical support (ticket # 30126-148329) whom have had me checking all the configuration steps and unable to assist.</p>
<p>Do you know if my current subscription supports a simple Cutover Migration from my Exchange 2010 environment?</p>

    <title>Outlook - why a space hog&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j lee harshbarger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook - why a space hog&#63;</h2>
                    Every day I get a warning message that yet another 1% of my hard drive is gone. Since I am not saving any big files like pictures or music on it, primarily only Office files, I couldn't figure out where the space was getting eaten up from. &nbsp;I used WhatSize
 to investigate, and the hog turns out to be Outlook. 33.5 GB is for message sources. &nbsp;What is "message sources"? &nbsp;How can I keep this from multiplying so fast? &nbsp;I only have 5% left on my hard drive. &nbsp;The 2nd biggest thing on my hard drive is Application Support
 at 15.2 GB, so it seems that Outlook is clearly the hog. &nbsp;How can I control this ravenous beast?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S. There's also 2.31 GB for Outlook 2004 identities. &nbsp;When I got this computer, I transferred the user to here, and my old computer had Outlook 2004. &nbsp;Can I get rid of that?</div>
                </div>

<br />
Yes, but you need to work off a copy of the Identity.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Copy your current Identity.</li><li>Delete the IMAP accounts.</li><li>Make a copy of the Identity without IMAP.</li><li>Move the Mailing Lists, Rules, and Signatures folders to your copy Identity.</li><li>Rebuild</li><li>Open Outlook and open Rules.</li><li>Verify the rules open OK. The folder destinations will need to be reset. You'll need to add your IMAP accounts back for those folders.</li></ul>
<br />
Once you are satisfied that the copy Identity is working you can rename and delete the extras.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rebuild is often the only thing you can do if your Identity fails to open. However, always make a backup copy first. It's not a specific situation that you need to avoid when deciding to rebuild, it's the rebuild process that go wrong. Once the rebuild has
 mangled your data if you don't have a backup you're in trouble.<br />
<br />
With IMAP it's just easy to start over in a new Identity.&nbsp; You can have corruption in other items, but it's usually messages that's the culprit. If you do have to rebuild, removing the IMAP messages makes a lot less for the Database Utility to rebuild.

<br />
Is Gmail IMAP or POP? I highly suggest you switch to IMAP. This way you dont loose your mail in the future. It's POP mail that's stored under "On My Computer" that's vulnerable to loss.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, once you are satisfied with the results you should delete. <br />
<br />
<br />
Since this has never come up before I couldn't even hazard a guess.<br />
<br />
Considering your problem was so severe, I certainly wouldn't trust a rebuilt Identity to have solved all my issues. YMMV<br />
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Do Not Rebuild Identities with Exchange and IMAP accounts. Delete the accounts (this deletes the cache files in Outlook). Do the rebuild then add back accounts. Better yet start over in a new Identity. If the rebuild does not work then you could sync unwanted
 changes or deletions to your server and lose data.</li><li>Make sure you have plenty of free space on your drive. Make sure that you have at least three times as much hard disk space available as the current size of your Outlook identity PLUS 10% free for virtual memory.</li><li>Rebuilding does not fix all issues. It can make some problems worse. Even though the Database Utility will make a backup, I advise making a copy in the Finder first.</li><li>You can delete the rebuild version after you are satisfied with the results. This copy will be named like this: Main Identity [Backed up 1-21-2012 13.35]&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<br />
Tip: If your Identity will open, before you rebuild, check "On My Computer"Inbox and Sent folders to be sure they are under the 2GB limit. Generally this is less than 10,000 messages but with large attachments could be less. Make sub-folders e.g. Inbox 2011,
 Inbox 2010, Sent 2011, Sent 2010 etc to help reduce the number of messages in a folder. (Check for any large archive folders you might have in addition to Inbox and Sent).<br />

<h2>            Someone else claiming that my email address is theirs</h2>
                    <p>I have a strange problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been receiving emails from one of the telco's in Australia with details of my "account" with them.&nbsp; However, I do not have an account with that telco.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The details from the telco include enough info that I am able access the account (which is obviously someone elses).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted the telco, and they can see the account that has my email address registered with it, they even called their customer who stated that the email address was theirs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email address in question is a live.com.au address, which I have had since MSN Messenger days (at least 6 years).</p>
<p>I have carefully looked at all settings in my live account, and all my registered emails and phone numbers are correct and mine, and I have performed a password reset which I received correct notification of the password reset.&nbsp; I have also since set up
 2 phase verification to make it harder for anyone to hack...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question comes back to the telco's customer who claims that the email address is theirs, and that they received the telco's password reset emails?!?&nbsp; The telco said that as the email address was a live.com.au address, I needed to contact microsoft to
 sort this out, and they also said that their customer was going to contact microsoft to sort this out.&nbsp; I cannot see any evidence that the telco's customer actively uses that email address except for the emails from the telco with the customers account details
 and password reset emails for the telco customers account.&nbsp; So how can I be sure that the telco's customer doesn't try and contact microsoft and claim that my email address is theirs? or if they do, Microsoft won't take my email account away from me?</p>

15 places is all you get, rounding occurs at the 15th position.<br />

<p>
</p><p>FYI, if A2 has the formula =2^53,&nbsp;the formula =A2-TEXT(A2,"0.00000000000000E+0")-0 is an example of when the redundant -0 is necessary.</p>

<p>[EDIT] PS....&nbsp; TEXT(...,"0.00000000000000E+0") is a method for rounding a value of any magnitude and number decimal places to 15 significant digits. So I am in the habit of writing that expression. Of course, for these example, we could simply use 1005010010005000
 and 9007199254740990.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the SS# is a pure number i.e. without any alphabets, then the characters in the end are unlikely to be spaces.&nbsp; They instead are space resembling characters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. From any one SS# cell, select one space looking character and copy it</p>
<p>2. Press Ctrl+H</p>
<p>3. Ensure that the Find box is blank</p>
<p>4. Paste in the Find box</p>
<p>5. Leave the replace with box blank</p>
<p>6. Press Replace All</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>SPO task app and assignees - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joseph_n_  say:</h3>
<h2>            SPO task app and assignees</h2>
                    <p>The SharePoint Online task app has a field to assign a task to someone. One can therefore look at the task list and see which tasks are assigned to which people. This leads to two questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is it correct that the task list app itself does not notify the assigned person? It seems that the assigning person either has to send an e-mail separately from the task list, or they have to use something like Flow to automate the procedure. Is that
 right? </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is there a way to view all assigned tasks by assignee? In other words, if tasks 1 and 3 are assigned to Jane, and tasks 2 and 4 are assigned to Judy, is there a way to look at all of Jane's tasks, and then one could see that tasks 1 and 3 are on her desk?

    <title>Microsoft Word Copyright Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas m miovas jr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word Copyright Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have looked over the Licensing for my non-commercial version of Word 2007, and I have a question regarding the legality of using MS Word for writing short stories and publishing them for profit. If I am using MS Word commercial or non-commercial products
 and write for a living or seek to, do I need to get further permissions from Microsoft to be able to use their product for such an effort to earn money by writing short stories or poetry or essays? According to what I read on the MS website, the fonts themselves
 may well be copyrighted and could not be used in commercial applications without getting further permissions. But my version of Word is non-commercial anyhow, so what is the legality of me writing as mentioned above using MS Word and trying to earn money from
 those efforts -- say by publishing on the Kindel or some similar Internet based device? or just publishing essays, poetry, or short stories in a type of printed out book format or Word file for a profit using either the commercial or non-commercial MS Word
 product?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            This is not the place to seek legal advice regarding licensing issues. If you don't understand the terms of your EULA or how that applies to your situation, you should approach Microsoft directly, or an attorney of your choice. Any 'legal' advice given
 in these forums may be worth no more than you pay for it.

            I did approach Microsoft directly -- I called their customer service hotline to try to get some clarifications, and I was directed to this forum. If I cannot get an answer other than "go get a lawyer" and have to spend hundreds and thousands of dollars
 to get an answer, then I will no longer use Microsoft text editing software. There is always Open Office or maybe the Kindle has text editing software to be used in conjunction with publishing via the Kindle.<br />
<br />
For the record, I have been using Microsoft products for at least 30 years, and I am quite satisfied with them, including Word. However, if you are going to make this difficult for me, why should I have anything to do with Microsoft? There are other alternatives
 available these days, but since Word has already been bought and paid for and installed, I thought I'd try to get clarification on their product.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />

            <p>Whoever told you to approach these forums for what amounts to legal advice was quite wrong to do so. Neither I nor most of the other people who post here have ever worked for Microsoft and I doubt your question will be read by anyone who is authorised to
 speak for Microsoft on the matters you raise. I am not trying to make things difficult; just to alert you to the fact that, as I said: "Any 'legal' advice given in these forums may be worth no more than you pay for it".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems clear enough, though, that you'd be less likely to fall foul of any licensing restrictions for how you propose to use Word if you used an edition whose EULA envisaged use in a commercial setting.</p>

            I agree with Paul that a public forum is not the place to seek legal advice, however seeing as you have been directed here by Microsoft, a few observations (<b>which do not amount to a legal opinion</b>) may be pertinent.<br />
<br />
1. There is no difference between a document created with the Home and Student (non-commercial) version and those created by the 'professional' versions.<br />
<br />
2. It appears that the non-commercial designation was intended to allow Microsoft to sell to home users at a lower price without upsetting the corporate consumer base.<br />
<br />
3. There are no definitions in the EULA of what the various terms mean, so taken literally, it is hard to find anything that you might want to use a word processor for that could not fall into the definition of commercial activity.
<br />
<br />
There is no legal precedent because Microsoft has not been in the habit of taking its home and student consumers to court for minor infingements of EULA. To do so would be commercially far more damaging than ignoring the fact that some home users may sell some
 of their documents, or students may produce documents which will be useful to their later careers.<br />
<br />
The EULA is very loosely written to enable it to cover any eventuality that Microsoft lawyers may wish to explore. As far as I am aware, they haven't explored it, and the chances of the Microsoft usage police beating a path to your door to check whether your
 poems or short stories were written on the professional version or the home and student version are too slim to contemplate.
<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be inclined to worry about it for a moment longer.<br />

            To add to what Graham has said, since you have also asked about publishing your writing for Kindle or other platforms, it is hard to see how this could be illegal, either. Although it may no longer be true, at one time our local newspaper was composed
 in Microsoft Word for Mac, and undoubtedly countless books (especially self-published ones) have been typeset in Word (though many may have been rendered as PDFs before publication). Most of the fonts are commercial fonts that are not owned by Microsoft, but
 your purchase of the Microsoft product presumably includes a license to use the fonts in any way you choose, including for publications (though again it is probably not productive to go too deep into exploring this). In any case, once a publication&nbsp;has been
 converted to PDF or .azw, MOBI, EPUB, or some other file format, it would (I should think) be very difficult to prove that it originated as a Word document.

            I want to thank all of you who replied for your replies. Getting the commercial version would be better, just to be on the safe side, or find a word processor that doesn't have those restrictions on it. I agree that I have never heard of Microsoft going
 after anyone for using a non-commercial product to make money, but you never know. I do think Microsoft would be a bit crazy to do so, unless it is some big corporation who didn't buy legal software for all their computers.<br />
<br />
Thanks. It gives me something to think about before I go on to make my first million LOL ;)<br />

            Yes, the simplest thing to do may be to buy a business license if you expect to make significant amounts of money.<br />
<br />
I have not heard of MS siccing their lawyers for mis-use of Home and Student license. What they do do is send in the "licensing" police into businesses that are suspected of not complying with license terms. That can get expensive.<br />

            In a documentary, I saw JK Rowling using MS Word to write her Harry Potter series. So, as long as it doesn't say at the top "non-commercial use" as you're editing it, it's completely fine. If you're unsure, contact Microsoft.

            @Steve<br />
<br />
These options are for only Thai,Asian, chinese languages so you may not get them for English.<br />
I am using Hindi so these options are available in Word for Hindi.<br />
<br />
But the same are not available in Power point. The reported problem can be solved by applying proper font to the complex script.
<br />
<br />
The complex script settings can be set by adding any of the R to L language or Asian language in the Power point language settings.<br />
<br />
Right now it has been solved at my end after long try.<br />
Thanks to all for your valuable contribution.<br />
<br />

    <title>ActiveSync v4.5 Problems - constantly running, and accumulating - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ActiveSync v4.5 Problems - constantly running, and accumulating unresolved items..</h2>
                    I'm currently running..<br />
<span>
<span>
<div><br />
- Windows XP Professional SP2<br />
- ActiveSync v4.5<br />
- AT&amp;T Tilt (Windows Mobile 6)<br />
<br />
I've been having two problems with ActiveSync v4.5.<br />
<br />
1) <b>Constant Syncing</b>. It seems like ActiveSync v4.5 wants<br />
to constantly sync, even when there are no changes. And when ActiveSync<br />
is running, my AT&amp;T Tilt definitely slows down in performance. So a<br />
typical problem would be: I'm talking on the phone via bluetooth<br />
headset, and reading off information from my AT&amp;T Tilt. Then<br />
ActiveSync will kick in, and now the AT&amp;T Tilt becomes slow and<br />
unresponsive. <br />
<br />
2) <b>Unresolved Items</b>. When I edit &amp; save a MS Word file<br />
on my laptop, but don't close the file, ActiveSync tries to sync the<br />
file, but ends up with an unresolved item. In order to resolve the<br />
item, I have to close the MS Word file, and then maually tell<br />
ActiveSync to resolve the unresolved items. With previous Pocket PCs<br />
and ActiveSync versions, I was able to edit &amp; save files, without<br />
accumulating these unresolved items.<br />
<br />
Are there any adjustments, tweaks, patches, hacks, or freeware that can<br />
solve the above two issues? Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
Thanks.</div>

            In general, Word 2010 &amp; Word 2016 can each edit documents created by the other. Do note that documents created in Word 2016 are liable to format differently on Word 2010 due to changes in the layout engine. Word 2010 also won't support features introduced
 in Word 2013 &amp; later. See, for example, <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-s-new-in-Word-2013-3A9A927F-73AD-4AC5-910B-DFB12052D063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Locked out of my account for 30 days - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twillimeoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of my account for 30 days</h2>
                    <p>This is absolutely ridiculous.&nbsp; When I registered for a MS account 4 years ago, it asked me for a second email address to send security information.&nbsp; At the time I didn't have a second email so I used my work email.&nbsp; I left my job a couple of weeks ago and
 changed that email address in my account.&nbsp; What MS doesn't tell you that when they ask you for that secondary email address, you can't ever change it!!&nbsp; This time I changed it to my new phone number, apparently I will not ever be able to change my phone number
 either or I will be locked out of my account for 30 days again!!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>They also didn't warn me that if I changed that email address I would be locked out of my account for 30 days until AFTER I submitted it.&nbsp; To undo the change I would have to have access to the now invalid email address.&nbsp; Regardless, I would have to change
 it at some point so I would be locked out of my account for 30 days at some point regardless.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to MS this is set for 30 days because most people don't check their email more than every 30 days on average.&nbsp; Really?!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a Windows phone which had to be factory reset.&nbsp; Now I've lost all of my apps, messages etc too.&nbsp; After talking to three different MS reps all who said nothing could be done.&nbsp; MS's solution to the problem is to tell me to create a new MS account
 and use it until my account is unlocked in 30 days then trash it.&nbsp; Seriously??!!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess what MS, I can have an iPhone in 30 minutes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a completely unreasonable policy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Signed, </p>
<p>Done with MS and my 2 Windows phones, 3 Surfaces, 1 Windows 7 PC, Microsoft band and 3 Miracast devices.&nbsp; When you start offending loyal MS customers to this extreme, your "security policy" might be overkill.</p>

            <p>If you make the change BEFORE you lose access to the alternate mailbox or phone number, you will never have an issue. For alternate addresses, it is good practice to have more than one. With free mailboxes being so readily available, there's simply no impediment
 to having more than one. Create addresses at Yahoo and Google and add those as well so you always have one available to enable you to make changes. I myself have five addresses from four separate mail providers so that this can never happen to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your phone vendor would have zero effect on this situation.</p>

    <title>make an excel sheet look more like a pdf - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            make an excel sheet look more like a pdf</h2>
                    I had another question and one of you came up big...hoping for it again. I have a excel sheet that prints on 2 pages. it is for counting money at my church... I have six people that do this and they are not what you would call pc savvy at all... anyway
 all they do is count the amount of each denomination of cash and it does the math for them... (example there is 20 $20 bills they simply put 20 and it generates $400.. no math involved it then adds up the total... and for checks it does the same  this then
 goes to another sheet for the bank... lots of formulas.... i like everything about it except that it looks like a excel sheet instead of a clean pdf.. i removed the grid and ruler but they still tab or enter there way through it hoping all over. and the view
 just doesn't fit the screen as nice as i would like... so is there a way to view it or save it in another form where it doesn't look like a spread sheet but like a form and as user friendly as a form?

            Hello,
<br /> The best format for what you need is the .pdf. I understand the thing about it doesn't fit into the screen, but you could manage that modifying the page size and/or the orientation of you excel sheet to be adjusted to the look you need, so when you save it as a .pdf file you will have on the same page.

            Well, to do it you are going to need a third party tool and I am afraid it is not free, so I can't recommend you any. I thought you only need some format that doesn't allow the users to modify the content of the file, my bad, my apologies for the misunderstanding. But if you need that the users be able to modify only part of the file you could lock the cells you don't want the users to edit and let the others one unlocked for them to edit it. See the article below about this excel feature, the only problem is that your document will still looks like a excel sheet in case you are concern about the appearance as well.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 is not showing emails received in past 2 days</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, my Outlook 2016 went bonkers. &nbsp;In my Inbox, I could only see emails received in the past 2 weeks. &nbsp;I reset my IMAP account and got all my emails received since 09/21/2015. &nbsp;Today, I can only see my emails received since Monday. &nbsp;Outlook indicates
 I am connected to the server and I receive emails from the account I have on the exchange server, just not the IMAP account. &nbsp;Has anyone else encountered this situation and if yes, how did you fix it?</p>

 The company checked the number of devices accessing my email account (i.e. work/home desktops, laptop when I travel &amp; my cell phone).&nbsp; All are configured as IMAP email accounts.&nbsp; While we were talking, there was a device accessing the email account via a POP
 acct.&nbsp; We changed my password to deny the POP acct access.&nbsp; The company thinks that the emails were deleted via the POP acct.&nbsp; I am not sure that is what happened, but the employee didn't provide any other explanation.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Santi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the delayed response on your inquiry.&nbsp;Let me help you with your concern about not being able to receive emails on your account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some instances where a user does not receive emails on the account due to the following reasons:</p>
<p><span><font>&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p>-Email rules on your account.</p>
<p><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span>-Junk Mail Filtering Settings. </p>
<p>-The contacts that you have on blocked and safe senders list.</p>
<p>-Your mailbox is full. A bounce message will usually follow after the user has sent the message indicating that this is the reason why the message cannot go through the mailbox of the recipient.</p>
<p><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span>- The domain that you are using or where you registered your mailbox is not properly configured. If this will be the case, you may need to contact the domain administrator or email provider to check if they are having technical
 issues on their end.</p>
<p><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span>- Email forwarding is enabled on your account.</p>
<p><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p>You can visit this <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/email/im-not-receiving-emails-sent-by-my-family-or/377a9bf3-7975-4d76-a6eb-04dcc6d68097">
<font>article</font></a> for additional information and helpful contents on receving emails on your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If in case after doing the troubleshooting steps did not resolve the issue, I have created private message tab for you so that you can provide the affected account and we can investigate the account to determine the root cause of the issue.</p>
<p><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p>Please click on "You have a private reply to this message" link just above your post to view the message. Don't forget to sign in to Microsoft Community Forum to view the link.</p>

                    <p>I can't see a pattern but "daily task list" below the calendar is set to "By Due Date" and some tasks that are due that day is not showing up in the list for that day.&nbsp; I didn't import the items but sometimes will add them via Office365 on the web.&nbsp; Only
 seems to be a problem with 2013 since I have never seen the problem in 2010.</p>

Definitely a bug of some kind.&nbsp; It is an active task with a due date of today.&nbsp; Shows in the side list (although I show it grouped by category for GTD)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found one example of when I put this on my task list from the web and here it is in Outlook.&nbsp; Not showing in the Daily Task List for today</p>

            <p>Second Tasks bug, not sure if this is correct forum.&nbsp; I am using Office365 after the latest upgrade with Office 2013 so not sure if it is just Office365 or anyone on Exchange 2013 with Office 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This bug is recreatable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a sample task on Office365 WebApp&nbsp;(and probably OWA on Exchange 2013)</li><li>Set due date as today &lt;06/13/2013&gt; and save</li><li>Task will show on Outlook correctly</li><li>On Office365 WebApp, in left task list, click "Mark Complete" on popup icon when hovering over task in list</li><li>Task details pane will show "<span>This task was completed on 6/12/2013 &lt;yesterday&gt;.</span>&nbsp; Outlook will also reflect this</li><li>If completing the task in Office365 by clicking the "Completed" button on the task pane or from within the task, puts the correct task completed date.</li></ol>
<p>Could be related to the time problem above or an entirely new issue.</p>

<h2>            Lucia 950xl repairs</h2>
                    <p>My phone has suffered damage by being momentarily immersed in sea water. It will no longer switch on but it was "running" very hot so I've removed the battery. I have dried the phone of course but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive ordered a replacement which should be with me in a day or two. However I think it would be a good idea to get the faulty one repaired so that it can act as a replacement in future if something similar happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone recommend &nbsp;a suitable repair outlet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            I'm guessing if it was immersed in "sea water" it is probably not worth repairing if it got wet enough to wet the interior.

                    <p>Hi, I am trying to import (link to) a csv text file (Access 2007). </p>
<p>When I do this the link wizard pops up with the error "bad file name or number". What does this mean? The file is 7.5GB - is this a file size issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it is clear to me. The Full-layout Touch Keyboard is only available for some languages (as yet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seem to have read about this in the Release notes of one of the pre-16257 builds. You might find more info there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, you'll have to wait until it is made available in your language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

            If you downloaded an exe or msi file, you need to run it on your pc with your device connected through Activesync. If it's a cab file, copy it directly to your smartphone and click to run setup. If none of the above works, it means that the file is not
 intended for your device.
