<h2>            Windows XP ISO</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm trying to follow the book "Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Approach" and I need to install Windows XP on a virtual machine to follow the exercises. Is there a way I can get access to this (potentially through my university)? I would rather not risk
 malware by torrenting an illegal copy. The book also uses a copy of Windows 7 SPI.</p>

            It'd probably be better to ask the university if they have any programs for this, but other options include a MSDN subscription from Microsoft - but that's super pricey just to use an outdated OS.

<h2>            Skype&#58; Unable to unblock &#47; unrestrict account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently (I believe sometime between Wednesday and Thursday), my account became blocked / restricted when I try to access it through the application on my computer. I clicked the link to unblock / unrestrict my account but I got a message stating there was
 nothing wrong with my account. I also tried to unblock / unrestrict my account from the link when traversing through the FAQs on the Skype website, but the account I am logged into has no money associated with it (the account that I access through the application
 on my computer does have money on it). Finally, I tried to look for a contact email, number, or chat, for support, but was not able to find one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide me with contact information for support.</li><li>Fix my account so I can make calls again (e.g. so that it is unblocked / unrestricted).</li><li>Tell me how I can fix my account.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Character will stop running or sprinting then resume a split second later</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an orgional xbox 360 elite.&nbsp; the first black ones to come out?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, I really don't know how to sum this up.&nbsp; But, here's what happens.&nbsp; If Im playing a game, in these examples the games I'm referring to are 'Dark Souls, Mw2, Halo reach' my guy will stop walking or running and I have to wiggle the joystick to get him
 going again.&nbsp; but juuuuuust for a SPLIT second.&nbsp; enough to take me out of my sprint\ run and then I have to push the command to run/sprint AGAIN.&nbsp; Nothing big but a major annoyance when it happens RIGHT befor a cliff or whatever and I end up jumping short
 (ESP. D.souls Auuughhh).</p>
<p>Im guessing it has to do with the Wireless Internet connection I have.&nbsp; Probly due to LAG??&nbsp; but then one day I tried turnig off my router, and playing Darkk souls OFFLINE.&nbsp; still doin the same thing.&nbsp; just stops walking for a split second, then resumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 almost as if the controller dies.&nbsp; very annoying.&nbsp; thought it might be the disc,&nbsp; no.&nbsp; discs are fine.&nbsp; Im kinda thinking it has to do with my HDD.&nbsp; Cuz, sometimes when I go to clear my HDD cache, it doesn't load what types of storage devices I have; it just
 keeps trying to 'load.' the devices.</p>
<p>Its a minor thing yes, however, my enjoyment quickly ends when I die for no good reason in Dark souls(AUUUGH, I JUST GOT 10,000 SOULS AND 4 HUMANITYS!!!!).&nbsp; also, my thumb starts to get sore from clicking the left stick in M.W.2 just so I can&nbsp;resume sprinting.</p>
<p>Idk.&nbsp; any suggestions?</p>
<p>Also, real quick, why are wireless connections slower than wired?&nbsp; ie more lag?&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks guys.</p>

<p>Hiya,<br />
<br />
It's possible it has something to do with your XBOX 360 or your controller? Have you attempted to try a different controller (wired or wireless?)<br />
<br />
As far as it being your storage device, you can actually check this by removing your hard drive and using a USB Flash Drive momentarily. Just configure the USB Flash Drive, download your profile, and then start up a game and see if you still experience this
 weird stopping in sprint or pause.<br />
<br />
As far as your question about why wireless connections are slower than wired, it's simply because a wired connection is well hardwired allowing for data to travel faster. With wireless your signal needs to travel from your wireless router back to the wireless
 device so you lose a bit of connection speed in the process.<br />
<br />
Let us know if those suggestions above work out for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sounds like a controller issue more than network , try another controller and if its fine check your battery (fully charged? seated correctly?) on the one with issues</p>

<p>As Bunta San said, try to replace your controller battery or plug it in the charging cable (in case of built-in battery). Also try to remove objects standing between you and the console or if you are too far from the console, move closer.</p>
<p>Also, if the controller is old enough the joystick may has been damaged because of years of using it very often.</p>
<p>To clear that out, borrow one controller from a friend of yours, match the controller with your console and see if it runs smoothly.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Wireless connections are not actually that much slower than wired as I have been using a wireless controller with recharger packs most of my xbox career. &nbsp;From past experience I do know that after dropping the controller a couple of times the controller
 can get damaged in a variety of ways. &nbsp;</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ My usual dilemma is that if I barely move the joystick then leave it alone it tends to just move the camera or character round and round very slowly. &nbsp;I usually get around this by popping the stick out then popping it back in. &nbsp;It won't move much but that
 always helps for me.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ In the event that it does not work the best solution would indeed be to either get a new controller or perhaps try resyncing the controller to the xbox and see if that helps.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Sometimes it can just be the batteries so I would try to replace the batteries as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Wireless connections are only as slow as the speed that your router can put out. &nbsp;The faster the speed of the router the less lag you have. &nbsp;As far as controllers go there really isnt any lag there unless a hardware related issue is happening.</p>

<p>Hey guys. &nbsp;I can't believe I didn't think of mentioning, that no, my controllers are fine. &nbsp;I thought it was them as well. &nbsp;I tested them at a friends house, both of them. &nbsp;Both with using their wireless setup, and their wired setup. &nbsp;So I think it just
 has to do with hard ware. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, last night I tried a test. &nbsp;I put all three games in while online, and in a match(sorry team mates!) &nbsp;and simply ran around the maps. &nbsp;alas, they all displayed the sprint shudder. &nbsp;at one point I even stopped walking.(my character was still making the
 'running' animation in MW2) then I gained controll again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>then I logged off, and unhoooked the wireless connection, and played on a different account while OFFLINE. &nbsp;tried the same thing, ran around the maps. &nbsp;This time, I did not suffer from any sprint shudders or stopping while still giving the command to sprint.</p>
<p>I think this is a simple issue of LAG, and or hardware issues. &nbsp;I guess I just have to put up with it until I buy the new HALO 4 edition. &nbsp;(yeah, like I'm made of money *rolls eyes*)</p>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions. &nbsp;I give up. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>john, I'd recommend making a batch script and copying it into any directory your going to make a new folder in at anytime its just a quick fix but it'll make it easier then opening up a command prompt every time you want to make a folder&nbsp;</p>
<p>@echo off<br />
set /p foldername= what do you want to name your new folder?:<br />
mkdir %foldername%<br />
echo %foldername% created press any key to continue<br />
</p>
<p>save as .bat in notepad&nbsp;</p>
<p>theres &nbsp;no error handling be careful not to overwrite anything&nbsp;</p>
<p>it'll make the folder wherever the file is saved&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

            I was able to create a new FOLDER by changing the view/sort/arrange by options in the folder i was trying to create a sub folder in. &nbsp;It would appear that with certain view combinations you cannot create a new folder, only a new zip folder. &nbsp;Thanks again
 Microsoft - I long for XP. &nbsp;Also you have royally screwed up Skype in Windows 8. Also I have had to reinstall 8 after updates were delivered as certain functions ceased to work with the update. Sorry for the rant.

<p>
</p><p>I tried to reproduce this issue, but was able to create a new folder with various View/Sort/arrange options. So the issue you are facing could be caused due to some incorrect settings or due to some corrupt system files. I would suggest you to try these

            <p>I gone back to Windows 8 as Microsoft do not seem to want to know they can keep Windows 10. Absolute rubish and wasted a whole weekend of my time trying to sort it out. I have also advised all my friends on facebook to leave well alone too, and they already
 reported upgrade issue.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>My HP M7 is also having issues....I upgraded on the 1st and the first couple days was great then...</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing that popped up is when I shut down the PC through right clicking on Start it (or any other means) it acts like it puts it into sleep mode...Power button LED, Power LED on the side, and the Mute button LED stay on. &nbsp;The PC will not wake therefor
 I have to do a hard shutdown to turn it back on. &nbsp;I've adjusted power option, but no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next thing I noticed that started a couple days later was the Start menu, Cortana, task bar and Windows update. &nbsp;Right clicking on icons in the task bar doesn't work (and as of logging in tonight the icons and tray items have not loaded), Start menu and
 Cortana won't open. &nbsp;When these issues happen I try to see if there is a update, but Windows Search and myself can't find Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reboot these issues usually go away and sometimes pop back up later as I use the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if Microsoft could shed some light on these issues. &nbsp;It is really bothering me since this laptop isn't that old (bought back in January).</p>

<h2>            Tiger Woods 12 has robbed me&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I had the chance to reclaim my #1 spot at The Masters in my second season, so I had to play simultaneously with TW.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 1st round (of 2) I hit -11, while he hits +1. After one hole of the 2nd round he is at -65! All the way round he's at that score and the leaderboard shows he has played all 18 holes of round 2 in 6 shots! Yet the commentators are talking about his
 +3 round lol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What annoys me is I innitially dropped for #1 to #2 without losing&nbsp;a tournament and then this happens. I just hope it doesn't effect the #1 for 281 weeks and the win 7 Masters achievements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disappointing glitch, annoying glitch and a bit of joke to be honest.</p>

            <p>This did not resolve. Same problem occuring after last Windows 10 cumulative update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be a problem with NVIDIA DRIVERS in general judging by the Microsoft forum!</p>

            I had the latest NVIDIA drivers before the update, after AE update it broke the driver, I did clean install, scanned WinUpdate, even manually selecting the proper driver from device manager. It should've never have&nbsp;happen to stable drivers. Now I'm stuck
 with the basic video driver. Going to try the PC Guru hacked drivers to see if that works...

            Well i guess its probably hepped up with loads of anti-virus softwares ripping apart system performance...dont take it wrong...<br />
<br />
i would suggest you to remove all the anti-virus or anti-spyware out and download, install and scan using malwarebytes...a light weight scanner for malicious softwares...also is a free download...<br />
<br />
you can download it with the below link....<br />
<br />
www.malwarebytes.org<br />
<br />
then update and scan the whole computer...this would try to remove majority of the malware from the computer if any exists..once done then visit the below link..<br />
<br />
http://housecall.trendmicro.com/housecall7/<br />
<br />
and then using the online scanner scan your computer for viruses....coz malwarebytes will remove only malwares(malicious softwares) whose primary intent would be information disclosure...but however will not take or take to a lesser degree in quarantining the
 viruses(programs meant for both information disclosure and cyber vandalism)...<br />
<br />
after performing the above tasks and healing your computer to a recoverably limit then installyour favourites...mcafee or any...but please beware that you got to stop or disable windows defender when you are running any other anti-virus softwares coz due to
 inter-process conflict a race condition may happen within both of them and in turn take a bounty of your system performance...<br />
<br />
<br />
if neother of the above works...the only option would be to try a system restore...if even worse...reinstallation may be the viable choice as its better to reinstall the OS taking a backup of all your data rather than trying to cure it for days together.....hope
 this helps....<br />
<br />
if not please do post back...<br />

    <title>US&#47;Canada account migration problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ati18  say:</h3>
<h2>            US&#47;Canada account migration problems</h2>
                    
<p>Just wanted to let the developers at Xbox live know about an issue regarding migration of Xbox live accounts between USA and Canada. &nbsp;Four years ago I had to cancel and create a new account when I moved from USA to Canada, and just five minutes ago did the
 opposite as I just moved back to the US. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically, the issue is that when you have a US/Canadian account, your billing address and card info is locked to that country. &nbsp;Once you make the move and cancel the old credit card, making subscription payments for your account with anything other than
 points cards is impossible (unless those are country specific also...are they?).</p>
<p>Given account migration to Russia, South Africa, etc. is supported, why not include for the (I presume more common) case of Canada-US and US-Canada? &nbsp;Have had to start over twice now, gamerscore wiped clean. &nbsp;This is pretty frustrating, Microsoft.</p>

<p>There is no "migration" between the US and Canada. You would simply need to have an account whose region matches where you physically live. If that doesn't match, you would need to create/use a different account.</p>

                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have got a new pc and i wanted to start to play an online game called "dmo". I downloaded it and installed it and it shows me the following error: "Activation context generation failed for "c:\MoveGames\DMO_GSP\DMLauncher.exe". Dependent Assembly Microsoft.VC80.CRT,processorArchitecture="x86",publicKeyToken="1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b",type="win32",version="8.0.50727.6195"

<br />
I tried everything commented ab this subject before, de- and reinstalling the c++ programmes, Installing a new net framework and so on.. I don't know what to do anymore, need help.
<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!</p>

</p><p>- Ok ! You have tried reinstalling C++ and .NET Framework, but this does not tell us everything you have</p>
<p>already tried, and does not tell us which versions of C++ and .NET Framework you installed/reinstalled.</p>
<p>To save yourself having to read suggestions for fixes you have already tried you need to list them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[ <em>EDIT: Oops! </em>Forgot this was the Win7 forum. Have to change some things.
</p>
<p>If the game uses C++ 2005 it would use .NET 3.5, but you may want to update .NET to 4.5 as well,</p>
<p>if you have not already. ]</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- VC80.crt&nbsp; is a component of C++ 2005, but C++ 2005 has several sub-versions. Some of the sub-versions
</p>
<p>are modified from the original version by the software developer, so in this instance using the installer that
</p>
<p>comes with the game is the safest option for getting the correct sub-version. </p>
<p>If there is no vcredist.exe&nbsp; in a sub-folder in the games install folder you should be able to use</p>
<p>the main C++ 2005 download from MS.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once .NET 3.5 and C++ 2005 are sorted out, if you still have problems it may be to do with Adobe Flash and</p>
<p>Shockwave Player not being up to date. I'm not familiar with this game, but believe Facebook games run in</p>
<p>Adobe&nbsp;Flash or Shockwave&nbsp; Players.</p>

            <p>- Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game (reboot after) ?</p>
<p>- When you reinstalled C++ did you reboot after uninstalling and again after reinstalling ?</p>
<p>- With the base version of MS C++ 2005 installed and .NET 3.5.1 activated, if you are still having problems<br />
there are still a number of potential causes for this error that you can troubleshoot.
</p>
<p>First try running System File Checker. This may fix any corrupt files associated with this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1538-sfc-scannow-command-system-file-checker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SFC /SCANNOW Command - System File Checker - Windows 7 Forums</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Still not happening ?- You haven't by chance deleted the WinSxS folder, or any files from within WinSxS ?</p>
<p>- Have you run the <em>sxstrace.exe</em> command as suggested by the error yet&nbsp; ( it's a bit complicated, so</p>
<p>you will need to do a search for how to run sxstrace.exe for a tutorial ) ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Back on .NET... Have you looked for .NET 3.5.1&nbsp; in Programs and Features &gt; <em>
</em></p>
<p><em>Turn Windows Features on and off&nbsp;</em> yet ?<br />
If&nbsp; .NET 3.5.1 in not enabled here doing so should help with your game.<br />
[ I was on Win10 last night and thought that Win7 still had .NET 3.5 listed in Programs and Features along<br />
with .NET 4.5, but&nbsp; I had a look at Win7 today,&nbsp; and see that .NET 3.5.1 gets enabled, or disabled, in the
<br />
Turn Windows Features on and off&nbsp; section of Programs and Features (as it&nbsp; does on Win10 ).&nbsp; ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If there is a forum for the game you may still find a fix for an issue that is inherent in the game on</p>
<p>those forums.</p>

            What is the format (extension) of the file? I can only&nbsp;<br />
guess .WMV which is a movie format and the way <br />
to recover the individual photos would be to make <br />
screen captures. <br />
<br />
Be aware the screen captures will not be the same <br />
resolution as the original photos.<br />
<br />
The freeware VLC Media Player can do the screen <br />
captures.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
VLC Media Player<br />
<a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_vlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_vlc/</a><br />
(runs on XP/Vista/7)<br />
<br />
To setup for your screen captures...open VLC and<br />
go to...Tools / Preferences / Video button / Video<br />
Snapshots section.<br />
<br />
In the directory field...Browse to and select a folder<br />
to save your captures in. (for example...you could<br />
create a new folder on your desktop and select it)<br />
<br />
At...Prefix...check the box...Sequential numbering.<br />
<br />
At...Format...choose JPEG or PNG.<br />
<br />
Finally.....left click the 'Save' button.<br />
<br />
Now...Play the video and pause by pressing your<br />
Spacebar when you see a screen you wish to capture.<br />
<br />
To capture the screen...type...&nbsp; Shift+S<br />
<br />
Press spacebar to advance to the next photo...<br />
ect...etc...<br />
<br />
The following article&nbsp;may also&nbsp;be worth a look:<br />
(DVD or otherwise the goal is still to capture still shots from video)<br />

    <title>Wifi user name and password are cleared before I can enter them - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wifi user name and password are cleared before I can enter them</h2>
                    <p>Regularly one must enter a user name and password in wifi connections.</p>
<p>The problem is that windows clears these even before I finished entering them.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'm halfway through the user name, sometimes I can start entering the password, but before I'm through Windows (or something) clears the both of them. And I can restart.</p>
<p>Usually I succeed after some 5 trials and I can click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens with two totally different Wifi networks.</p>
<p>It happens on 2 laptops (one running Windows 10 Pro, the other Win 10 Home).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think it is Windows related.</p>
<p>What keeps clearing these boxes before I finished them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello,<br />
thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>To answer your questions:<br />
‚Ä¢'Do you delete the wireless network profile each time you exit Windows?'</p>
<p>No I don't delete the profile each time I exit Windows. I tried creating the profile manually but that didn't help so I deleted it again. At this moment there are no profiles for the wifi networks I'm having trouble with. For 2 other wifi networks there
 is a profile, yet these networks open a webpage where I fill in the username and password. So they have another way of authentification and work fine.<br />
‚Ä¢'Do you mean that you are unable to provide Wifi network credentials when you say 'Windows clears these even before I finished entering them'? Does it delete the input characters even when the cursor is typing?'<br />
Yes and Yes. Well like I said after some 5 trials I manage to put in the user name en password, if I type fast enough before everything is cleared.
<br />
‚Ä¢'Do you use any third party antivirus software on both the laptops in question?'<br />
I use Malwarebytes Ant-Exploit Free (next to WIN10 virus software).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the following:</p>
<p>- updated the wifi driver: didn't help.</p>
<p>- stopped Malwarebytes Ant-Exploit Free: didn't help.</p>
<p>- placed to computer in a clean boot: didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to be clear I use one other Wifi network which uses authentification via a web page. This works fine (I'm using it right know). It's when I have to type in user name and password in the pane with all the Wifi connections the problems start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I've timed it. The boxes for user name and password are cleared +/- every 15 seconds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

            <p>I know I am late to the party here but what I did and it worked for me was to go through and forget every single network. There was probably at least 30. Once I did that I restarted the computer and tried connecting to the WiFi and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, this is a different issue where it does connect to a network but says there is no internet, are the devices set to manually set a IP address or DNS server address (for me I was tinkering with an old router, turning it into a bridge client and forgot
 to set it back to automatically receive an IP address and DNS sever address)?</p>

            <p>I realize I'm a little late to the party, but I experienced the same problem last night and it's been resolved today and none of the comments here were helpful, so I figured I'd add my 2 cents for anyone in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is a problem with the network connection point to which you're trying to get online. Last night, I was trying to connect to my university's wifi network in one building and experienced this exact problem. I restarted multiple times and disabled
 all third-party software that could've been interfering with my connection but nothing helped. Other Windows 10 users were connected without issue as well. This morning I was able to connect to the same network from a different building, which leads me to
 believe that the specific problem was with the router to which I was attempting to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            Same problem here, and I have it on Windows 10 Mobile. I see that there is still no solution to this problem. On a phone it is difficult to enter the credentials in &lt;5 seconds, so this workarounds fail for me. I cannot connect to the Wifi. If anyone is
 wondering, I have the Creators Update and latest updates installed.

            The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MRT) is not a substitute for an antivirus application.&nbsp; When you download it, it runs
<b>once </b>(the MRT does not stay active in the background or run everytime you start your computer) and searches for any existing infections that it recognizes and attempts to remove them.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
After you've run the MRT, you remain vulnerable to subsequent infection from any malware, including any that the MRT may have removed, unless you have a separate antivirus application with a current subscription.<br />
<br />
A new version of the MRT, with updated malware information, is downloaded every month on "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Patch Tuesday</a>."&nbsp; If you want to re-run the MRT at any time before it gets downloaded again the
 next month, search your computer for MRT.exe.&nbsp; It normally is located in C:\Windows\system32.<br />

            its fixed . Its was because of windows defender. to enable VT i had to disable hyper V . But windows defender wasnt allowing it. when i untick hyperv , the selection tick goes but actually it doesnt gets disabled due to windows defender. Then i disabled
 it and its now working fine

<h2>            Update 1809 deleted files</h2>
                    <p>Windows update 1809 installed automatically on Feb 9th. It lost all of my files. I found them and copied them back to My Documents/Pictures?videos etc. I also set up Outlook again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Feb 12th an update happened again and all files were gone. Outlook also lost my profile again. I can't find the files. I set up outlook again, but each time I restart / reboot it goes away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find anything about this online yet. I doubt that I am the only one who this happened to? Is there a fix</p>

            Hi TO.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Where are you finding these files?  Are they in OneDrive?  
<br />
<br />OneDrive introduced some features that remove files from the hard drive and store them only in the cloud if Files On Demand is chosen in OneDrive Settings:  <a href="https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/introducing-onedrive-files-on-demand-and-additional-features-making-it-easier-to-access-and-share-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/intro...</a>
<br />
<br />Also if the new Folder Protection is chosen in OneDrive Settings &gt; AutoSave Tab, then Documents, Desktop and Pictures folders will be moved into the OneDrive folder.  See Folder Protection details here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Strangely, recent Updates have set these on by default and even caused file losses that resulting in withdrawing the October Version 1809 Upgrade.  So I would check closely those OneDrive Settings, your OneDrive folder, the PC Recycle Bin,  and also check the Onedrive Online Recycle Bin.
<br />
<br />Some Updates can also cause Windows 10 to start into a temporary profile which should be obvious because you don't recognize anything, in which case files should still be in your old Profile at C:\Users.  
<br />
<br />Finally sometimes if an Update fails it will archive files in C:\windows.old.  
<br />
<br />So look in all of those places, starting with OneDrive online files and online Recycle Bin.  Right click OneDrive cloud icon in System tray to "View Online."
<br />
<br /> BACKUP SUGGESTIONS:
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because a hard drive can die at any time without notice.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can sync your Desktop, Documents and Pictures folder in Onedrive using Folder protection, or just drag valuable files into OneDrive folder, offering 5gb free with additional space for cheap: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>   You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.  
<br />

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not set up onedrive on this computer.&nbsp; After the Feb 9th update I located my files under the windows.old folder. I copied them back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Feb 12th another update forced my wife to either update and shut down, or update and restart. She did the shut down. The next day, all files were gone again, and Outlook was as though it had never been installed. I was out of town and did not see it until
 later on the 13th.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up the outlook account again. After rebooting, it was gone. This has happened three times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did an update take anything off of my computer and force it onto the cloud? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time all files are gone. I worked with Microsoft Tech Support to try to find them. Gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the profile. I am still logged in as the proper user, doesn't appear to be a temp profile.</p>

            First try the methods here to Manage Updates after Version 1803:  
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-update-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-up...</a>
<br />
<br /> You can block Windows Updates by setting a Metered Connection, see here:  
<br /><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-...</a>
<br />
<br />More prominent tech columnists and experts are recommending to do this:
<br /><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/microsoft-windows/its-time-make-sure-windows-auto-update-is-turned-off.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you can install them when you want.  There are even good reports from users now who've had them shut off for awhile and only install the Version Upgrades twice a year from the Media Creation Tool which is the most stable method anyway, and includes all previous Updates rolled in. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it.  I will vote up the feedback with my MVP badge and also monitor and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />
<br />Please do not mark "No" to the popup asking if this post helped you, as it will remove my ability to help you further.  Just ignore it until problem is solved.

            It's probably being installed along with those other modern apps that are queued for Startup.  You can check their progress in the Microsoft Store app Settings under Updates and Downloads.  
<br />
<br />But the problem is that app is regularly buggy itself so it may be best if things don't sort out in a day or so to run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This reinstalls WIndows while saving your files and apps in place; takes about an hour, resolves most problems.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then I'd  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.

    <title>Skype Translator stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cedricbanker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Translator stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I have created some chat translation channels with friends. The channels have been working for months. Yesterday, the translation stopped working. Is there perhaps a translation server, which stopped working? If I try to make a new translation channel, it
 no longer prompts me about which languages I am translating to and from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, all of the translation channels I use have stopped translating. Either from me to the other person(s) or from the other person(s) to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has happened? How does it get fixed? Is it a known bug from Microsoft's side that will get fixed soon?</p>

            Yes, your understanding is correct. Translation service is giving problems. Microsoft engineers are working on it. No Turn Around Time is committed though.

<br />Some users have been reporting throughout today Skype Translator is not working. I encourage you try reporting the issue so the engineers are aware of the problem.

<p>I don't have a resolution to the problem, sorry. I'm only responding because I'm having an identical issue with the Skype Translator. One minute it was working fine, suddenly an upgrade came in and from that point on, it stopped working. I've tried all the
 suggestions, between my cell and laptop and still nothing works that I tried. So I hope not the community, but Microsoft stop hiding the ball and comes up with a solution that fixes that problem or find a new bot that works.</p>

<h2>            Connection Problem</h2>
                    My parents desktop is&nbsp;running windows 7. When opening the browser the error comes up You're not connected to a network. When I click fix connection problems it comes up as The "Local Area Connection" is experiencing driver or hardware issues. When I go
 to windows updates to check for updates it comes up error code 802400F You need to connect to the Internet to check for updates. So basically if I'm understanding it right I have to connect to the Internet in order to get my Internet to work. My laptop is
 running fine wirelessly connected so it isn't the router or modem. Please any help would be appreciated.

<p>Hello all,<br />
I noticed the other day there is a yellow triangle for Intel Turbo Boost Driver in my Device Manager.<br />
Under the General Tab, this is what I see: "This device cannot start. (Code 10)"<br />
I uninstalled the driver, and then re-installed the driver with the latest updates and the driver is still not working?
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>You sure can.&nbsp; I adapted the instructions below from the following page:</p>

<p>
</p><p>And it works well.&nbsp; Here's how.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Notepad and paste in these 3 lines.<br />
<br />
<strong>Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms</strong><br />
<strong>$screen = [System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation]::VirtualScreen</strong><br />
<strong>[Windows.Forms.Cursor]::Position = "10,10"</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Save the file with a <strong>.ps1</strong> name (that's a number one at the end, not an I or L), being careful in the Save box to select "all files (*.*)" in the File type drop down when you save it.&nbsp; Example:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96eaab65-bbe8-4cbc-bf8c-c5d3445ab888" /><br />
<br />
You can save this file anywhere you like. I recommend your C:\ drive or something, because this is not the file anyone will actually be using directly.&nbsp; You need to create a shortcut to it instead.&nbsp; I'll assume you saved it under
<strong>C:\MoveMouse.ps1</strong> for the rest of this post.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>On your desktop, right-click and make a New &gt; Shortcut.&nbsp; Use the following as the location of your shortcut item:<br />
<br />
<strong>powershell.exe c:\MoveMouse.ps1</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Right-click your newly created shortcut and go to properties, and assign a keyboard shortcut to it.&nbsp; I used Ctrl-Shift-M for mouse.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>That's it.&nbsp; Now whenever you press Ctrl-Shift-M, this script command file will run, and move your mouse to location 10,10 on the screen (just inside the top-left corner of the screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enjoy :)</p>

<h2>            ASUS T100 won&#39;t turn on after Windows updates</h2>
                    I just bought a refurbished ASUS T100. Came in the mail yesterday so I&nbsp;opened&nbsp;it and began&nbsp;the setup process. Once setup was done, there was of course Windows updates to be done. I completed two batches&nbsp;of updates successfully. The third batch&nbsp;of updates
 was a very large quantity so I decided to leave it on the charger and allow it to update while I slept. They literally took all night to download and install. When I got up this morning, it was finally restarting. I went downstairs for 30 minutes. When I&nbsp;came
 back upstairs, the tablet was completely off. It has been on the charger all night, but now it won't turn on. It will start to power up, but then the screen just shows me a battery with the battery level about a quarter full and red. If it has been charging
 all night, how could it possibly not have enough charge to start up after updates? Could something in the updates have fried it? I really need this resolved ASAP as I bought this to use for my colle

<p>Obviously, you do not get it, so lets try again.&nbsp; In the mail app and Yahoo, if someone sends an attached photo, it does not come up as small pic that you can hover over, and it will show download with an arrow, so you click the arrow, and it downloads to
 Photos etc.&nbsp; The pic comes up full screen in mail , so you have to right click, pick out save as.... from menu, etc. Get me now?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to us with the required information. I would like to assist you with further information from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mail app in Windows enables you to receive and download attachments. When an attachment arrives in an email, you'll recognize it: A paperclip icon rests next to the email's subject. And when you open the email, you see a generic photo thumbnail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below steps to save attachments using Mail App.<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Download the attached file.</strong></p>
<p>The Mail app doesn't download the files until you specifically give it the command. Instead, the Mail app places shows generic thumbnails ‚Äî placeholders for attached folders ‚Äî along the email's top edge.</p>
<p>You can save the file either of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click the attached file's generic thumbnail icon. When the thumbnail shows a miniature of the attached file, right-click it and choose Save.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Right-click the attached file and choose Download form the pop-up menu. When the download completes, the generic thumbnails fill in with photos representing the newly downloaded files.<br />
<br />
</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Choose a storage area to receive the saved file.</strong></p>
<p>File Explorer's Save As window appears, shown here, ready for you to save the file in your Documents folder. To save it someplace else, choose any folder listed along the Save As window's left edge. Or, click the words This PC, also on the window's left
 edge, and begin browsing to the folder that should receive the file.<br />
<br />
Saving the file inside one of your four main folders ‚Äî Documents, Pictures, Videos, or Music ‚Äî is the easiest way to ensure you'll be able to find it later. When you choose a folder, you see a list of existing folders where you can stash your new file.<br />
<br />
To create a new folder inside your currently viewed folder, click the New Folder button from the menu along the folder's top and, when the new folder appears, type in a name for the folder.<br />
<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Click the Save button in the Save As window's bottom-right corner.</strong><br />
The Mail app saves the file in the folder of your choosing.After you've saved the file, the attachment still remains inside the email. That's because saving attachments always saves a
<em>copy</em> of the sent file. If you accidentally delete or botch an edit on your saved file, you can always return to the original email and save the attached file yet again.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information is helpful. If you need further assistance, we would be happy to assist you further.</p>
