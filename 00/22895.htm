            S40 phones only allow Java apps and cannot multitask, so you can't have another application running 'in the background' as you can with smartphones, meaning that it is not possible to do this.

            The newest S40 models have some java apps running in background. F.ex. Windows live messenger in 6700 classic. So it could be possible? Havent seen such application though

    <title>Car Kit and 6021 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dangerous2a  say:</h3>
<h2>            Car Kit and 6021</h2>
                    Hi, For years I have had two 3051is and I think a CARK 124s. These had a chunky swivel mount cradle with a jack plug and DC connector in the bottom. I seem to recall they were actually for 6010 phones, but have always worked fine. There is an windscreen
 antenna linked into the box of tricks and reception is pretty good.<br />
<br />
Now I have changed to 6021 phones and have two CK7W kits to fit.<br />
<br />
My question is simple. I want to replicate the cradle for the old kit. I have searched the site but information is very sparse on this combination.<br />
<br />
Nokia websit shows the CR23 as suitable, but lacks details of how it connects to the CK7W, in fact it lacks many details at all on in car use. I appreciate that the 6021 is bluetooth, but Mrs dangerous wants a simple drop-in charge and use kit.<br />
<br />
Will the CK7W and CR23 together allow charging of the phone, and does the driver have to connect the data lead to the phone, or is this done when the phone sits in the cradle?<br />
<br />
Is it more practical to use a simple car charger and leave the phone in the glove box, allowing it to connect through its bluetooth method.<br />
<br />
Any ideas would be helpful.

            The CK-7w &amp; CR-23 combination will charge your phone and work a treat. There is a data cable that comes with the ck-7w which plugs into the bottom of the cradle not the phone, this connection is transfered to the phone just like your old kit did, the only
 difference to your old car kit is that it will work with other phones via Bluetooth wirless connection. However i do recommend you get a proffesional round to do the job because its not as simple as just plugging it all in. Good luck<br />

            Thanks for this response. Unfortunately the Nokia web pages are very poor in their description of these parts. From the information shown it is impossible to determine what does actually come with the cradle, or how it is mounted or connected. The "further
 information" tab just shows an enlarged picture. It is a fairly expensive item if the part does not do what I want, and inevitably to try it it has to be unpacked, and (quite rightly) this usually means that the vendor will not accept it back. Your help is
 appreciated. Regards Andrew

            Try opening you phone book and contacting a local installer, i am sure they will be more than happy to give a full demonstration before seliing the product. Too many people try and use the web to get a few quid off but loose the good old fashioned help
 and advice. This isnt a dig at you just a comment on the way we live today.<br />

    <title>Calculated field and creating relationship in Access 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Calculated field and creating relationship in Access 2013</h2>

<p>
</p><p>As you've found, you can't.<br />
<br />
I see nothing about <em>'calculated columns'</em> in the tutorial.&nbsp; I can think of no situation in which this would be appropriate, as a relationship object is created on the basis of a column or columns in one table being its primary key, or at least a candidate
 key, and the corresponding column or columns in another table being a foreign key.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if you could explain in real life terms what entity types are being related, and what attributes of the entity types are represented by the columns on which you are attempting to relate the tables, we would be able to advise further.<br />

            <p>I did a quick scan of that tutorial. Like Ken, I see nothing about being able to use a Calculated field in a relationship. So the error message you are getting is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The definition of a primary key Is a value that is unique and unchanging. A Calculated field doesn't match that description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are trying to use one in a relationship, then it is likely your tables are not designed properly. So explaining to use why you think you need to do this will help us help you.</p>

            Thank you both very much for taking your time to answer. &nbsp;So here is what I am confused still. &nbsp;In the video, I do see that the instructor used calculated field when he was creating a relationship with relationship wizard. &nbsp;It started from bout 1:06 into
 video. &nbsp;He used "Customer Name" (which is a calculated field, last name + First name) during the wizard tutorial. &nbsp;Can you please explain why he chose that calculated field, and how he was able to choose that calculated field (If I do the same on my database,
 I get the error that I was talking about) and also what effect/benefit, etc. comes from choosing that field? &nbsp;BTW, at the end of tutorial, I do see the result of this relationship is actually connected from "Customer ID" and not "Customer Name" in parent table.
 I could see this in relational map at the end of the tutorial. &nbsp;So, there is something that I am missing and something I am not understanding what happened in this video. &nbsp;Thank you for your a

            It's confusion like this which is why almost any experienced Access developer will advise avoiding the Lookup Field Wizard like the plague.&nbsp; For the reasons why see:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.mvps.org/access/lookupfields.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mvps.org/access/lookupfields.htm</a><br />
<br />
In the tutorial what the method illustrated actually does is create a relationship on the keys, but in the referencing Phone Numbers table the concatenated values of the two name columns which make up the 'calculated' column are shown for the foreign key column
 in the table's datasheet view.&nbsp; This is not the actual value of the column, however, which is a long integer number referencing the autonumber primary key of the Customers table.&nbsp;&nbsp; The end result is the kind of confusion you've experienced.<br />
<br />
Forget the Lookup Field Wizard.&nbsp; Create a foreign key of the appropriate data type in the referencing table, and create relationships on the keys via the relationships window.&nbsp; When you want to see the names you can do so in a form bound to the Phone Numbers
 table by using a combo box bound to the numeric foreign key column.&nbsp; In a report you base it on a query which joins the tables on the keys, returning the relevant columns from both tables and binding controls in the report to them.<br />

            <p>Relations are created between key fields in tables. The most common relationship is 1:many where a primary key in a parent table (the 1 side) is related to a foreign key in the many side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you can have composite keys, they are more cumbersome to work with. Generally using a surrogate key like an autonumber. So what happens is the Foreign key becomes a meaningless numeric value that the user never sees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example: You have an Order database. Customers make orders so there is a foreign key in the Orders table for the CustomerID. Most users won't know customers by their IDs so when you populate the FK in the Orders table, you use a combobox. Such a combo
 will store the CustomerID, but the user sees a list of customer names and chooses from that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has often been guilty of not following best practices in tutorials and templates. The whole lookup fields issue is an example.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Let's say you have a table Employees, which includes columns EmployeeID, FirstName and LastName, of which EmployeeID is an autonumber primary key.&nbsp; You also have a table ProjectEmployees which includes columns EmployeeID and ProjectID.&nbsp; In this table EmployeeID
 and ProjectID are foreign keys, the former referencing the primary key of Employees, the latter referencing the primary key of a Projects table.&nbsp; Both of these foreign key columns are straightforward long integer number data types, not autonumbers.<br />
<br />
If we assume you have a form bound to the ProjectEmployees table in which you wish to select employees for projects, the form would includes combo box bound to the EmployeeID column, set up as follows:<br />
<br />
ControlSource:&nbsp;&nbsp; EmployeeID<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName &amp; " " &amp; LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit of the last one to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.&nbsp; The combo box's drop down will list all employees
 by name, but when you select one the value of the control, and hence of the column to which it is bound, will be the value of the EmployeeID in the hidden first column.<br />
<br />
A form set up as above would usually be embedded in a projects form as a subform, the subform being linked to the parent form on ProjectID.&nbsp; There would be no need to include a combo box bound to the ProjectID foreign key column as its value is automatically
 set to the parent form's current ProjectID value by the linking mechanism.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
With reports, to list all projects and the employees assigned to them for instance, you would base the report on a query which joins all three tables:<br />
<br />
SELECT Projects.Project,<br />
Employees.FirstName &amp; " " &amp; Employees.Lastname AS FullName<br />
FROM Projects INNER JOIN (Employees INNER JOIN ProjectEmployees <br />
ON Employees.EmployeeID=ProjectEmployees.EmployeeID) <br />
ON Projects.ProjectID=ProjectEmployees.ProjectID;<br />
<br />
In the report you would bind text box controls to the Project and FullName columns.&nbsp; The latter is a computed column in the query.&nbsp; This is similar to a 'calculated' column in a table, but in this case the first and last name values are concatenated on the
 fly by the query, rather than in the base table.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few supplementary points:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Notice how in the above no table and column names include spaces or other special characters.&nbsp; This is another area where the Microsoft templates and tutorials fall below best practice.&nbsp; While spaces or special characters can be used in object names, it
 is strongly advised that you do not do so.&nbsp; Instead use CamelCase or represent a space with an underscore character, e.g. Last_Name.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; In the ProjectEmployees table above, the EmployeeID and ProjectID columns represent a composite key of the table, assuming an employee can only be assigned once to a project.&nbsp; Even if you were to add a separate autonumber primary key, the two foreign key
 columns are still a candidate key, and as such must be included in a unique index to protect the integrity of the data.&nbsp; In a case like the above there is no advantage in adding a separate 'surrogate' key; it merely adds an additional overhead as another index
 has to be maintained by the database engine.&nbsp; It is simpler to make the two foreign key columns a composite primary key.&nbsp; There can be advantages in some similar situations in adding a surrogate key, but only if the table is itself a referenced table in a
 one-to-many relationship type, as it then avoids the need for a composite foreign key in any referencing table(s).<br />

            So first you create a main form bound to the Customer's table and a subform bound to the Family Members table linked on CustomerID. Then use the combobox wizard to create a search combo (3rd option). The user selects a customer from the combo and the form
 populates with that customer's data and the subform shows the family members.&nbsp;

<h2>            excel 2016 cant open files by clicking on them - opens excel with no file &#40;empty&#47;bank&#41;</h2>
                    <p>excel 2010 worked no problem. I upgraded to office 365, which installed excel 2016. Now I cant open any excel files. I can open word files ok. &nbsp;If I double click on an excel file (even one I just created and saved!), it opens excel with a blank document
 area. &nbsp; &nbsp;The only work around I have found is to first open excel with no document, then go to the File tab, and open the file by navigating through the file system - VERY slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no error messages (visible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>office 2010 had no problems.</p>

            Dear LB270468,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Recently there were lots of changes with calendar so it is hard to tell if this is a bug or chnage of functionality. If you are unhappy with this change, all I can suggest is to submit your feedback to developers here <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/</a> If there will be enough votes, maybe developers will make changes or add functionality

            Go to menu-settings-configuration settings-personal settings- my web. Do not enter any data in any field &amp; press back. Do again with my access point. Now select these two as active settings &amp; access point. Now go to connectivity-wlan. Search &amp; save your
 wlan. Set the connection to do not ask. You will be able to connect using wlan only.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If the contacts had been manually added to your account, then you have the option to edit or delete them. For contacts that were synched or imported from other sites such as Facebook, there's no option to delete/edit them from your Hotmail account but the workaround
 for this is to delete or edit them in Facebook . Changes will then reflect on Hotmail.<br />

            <p>Hi there and thanks for the replies and I have finally managed to delete but it was not so simple!&nbsp; I realised that I's synced my Messenger with Skype and it appears because of this the delete option wasn't available within my outlook /hotmail/messenger
 accounts!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I did was went in via Skype, delete the contact there and then I was able to follow steps as noted above!&nbsp; It was strange as said contact had been added to Skype at a later date?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, all sorted now and thanks again for the help!</p>
<p>Mchael</p>

<p>
</p><p>Doe to a system conflict I deed&nbsp;refresh&nbsp;windows 8.1 original in my laptop, where&nbsp;I had&nbsp;installed also Microsoft Office 365 original.&nbsp; After refreshing Windows 8.1, I had to reinstall also&nbsp;my Microsoft&nbsp;Office&nbsp;365 original. Everything worked OK.

            Like most battery-powered devices, phone’s battery can get warm during excessive use. This is completely normal and does not prevent from using phone.<br />
However, if you feel that your phone is heating up to an abnormal temperature or too frequently, take it to a Nokia Care point for inspection.

<p>If the phone is getting warm and the battery is always discharging quickly and going flat, this probably means that you are constantly running one or more applications that use power hungry phone features, such as wifi connections, 3G internet connections,
 or GPS geotagging. Check whether any of your installed applications are loaded at startup and then keep running. Check if any applications are running in the background (press and hold down the middle button to see a list of running applications) and terminate
 them. Also check your phone connectivity settings and make sure that wifi connections and internet connections are set to "always ask" , not "connect automatically".</p>
<p>I've noticed that if I take photos and leave the camera application running in the background, the battery will usually discharge very quickly.</p>

<p>There's more than one cause for this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two most common causes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It's been a while since you logged into your Office application. </p>
<p>To fix this, open Word. If you see the template gallery, click the circle in the upper left corner. if it shows that you are logged in, log out, and then log back in. If you don't see the template gallery when you open Word, go to the File menu and choose
 New From Template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Your subscription to Office 365 expired.</p>
<p>To fix this, renew your subscription</p>

<p>Thank you for your answer. However, I tried the first solution and it is still not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About your second solution, I tried to install my Office pack on a Windows computer and it worked ! My Mac is saying that (see picture below). It is strange isn't it ?</p>

            You'll have to contact your Office 365 administrator (or perform this action yourself if you are the administrator). The account settings need to be changed to allow you to use Office on your Mac.

<p>I tried searching for an answer on this site and online and came up with nothing except for an app that looked outdated.</p>

<p>I see. And yes, just for you to isolate the issue if this is only an account issue since no issue with your mic settings.</p>

<h2>            Using multiple font colors in a single cell</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'd like to use two colors in a cell; Red and Green.</p>
<p>I want to use Red font color, if there is no condition.</p>
<p>The workbook and worksheets are protected.</p>
<p>In Sheet1, if column E has a value "Solved" then, I want to use Green color in column D(offset(0,-1)).Otherwise I want to use Red font color in a cell in column D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>Sorry,&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;if column E has a value "Solved" then, I want to use <strong>Green color in column D and Red color too</strong>.</span></p>
<p>Sub RedGreen()<br />
&nbsp; Dim cE As Integer, cElr As Integer &nbsp; 'column E ,and column E last row<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; Dim wsC As Worksheet<br />
&nbsp; Set wsC = ThisWorkbook.ActiveSheet&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; With wsC<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; cElr = .Cells(Rows.Count, "E").End(xlUp).Row<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For cE = 17 To cElr<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If .Range("E" &amp; cE) = "Solved" Then<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Unprotect Password:=xxx<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'.Range("E " &amp; cE).Offset(-1, 0).Font.Color = vbRed Or<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If .Cells(cE, 5).Offset(0, -1) &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Cells(cE, 5).Offset(0, -1).Font.Color = vbGreen Or _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Cells(cE, 5).Offset(0, -1).Font.Color = vbRed<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next cE<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .Protect Password:=xxxx<br />
<br />
&nbsp;End With<br />
</p>
<p>End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried above code, but as you can see, this is not working in a cell.</p>
<p>At least I want to unprotect sheet1 while entering text in a cell, then when finishing text, I want to protect sheet1.</p>
<p>Is this possible in excel ? Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi, you can do it with conditional formatting, go to cell D1, click on conditional formatting, New rule, last option "use a formula to determine which cell to format", in the format values where the formula is true enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>=E1="Solved"</p>
<p>
</p><p>click on Format, choose green, OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then highlight column D and click under font in the ribbon the icon that looks like a paint can select red, then copy format from D1 to the whole column D</p>
<p>when entering solved in column E column D will change to green</p>
        </p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>You should try using conditional formatting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the cells in Column D that will be either red or green.&nbsp; I assume your data start in Cell D2.</li><li>On the Home tab in the Ribbon, click on Conditional Formatting and select "New Rule..."</li><li>Click on "Use a formula to determine which cells to format"</li><li>Enter the formula =$E2="Solved".&nbsp; Yes there are 2 equal signs there.</li><li>Now click on "Format..." and select the Font tab and the Green color.</li><li>Click OK twice.</li><li>Now repeat the process for Red, changing the formula to =$E2&lt;&gt;"Solved"</li></ul>
<p>That will make the cells in Column D be either Red or Green depending on the value in Column E</p>
<p>

            <p>When you get to the 'Format' step of setting up conditional formatting, choose the [Font] tab and

<p>
</p><p>If you set the font color for column D to red to begin with, then the 1 rule that Ediarp gave you earlier will turn the font green:</p>

            <p>Sorry to make you confusing.</p>
<p>Users want to use two font colors, red and green in a cell.</p>
<p>This could happen only the worksheet is not protected, I guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried your suggestions but it didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I unprotect this cell while users using, then protect it after they finish entering text in macro?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>This would be possible in VBA - but some rules need to be known about what to shade green and what to shade red.&nbsp; Since you want to base things on whether a cell in column E has "Solved" or not, then it would be a Worksheet_Change() event most likely that
 'monitors' column E entries -- but big question: how does Solved get into that cell?&nbsp; User types it in, chooses it from a list, or does some IF() formula display it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I wouldn't worry about whether the sheet is protected or not - if this is a cell that user's can type entries into, then make it UNLOCKED so that they can use it without having to unprotect the sheet.&nbsp; Even if it is a cell with a data validation dropdown
 list in it, it has to be unlocked on a protected sheet to allow the user to make new selections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But again, the heart of the matter is how to decide what to make green and what to make red in the cell.&nbsp; You have to give us some clue as to what might show up in the cell and how to deal with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could get really complicated if you want to make entries by Tom red and entries by Mary green.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to see a little of what the code has to look like:</p>
<p>Type some text into a cell.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then start recording a macro - select just one or two words in the cell and change the color of the font for those words, repeat with other word(s) and different color.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Stop recording.&nbsp; Look at the code to see the type of thing that has to happen.&nbsp; When it's stripped down to the essentials, it's going to look something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub MultiColoredFontInCell()<br />
'<br />
' MultiColoredFontInCell Macro<br />
'</p>
<p>'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range("C9").Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "This is test text to work with."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'text is all black at the moment, now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'changing test text to red font<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ActiveCell.Characters(Start:=8, Length:=10).Font<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Color = -16776961<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .TintAndShade = 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ThemeFont = xlThemeFontMinor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'now changing work with to green<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ActiveCell.Characters(Start:=22, Length:=9).Font<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Color = -11489280<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .TintAndShade = 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ThemeFont = xlThemeFontMinor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range("C10").Select</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as you can see, you need to be able to determine the starting character in the cell and how many characters behind it to set to a color within the cell.&nbsp; That could be based on a word, or the location of spaces in the cell or other things, but there has
 to be some guidelines/rules to build the code around.</p>

<p>I made "Solved" in column E , as drop down. When they choose the "Solved", font color in column D(same row, but column D) will be changed to green. So they can use green font at that point. When unchecked "Solved", back to red font from that point.....</p>

            <p>I'm going to be blunt - they are asking for a feature that would complicate the operation of the workbook without any real need.&nbsp; The don't give you an idea of what needs to change color, and want to be able to change the colors to any of their own personal
 choice.&nbsp; That's pipe-dreaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would show them how to select words in the cell and how to click on the one little icon up in the [Home] tab that changes the color of the selected font and say to them: and that 1-mouse action, 1 mouse-click solution has not cost you one dime and costs
 perhaps 2 seconds of time to do.&nbsp; And then ask them "now do you want me to turn ALL of the text green when "Solved" is entered into column E on a row or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have set unrealistic goals with poorly defined requirements - two absolutely near-fatal elements of any software project.</p>

            <p>I agree, but All worksheets are protected by password . I unlocked some cells, so they can enter red text but not green. I don't want them to know the password, so without password, they can't change font.</p>

    <title>Problem connecting N80 &#38; PC Suite - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem connecting N80 &#38; PC Suite</h2>
                    Hi all I am hoping someone will be able to help me as I am completely frustrated by PC Suite :(
<p>I have a problem where I am using PC Suite on a corporate laptop. If I log in as local administrator or domain administrator then my phone (N80) connects beautifully. If I log on with my user account (that has admin priveleges) my phone is recognised by
 PC Suite but not PC Sync.</p>
<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction as to what may be blocking connectivity under my user account. My sys admin is stumped and we are about to tear our hair out.
<br />
Thanks, Kerrin</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Are you windows user folders mapped to network drive?<br />
<br />
if those are, do this:<br />
1. log in as local administrator<br />
2. go to folder: C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\Application Data\PC Suite\ConfServer\<br />
3. copy all files from that folder to your user account profile's ..\PC Suite\ConfServer\ folder (it should be in network drive)<br />
<br />
BTW: "Application Data" is hidden folder; Set "Show hidden files and folders" from Folder options if you can not find it.

            Thanks for the reply miksu - sorry i've taken so long to post this reply.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I'm still having the same problem. I have tried what you said, i've tried copying the whole PC Suite folder and i've also removed all programs and folders and started again with copying the ConfServer folder like you suggested but still the same.
 PC Suite says phone is connected but PC Sync comes up with either the phone is not supported or the phone has rejected the operation.<br />
<br />
Is it something in particular in the files in ConfServer folder that I should update so that it doesn't affect the other contents?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help,<br />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to make a shared folder show up on my computers drive in my onedrive business account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need help with my business onedrive account. &nbsp;I created a folder "A" that I've shared with my employees. &nbsp;They can access this folder via signing in online through their "shared with me" but cannot access it via their onedrive account from the computer's
 drive because the "shared with me" folder is not visible.<br />
<br />
How can they gain access to folder A without having to login via the online account through a web browser? &nbsp;I am able to do it just fine after signing in and adding the business onedrive account to my computers drive, but the shared folder is not visible to
 my employees when i set them up the same way as i was set up. Any advice is much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I'd like to explain that we cannot directly sync all files and folders in Shared with me section. However, we can access that folder and use the new sync client to sync all files to our local drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can let other user navigate to their <strong>Shared with me</strong> section, access that folder A. Click<strong> Sync</strong> button to see if it can launch the new sync client of OneDrive for Business (We suggest users to use the new sync client to
 sync files from OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online). If yes, it will sync files in folder A to their local drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, let them check steps mentioned in <strong>Test the feature before you enable it for your organization section
</strong>from the article below.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-users-to-sync-SharePoint-files-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-22e1f635-fb89-49e0-a176-edab26f69614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Enable users to sync SharePoint files with the new OneDrive sync

    <title>A numbered reference list&#47;bibliography&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lmcque12  say:</h3>
<h2>            A numbered reference list&#47;bibliography&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Is there a way on Microsoft word 2013 to put in footnotes but then make a numbered reference list/bibliography at the end of the document which corresponds to these footnotes? I need to be able to do this with APA formatting but I cannot seem to find a way.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Assuming that I understood your question correctly, you can add your reference list, format it with a numbered list, and then insert cross-references to the paragraph numbers in the body of your document.
