            Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f2592072-88fc-400a-add4-31bde2bd0b91" title="ChandanDey1308">
ChandanDey1308</a>.&nbsp;In most cases it is normal for your phone to feel warm, such as if you are using multiple high-performing apps, listening to music for an extended time, or when your phone is charging. You may try closing some apps that you are not using
 or reboot your handset by pressing and holding the volume down and the power buttons simultaneously for 10-15 seconds. Hope this helps.

    <title>PC Suite Backup failed to backup contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jesterxl---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Suite Backup failed to backup contacts</h2>
                    Went to update my firmware today, and it said that it would delete all contents on my phone. So, I updated PC Suite, and then clicked the backup button. It appeared to be successful.<br />
<br />
I then had it install the firmware update. After that successfully happened, I went to backup, and clicked Restore. It updated my saved profiles, applications, files, and images.<br />
<br />
My contacts, however, are now all gone.<br />
<br />
The log shows it backed up Contacts, but there is nothing in that heading. If you compare it to how the log formats files, there were items under it as a heading, like so:<br />
<br />
Content restored:<br />
- User files<br />
Images\Backgrounds\underdark1_176x208.otb<br />
Others\ClientLoginTest.swf<br />
Others\FlickrMobile.swf<br />
Others\show_keycodes.swf<br />
Others\testing_login.swf<br />
etc...<br />
- Contacts<br />
- Calendar<br />
- Settings<br />
- Messages<br />
- Bookmarks<br />
- Full backup<br />
<br />
So, following that logic I'm lead to believe that my Contacts didn't actually back up. Um... darn?<br />
<br />
I have some contacts backed up on my SIM card, but they are 2 years old, and don't have the 2 years worth of contacts I've added since then.<br />
<br />
Just thought Nokia might want to know their Backup program doesn't work with Contacts on a Nokia 6680.<br />
<br />
BTW, just so today wasn't a total failure, what DID my firmware update actually give me? An "up to date Symbian OS" doesn't count; that has no tangible user value.<br />
<br />
Finally, here is my system info, hope it helps the engineers to prevent this problem for other users in the future:<br />

            PC Suite has little to do with your problem not the PC system. This is about the phone.<br />
YOu can try to check that did the contacts really appear in the backup file by opening it with notepad and then use search to look for a number string or a name that you definately know exists in your contacts.<br />
<br />
If you can find the contacts in the backup file, then you have some hope in restoring them.

            Dude, you're right! I opened that 10 meg beast in Notepad and can see all the good Contact data.<br />
<br />
The restore, however, doesn't shove that goodness back in my Phone's contacts. Any suggestions?

            I have had the exact same problem with my N70 yesterday, 18-11-2006.<br />
<br />
I first downloaded the latest PC Suite, then backed my phone memory up and afterthat flashed my firmware with the PC Suite.<br />
<br />
After restoring everything is normal, except for the absence of my contacts.<br />
<br />
Looking with notepad in the .nbu file (content copier) I managed to discover all of my contacts.<br />
<br />
So they were backed up alright, but restoration fails!<br />
I made my backup and restore attempts with the same PC Suite version.<br />
<br />
The specs:<br />
<br />
Win XP Pro SP2<br />
Nokia PC Suite 6.28 release 21 (Dutch)<br />
<br />
Firmware N70:<br />
5.0638.3.0.1<br />
18-09-06<br />
RM-84<br />
<br />
Is this a program failure of Content Copier....?!?!

            The failure root cause is difficult to determine with this level of information.<br />
After firmware update, did you run the restore coed for your phone (*#7370#, confirmation code 12345).<br />
Then try to restore again

            No, I didn't restore my N70 to factory defaults. But to be honest I really don't think that would 'do' the job. :-)<br />
<br />
If you read the following thread, you'll see that this problem was reported on these boards late August and many, many people have difficulties with this problem:<br />

I would hope that Nokia had already looked into this issue and made some sort of reaction, acknowledgement and/or fix, but up until now to no avail.<br />

            I had the same problem today when trying to restore a full phone memory backup of my Nokia 6680.<br />
All data was restored except contacts data.<br />
The phone went through a repair and the motherboard was changed (=&gt; new IMEI) in a authorized Nokia Service Center.<br />
So the Contacts in Phone Browser were empty.<br />
<br />
BUT I FOUND A SOLUTION!<br />
It only works if you have backed up only your contacts (so you have a .nfc file in "C:\Documents and Settings\*YOUR-USER-NAME*\Application Data\Nokia\ContentCopier\".<br />
(Before taking the phone to the repair shop, I made the backup twice - one full backup, and one backup selecting only contacts)<br />
<br />
So, if you have the .nfc file, copy it to a separate folder. (If i leaved the .nfc in the same folder with the .nfb, pc-suite-content-copier only sees the .nfb file(s) and the Contacts/images checkboxes are grayed).<br />
After copying the file, in ContentCopier select Browse and select the folder with the .nfc file in it.<br />
Now the checkboxes are not grayed anymore (what a stupidity!), contentcopier says it found a backup file, and you can restore it succesfully.<br />
<br />
For precaution, now i will manually copy the c:\system\data\contacts.cdb file, instead of using the **bleep**py content-copier.<br />
<br />
IT IS A SHAME NOKIA DIDN'T CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION SINCE AUGUST 2006 ! WE PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR THEIR LATEST GENERATION PHONES, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SUPPORT THEY FORGET US! INSTEAD OF HELPING US, THEY TRY TO HIDE THE PROBLEM WITH ANSWERS LIKE "This is a user
 to user forum" - **bleep**! MAKE IT A USER-TO-USER-AND-NOKIA SUPPORT. THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT! ANSWERS TO THEIR PROBLEMS!

BTW: Backup file must be .nbu format (so it is made then with PC Suite 6.81 or 6.82) and installed PC Suite must be 6.82.22

Are you trying to go to the last record on the main form, or on the subform? If the subform, I would expect you to have to setfocus to the subform, so as to make it the active data object, before calling the GoToRecord method with no object specified.

Is "MeetingID" the name of your form?&nbsp; If not, the GoToRecord call above is certainly wrong.&nbsp; If it is, it seem that something else is wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the form a bound form?&nbsp; Or is the form's Record Source property blank?</p>

    <title>Sidebar in Messaging app, while in portrait mode&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sidebar in Messaging app, while in portrait mode&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In Messaging (Windows 10 Mobile, current version), while typing/reading a message (not list of conversations, but while within a conversation listing), there's a sidebar with my current/recent conversations while in landscape mode (ONLY in landscape mode),
 so it's a bit easier to bounce between different conversations. &nbsp;To me though, the keyboard is so much in the way that I don't like landscape mode, except for the sidebar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I know the answer ("no"), but is there perhaps a way to see the sidebar when in portrait mode in messaging? &nbsp;Or put it across the top?</p>

 of which of theses tasks have been completed and which havent yet (100%, 50%, 0%). Some are completed who are still scheduled far into the future yet we were able to finish them early. Now I want to shift this waterfall in a way that the task that has just
 been finished is right before todays date and the task that is to come next is right after todays date. So shift the entire group of tasks but keep the structure. Then, once I have done that, I would like to recalculate (taking into account resource limits)
 from today into the future, and give me a new end date. </span>

            <p>CH_MAPLAN,</p>
<p>The best way to show completion of any task, current or future, is to make an entry into the Actual Start and Actual Finish fields. Since Project is interactive, entries in those fields will tell Project what really happened and Project will adjust the current
 schedule (i.e. Start and Finish fields), to reflect reality. Therefore, future tasks will be moved back to the actual dates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as current tasks that have not started but should have, there are various ways to slip the schedule. One method is to adjust the start date, but that should be taken care of by any predecessor tasks and manually adjusting the start date will set a
 constraint, so that may not be the best option. Another method is to set the calculation option under File/Options/Advanced group to have Project adjust tasks based on the Status Date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I assume you set a baseline. If you did not, then updating tasks as outlined above will change the schedule and you will have no way to compare the current schedule with the original schedule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

            <p>As John says, best way to update is to enter Actual Start, Actual Duration and Remaining duration. However if you only have % complete then:</p>
<ol>
<li>File, Options, Advanced</li><li>Scroll to bottom of form</li><li>Select the first 3 Move calculation options</li><li>Now when you set % complete tasks move automatically so all actual work is in the past.</li><li>Select Project, Update Project</li><li>Select reschedule uncompleted work</li><li>For entire project</li><li>OK</li></ol>
<p>That should do it. Good luck.</p>

            <p>You can do the whole thing in one go as described by Rod. If I did this, afterwards I would reset those three calculate options back to the default (off).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although updating all at once is a quick way to improve everything, you may prefer to check and update the status task by task. This is because the tasks you know about because you have some progress data may re-schedule their successors automatically when
 updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a task which was scheduled way in the future by predecessors, but the task has started and finished even though the predecessors have not, it may be a good idea to decide that the predecessor link should be removed.</p>
<p>Once a task has an actual start date, its predecessors, right or wrong, are irrelevant.</p>

            I think that a disadvantage of Bluetooth is that it can only connect to one device at a time, i also think a way round your problem with headsets is that you use a Bluetooth connected one as well as a wired headset. I do not know if this will work or not
 as I haven't tried this.

            Hello pierrechappuis1,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your patience.
<br />
<br />I am pleased to inform you that Outlook.com has fully completed its deployment of the fix that had impacted service availability for some users in the infrastructure and there should be no more service interruption now.
<br />
<br />See: <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a>
<br />
<br />In case it is still not working for you, it could be a browser-related issue.
<br />
<br />May I suggest you to delete your Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies and clear browser caches then restart the browser? 
<br />
<br />- selectively deleting browser cookies

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still experiencing the same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting Cookies and Cache, tried Google Chrome, Edge, Firefox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still get the same error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I can't contact the support Team, as in the request-help app I get an email link that automatically tries to open in Outlook.com<span>, leading me to the same error page.</span> (Regardless of the browser and even though I set my Office Outlook
 application as the Standard app for emails in Windows 10.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope, this is fixed soon. I urgently need to access my email account!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Page Setup - Margin changes not saving</h2>
                    Hi I need to use custom print margin settings to print courier consignment notes onto template labels. Previously I had the margins setup as per the courier company's specifications and it was working fine. However there must have been a recent update
 to IE 10 as any changes to the print margins are no longer saved upon exiting the "Page Setup" dialogue box.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is making it impossible for me to use their labels. Could you please check and respond?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kind regards,</div>
<div>Sam.</div>

            Hi Sathish,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the response. This did not resolve the issues unfortunately. I have discovered some more info however.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After the reset, the default margin was 19.00mm. I need the left/right to be 2.36mm (which I was able to set before without a problem).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now when I enter the margin as 2.36mm it accepts it however once I close out of the options and then reopen to check the setting applied it is set at 4.23mm.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Basically if I set the value to anything under 4.23mm it defaults to 4.23mm. While anything over 4.23mm is retained to whatever value &gt;4.23 you enter.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What is dictating the minimum margin value? Is it my printer or IE itself?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Sam.</div>

    <title>two windows live accounts -- one phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paigenorman  say:</h3>
<h2>            two windows live accounts -- one phone</h2>
                    I have two windows live accounts; one has all my phone/marketplace apps on it -- one doesn't. &nbsp;The "old" one has all my apps but doesn't recognize my NEW HTC 8x phone (so I can't put all my apps on through Windows Live). &nbsp;The "new" one recognizes the new
 phone but doesn't show any of my apps on it.<br />
<br />
I have both Live accounts linked on Windows Live but that didn't solve the problem.<br />
<br />
I think the issue is that when Hotmail migrated to Windows Live, my phone wouldn't allow my "old" Live account information so I had to set up a "new" Live password/name. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there a way to merge them together (NOT for email purposes -- i've done that) but for phone apps purposes? &nbsp;<br />

<p>I read about account merging but the concept is just too complicated and it is better you get the experts work it out for you.

            <p>Raju,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have conversation view turned off. &nbsp;As an example, in the screenshot below I want see all emails generated by our SPAM filter (DRS Email Quarantine). I select an email then sort by "FROM". Outlook puts my selected email at the bottom of the list. Can you
 put it in the middle or nearer the top instead? Users will typically be working in the region just below the ribbon. It is disruptive to have the focus moved to he bottom of the screen. Another approach would be to lock the selected email's location in the
 window and reorganize the rest of the emails relative to the selected email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Spacebas</p>

            <p>I am also having this issue with my newly installed version of Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In previous Outlook versions (2003, 2007, 2010), when you select an e-mail, and then sort by a field, it will display the selected e-mail at the top of the sorted list.</p>
<p>For example, in the previous user's example, if you select an e-mail from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", and then sort by the "From" field, it will show the "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" group on the top of the list, along with all e-mails sent from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2013, this behavior is different.</p>
<p>Instead of being sorted to the top of the list as in previous versions, the selected e-mail (and sorted group) are displayed on the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>In order to see all e-mails sent from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" in the group, after sorting by sender, I must scroll down to view the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous versions would display the results with the selected e-mail and group at the top of the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may seem like a minor thing, but it a very frustrating change, and as far as I can tell, with no good reason either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I very must doubt there is a way to resolve this short of issuing an update to the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although this is unlikely, I wanted to at least "officially" request that this functionality be fixed.</p>
<p>Please submit this as bug and/or feature request for upcoming updates to Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>The answer should be far different than "this is designed that way" but rather needs to include good reasons behind. If there is none, than we expect those to be investigated and fixed rather than forcing the user to open a official query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, this is also an official website and we had already raised our concerns on an official site, so I think we did more than we should. Rest should be up to proper groups to consolidate and take it further. I am pretty sure you guys would have a way to
 raise a ticket yourself as well. Am I mistaken?</p>

</p><p>The answer should be far different than "this is designed that way" but rather needs to include good reasons behind. If there is none, than we expect those to be investigated and fixed rather than forcing the user to open a official query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, this is also an official website and we had already raised our concerns on an official site, so I think we did more than we should. Rest should be up to proper groups to consolidate and take it further. I am pretty sure you guys would have a way to
 raise a ticket yourself as well. Am I mistaken?</p>

    <title>Windows Phone keeps closing WhatsApp - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gorranianzouk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone keeps closing WhatsApp</h2>
                    <p>On my Lumia 830 (latest version of windows 10), I use WhatsApp alot and almost every time I unlock my screen it has to reload whatsapp from scratch (Says Loading instead of Resuming). I lock my screen with a whatsapp discussion open and some 5 min later
 when I unlock it is back to the home screen &amp; whatsapp is closed. I have to open it again, and it takes extra time to load the app back.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other apps like Facebook/messenger/IE/everything else just go straight back into the app with either a "Resuming" message or no loading time at all. Is there any particular reason for this/any known workaround or fix? It's the app I use the most and it's
 very annoying to have to re-open it almost every time I unlock my phone.</p>

            Actually, it's not the app which is buggy... It's the OS! No app on Windows Phone wants to run properly whether it's WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger or Instagram... None of them works properly... This means that the problem is with the OS itself and not
 the app because only one app could be buggy, not the whole category of Social Apps!

<p>I am required to compare forecast and actuals for over all 100 people who work on various projects.
</p>
<p>Is there a way to compare 2&nbsp;worksheets - one &nbsp;in forecast and&nbsp;one in&nbsp;actual data that are contained in 2 separate worksheets?</p>
<p>I have the following:</p>
<p>employee id (column a) project id (column b) and&nbsp;forecast spend&nbsp;...(2) .and employee id (column a) project id (column b) and actual spend. Is there a way to compare quickly?. I am doing this manually now, since I do not know a quick formula.
</p>
<p>what is happening is some people who are forecasted to work on project abc are working on project xyz..</p>
<p>so I need a formula to compare forecast&nbsp;$$$spend&nbsp;and actual $$$spend with respect to each person AND to let me know projects that are being forecasted and not worked on and projects that are worked on and that are not forecasted. messed up, I know.
</p>

<p>can you help since I doing this manually now...!!!</p>

    <title>Hyperlinks in powerpoint show no longer work when audio recording - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billlandenberger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyperlinks in powerpoint show no longer work when audio recording presentations</h2>
                    So Powerpoint (latest update office 365) has overhauled the way you do audio recordings, with various controls appearing on the laptop screen and full screen view of slide show on a connected data projector (I 'live' audio record lectures as they are being
 presented to a class).&nbsp; I have my head around the new controls, but one major issue that has cropped up is that hyperlinks in the shows (to websites in my case) no longer work (an alt-text popup shows the link address, but it is not clickable).&nbsp; I have tried
 on both the laptop screen and the projection screen windows and holding down ctrl merely produces a red laser pointer (alt and shift do nothing).&nbsp; The links still work in edit mode and in presentation mode when not recording, but refuse to work in 'record'
 mode.&nbsp; Any suggestions?<br />
cheers<br />

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting the query in our forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test PowerPoint version 1902 (Build 11328.20100)&nbsp;Monthly Channel, when&nbsp;I click Audio &gt; Record the Audio when the Record Sound&nbsp; windows is working you can't do any other operations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is normal behavior. If you want to when you record the Audio, you can do some operation. I would like to suggest submit your feedback via the smiling face on the top-right-corner of PowerPoint. Also, you can post a&nbsp;new idea in our
<a href="https://powerpoint.uservoice.com/forums/288949-powerpoint-for-windows-desktop-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay, I was out of office in the last two days. Please try the workaround in Method 4 to manually suppress this error message in Outlook:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2783881/how-to-suppress-the-autodiscover-mismatch-warning-in-outlook-2007-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I'd like to gather following information to further help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Does it show the same "outlook.office365.com" URL every time it prompts? Have you made any other manual configurations except shutting down some steps of Autodiscover?
</p>
<p>2.You mentioned the issue only happens in one location, do you mean the company is located in multiple geo-locations and only one site has this issue?

                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of imported internet calendars (RSS) in my online Outlook as part of office 365. I would like to receive reminders for events listed in the calendars, and ideally, mark the time not as tentative, but as busy. How can I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Alexander,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As all the events are in the internet calendar, it is not feasible to change the reminder of internet calendars in OWA. I totally understand your concern. Could you please vote on the feedback via the link below or submit a new feature request to our relevant
 team?</p>

    <title>Advertisements on Windows 10 home pages and in email boxes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buttercreeme  say:</h3>
<h2>            Advertisements on Windows 10 home pages and in email boxes</h2>
                    <p>WHY are there SO many ads on Windows 10 that even my new computer tower with MUCH more speed, is bogged down with waiting for ALL of them to load? Can't even read a page or move between pages in articles because of the volume of them. I understand needing
 to make money...and using paid advertising...but Microsoft has gotten ridiculous with how many are allowed to try to load on both Microsoft Edge and IE. How do I turn these off?</p>

            It's on ALL webpages/articles etc. on Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; After doing some outside investigating on the whole issue&nbsp;of so many invasive ads all over in Windows 10, I will simply stop using Edge until Microsoft addresses all of the security issues involved.&nbsp;
 I will simply go back to using IE exclusively for now since I can enable things to stop the majority of these problems on that.&nbsp; I hope Microsoft can fix some of the problems&nbsp;as I DO like Edge.&nbsp; But safety and convenience comes first for all of my devices.
 I also don't like not being able to switch the OS keys between the 2 desktops (my old 1 and my brand new 1). I have always just gone along with changes from Microsoft since Windows 98, and sadly have to back out of this 1 for now.&nbsp; In many ways I wish I had
 stayed with Windows 7 and I was 1 of the 1st to upgrade to Windows 10 so have run it for almost a year. BTW I currently have 2 desktops, a laptop, a netbook and am responsible for keeping running a friend

            Nope and I run a heavy duty paid anti-virus etc, etc on ALL my devices.&nbsp; and the issue is ONLY in Edge.&nbsp; NO other browser bogs down nor freezes nor just "goes poof" like it does. Plus I have never liked McAfee...which is what seems to be what you're suggesting
 to use. Back in the beginning (2001) it was the one&nbsp;that DID let stuff into my first computers. I switched to a different system and have never had another problem.&nbsp; Edge is just not stable enough yet it seems, so I can use others. Simple.&nbsp; By power of deduction
 it IS a Microsoft Edge problem until they get things fully in place. Maybe this fall with next big update.&nbsp; I am just letting Microsoft know in feedback as I have been one of their "experimenters" since 2007.

            I followed all of the steps in the link you provided me and the 1 that found the most was step #4 Hitman Pro. I activated the 30 day trail and will likely subscribe to this program. None of the programs found anything really bead but did removed tracking
 sites. I appreciate your suggestion.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the delayed response on your inquiry. I understand that you want to have and use your old interface. Please be informed that if you were automatically upgraded to Outlook.com, there is no way to go back to your old interface. The launch
 of Outlook.com preview gave everyone an opportunity to learn together as we roll out and scale this new service.

<p>You can visit this <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-email/when-i-log-in-i-am-seeing-outlookcom-instead-of/be3fb8d7-01b3-4aee-aac1-64d078d575de">

<p>Should you have other questions and inquiries, do not hesitate to respond to this post.

<p>Hi UygarKilic2182,<br />
<br />
Since different migration process may have different root cause, I’d like to confirm the following information to further analyzing this issue:<br />
1. Did you migrate from on-promise Exchange server to Office 365 Exchange Online? Please provide us with the detailed email server environment in your organization.<br />
2. Let us know the detailed migration process, staged migration, cutover migration or hybrid.<br />
3. The entire error message.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</p>
