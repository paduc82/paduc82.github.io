<h2>            Outlook search box populates search filter results in oldest first order.  Slow results.</h2>
                    As recently as a few months ago after completing major email archive search to provide open public records was complete, outlook began steadily providing results from the search filter box in order of the oldest items first. &nbsp; This was noty always the
 case. I have a rather large inbox and giving the oldest results first is counter-productive. &nbsp;Does anyine know how to fix this?

            Hi theChrisr,
<div><br />
<div>Can you clarify whether the problem is the sort order, or the order that search finds emails?</div>
<div><br />
<div>KnightRider1015&nbsp;has advised you to change the sort order of the view. But I think the problem you are describing is that the search returns mail slowly, with the first results appearing being the oldest and working to the most recent. Is that correct?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have this problem too - if I do a mailbox search, I see results from 2004 appear first, then a few seconds later, results from 2005, then 2006 etc. The most recent results are at the top based on sort order, but it can take 20 to 30 seconds before any
 results from 2013 appear.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Most of the time I'm interested in recent results only, so I've learnt to add in "sent:this week" or "sent:this month". But ideally search would always return the most recent results first, and the older results last.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope someone can shed some light on this! Or if it is a common problem, perhaps Microsoft can address it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm using Outlook 2013, 64 bit, version 15.0.4505.1002.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>

            The problem you are describing is the exact same problem Im having. &nbsp;It takes forever to do any searches because my oldest messages are coming up first. &nbsp;Unfortunately outlook does not have a method to select a specific window of time to search for messages.
 &nbsp;Usually Im looking for messages from 2-5 months in the past but Im forced to wait for the oldest stuff (2008 and older) to populate first. &nbsp;Often times if I start looking as the results before the search completes, Outlook will re-start the search so Im forced
 to wait for the process to complete first. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I tries the method of changing the sort order as suggested by KnightRider a few times but it did nothing to improve the search results or process. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am using the bit version of Office 2010 on the computer with the problems but I also use the 64 &nbsp;bit version on other computers and do not have the same issue... yet.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi theChrisr,
<div><br />
<div>OK. I'm glad that I'm not the only one having this problem. <b>Hopefully Microsoft will take note and fix the issue.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>I haven't noticed the problem where the search restarts if I open an email while the search results are being returned.</div>
<div><br />
<div>BTW. I did also try rebuilding the search index, and even after rebuilding, the search works the same way - generally oldest emails first. I have noticed that it isn't 100% oldest to newest - I get the odd 2013 emails appearing early in the search results.</div>

            <p>That only sorts the results. The problem is that it takes forever (or darned close to forever) to complete the search because it starts with the oldest. I need a way to search from newest to oldest. This is a Windows 8 issue.</p>

            <p>I also have this problem and ALWAYS HAVE! </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It doesn't search from oldest to newest though in my experience. It starts searching about&nbsp;three or more years ago and then searches BACK from there and only when that is complete does it search recent emails. But I have my entire email history from 1999
 onwards&nbsp;stored on my exchange server so that may explain the difference from others here.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Like I said; for me it has always done this as far as&nbsp;I am aware. It is incredibly frustrating and as mentioned you have to add "this year" or "last year" or something to the search to make it work as closely to how&nbsp;you want.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This was exactly the same with Outlook 2003, 2007, 2010 and now even 2013. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I cannot imagine why someone thought this was a good idea. I can only assume that this is by design. A retarded design! Because nobody at Microsoft has ever wanted to fix it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Just&nbsp;like the quoting on reply error (failing to format the indented lines correctly on quoted text - after about 2 replies the quoted text is broken and you can't see who said what!).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Like the error of not being unable to reply to an HTML message by going to the END of the message and removing the indent to add your reply (this means you also can't add in-line notes which are unindented as Microsoft seem to want you to reply to all emails
 by adding text only&nbsp;at the TOP!), </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft don't seem to care at all about correcting these faults so I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for a fix.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I honestly think Microsoft is run by a bunch of kids who have absolutely no clue about the real world. And yes I know I say that in all of my posts :)</p>

            <p>That's a childish response to a real problem.&nbsp; I have a MacBook Air and couldn't do jack on it. Had to wipe the useless Mac O/S and put Windows on it.&nbsp; A Mac is OK if all you want to do is say "HEY LOOK! I HAVE A MAC! (ie. "I am a poser and have no idea
 of the real business world") and don't need to do anything more complex than browse the web and do your mother's email.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Mac Mail does not work right with Exchange Server. Complete waste of time, wanting you to use the obsolete POP3 email system before it will work. It's VERY slow with IMAP4 so not efficient.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yes I tried Parallels but that is a resource hog and on the incredibly underpowered MacBook Air it was useless.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Suggest you go play in the Mac forums if you can't offer any proper help here.</p>

            You are correct in this. &nbsp;Switching to a Mac does absolutely nothing to resolve a real issue. Unfortunately Macs are not primarily set up for enterprise use and certainly not ideal for use with MS Exchange which is what I have to work with. &nbsp;The funny
 thing though, is that outlook on the PC in question even searched my non-exchange IMAP gmail and hotmail accounts in the same oldest to newest manner.
<div><br />
<div>This search issue is a real pain to deal with but it appears that Microsoft has not clue as to why it is happening.</div>

 workbook. Had the same trouble with the 2004 version. &nbsp;My workaround is going to "View" and checking "Formatting Palette" and it opens in a box on the side. This is a huge inconvenience and other friends who have Office for Mac don't seen to have this issue.
 It may be a simple setting but I can't find it.

            <p>Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate all the help, references and advice. Unfortunately nothing seemed to work in my situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've resolved the problem by taking the easy way out, bitting the bullet and loaded Office 2011. This solved the problem of the missing tool bars and the other issue of the compatibility checks both the &nbsp;2004 and 2008 versions seemed to be running on every
 Word and PPT file extension ending in an "X" since I installed the OS 10.9.5 security update and a Safari update back on 9 April .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Tearing my hair out over this one!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a 5230 that keeps having short unexplainable vibrations. I keep all phone volumes muted for most of the time, with the Message alert time set to Alarm 1.aac, so when a text arrives I get two long and one short vibration. I'm also getting regular single
 short vibrations and haven't a clue why. Took it back to the shop and they checked all my settings to no avail, I was advised to update the firmware, which I have and it's still doing it! Anyone had this problem and solved it? Please! Help! :smileyhappy:</p>

<p>You could try to reset to factory settings. This shouldnt delete any data but backup anyway.</p>

<h2>            Excel help</h2>
                    Copied from my Google + account. Are there any Excel 2016 experts out there? I am trying to complete an assignment that requires a histogram with 4 distinct "bins" 1,2,3,4. Unfortunately, the program wants to auto sort the data using Scott's normal reference
 rule. &nbsp;I can change the number of bins OR describe the bin width, but not both. Changing one affects the other. Some of my data sets will not have any entries into a specific bin which seems to add to the problem I am having. &nbsp;I haven's had any luck searching
 the help section online, or calling. I struck out on YouTube tutorials as well. &nbsp;Maybe someone here can help me out?

            Thank you for your response Tom. I believe that I have the analysis toolpack add on. &nbsp;The computer I use is from my school district, and the assignment that I am attempting to complete is from a graduate class that I am taking through the University of
 St. Francis. Here is a screen shot of the histograms I am attempting to create. When I try to change the number of bins or the bin width, the other one is automatically adjusted in a way that is not conducive to my overall goal. &nbsp;I believe that part of my
 problem is due to the fact that some of my "bins" will have 0 entries for a particular number. &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba139b98-7802-4de0-93cf-e76dc975413c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba139b98-7802-4de0-93cf-e76dc975413c" /></a>

<p>The histograms in your screenshot are the type created by Insert &gt; (Charts) Insert Statistic Chart, a new feature available in Excel 2016.</p>
<p>

            Thank you for your help Mike. &nbsp;I feel like I am getting closer to the answer, but I am still lacking all of the skills necessary to complete the puzzle. I am amazed by your knowledge and tried to download your add-in. &nbsp;Unfortunately I am still experiencing
 difficulty. I have tried to follow the steps that are outlined on the original download page including Control Shift B. I am wondering if the issue I am having may be related to the fact that I may not have full authority to add "add-ins" because the laptop
 is owned by my district? Or it is completely due to USER ERROR! Sometimes I feel like I know just enough to get myself in trouble!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5265f3af-8cb1-4dab-8f17-781d59b89219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5265f3af-8cb1-4dab-8f17-781d59b89219" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac6c1c34-ed9a-4f8d-9e68-2f3560eab261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac6c1c34-ed9a-4f8d-9e68-2f3560eab261" /></a>&nbsp;

            I am not sure EXACTLY how I finally was able to format the histograms with the correct bin values, but I believe that if was through the Data Analysis Add in that was originally suggested. &nbsp;Thank you for sharing your wisdom!&nbsp;

<h2>            Making 2 x A5 from 1 x A4 MS Office PowerPoint 2007</h2>
                    I have created an A4&nbsp;poster in PowerPoint and now want to make 2 x A5 flyers from it. All the instructions I can find are for Word documents but I&nbsp;couldn't position the logos as I wanted them in Word so had to plan it in PowerPoint.&nbsp;When I try to print
 from that (or&nbsp;from PDF or TIFF) it doesn't give the option of choosing 2 pages per sheet as it would do in Word.&nbsp;I have tried to save it as a picture as I thought I could do 2 per sheet that way but I&nbsp;can't find out how to do that either. Can anyone help?

            <p>Hi John</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much - I had been struggling for hours to work out a way of doing it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried several different ways.</p>
<p>I planned the poster on PowerPoint but when I saved it as a PDF and printed it, it had huge margins, so I tried again printing borderless and it was too close to the edge so I adjusted it so that when I printed it borderless it was how I wanted. But trying
 to get&nbsp;it correct in 2xA5 version is another challenge!&nbsp;I tried 'insert picture' (it didn't have the choice of 'object') but the images came out overlapping - not sure how! But I tried again just copying &amp; pasting and that worked better. It doesn't come out
 quite central, but it's only a couple of mm out so it's fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it extremely frustrating when what prints out is so often different from how it appears on the screen, and you only get the full menu for printing from Word but you can't always achieve what you want in Word. I suppose I ought to bite the bullet and
 get proper publishing software&nbsp;as I'm always trying to stretch Office to the limit.
</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Shirley</p>

            Glad you got it worked out. For printing options, these are determined by the driver software that came with the printer. If the printer manufacturer hasn't enabled options had you need, then Word can't make it happen either.

            <p>Many thanks. I suppose I can't expect 'champagne' from a&nbsp;'beer' priced&nbsp;printer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know whether you can advise me on another issue I've had since then? I am printing tickets in an Avery label template&nbsp;to get 8 to an A4&nbsp;sheet. It's not the same layout as the poster/flyer.&nbsp;I did it for the first time last year and really struggled
 until someone suggested using the label template and showed me how to do it. If it was as simple as last year's, once I'd got the first one planned in at&nbsp;the right size, I could just copy &amp; paste the text and the charity's logo separately on to the other 7
 and jiggle them about till they all looked the same. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this year I&nbsp;have been lucky enough to get sponsorship for the costs from some local businesses&nbsp;in exchange for me including their logos on all the publicity. I tried to&nbsp;follow the same process as last year but the logos refuse to go into the right
 place on the other tickets, and I can't&nbsp;do a PDF because that comes out with everything in one corner. There's probably a solution staring me in the face but I can't work it out. Any ideas?&nbsp;If not, I'll start again and post it as a separate question. Many
 thanks.</p>

            <p>Avery label templates are laid out using a table. Because you're having trouble with logo positioning, I'm guessing that the images are floating above the text layer. You be able to get a more reliable arrangement if you make the logos inline with the text.
 Then they'll sit in each table cell. Please try this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on a logo to select it.</li><li>On the <strong>Picture Tools&gt;Format</strong> tab, click on <strong>Position</strong> and select the top option
<strong>In Line with Text</strong>. The logo pops into position on the page. If that position is not inside one of the table cells, copy and paste the logo into a cell.</li><li>Inline images act like text characters, so use text formatting commands to position it. As examples, use
<strong>Home&gt;Paragraph&gt;Alignment&gt;Centered</strong> to center the logo in the cell, or use
<strong>Home&gt;Paragraph&gt;Spacing&gt;Before</strong> and add 10 points to create some space above the logo.</li><li>Repeat for all logos, applying the same measurements to each logo. When you're done, they should site in a neat grid and they won't accidentally move.</li></ol>

            <p>That was really helpful, thank you very much. Somehow one of the logos had already attached itself to the text (no idea how I managed that!) so when I copied &amp; pasted the text, the logo came too, but for the others I followed your instructions. Your extra
 tip about adding&nbsp;space above&nbsp;helped me to&nbsp;get them positioned exactly as&nbsp;I needed. I had to adjust the pair at the bottom of the page very slightly so I didn't lose any of the logo&nbsp;off the bottom in the printing, but even my cheapie printer managed to print
 within 5mm of the edge, so I'm really pleased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was for tickets &amp; publicity for a barn dance I'm planning in aid of the Contented Dementia Trust so I wanted to do everything at minimum cost. Thank you very much for taking the time to help me.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi John</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for all your help. Having&nbsp;used your tips about keeping logos in line with the text, the tickets worked fine and I have also been able to re-plan the poster more successfully in Word.&nbsp;I can print it out as 2xA5 easily by&nbsp;clicking on 2 to a page
 and selecting pages 1,1 and it works a treat. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However I now want to send it out to other people and I was advised&nbsp;to send it as&nbsp;a PDF so it prints out exactly right at their end. That's fine for the full sized poster, but I can't work out how to do the A5 flyer because in PDF&nbsp;you don't get the choice
 of selecting pages. So&nbsp;at best you just get one on one half of the paper and you have to feed it back into the printer to get the other one on the other half.&nbsp;I tried to copy it into a new Word document of 2xA5 that I could then save as&nbsp;a PDF but I&nbsp;can't get
 it to come up half the size. When I had planned it in PowerPoint you suggested saving it as a TIFF but I can't seem to save it from Word to TIFF. Any ideas? I don't want to have to go back and do it all over again in PowerPoint! I'm using Word 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

            <p>If you have a Word file that just contains 2 copies of the PDF beside each other, you can send the Word file. There is nothing that is going to be rendered differently at the other end, because all formatting is embedded in the PDFs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll get the most accurate result if you size the the PDF to A5 numerically. After using Insert&gt;Object to place the PDF on the page, right-click on it and choose
<strong>Format Object</strong>. On the size tab, set the <strong>Height</strong> to 210 mm or 8.3 inches and the
<strong>Width</strong> to 148 mm or 5.8 inches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For positioning the PDF on the page, you can do that 2 ways:</p>
<p>If the PDF is inline with text (image hugs the margins, you can't move it with your mouse), set the Word
<strong>Page Layout&gt;Margins</strong> to 0" for all 4 margins. Then you should just be able to fit 2 PDFs on a landscape A4 page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the PDF is floating (you can select it and drag it to any position on the page), then right-click on the PDF and choose
<strong>Format Object</strong>. Select the <strong>Layout</strong> tab, then click on the
<strong>Advanced</strong> button. On the <strong>Picture Position</strong> tab, Set
<strong>Horizontal</strong> to <strong>0" to the right of Page</strong> and <strong>
Vertical</strong> to <strong>0" below Page</strong>. Then for the second PDF, do the same, but set Horizontal to 148 mm or 5.8 inches to the right of page. The 2 PDFs should completely fill the page with no overlap.</p>

            Hello JackSander1,
<br />
<br />I would recommend to try the safe mode and disable the office add-ins
<br />
<br />1- Try to open the office app in safe mode:
<br />Close all office apps
<br />Press the windows key + R and write the command to open the office app in error, below are the commands to open all office apps:
<br /> 
<br />For Excel: Type excel /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Outlook: Type outlook /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Word: Type winword /safe, and click OK.
<br />For PowerPoint: Type powerpnt /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Publisher: Type mspub /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Visio: Type visio /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />2- Disable the add-ins:
<br />Go to file &gt; options &gt; add-ins select COM and uncheck the first add-in checked, close the office app and make your test. If the issue persist repeat this step until disable all add-ins.
<br />
<br />I hope this work for you, if you have a further question Let me know.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

            mmm we can try to check if you are affected for an update, when updates broke some feature in windows a new update to solve this is developed, so restart your computer, check for updates and if this doesn't solve the issue go to the control panel &gt; program and features &gt; installed updates and uninstall the update installed in that date.

            yes and no. as long as i know, my Office do crash after pressing keyboard. but my search app also didn't work after typing a few letter and it will hang in there. for example i want to search for 'winword', when i type 'winwo' the app will hang. the last
 option in my mind is i will format my laptop and see if the problem still persist.&nbsp;

<h2>            Outlook 2016 &#39;My tasks&#39; Group shared list</h2>
                    <p>I'm aiming for a group shared task list in Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no issues setting up my task list, filling it with content or setting reminders on the content. I am fine sharing the list with others and giving them editor rights allowing them to access it, create, delete tasks etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want and am struggling with, is a making it a group list that everyone I nominate has access to and EVERYONE gets a reminder/ pop up on the tasks on there. At the moment, as the task list 'owner', it's only me who gets the reminders and not everyone
 with access to the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution I can find is to specifically allocate tasks to people. The only problem with that is they then don't pop up as a reminder for me so I lose visibility of the task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>nb; I want it it the list format and not in a calendar where it can disappear unless monitored closely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions or help you may have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

            Hi;
<br />I recommend to follow the bellow article, although when the office request activation key, you should select activate by phone, then you will select your country.
<br />Note: do not insert your product key directly, contact by phone and select your country.

<h2>            when I group a set of pictures together and send them in an email they lose their individual nature and become 1 pic. How can I prevent this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In particular I'm trying to get a fairly complex hyperlinked signature set up where each pic has a separate hyperlink. When I use the group function to bring all the pics together, it works fine- until you send the email. Then both the sent item and the
 email received combine all the pics into one and remove all hyperlinking.</p>
<p>Any ideas...?</p>

            I hyperlink each picture to a webpage. It's a whole picture split up into 5 pictures so each picture can have a separate hyperlink.
<div>I then transfer the entire 'picture' (built of 5 separate pictures) to publisher, and use the 'group' function to group the images together in a 'frame' of one image.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The reason I have done this is that if you look at the whole 'picture' (before grouping) in a preview pane in Outlook, and the preview pane isn't wide enough, it makes some of the pictures go under the others (which is what I'm trying to avoid)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Grouping puts it all as one picture, which fixes the preview pane problem, and keeps the individual hyperlinks.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, if I then go and send that message, both the sent item and the received email lose all hyperlinks whatsoever, plus the individual nature of the pictures within the group. It makes the group into one image.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Outlook obviously processes the grouping into one image on sending.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My question is- how do I prevent this from happening, or is it just a quirk of Outlook that can't be resolved?</div>

            <p>Make sure you have the latest version of Zune installed (4.8) on your computer. Then connect your phone to your computer with the USB cable that came with the phone. Finally check for phone updates in Zune. If it says that it is already up-to-date, you need
 to wait until you get an update notification in your phone (since the update is not ready for all phones yet).</p>

    <title>Schedule for Security Essentials Scanning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andersonneil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Schedule for Security Essentials Scanning</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In MSE Settings, I have a Full Scan scheduled to run around 2.00am on Sundays. This happens quite OK.</p>
<p>When I look at MSE at other times during the week, I see on&nbsp;MSE Home that another Scan is run at another time during the week also.</p>
<p>I have looked through the Task Scheduler and have found an entry in a Scheduler Folder called Microsoft Antimalware for "MP Scheduled Scan" with an Action to start a program "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Security Essentials\MpCmdRun.exe Scan -ScheduleJob -WinTask
 -RestrictPrivilegesScan". This is obviously the entry that causes this other scan to occur.</p>
<p>Is this Antimalware Scan different to the MSE Scheduled Full Scan?? How was the&nbsp;Task Scheduler entry created, when I don't see a Task Scheduler entry for the Scheduled Scan from within MSE itself?? Can this Antimalware scan be deleted???</p>
<p>I cannot see any logs etc. anywhere for either scan, so I can't tell if they ever find anything or not, or if they look like they are doing the same thing. Is there somewhere to look to see the logs from MSE scans??</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello, Neil.</p>
<p>I'll answer the "easy" part first by referring you to some other discussions/posts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logs: <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msescan/thread/e7ed7b1a-9015-4851-b550-3c013f8d1d44" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msescan/thread/e7ed7b1a-9015-4851-b550-3c013f8d1d44</a> and -<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msescan/thread/25a5032b-4c54-413f-895d-38805682c96a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msescan/thread/25a5032b-4c54-413f-895d-38805682c96a</a></p>
<p>Now a question for you. Why would you want to delete the antimalware scan that you have observed as happening in addition to your scheduled scan?</p>
<p>Do you see two entries for the scan in the Task Scheduler?</p>
<p>At what time is that task entry (which I suspect is the only entry for the scan) shown as next scheduled to run? My guess is that you will see that it is actually your full scan and the next run is Sunday around 2 am.</p>
<p>MSE creates a single scheduled task for the scan. If you delete it, MSE will recreate it.</p>
<p>I also believe that the "off schedule" scan that you have observed is being performed by MSE upon application of an updated signature or in response to MSE detecting something suspicious and confirming that no known signature is present by performing a Quick
 Scan.</p>

<h3> wanttoknowmore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Building an expression to calculate number of days on an access 2007 form</h2>
                    Hello, I have a form with a control box containing the following expression:<br />
<br />
=DateDiff("d",[Enrolled Date],[Closed date])<br />
<br />
Enrolled Date and Closed Date are entered on the form manually for each record and are displayed on my main table. I’m using this expression to calculate the total number of days that people are enrolled. This works great for people who have a closed date.
<br />
<br />
How do I tell Access 2007 that for those few people still enrolled and without an closed date that I want this control box to calculate the number of enrolled days as the difference between the enrolled date and today’s date while still keeping the above expression
 for all those with a closed date? I think I have to you an "If, then" expression, but I'm not sure how to do it.<br />
<br />
The result I want is to have each record in form view automatically display how many days the person has been enrolled for whether they are currently enrolled or have closed their enrollment. The way I have it set up right now only gives me a value for those
 with a closed date. Those without a closed date just show up blank.<br />
<br />
If it helps I do have another field in my table that shows who is "Enrolled" or "Closed".<br />
Thank you<br />

</p><p>Looking at one folder as an example - the metrics show this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3828248-97a2-419e-b0d0-78e52569af62?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3828248-97a2-419e-b0d0-78e52569af62?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to Version History for the first file, I see this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2b7d481-a891-486b-80e5-d8d69df568b8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2b7d481-a891-486b-80e5-d8d69df568b8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>There is only version and the current version of the file is just over 100 kb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening for all my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Mr,<br />
<br />
I tried to repro your situation here, and I cannot get my total size showing any contents, did you add this column from existing site columns or you crated the column? If you created this Total Size column, could you share the specific content of it?<br />
<br />
Additionally, other columns such as % of Parent and % of Site Quota is also not available on my end. Please let us know how you created these.<br />
<br />
Besides Total Size, where is you get this? OneDrive online? My site is slightly different form yours, I add Total form existing site columns:<br />

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks to me like you're viewing your files in One Drive Classic mode, as that's the view I see if I click the following in the bottom-right of the screen:
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19aec0b2-ae26-4350-aa71-f62564f07f37?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19aec0b2-ae26-4350-aa71-f62564f07f37?upload=true" /></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do that, I am redirected from this URL</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://myemployer-my.sharepoint.com/personal/my_name_myemployer_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fmy%5Fname%5Fmyemployer%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FSQL</p>
<p>
</p><p>To this one:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://myemployer-my.sharepoint.com/personal/my_name_myemployer_com/Documents/Forms/All.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fpersonal%2Fmy%5Fname%5Fmyemployer%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FSQL</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I see the same layout as you:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87385dc3-ee22-4f5e-b446-e51d40b06b0d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87385dc3-ee22-4f5e-b446-e51d40b06b0d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I get to the Storage Metrics via this URL:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://myemployer-my.sharepoint.com/personal/my_name_myemployer_com/_layouts/15/storman.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replacing myemployer with my employer's name and my_name with my Microsoft Name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, I can get to Storage Metrics via One Drive for Business as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa5960ec-ed4c-40d5-973d-77671aa3cb62?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa5960ec-ed4c-40d5-973d-77671aa3cb62?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>From any list of files in OneDrive, I click the settings cog, search for <strong>
librar</strong> and click on the "Site contents" link in the search results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That takes me here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://myemployer-my.sharepoint.com/personal/my_name_myemployer_com/_layouts/15/viewlsts.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I end up here - and click on the Settings link shown below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92afb476-7dd9-407e-be18-e612bc6bf092?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92afb476-7dd9-407e-be18-e612bc6bf092?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I then end up here:</p>

<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fad76f8-1e17-484e-9232-674d19439c60?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fad76f8-1e17-484e-9232-674d19439c60?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And click on "Storage Metrics" and end up here:</p>

</p><p>https://myemployer-my.sharepoint.com/personal/my_name_myemployer_com/_layouts/15/storman.aspx</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>And if I click on Documents, for example, I end up here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://myemployer-my.sharepoint.com/personal/my_name_myemployer_com/_layouts/15/storman.aspx?root=Documents</p>

<p>
</p><p>Drill down to a folder to end up on the same view I provided in my initial message on this thread.</p>

<p>Additionally, I did a test where I put a 2.5 Mb file in the root of my One Drive for Business. It displayed in Storage Metrics as taking up 3mb:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01867ffb-18d5-4d53-8958-429221c64910?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01867ffb-18d5-4d53-8958-429221c64910?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a new folder called&nbsp;<strong>a</strong> in the root of One Drive, and put the file into that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I did that, the 3mb file then showed as taking up 11.9 mb, when viewed in the folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c67a7f1-8195-47c4-a1ff-f7aadf75625c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c67a7f1-8195-47c4-a1ff-f7aadf75625c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the above actions using Windows Explorer - with the updates syncing to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do the same actions online in OneDrive, the issue does not happen - the size of the file in the
<strong>a</strong> folder is the same as it was in the root of One Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Skype on Samsung Focus II doesn&#39;t work properly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype on Samsung Focus II doesn&#39;t work properly</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder whether somebody can help me with this:</p>
<p>I upgraded to the most recent version on Skype, using Mango on a Samsung Focus II. However even when on WIFI I don't have&nbsp;a proper audio connection. Funny enough that video works pretty much okay. There are no issues with Skype on other devices via the same
 WIFI, e.g. Samsung Galaxy Tablet or Windows 7 Laptop. </p>
<p>How can I get Skype to work on Windows Phone as it is supposed to be? So far the experience has been rather disappointing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I think the best way for tracking this down is to get in touch with Skype Support instead. Here is the appropriate forum:</p>
<p><a href="http://community.skype.com/t5/Windows-Phone/bd-p/Windows_Phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://community.skype.com/t5/Windows-Phone/bd-p/Windows_Phone</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also make sure you mention the correct phone, version, firmware, etc when posting to help the support staff. Note that the Samsung Focus II has not been released yet so it is probably
<em>Focus S</em> or <em>Focus Flash</em>? The <em>Focus II</em> will start selling later this month.</p>

<h2>            Not Receiving Emails In Outlook.com Account From Certain Addresses</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have noticed that Outlook.com accounts do not receive emails from certain email addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per other posts, adding the email address to the Safe Senders list alleviates the issue, but this is a site with thousands of members and we cannot expect all users to be able to complete this task to receive email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, the email doesn't even show up in Spam/Junk, it just simply never arrives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SPF and DKIM records all pass when viewing the source of a received email when it is in the Safe Senders list. There must be a way to validate that this is legitimate email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we go about making sure that these emails are received on Outlook.com accounts?</p>
