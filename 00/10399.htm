<h2>            Lumia 710 - Does it use Nokia pc suite&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Does the Nokia Lumia use the Nokia PC Suite?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And why doesn't the phone show up in my computer? when it is connected by the USB, Zune shows and I can do things by that but doesn't show in my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help</p>

<p>Hey RECOPECO,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to the forum! Lumia 710 does not support Nokia PC Suite. PC Suite is a software for older Nokia models with Symbian or Nokia OS operating system. Lumia 710 supports only Zune.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Lumia 710 is intended to be used only with the Zune software. That is why it doesn't show up in My Computer. It does not have the mass memory mode when you connect the USB cable like the Symbian phones have.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this</span></span><span>&nbsp;<span>answered</span>&nbsp;<span>your question.</span></span></p>

<p>In order to troubleshoot, can you:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- check your email account&nbsp;and verify that an email exists in the "Sent Items" folder</p>
<p>-&nbsp;check with the invitee to&nbsp;see if the email&nbsp;appeared in their junk folder</p>

This was an absolutely USELESS response.  



First, how the heck would a "sent" item be found when the Microsoft Office server is sending out the invitations? There's no way a "sent" email containing the invitation will be found in the "sent" items folder.  



Second, what the fat is wrong with you? Obviously, we have checked with the recipient to see if the "Invitation" was in their junk or spam folders. Duh.  



The reason why people like me are here is because we just paid $99 for a subscription we are supposedly able to share with family members, but your system doesn't freaking work.  



NOW, what the $^#%#( do I have to do to share my Office 365 subscription, when your system never sends invitations to the people I invite? PLEASE ANSWER and SKIP THE ****.

            <p>Here's a possible explanation and solution. I say possible because my setup may be different from yours but I think I figured out what was wrong with mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same issue: I would send invites to members of my family and they would never see the invites. I assumed that the emails would be sent by the back-end/MS server but I discovered while looking at my emails that oddly, the invites were in my Sent
 Mail items. Here's what I think happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a custom domain name email as well as an outlook.com email address and outlook.com is configured to retrieve and send email via my custom domain provider's servers. The invite is being sent from
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (the account used to purchase Office) to
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** but using my provider's SMTP server. Most SMTP servers are configured to prohibit relaying so the email will not be sent. That is, unless I am sending the email
<strong>from </strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** or sending it
<strong>to </strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** the SMTP server will reject the email. Unfortunately, there was no notification of the rejection when the invites&nbsp;were sent but I subsequently tested this scenario
 and indeed, the email is refused by the SMTP server when the send button is clicked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I solved the problem by sending the invites to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***. The email was then received and with a couple of clicks, Office was activated for them. You may also be able to fix the issue by finding the invite in your sent items and manually forwarding it but specifying a different from
 address (if you have multiple aliases). Maybe. There may be other problems with the invitation process that I haven't come across yet. As they say, YMMV (your mileage may vary). Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Rhialto has the point here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that Microsoft's email sending violates the SPF (<a href="http://www.openspf.org/Introduction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sender Policy Framework</a>) spam protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Namely, Microsoft sends invitation email from their hotmail.com mail server but with your own email address designated as the sender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many mail servers reject these kind of emails as SPF violation. They receive mail from hotmail.com server but designated as sent from you, through your own email provider. This is a typical spammer's way of faking the address so they reject it as spam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A workaround (tested and proven), until Microsoft corrects this and indentifies their mail as sent from hotmail.com and not from you:</p>
<p>1. A workaround works, if the person you would like to invite, has other email address, that is not subject to SPF validation.</p>
<p>2. Send invitation to this other email address.</p>
<p>3. The invitee will now receive the invitation. The invitee should accept the invitation. You will see it in your Office account.</p>
<p>4. The invitee during/after the installation of MS Office connects to his/her Microsoft/Office account with his "primary" or "intended" email address.</p>

            <p>You two are genius. &nbsp;I was using a customized domain as well. &nbsp;The only thing to add to your explanation is that you need to look at your outlook.com sent folder. &nbsp;Your outlook desktop captures your customized domain sent mail. &nbsp;So at first I didn't think
 you were correct, but then I logged in to the web version and there were over 20 invitations I had tried to send. &nbsp;I had each person accept the invitation right from my computer and then log into their own microsoft account to finish the process. &nbsp;Never did
 figure out how to forward the sent mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            I purchased the 365 package and successfully launched it on all family machines - two are Macs. &nbsp;We simply got everyone to follow the instructions using my email and the password authentications - having said this I absolutely loath this on-line game for
 this kind of service. &nbsp;I would much rather buy a programme and pass it round the way we used to. I've read some of the complaints here and I don't even understand some of it - so for those of you able to understand your and their email systems and the various
 server rituals; I am impressed.

            <p>Manually forwarding the invite from the inviter's sent folder worked for me, too.&nbsp; In my case, inviter was a @Hotmail.com address, though the *recipient* was a custom domain (supported by Hotmail.com).&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe Microsoft is trying to use SMTP from domain
 that doesn't usually send email&nbsp;(like office.com)? </p>

            <p>HI all</p>
<p>The solution is as suggested.</p>
<p>Go to your Sent box the bounced item will be there</p>
<p>Delete the extra guff at the top of the email and replace the subject with Invite to 365.</p>
<p>Forward it to &nbsp;the recipients address again.</p>
<p><span>Their invite will be sent.</span></p>
<p><span>Once received they click on the ACCEPT button they will be taken to the login page. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Login in with the email address it was sent to and their password.</p>
<p>Voila they will be taken to the Office 365 account page where they can view what is available etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have access to the accounts I forwarded to I can verify this method works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Table of contents - Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have edited an existing table of contents (TOC) in Word and used to get a question "do you wish to replace the current table of contents".&nbsp; But this no longer happens, instead a second TOC is added to the original TOC which makes a nonsense of the TOC.&nbsp;
 This has only recently happened after an Office update.&nbsp; Any ideas how to rectify?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify the process I use (I want to only show headings 1 and 2, not 3 plus)&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Right click in the TOC</p>
<p>- Select "edit field"</p>
<p>- Select TOC and enter</p>
<p>- Amend levels to show 2 and OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>This then used to prompt a question to replace the current TOC, but now just adds two TOCs (one with two levels and the original one with three).</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>Until the bug is corrected, you have another option. Instead of using <strong>
Edit Field</strong>, just press <strong>Alt+F9</strong> to display the TOC field code. Then edit the levels from&nbsp;<strong> \o "1-3"
</strong>to&nbsp;<strong> \o "1-2"</strong>. Then press <strong>Alt+F9</strong> to toggle the display back and
<strong>F9</strong> to update the field.</p>

<p>Hi Jeanette, thanks for the feedback here! It would be helpful if you could provide a couple additional pieces of information:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Which version exactly of Word do you have installed? To check your version, you should be able to do the following:
<ol>
<li>Open Word.</li><li>Choose&nbsp;<span>File &gt; Account</span>.</li><li>Under&nbsp;<span>Product Information</span>, note the version number under the&nbsp;<span>About section</span>.</li></ol>
</li><li>Does this issue happen with any ToC or is it just specific to certain ones/specific documents? Are you able to reproduce the issue in a new document while creating the ToC from scratch?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Charlie</p>

<p>Hi Charlie</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version number is 1904.&nbsp; I was working on an existing document using the standard TOCs available from the Reference Tab.&nbsp; I have used the automatic tables 1 and 2 and the problems are with both of these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have just set up a new document to test this and it all works fine - when editing the TOC, I then receive an email asking me if I want to replace the TOC, which is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that the problem not with new documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>Jeanette</p>

            For what it's worth, I find the automatic tables (which are in a content control) difficult to work with. If instead you use the
<strong>Custom Table of Contents...</strong> option (I think it may be called something different in Word 2016), which opens the
<strong>Table of Contents</strong> dialog, you can select all your options at the outset. It then becomes easier to edit as well.

    <title>Excel Text Wrap hiding part of text when specific cell is not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shonbullo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Text Wrap hiding part of text when specific cell is not selected.</h2>
                    So, I have a problem, I take notes in excel cells, and I give speeches from those notes. However, even with text wrap on, it cuts off part of the text. If I type "Morality is an inherent within our society that everyone abides" and then hit enter to move
 onto the next cell down the row, when I'm not typing in that cell it only shows part of it, for example all I can see without selecting that cell is "Morality is an inherent within our society that everyone". Does anyone know how to fix that? The text is still
 there, but it's not visible without me physically clicking and selecting the cell to edit.&nbsp;

            Excel's text wrapping mechanism isn't perfect. You'll have to increase the column width or the row height to see&nbsp;the entire&nbsp;text.

                    I have purchased a remote access&nbsp;program called ammyy and MSE keeps killing it and does not give me the option to allow it. I have white listed the file and file location, but MSE still keeps killing it when I try to download it. Is there a way to cause
 MSE to allow/accept certain files and/or file locations with the Real-time protection? If MSE cannot white list user defined files I will be forced to move to another anti-virus program.

            <p>For the latest version of mse (version 4)&nbsp;uncheck the box that says "apply reccomended actions" under the default actions submenu.&nbsp; Then each time MSE detects anything you will be prompted what you would like to do.&nbsp; If you trust the detected program you
 can allow it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also you can submit a false positive report to microsoft.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft account, skype, alias, contacs</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>Back to 2008 i created an hotmail account. Last year, i created two alias based on that account and i deleted the old hotmail address setting one of the new addresses as primary. In fact, the old hotmail disappeared from outlook.com but now i see that are
 still associated to my skype account. I would like to change it by replacing to my actual email and erasing completely that old email address and all the connections that exists like old contacts that are appearing as suggestions "based on my profile" in my
 LinkedIn account.</p>
<p>Is this procedure possible?</p>
<p>Thanks to all :)</p>

<p>I understand you want to schedule a delayed email in Office 365 OWA&nbsp;(<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>).</p>
<p>Currently, it is not feasible in OWA. This can only be done with an Outlook client.</p>
<p>However, your idea is great. We welcome and encourage you to share your ideas through:

    <title>How do I search through text and delete everything except words that - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> locutus85  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I search through text and delete everything except words that contain a certain character&#63;</h2>
                    Hi. I'm thinking that this might not even need a macro but I can't figure out how to do it. There will be text including email addresses on a site. I just want the addresses. So I copied all the text into Notepad so only the ASCII would remain. Now it's
 easier to handle. After copying it into Word I want to search through it and delete everything but the addresses. So the obvious thing to do is search for the "@" and delete any word that doesn't have it. I want the result to be a list of addresses - each
 on its own line - and nothing else. Does anyone know how to make a macro for this?&nbsp; I have Word 2007. I also have Excel 2007 if that allows for an easier solution. Thanks.

<p>Hi Angela Wells13,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are sorry to inform you that Skype user name cant be changed. This is because,&nbsp;Your Skype name is the username you created when you first joined Skype, other than your email address or phone number. Also,&nbsp;If you sign in with an email address or phone
 number instead, then you have a Microsoft account, not a <strong><em>Skype Name</em></strong>. However, if you want to be searched on your preferred name you can change the display name of your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Sign in to www.skype.com</p>
<p>2. Click on EDIT profile.</p>
<p>3. Click on Edit button and enter your preferred name.</p>
<p>4. Click Save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Sign in to Skype application.</p>
<p>2. Click your Avatar at the upper left corner of the screen.</p>
<p>3. Click on the pen icon beside your name and enter your preferred name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reply.</p>

            The Help file for earlier versions of Outlook identified the path for scanpst - try searching Outlook 2013 Help for
<em>scanpst</em> to see if that gives you the location.&nbsp; [For Outlook 2007, it's in
<em>drive</em>:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE12 but that will not be the same for you - perhaps it's in ...\Office14 though]

            yeah that its same problem like us from indonesia, so we really appreciate that if nokia can make nokia file update firmware without use nokia updater, so we only get new firmware file from internet like symbian application, after that send it to our mobile,
 and then install it only like that, not nokia updater download files update directly install it to our mobile, if connection have problem and disconnect our mobile can useless... oke i agree with you to give suggestion or opinion to our nokia Software development
 to think it.. to update nokia firmware without use nsu only instal like application symbian...

            I have done re-install of FW before. I can say for sure that NSU store FW file in our PC. Because, it took very few minute to check FW and start upgrade process. If you plan to do on many mobiles but the same PC, the later ones could take a lot less time.

            It stores the file in the Application Data folder of the User.<br />
The FW file, its is not an EXE but NSU's file.<br />
<br />
If it uses the same file for the other phones too i have not yet tried.

<p>Hey all, first of all I'm sorry for my bad English. I bought my E5 one month ago and its just great. I have just one problem, when I try to use my original (from the box) headphones for headset can hear nothing... When I plug it in, check headset and call
 someone can't hear nothing. When I press the headphones button and hold it down everything is prefect but its not handsfree anymore, because I can't hold it down at all the time. Headphones is OK, because I try to listen music sound is great. Tried another
 headphones, same like this one but its the same. Tried my headphones with Nokia C5 and its the same problem... And now don't know what to do, anyone with this problem?</p>

            Your headset jack must be fully insert to your 3.5 A V connector. When you insert half of the jack the phone will ask to choose a option. (Headset, Handphone)

<p>Hi John Patton,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft AU Daemon is a small piece of software that periodically checks Microsoft's servers to see if there are updates to Microsoft Office.
</p>
<p>Since the version of your outlook is little old, please try to update to the latest. For your reference:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Check-for-Office-for-Mac-updates-automatically-bfd1e497-c24d-4754-92ab-910a4074d7c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Check-for-Office-for-Mac-updates-automatically-bfd1e497-c24d-4754-92ab-910a4074d7c1</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to disable the Microsoft AU Daemon (<strong>However it is probably a good idea to leave it running</strong>), follow below steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open System Preferences</li><li>Select Accounts</li><li>Select Log-In Items</li><li>Select Microsoft AU Daemon</li><li>Click the "-" icon to remove it (or just hit delete)</li></ol>

<h2>            How to redeem and &#47; or use Zune Marketplace Giftcards&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just came across a couple of $25 Zune Marketplace gift cards given to me for my birthday years ago.</p>
<p>AND just discovered that the Marketplace no longer exists.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how I can get a refund, or use the cards to buy music, if I don't have an Xbox or whatever else one uses Microsoft points for?</p>
<p>Are the cards of any value whatsoever?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Thank you so very much!</p>
<p>It worked with the first card I tried.</p>
<p>I don't think I know what to do with $50 worth of Microsoft store credits yet, so I won't try the second card for now.</p>
Just great to know money wasn't wasted on my gift. At least, not yet :)

                    I have two Skype accounts, one that I use mainly and the other that was set up after when I forgot my details to the main one. Skype has for some reason signed me out of the main one, and now I can only get into the secondary one - please advise! They
 are both connected to the same email account, but I always used my profile name with the first - this also doesn't seem to be working now.

            Hello GRÁINNEGILLIS<br /><br />I am a fellow Community member here to help. I am very sorry to hear that you are experiencing this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />by any chance did this issue start occurring after you updated to the newest version of Skype?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new version of Skype is still under development and as such is lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and contains many bugs.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected in the very near future that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in order to add features and functionality and correct known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has listened to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_b

            <p>The online tool does not ever finish. I have tried it twice and both times my entire office software uninstalls and I have to reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other programs have the issue. This is the only database we use but there are various other subsections under this database. They all crash at various times. I will try the analyzer and see if it helps. I will follow up again in a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing as how it crashes randomly. I will let you know either as soon as it crashes again, or if it has not crashed in say 24-48 hours. If you have any other suggestions in the meantime, let me know. Thanks</p>

            Just as an fyi. I have exhausted all options listed. As well as doing updates and uninstall and reinstall again. Do you have any other suggestions?&nbsp;

<p>And why an earth would you want to use an 'app launcher' to start any office component?</p>
<p>You need to specify what you are trying to achieve, for what purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have Office Starter this installs a virtual Q drive, the contents of which are not visible or accessible &nbsp;to explorer</p>

    <title>How to display ordinals in date field in mailmerge Word 2010 from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> w.m.mitchell  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to display ordinals in date field in mailmerge Word 2010 from Excel data source&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've looked for last couple of days for solution to issue but haven't had luck beyond the basic date display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A mailmerge was bringing up a date problem that is quite common.&nbsp; The display wasn't right as I was getting a numerical display where Word 2010 was just taking the basic date in Excel without the Excel formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution easy to find on net.&nbsp; Didn't have to follow complicated way of changing anything in options and confirming any conversion business, there's the much easier option of just changing the mergefield coding, like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { MERGEFIELD Date '\a "dddd, MMMM d, yyyy}</p>
<p>
</p><p>That gives me this display on today's date:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday, August 5, 2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's great and it's simple!&nbsp; However, I actually need ordinals, like so:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday, August 5th, 2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that there is a possible switch in \ * Ordinal, but only found examples on regular field codes and nothing that actually worked in the mailmerge scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help, please, in getting ordinals in the syntax so that all the dates show the appropriate one according to the number?&nbsp; i.e., st for 1st, nd for 2nd, rd for 3rd, th for 4th, etc., etc.??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand from some posts and results via googling that superscript may not be possible (?) and that is secondary.&nbsp; Certainly ordinals in superscript would be ideal, but I can live without that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Superscript, too, is possible! You can use a field coded as:</p>
<p>
<span>{QUOTE{SET MergeDate {MERGEFIELD Date}}{MergeDate \@ "dddd 'the' d"}{IF{=(MOD({={MergeDate \@ d}+89},100)&gt;2)*(MOD({={MergeDate \@ d}+9},10)&lt;3)}= 1 {=MOD({MergeDate \@ d},10)-2 \#
<sup>rd;st;nd</sup>} <sup>th</sup>}{MergeDate \@ "' of' MMMM, yyyy"}}</span>
</p><p>
</p><p>where 'Date' is the name of the field containing the date in the data source. Note the superscripted ordinals in the field code.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>The field brace pairs (i.e. '{ }') for the above example are all created in the document itself, via Ctrl-F9 (Cmd-F9 on a Mac); you can't simply type them or copy &amp; paste them from this message. Nor is it practicable to add them via any
 of the standard Word dialogues. For a macro to convert either of the above into working field codes (after which you'd need to re-apply the superscripting), see

<p>Hi all</p>
<p>I have successfully migrated a customer's mail from an SBS 2003 exchange server to Office 365 using the Cut Over Migration method.&nbsp;They have been&nbsp;live on 365 for almost a month now.</p>
<p>Should I now Delete the Migration Batch?</p>

<p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>I have done some research but found no official article regarding cutover migration from SBS Exchange to Exchange Online. However, from your post, I noticed that your cutover migration batch from SBS Exchange to Exchange Online has been completed and users
 are using Office 365 for Business Online services properly for one month. It indicates that the migration should be completed successfully.</p>
<p>Based on my personal experience, if you have corrected corresponding DNS records to point to Office 365 and it works properly for all of the users, you can delete the migration batch and it won’t affect the Office 365 Online services.</p>
<p>Feel free to post back for any further concerns.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Aaron</p>

<h3> steven whiting  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 shared mailbox issue</h2>
                    <p>We have a mailbox that is shared. It has a licence attached to it and was working fine for ages. The account that is linked to it has been disabled in on-prem AD and in Office 365 sign in is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're now having an issue where people that have access to it, can't view it in Outlook anymore. With one user, if we choose repair on her Outlook profile, when you reopen Outlook the shared mailbox reappears. But a few seconds later it disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an admin I gave myself full control over the mailbox. It sits in my Outlook just fine and never disappears. But for two users it just refuses to stay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I search for on Exchange with powershell to troubleshoot the mailbox?</p>
