<h2>            Why does Internet Explorer freeze up all the time&#63;  Whether I&#39;m on Facebook or Yahool email.</h2>
                    Nov 15, 2012 I recieved support from Window Answer Desk,&nbsp; I was having trouble with internet explorer freezing up and had taken help from Windows Best Help.&nbsp; They had called me about many hits showing up on their info.&nbsp; After thinking about it I wasn't
 too sure if they were ligitamate so I called the Answer Desk and recieve help.&nbsp; The tech who helped me cleared alot of stuff off my computer and I was working pretty well for a while, I was still having problems playing Words with Friends on Facebook.&nbsp; It
 would freeze up and I'd have to refresh the screen.&nbsp; It's getting worse now and I need help!&nbsp; My order # MS11276932100

<h2>            MS Project prints extra page  with one line</h2>
                    <p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When printing using any printer in MS Project 2010 I always get the last line of my schedule on the last page. For example: I have a 50 line schedule, ask the printer to fit it on 1 by 1 page, resulting in two pages with 1-49 on page one and line 50 alone
 on page 2. Having a legend or not does make a difference. I have tried multiple printers inc pdf printers and its the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>First of all is your version of Project fully updated? It should be version 14.0.7176.5000. If not, run Windows Update.</p>

<h2>            N97 mini&#58; piece of &#42;&#42;bleep&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    
<p>I've owned this phone for about six moths now, and I'm so totally **bleep** off with it. Nothing works. There are tens of different software problems in it. Menus are not working smoothly, music player is very slow to use, for example deleting songs from
 the library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connecting to the computer is so unbelievably problematic: usually needs to shut down the phone and reconnect battery to get it connected to computer. MTP-driver fails to install, some other drivers wont install. Why the hell it needs to install some drivers
 in every third time I connect it to the comp??? Isn't one time install enough?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These Comes With Music-things are mainly pure **bleep**. Ovi Player and Ovi Suite doesn't work. The usability is poor in them. Things just doesn't work like Windows and they crash often. Music downloads are often slow, and the worst part is that if you change
 a computer, you have to download everything again to get those DRM-licences back. Or at least have to reload the licence. The same apply to the phone: it was serviced because of the software issues, and now I have to reload licence again to every **bleep**ing
 track again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Softwares are all up to date, and still they don't work. There are problems with installing for example Ovi Maps updates, getting error unknow error -5, problems with installing soundpacks to Ovi Maps. Have to do hard reset at least once in a month, because
 the phone slows down and doesn't work well anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are only few problems mentioned, there are so many of them that I can't even remember them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ive owned a cell phone since 1996, and have had mainly Nokias, but I bet this is my last Nokia ever! The phone really isn't worth of 500€ I've payed of it.</p>

 it's only possible to get it running reasonably, you just need to find every tip you can to optimise everything and it is useable, but there are 100's of threads on the forum regarding this subject and you should be able to find some tips and workarrounds

            Nah... It's not about optimizing the device. It just doesn't work like it's supposed to work. Main problem in my opinion is this Symbian platform. There are so many bugs in this firmware, that it just ruins the whole product. For example if you want to
 remove ten tracks from the music player library, it takes at least five minutes to get done. Hey, really, this makes the phone usable??? Today I needed navigation on the road, and I noticed the sounds don't work att all! How is it cured with any optimization?
 And few minutes ago I noticed, that the relicencing of the music tracks doesn't work at all. Doesn't log in on my account. Just looping message wait a moment in th web browser...<br />
<br />
These promblems are maybe small, but when you have a product with tens of them, it spoils the product. I don't want to optimize my phone by using hundreds of tweaks, I only want a phone that works like it should be working. Without any crashing, without unknown
 error messages, without slowing down in a month of normal use, without needing to reinstall firmware or resetting it two times a month. This n97 mini just is ridicolous and as a paying customer I think I have a right to get working product.

<p>Although I do not doubt you are having the issues stated, I've also&nbsp;been using N97 mini now for 6 months with very few issues.&nbsp; I've had only one crash in that timeframe which resulted in an auto power down-reset.&nbsp; Otherwise, the phone has been very reliable.
 Navigation,&nbsp;maps, browsing,&nbsp;email/calendar/tasks sync to exchange, music, video, converters, calculators, travel</p>
<p>guides, bluetooth, camera, etc. all work very well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is true the phone is a bit slow&nbsp;due to it's slower processor and Symbian is a bit difficult to use, but the operating system is very mature and stable.&nbsp; Although I am envious of Android&nbsp;and available h/w I'm scared of the newness of the platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hopeful that the upcoming N9 h/w with Meego or Symbian^3 will prove to be just as reliable.&nbsp; If so, I will buy Nokia again.</p>

<p>Hi nixy_fedorov!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm aware of that and I have been in contact with Nokia-team many times referring these issues. But to be honest, they only shrug their shoulders and that's about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last problem I had here only few minutes ago was when I tried to remove file folders using windows explorer, and the phone stopped responding. It completely freezed. And it happened twice. And only thing helped was shutting it down' and removing battery
 for a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only few minutes later, the keylock freezed. The phone only announces me to open keylock usin sliding switch and it does nothing. Batteryindicator has disappeared from the screen too. I can't even shut the phone down from the powerbutton. The only way, once
 again, is to remove battery.</p>

<p>Instead of posting a bleep filled rant did you not think to ask the users here for help? You've made three posts so far and not once have you asked for any assistance.<br />
<br />
This whole point of this forum is for users to help each other, it is not a place for voicing your complaints to Nokia. Constructive, polite feedback is welcome, bleep filled rants are not and they will not be passed on.<br />
<br />
I suggest you do one of two things:<br />
<br />
1. Start a new topic, be polite and ask the other users here for help to resolve your issues, giving as much detail as possible.<br />
<br />
2. If you feel that users cannot help you then write an official letter of complaint to Nokia in your country politely detailing your problems. The complaints address can be obtained by calling Nokia care.</p>

<p>Thx for Your polite answer. It was very helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have following problems with the phone:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. It crashes from time to time.</p>
<p>2. It is slow.</p>
<p>3. Menus are not working smoothly</p>
<p>4. Music player is VERY VERY slow and sticky.</p>
<p>5. Albumpictures doesn't load, or&nbsp;load very slow.</p>
<p>6. Changing tracks won't work sometimes at all. Phone simply freezes. Or the track changes&nbsp;after 15-30 sec.</p>
<p>7. Key lock have locked the phone couple of times so well, that it could be reopened only by removing battery.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;Track removal from the library is very slow. Takes simply too mch time to remove songs from the library.</p>
<p>9. The battery doesn't last anywhere near&nbsp;as promised</p>
<p>10. Bluetooth connection with headsets breaks off.</p>
<p>11. The touchscreen scratches REALLY easily, only a piece of paper in the same pocket can scratch the screen.</p>
<p>12. The drivers doesn't work. USB MTP-driver fails often.</p>
<p>13. For some reason, drivers have to be installed more than once.</p>
<p>14. Ovi Maps is slow and sticky. Sometimes it doesn't find any adresses at all even used in online-mode.</p>
<p>15. Voices in Ovi Maps doesn't work. For some reason they just stopped working and the phone doesn't give any driving instructions at all.</p>
<p>16. The phone was a while ago serviced in a local AUTHORIZED Nokia service, and after the service, where they reinstalled the firmware, EVERYONE of the downloaded Comes With Music-album track needs to be relicensed. And it doesn't work. Once you need to
 log in to your account, then it shoud do it automatically, but the phone (browser) only gets stuck in a somekind&nbsp;loop, and nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are few problems that I've had with the phone. Please, do You, dear psychomania, have any help for these problems?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And by the way, I have been in contact with Nokia, and&nbsp;according to them, there is nothing wrong with the phone. Maybe so, but according to my own experience, things are a bit differently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yet,&nbsp;I live here in Finland, where they make these "better" Nokia phones, and&nbsp;I have&nbsp;known the company Nokia since they were&nbsp;manufacturing&nbsp;only rubber boots. I have owned 13 mobile phones during last 15 years. Eight of them Nokias, and I really am a
 Nokiaman, yet only due my home country! But this Nokia N97 mini is the worst phone ever. So please,&nbsp; don't try to be smart here. Sorry, but the phone just is carbage, and to be honest I want others to know it too, so they won't make the same mistake I did.</p>

    <title>How can I share an Office 365 Excel Online spreadsheet with anybody - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#91;--steve--&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I share an Office 365 Excel Online spreadsheet with anybody that has the link&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I would like to create a publicly-accessible Excel Online spreadsheet (similar to the way that Google Sheets can be made public) accessible to anyone who has the link. Clearly the option does exist, as there is a radio button on the "share" control in Excel
 Online labelled with "anyone". However, it is greyed out and the info tooltip says "Your organization is preventing you from selecting this option".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please could you tell me (or direct me to any existing documentation on) the exact steps to take to enable this capability? I have administrator access to the Office 365 portal so should be able to modify the necessary settings if you could tell me which
 settings need to be modified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Hi Neo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions. I've given this a try, but it doesn't seem to solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set the global Sharepoint sharing settings to allow anonymous links:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2fe4ae57-cc45-41a3-a86f-cd7f36221c58?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2fe4ae57-cc45-41a3-a86f-cd7f36221c58?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>and I've set the sharing properties for the site collection to allow anonymous sharing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ba93a5c-7614-4d5a-a6ff-d74aa4f2cf17?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ba93a5c-7614-4d5a-a6ff-d74aa4f2cf17?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But I still get the same greyed-out radio button shown in my original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you suggest any other solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Dear Neo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have tried this on two Excel documents. One is stored in a personal OneDrive: https://[my-organisation]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ and one is stored in a Office 365 Group site:&nbsp;https://[my-organisation].sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/groupname</p>
<p>2. These were created in Excel 2016 for Mac and saved to SharePoint Online.</p>
<p>3. We currently have a minimal userbase while we test Office 365 and try to work out whether there are any flaws that would prevent us fully adopting the platform. However, there is one other administrator who has tried sharing these documents and it has
 not worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to try and do a minimal example, I have followed the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. open Excel Online via the Office 365 portal.</p>
<p>2. create a new Workbook</p>
<p>3. Save the Workbook from Excel Online to the [--Steve--]&gt;Documents online location.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1155e62-a4ca-4d8f-b721-a7bed3a40072?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1155e62-a4ca-4d8f-b721-a7bed3a40072?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Click the Share button</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ac10bfd-6078-4b70-9e62-f4f76aaa09c3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ac10bfd-6078-4b70-9e62-f4f76aaa09c3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, even with this example using my personal file storage, not a Team site, sharing is not permitted.</p>

<br />
<br />I am sorry it did not solve the issue. Since we are a user community we can not access your account details. So I will immediately route your request to a higher level of Skype support, who can access your account details, and will help you sort this out.
<br />
<br />Kind regards
<br />Maggie

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the only way to invite external (non Skype, Skype For Business) users to a Skype meeting, by sending an invite via Outlook? Can I send an invite by email through the desktop client - "Meet Now". I thought there was a way of doing it, but can't figure
 it out?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update. I actually figured it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you select Meet Now, it will add you as a participant. If you select the participant icon, it will expand the participant list and also display 2 boxes (Invite More People, and Participant Actions). If you select Participant Actions, you have a sub menu,
 and an option to 'Invite By Email'. Tested it out with a gmail account, and worked like a charm.</p>

<p>What you describe is a contradiction in terms. So we have to clarify what you are talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Subscriptions are limited to 1 year or monthly. There is no such thing as a "lifetime subscription".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into File menu &gt; Account command and tell us the name of the bundle you have, Office 2016 "something" or Office 365 Personal.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the time frame you describe, builders started offering a "free" 1 year (they don't clearly mention that) subscription to Office 365 Personal.&nbsp; You actually paid for it in the price of the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you actually have Office 2016 Home and Student (or one of the other 2 "permanent" licenses) then you have a different problem.</p>

</p><p>Hello Bridgespotter,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This concern happens when time zones are involved. If you have moved from one place to another and there is a big difference with the time, some people have experienced this kind of concern. What you can do to correct this concern is
 to remove your birthday and set the time zone on your calendar on Outlook.com email account. Once done, add your birthday again to your calendar and check if it helps solve the issue. To correct the time zone in Outlook.com you can refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-the-time-zone-and-language-settings-in-outlook-com-8a34d50d-81b4-40c2-b304-b3d043566389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong> and follow the instructions provided.
</p>

<h3> jms925  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>WMP put wrong cover art and info on one of my albums. &nbsp;I manually changed it, but WMP changed it back. &nbsp;I went to "find album info" and then to "edit the information manually" and did that. &nbsp;It corrected the written info (titles, composer, etc) &nbsp;but not
 the album art. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now somehow WMP &nbsp;has put this same album (incorrect) art on to 350 of my 435 albums.!!! &nbsp; &nbsp; How do I fix the album art of these 350 albums. &nbsp;The windows 7 thread that said to right click on the album cover art box apparently doesn't work in Windows 10. &nbsp;I
 just want them to go back to generic &nbsp;art covers (i.e. NO art). &nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi - That's unfortunate! So do you normally just see the musical note icon?</p>
<p>and how about in the music folders in explorer... what's happened there? All these items are systemically interlinked so it depends upon how you have been managing your music library.</p>
<p>The quickest way to resolve this may be just to paste in the generic icon as art. It may overwrite the incorrect album art. Try that first (you can copy and paste the image from here - below) and see if that works.
<strong>Note that</strong> to see the <strong>'paste album art' </strong>option on the cover art box you need to have clicked
<strong>'copy'</strong> on an acceptable file (jpeg is best) beforehand. Let me know if this doesn't work - we'll delete the art folder contents and start over.</p>
<p>Cheers, Ric.</p>

<h2>            inserting spacers and blank rows. so  pivot table income statement looks good</h2>
                    Why doesn't Excel Pivot Tables allow spacers. I can't mess with the source data. I am trying to create consolidated Income Statements with company filters that can be printed and taken to Bankers, etc... &nbsp;Something that looks Professional. (Insert blank
 rows)

            Since no one else has taken a shot at this, I will.<br />
<br />
If this was MS Word, I'd say, rather than using blank rows, use the style formatting to set the desired rows height.&nbsp; I don't do much (any) pivot table work, so I haven't been able to figure out how to do this. I haven't found an example in my notes that does
 it. <br />
<br />
Maybe someone else can run with the idea.<br />
<br />
You could also try submitting the question on this site:<br />

he has LOTS of really good real world examples with downloadable files and he does answer questions.<br />

            Here’s some troubleshooting steps you can take one by one to see if it corrects your problem: 
<br />
<br />1) Make sure you have the latest version. Please check here for the versions:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/update-history-for-office-2016-for-mac-700cab62-0d67-4f23-947b-3686cb1a8eb7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/update...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Uninstall and then reinstall Office using these directions:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-office-2016-for-mac-issues-by-completely-uninstalling-before-you-reinstall-ec3aa66e-6a76-451f-9d35-cba2e14e94c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubl...</a>
<br />
<br />3) Roll back to a previous 16.xx version that did not have this problem.
<br />
<br />If you do roll back, when an update comes out, please update to see if your problem is corrected.

<p>To find your current version, open Microsoft Word (since Excel won't open) and go to the Word menu. Choose About Word. The version should be 16.14.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is any other version, do the following</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection before checking for updates. Install Mac OS X updates followed by Office updates.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Install Mac OS X updates first:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>To get Mac OS updates, go to the App store on your dock, and then click the Updates button to reveal available updates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Then Install Office Updates</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>To get the update:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open any Office application</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Let AutoUpdate check for and install updates</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart your Mac</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have any add-ins such as WebEx, Mendelay, EndNote, Zotero, TypeIt4me, etc it is essential that you install the latest updates for your add-ins.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If it is already 16.14.1 then try restarting your Mac and see if things are better.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Moving Emails to Folders</h2>
                    Ever since my hotmail acct was tranferred to Outlook, I can only move 1 email per session to the folder menu list: when I try to move another email, the folder list doesnt stay up. I can move emails using the "V" key but its much faster when using the
 move option. This problem is evident on other computers and well as IE and Firefox browsers.

            <p>Hi Needhelpnow,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means hrLogDiskFull.&nbsp; I cannot find specific instructions on how to address this problem - so I recommend starting with generic update-related troubleshooting procedures:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start by trying the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution, find and delete the contents (but not the folders themselves) of
<b>ONLY</b> the following two folders: Downloads and DataStore.<br />
<br />
And this MAY help resolve the problem if it is caused by an incomplete or stuck update - but it is not guaranteed to fix the update problem because at this point we don't really know the cause. This is one cause and there are many others that this procedure
 won't resolve.</span></p>
<p><span>If the above doesn't help, then I recommend the following in the order presented:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Try resetting the WU components:<br />
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How do I reset Windows Update components?</span></a></span></p>

            No email software would support that and shouldn't. There is no legitimate reason to hide your indentity when sending email.

    <title>Filtered Synchronization of public folder favourites, Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nosaj87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Filtered Synchronization of public folder favourites, Outlook 2010</h2>
                    
<p>In previous versions of outlook I have been able to apply a dated synchronization filter to the offline copy of my public folder favourites.&nbsp; Now when trying to add a filter I get the error message:</p>
<p>"The attempted operation failed. An object could not be found."</p>
<p>To get to this stage I have:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click public folders in the folder list. </li><li>Data file properties </li><li>Advanced button </li><li>Advanced tab </li><li>Use cached exchange mode and download public folder favorites. </li></ol>
Then to apply a filter, in the list of favorites:
<ol>
<li>right click, properties on one of the favorites. </li><li>synchronization tab </li><li>filter </li></ol>
<p>Applying a filter to any non-public folders still works.</p>
<p>Any ideas how to enable this?&nbsp; Or is there another way to limit what gets downloaded in a public folder?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <blockquote>but there is always a limit to every thing...So whats the max number of sheets addable in a workbook?</blockquote>
<p><br />
There is no single number that defines how many sheets thare can be in a workbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal computers are different with varying amounts of available memory and that memory is used to run the operating system and all the applications. You can continue to add worksheets to a workbook until all the available memory is used up and then you
 will get an error if you try and add more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's impossible for anyone here to tell you what that number of worksheets is because even if we knew how much memory you have we have no idea and cannot know how much is being used for the operating system and other applications.

<h2>            Windows Phone 8.1 - Backup and Restore</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently "upgraded" my phone from running on the Developers Preview to "the real" 8.1 on My Nokia Lumia 920. I did this, by recommendations, with the Nokia Software Recovery Tool. Before proceeding with the upgrade I verified that my phone had a recent
 backup and just to be sure I did a manual backup via Settings -&gt; Backup. I got a message that the backup was successful and I could verify that my phone was backed up just a minute ago. I proceeded with the upgrade in&nbsp;Nokia Software Recovery Tool and now I'm
 sitting in the "Restore phone" phase. Sadly I only have two restore points to choose, one from 2013 and another from April 2014. What happened to the backup I did today (26th of September)? I used the same Microsoft to sign in with during my restore as I used
 to make the backup.,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An interface to manage / view your backups on windowsphone.com would be a great feature Microsoft! Quite curious where my recent backup is now and who might have access to it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions how to proceed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Fredrik.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I just sorted it out. Thought I'll post the "solution" if anyone else have issues like mine. I waited about an hour and did a hard reset on my phone. Then went through the setup and restore process again. Now my latest backup was listed and I could proceed
 with the restoring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So don't be to fast when you backup -&gt; upgrade -&gt; restore your phone. You have to sit tight for a while before making the restore of a recent backup.</p>
<p>

            <p>There are different types of DropDowns. I am assuming by DropDown that you are referring to Data Validation Dropdown. Is this correct? If so, if you only have the 5 options of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 then you can just insert the numbers all separated by a comma in
 the Source field of the Data Validation Dialog instead of using a range on the worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also place the list of numbers on another worksheet and the Source field then has the worksheet name and range like example below. However, the easiest method of inserting a range in the Source field is to click the icon at the right end of the field
 and you will get a new popup field. Then change worksheets and select the list and the range will be inserted for you. After selecting the list, click the icon at the end of the displayed field to get back to the dialog box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=Sheet2!$A$1:$A$5</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worksheet with the DropDown list can then be hidden. Just right click the worksheet tab name and select Hide. (Unhide again by right clicking any worksheet tab and select Unhide and follow prompts to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not using a Data Validation Dropdown then please get back to me and explain how you created the DropDown.</p>
