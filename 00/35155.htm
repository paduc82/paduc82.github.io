<h2>            What is an XPS Document&#63; Can I safely delete it from my hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to free up memory on my PC.&nbsp; I would like to remove programs that I have never and will never use.&nbsp; But, I don't know if they are
</p>
<p>necessary for me to have or even what some of them are.&nbsp; What is an XPS document and do I need to keep it?&nbsp; What is PlayReady PC runtime amd64?&nbsp; Do I need it?&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Side Show Managed Runtime?&nbsp; Do I need it?&nbsp; What is and MSXML 4.0 sp2?&nbsp; I have Win 7.&nbsp;
 Do I need this program? I only use the Window Live Photo Gallery portion of the Window Live Essentials package.&nbsp; Can I safely remove&nbsp; Windows Live Mail, Win Live Movie Maker, Win live Writer, Family Safety, Bing Bar, and Microsoft Silver&nbsp;Light?&nbsp; I have had
 several versions of the Windows operating systems and I have never used any of those programs and have no desire to.&nbsp; I would also like to remove Lightscribe.&nbsp; It takes up a lot of memory and I don't want it and won't use it.&nbsp; I learned the hard way, a while
 back, that some programs are connected to others and if they are removed the program that I do want may not work anymore.&nbsp; Sorry that this is such a multi-part question.&nbsp; I know I'm asking a lot.&nbsp; If you have the time or inclination and know the answers, I
 would greatly appreciate the benefit of your knowledge.</p>

<h2>            how to add tags to files that are not JPEGs</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Can Only Tag Jpg Files</p>
<p>
</p><p>When researching new ways to organize files in Windows, I discovered that tagging was an option. However when I went to apply some tags to files, I found that the only type of file you can tag is JPEG. This seems like an incredibly foolish move on Microsoft's
 part and doesn't make any sense at all, since the vast majority of files in existence are not JPEGs. Hopefully I'm wrong about this and someone can tell me how to add tags to files that are not JPEGs.</p>

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the Metro IE version, the scroll bar will disappear when the mouse is not active, but as soon as the cursor is moved, in any direction the scroll bar should appear. There isn't any need for extra clicks.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and new Mobo &#34;PC doesn&#39;t have rights to my digital entitlement&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 10 and new Mobo</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I had windows 7 and I was able to upgrade to 10 for free and 10 ran great really enjoyed it, then my Motherboard started to go, so I replaced the motherboard today and now it's telling me this PC doesn't have rights to my digital entitlement, so after
 a few good searches I found some posts saying that if I contacted support they would help me resolve the issue with my entitlement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I contacted support via chat, and after waiting all they told me was to either "reinstall my previous windows 7 and then upgrade again or purchase a windows 10 product key(if you don't want to go through the long process of reinstalling)." I'd prefer
 not to have to reinstall and re-upgrade nor do I wish to blow money on something I had already gotten for free. Any kind of help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Is the Windows 7 a full retail license or did it come preinstalled with the previous motherboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try phone activation directly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> then click<strong>Run</strong>, then type:
<strong>slui.exe 4</strong></p>
<p>2. Next press the 'ENTER' key</p>
<p>3. Select your 'Country' from the list.</p>
<p>4. Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.</p>
<p>5. Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.</p>
<p>6. Explain your problem clearly to the support person. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

            <p>Hi sophiathoman,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For&nbsp;us to better assist you in the issue you are encountering, kindly answer these questions as concise as possible:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried using another song and still the same issue occurs?</li><li>Have you also tried importing the song onto another video but still the buzzing sound remains?</li></ul>
<p>One possible causes is that the codecs on your system is outdated or not installed.
<span>Media info will be able to identify the codecs required for your audio and video files. You may refer to the link below&nbsp; to start getting the required codecs to play your audio and video files.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, you may also try to check the audio mix setting on your Windows Movie Maker. To do so, please refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to Movie Maker.</li><li>Open your project file.</li><li>Click <strong>Project</strong>, then click <strong>Audio mix </strong>then toggle it to&nbsp;its far most left.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The reason why you need to check that setting is because&nbsp;your video file may have an audio of its own and have been mixing with the song that you have attached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Hi Jonathan, <br />
<br />
Does the Window installation CD you used to reinstall Windows contain SP2 or SP3?
<br />
<br />
If it only contains SP2, you need to install SP3 which you can get from here: <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2497281/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2497281/en-gb</a><br />
<br />
After you install that, you have to update the <b>Windows Update Agent </b>for which you'll find a link in the same article near the foot of the page.
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If you already have SP3 installed, proceed with the following troubleshooting steps:<br />
<br />
Start the Windows Search tool (hit Windows key + F is a quick way) and then copy/paste:
<b>chimes.wav</b><br />
<br />
Stop the search as soon as the file appears and then <b>right click</b> it and choose "<b>Open Containing Folder</b>".&nbsp; The folder will subsequently open with chimes.wav file highlighted.<br />
<br />
Double click that file which will launch it in Windows Media Player. Can you hear it playing?<br />
<br />
If you don't hear anything, click Start | Settings | Control Panel and then double click
<b>Sounds and Audio Devices</b>. In the Volume tab which is the first one which appears, make sure that the "<b>Mute</b>" box isn't checkmarked.<br />
<br />
If the "Mute" box is empty, click the "<b>Audio</b>" tab and make sure that the "<b>Default Device</b>" matches the sound card you have installed. There should be dropdown menus where you can change the device if it doesn't look right.<br />
<br />
If everything looks OK, but you still don't get any sound, check the cables to make sure your speakers are plugged in properly. If you have a subwoofer attached to the PC, make sure those cables are connected properly as well.<br />
<br />
If you still don't get any joy, do the following:<br />
<br />
Go to Start, then Run (hit Windows key + R if you can't see "Run" on the Start menu) and copy/paste the following and then click OK:
<b>dxdiag</b><br />
<br />
After the animation finishes loading, click the "<b>Sound</b>" tab and then click the "<b>Test Direct Sound</b>" button and respond to the prompts accordingly.<br />
<br />
If you still don't hear anything, click the "<b>Music</b>" tab and try testing each port. By "port" I mean the options available to you which you should be able to see in the list.<br />
<br />
If the above results remain negative, click the "<b>More Help</b>" tab and then click the "Sound" button. This will launch the Windows Sounds Troubleshooter where you'll get a number of options to choose from.<br />
<br />
Check also in Device Manager to ensure that all devices are installed properly. If they are, then they'll be prefixed with a plus sign (+).<br />
<br />
If a device hasn't been installed, it will be prefixed with a black exclamatiion mark inside a yellow circle. This indicates that Windows has detected the device, but cannot find a driver for it.
<br />
<br />
Devices may also be prefixed with a <b>red X</b> to indicate that thy've been disabled. If you find any or those, right click them and choose
<b>Enable </b>from the menu. Then click the <b>Action </b>menu and choose "<b>Scan for hardware changes</b>".
<br />
<br />
Let me know how you get on please. <br />
<br />

Hi jonathan, <br />
<br />
That sounds like your sound card isn't installed properly. <br />
<br />
So what you need to do here is to go into Device Manager - <i>instructions on how to do that in my previous post</i> - and check to see if you can see any black exclamation marks inside a yellow circle, or a red X anywhere.<br />

            You don't need to recreate the "Owner" user account. The "Owner" is just a generic user account made by the computer mftr. After all, they don't know who is going to buy the computer! Please see the end of my post for recommendations for setting up user
 accounts in Vista. As for the files where you are getting access denied, what and where are they? Give the full path; i.e., C:\Users\SomeUserName\Documents.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you are trying to access another user's files in their profile or perhaps you are trying to access files in what you perceive to be the "Documents and Settings" tree that includes "My Documents", etc. If the latter, then the reason you get the "access
 denied" error is that those are only virtual locations, called "junctions". They exist only to provide backwards compatibility for old software which expects those directories to exist. So give me the detail about the files you can't access.<br />
<br />
<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-weight: bold">General Recommendations For Setting Up Users In Vista:</span>
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, All Users, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it will require third-party tools and working outside the operating system.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your
 regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</span>

            I was referring to virtual locations or junctions that I was denied access to in documents and Settings Tree.&nbsp; That was fine.&nbsp; I am having one other area of access denial.&nbsp; I tried to update an HP monitor driver that was made available by the Windows Update
 site for the HP 1907 widescreen monitor.&nbsp; I was denied access by Vista and couldn't continue the update.&nbsp; I had presumed it was a continuing user account issue.&nbsp; I then tried to manually update the driver from within Device Manager by downloading &nbsp;the driver
 direct from the HP Support site and encountered the same access denial.

            Glad the information about junctions sorted it for you. How (and why) are you trying to update the HP monitor driver? Usually one updates video drivers, not monitor drivers unless your monitor has some special information contained in its configuration
 file. Include the link from where you downloaded the HP file so I can see what format it's in.

the HP software update was distributed&nbsp;through Microsoft Update, but is not displayed with any numeric identifier, such as a KB #.&nbsp; Simply, HP-Display-HP w1907 Wide LCD Monitor released August 2009.&nbsp; This date is significant because it is a later date than
 any driver available from the HP support site for the same device.&nbsp; The error code is "Unknown Error Code 80070005.&nbsp; Also after the installation and the system is rebooted Vista reports that there is a missing device driver for my monitor.&nbsp; When I try to download

            OK, now I understand your mistake. You should <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>never</em> </span>install drivers from Windows/Microsoft Update. And the First Law of Driver Updates is "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". Normally if everything is working you want to leave things as they are. The exception is that heavy-duty gamers will
 usually want to update their video and sound drivers to squeeze every last bit of performance out of the hardware to get the fastest frame rates. If you're not one of those people, you don't need to update your drivers if there are no problems you are trying
 to solve.<br />
<br />
If possible, uninstall the Microsoft Update pertaining to this device. If this isn't possible, do a System Restore to before you installed the driver from Microsoft Update. Set your MS Update to "download and inform me when updates are ready" instead of Automatic
 and look at the updates being offered. Don't select any drivers. You can right-click on the driver update(s) and choose to hide them.

            System Restore went through all of the steps and after the system reboot, was unable to restore the system to a date just prior to the driver update attempt.&nbsp; I was unable to un-install the driver.&nbsp; Also, the (what appears to be a) corrupted driver is
 also causing the display software "My HP Display" to abend before its initialization upon boot up.&nbsp; I was able to uninstall the software, as well.&nbsp; I am still getting the same "Access Denied"&nbsp;errors.&nbsp; I don't know where to go with these conditions from here.

            I would check with HP tech support then. Without being able to work hands-on with the machine, I can go no further. You might want to get a local tech to come on-site and straighten things out; it would probably be worth talking with HP tech support first.<br />

The problem is i am not able to use ever the support chat or the call back service. The reason why i am not able to use them is this: <br /></p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRES2FZ.img" /><br />Thn i sign in my name looks like this and i can't change it. Changing name inside of my MS account doesn't help ever.

<h2>            Hard Drive no longer recognized</h2>
                    <p>I have three internal drives on a windows 10 platform</p>
<p>C drive is a solid state drive strictly for the operating system needs.</p>
<p>A&amp;B Drives are your traditional internal hard drives that are 3 TBs 7200 RPM and connected as individual drives.</p>
<p>A drive is for all programs and app installs including all games etc.</p>
<p>B Drive is intended as a backup drive to allow a full system backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a couple of weeks ago my B drive did a Check disk on start up</p>
<p>I didn't have the time so I restarted my PC&nbsp; by pushing the reset button.</p>
<p>next time I went to start up I didn't have the time for another ck dsk so I stopped it again.</p>
<p>I was planning to allow it the time over the weekend but then the B drive was no longer visible as a drive.</p>
<p>It had been been designated as a library but when I try to access it it says it is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data is still on I'm sure so how do I get my computer to re-recognize it as a drive ?</p>

            <p>Enter BIOS setup via Dell F2 key to see if hard drive is detected anywhere.&nbsp; Normally it would be listed by its Serial which you can google to get the make/model.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it's not listed then the next step is indeed to reseat it to see if you can get it to
 register.</p>

            <p>This is a tricky one as I realise you don't want to chance doing anything with the drive that might destroy any recoverable data. The problem is I would think you need to have it "seen" in Disk Management/Explorer to be able to run any recovery software
 on it. Even using chkdsk commands need it to have a drive letter.</p>
<p>Is it recognised in the bios as hardware. ?</p>
<p>If it is you could try a Knoppix live CD and see if that shows anything. Or if you can take it out and connect it to another PC.</p>

<h2>            Unable to upgrade to Win 8.1 Pro Pack - Gives &#34;Something Went Wrong&#34; Error</h2>
                    We bought a new HP 23-g010 All-in-One desktop computer this week that came with Windows 8.1.&nbsp; We bought the Win 8.1 Pro Pack download from Amazon to upgrade the operating system.&nbsp; The product key checks out fine and the upgrade process starts but after
 running a while it comes back with a "Something went wrong" message and says to "Close this wizard and try again".&nbsp; This happened several times, I contacted the Microsoft support chat group and they tried multiple things after taking remote control of the
 computer with no success.&nbsp; I then did a full System Recovery of the computer and went through the basic setup and tried the Win 8.1 Pro upgrade before even loading any software or updates and it gives the "Something went wrong" message again.&nbsp; What can I do
 to get this working?

            I've got pretty much the same problem, only it bypasses the whole Product Key thing (Do I want to buy a product key/I already have a product key)! Numerous tries and even three hours with Microsoft Support on the phone did no darn good. At all! I'm about
 ready to give up and ask for a refund on the key and on the Windows 8.1 disk Support talked me into buying. GRRRRRR!!! &gt;:(&nbsp;

    <title>Burning movie to DVD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin house1611  say:</h3>
<h2>            Burning movie to DVD</h2>
                    I recently started recording myself doing presentations on Power Point and am wanting to burn them onto a DVD in a movie format so it can be viewed on a DVD player.&nbsp; I converted the Power Point into a mp4 movie and uploaded it to Movie Maker.&nbsp; However,
 I am not able to burn the DVD.&nbsp; The presentation is 105 minutes and my DVD's will hold up to 120 minutes, so I don't think that is the problem.&nbsp; I keep getting a dialog box that states the movie might not fit on the DVD because of length and it asks if I want
 to continue.&nbsp; I click yes, but it does nothing.&nbsp; What can I do in order to get this to work?

<p>Movie Maker creates movies in an HD format using an MPEG-4 (H.264) codec compatible with Blu-Ray players, SmartTVs, PCs and the like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the video DVD standard is an older MPEG-2 standard that only handles SD (standard-definition) video. If you just try burning the .mp4 file onto a DVD disk, you won't be creating something that is compatible with a standard DVD player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The value of 120 minutes printed on the DVD packaging assumes you are authoring in the legacy video DVD standard, so it makes sense that 105 minutes of HD video won't fit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you truly want to continue trying to author a video DVD, you need software that can reduce the resolution down to standard definition (480p maximum) and use the licensed MPEG-2 codec that is understood by standalone DVD players.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember the video DVD format was created in the late 90s before HDTVs were standard so can't handle higher resolutions. That's also why Microsoft and Apple dropped support for authoring video DVDs back in 2011 or so. You'll have to find your own software
 to do that.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Cpu frequency always max &#38; the OS is slow</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded my ASUS X55LB-XX198H(i7 5500U - @CPU 2.40GHz up to 3.0GHz 8GB RAM 2GB VRAM &amp; 1TB HDD) windows 8.1 home single language to windows 10 home single language just last night. Now here's the problem as I open my task manager I saw my CPU Frequency
 playing from 2.70GHz to 2.95GHz, is it bad? What is the cause of the problem? Is it harmful? . And here's another question how can my OS be a little faster when rebooting or just opening and shutting down because in Windows 8.1 when I am opening my laptop
 it only took 15-30seconds to open and when rebooting about 45secs i guess. Now in windows 10 when rebooting it took me 2mins 30secs &nbsp;and when opening it took me a minute and 15secs. what can i do to speed it up???</p>
<p>It already says that this laptop works well with windows 10 and it is compatible so why is it so slow? somebody please help me solve this problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You in Advance,&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;In addition, I suggest you to try enabling the fast startup option to help your computer start up faster. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R.</p>
<p>2. Type powercfg.cpl and press enter to open power options.</p>
<p>3. Click "choose what the power button does" on the left pane.</p>
<p>4. Click "change settings that are currently unavailable".</p>
<p>5. Under "shutdown settings", check "turn on fast startup" and save the changes.</p>
<p>

</p><p>A dark screen filled with dots ( not the blue death screen) sits on my desktop covering my theme whether I turn my laptop on or off its there. It may disappear once or twice but always returns. This happened after the latest windows update 10 a few weeks
 ago. I have reset the laptop and it is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have full function of the laptop, my icons still show, task bar, etc.. It is irritating to see this screen. Perhaps this could be a communication issue with the drives? I know nothing internally about computers. Please help.&nbsp;</p>

            Are you sure thats not the background? Because I'm not seeing the dots in top white region of the screen, taskbar or that floating widget. 
<br />
<br />Have you tried changing the wallpaper?
<br />
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, it could be a defect and you need to have the display replaced.

<p>This big dark square with what looks like a dot pattern (dots does not move) all over it is over my desktop picture which is a mountain of snow scene. You can barley see it across the whole top of the screen there ( which are clouds in the sky of the picture).&nbsp;
 I have tried to change the desktop background, it doesn't work. The square stays. Yesterday it disappeared on its own for a minute and popped back up while I was updating the Bluetooth on the laptop. The square appeared on the desktop this pass week after
 then 1709 update. I have updated everything in the device manager (I believe). Thanks again.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Mainman879 &amp; Welcome ^_^,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the Microsoft Support :-</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>The kernel power event ID 41 error occurs when the computer is shut down, or it restarts unexpectedly. When a computer that is running Windows
 starts, a check is performed to determine whether the computer was shut down cleanly. If the computer was not shut down cleanly, a Kernel Power Event 41 message is generated.&nbsp;</em></span><br />
<br />
 information to explicitly define what happened. To determine what may have happened and to identify a potential resolution, it is important to know what the computer was doing at the time just before the event occurred.</em></span><br />
<br />
 backup power supply. An underpowered or failing power supply may cause this behavior. For example, if you added RAM or additional devices or hard disks when this problem began, the power supply may cause the problem.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So, I would say that the events are occurring because the system is rebooting from a Bugcheck which according to you is the Kernel_Data_Inpage_Error.
 So, yes the two problems are related.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR bug check has a value of 0x0000007A. This bug check indicates that the requested page of kernel data from the paging file could not be read into memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It generally occurs due to problems in Storage, Filesystems, Bad Blocks in the HDD etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, in order to analyze and help you better, I would be requiring the <strong>
Dump</strong> files.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please goto this Path :- "<strong>C:\Windows\Minidumps</strong>" and then zip up the Dump files (.dmp) present in them. Once they are zipped, please
 upload them to a file hoster like OneDrive, Dropbox, Mediafire etc so that those could be analyzed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You
<strong>may be required to Copy Paste the Dump files to some other folder</strong> before you are able to zip them up.</span></p>
<p>Let me know how it goes ^_^</p>

<p>Hi ^_^,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well that is odd. If you are using any cleaning software like CCleaner, please stop using them as they remove the Dump files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, please follow this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/174459-dump-files-configure-windows-create-bsod.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">**GUIDE**</a></strong></span> to make sure that the generation of the dump
 files has been enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you have got a Complete Memory Dump file, I could take a look at it as well. The Complete Dump file is located at the path :- "C:\Windows\Memory.DMP" . It may be a large file, so please ZIP it up before uploading to any file hoster.</p>

<h2>            Invisible window on my desk top.__</h2>
                    
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have this strange invisible window on my&nbsp;desktop.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I only found it because it was covering&nbsp;some of my&nbsp;icons and I couldn't click them, after further investigation I could locate (but not see) the invisible window by the&nbsp;cursor changing to vertical and horizontal resize, I knew the window was ther but I
 couldn't see it,&nbsp;I could resize the window and even guess where the close X would be on the invisible window and close it, but it keeps coming back.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What is this window and do I see it and get rid of it? Any help would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                </div>

<p>I noticed exactly the same thing. I was hovering my mouse over icons near top left corner and noticed on certain area like 1x1 inch or so I couldn't click on icons under it.</p>
<p>It is so weird to have such invisible window covering part of desktop. I don't like it, it isn't normal behaviour.</p>
<p>I haven't figured out which program could be doing it yet. I have latest Nod32 scanned my system - no viruses.</p>
<p>Really weird.</p>
<p>I urge people to cover their desktop with icons and then start looking with mouse if there is any area thats preventing interaction with desktop icons. We have to find out what's causing it. Could be bug, could be some new spyware?</p>
<p>EDIT: POSSIBLE SOLUTION</p>
<p>Wow, just as I wrote this post I found possible solution to invisible window on desktop.</p>
<p>Desktop gadget called Drive Manager is on startup creating invisible window called Form1 on my Windows 7 64-bit. I don't know why it is doing it, I can kill it in task manager and gadget still works. Perhaps bad coding?</p>
<p>Anyway after closing gadget or killing application form1 I can click again on that area of desktop. I hope this helps to others - try closing your desktop gadgets.</p>

            <p>So reading this, am I correct that if I sign in on my friend's PC with my login info, then I can access my files and PC settings as if I were on my home PC? So What happens when I log out of the friend's PC and the friend chooses to login?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been my experience that when I logout of my PC, the next time I login it asks for the password for the last login used. To me, this sounds like If Ii use a friend's PC to login, access my files, then logout. When she wants to use her PC it will still
 require my login info even if she wants to change it to hers.</p>

<p><span>Hi Eric:<br />
<br />
BitLocker™ Driver Encryption &nbsp;is included in Windows® 7 Ultimate and Windows® 7 Enterprise.<br />
BitLocker™ Driver Encryption&nbsp;is a disk encryption/decryption feature, used to protect disk partitions<br />
that contain secret material and DATA. If you are a programmer, developer, <br />
business user or you have very secret data, then apply BitLocker™ else you don’t<br />
need it. <br />
<br />
<strong>For additional information refer to: <br />

<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> EFS can also be applied instead of BitLocker™ which is very effective.<br />

    <title>How do I change my associated MSA account on a work account logon&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b. koeller  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change my associated MSA account on a work account logon&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, back when there was a limit on the number of computers you could associate with a given MSA account, I had created a second, work-only MSA account to associate with my work computers and the work account logons. This was used to sync onedrive, bookmarks,
 and desktop background stuff. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to deprecate the work MSA in favor of my 'regular' MSA account (especially now that I've purchased many apps on my regular MSA account that I want to use at work). I can't figure out how to change the 'default' MSA account associated with my work
 account. I can /add/ the 'regular' MSA account, but apps, the store, sync, etc. aren't acknowledging that the 'regular' MSA account is what should be the main thing.</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brandon</p>

            Hi Billy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />1) For sound problems first try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<br />My Name is Edward M. 
<br />I hope to help. 
<br />
<br />Audio performance problems may occur if there is any type of damage to the cables or audio ports on the computer. 
<br />
<br />You may experience various symptoms; for example, audio playback stops working or intermittently, the audio is choppy or distorted, static noise is heard, etc.
<br />The audio ports are exposed to elements that can generate a buildup of dust or even physical damage. 
<br />
<br />If you notice that the port or connector has dust or other contaminants, use a compressed air sprayer to clean the ports. It is essential that you update the 
<br />following device drivers for optimal performance of audio and sound reproduction, in addition to solving common problems related to audio and sound reproduction:
<br /> 
<br />• BIOS 
<br />
<br />• Chipset 
<br />
<br />• Audio driver 
<br />
<br />The Windows problem solver in Microsoft Windows 10? 
<br />
<br />1. Click on Start and select Settings (gear icon)
<br />. 
<br />2. Click on Update and security and select Troubleshoot. 
<br />
<br />3. Click on Audio playback and click on Run the problem solver. 
<br />
<br />4. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the troubleshooting process.

            Hi,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Rogelio. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting our support.
<br />
<br />
<br />no sound at all coming from my laptop
<br />
<br />&gt; Re-start the computer and tap the F12 key as soon as it starts to boot up. If the computer boots to Windows re-start the computer and try again.
<br />
<br />&gt; Select 'Diagnostics' from the boot menu, then press the Enter key. Either the ePSA or the PSA tests will open -- it depends on the model of your laptop but should be the ePSA on newer models..
<br />
<br />&gt; Look for a "Perform Quick Audio Check" button on the bottom right side of the ePSA main menu screen (see screen shot below). Press the button and listen for the series of octave tones from the speakers.
<br />
<br />&gt; If you do not have the "Perform Quick Audio Check" button then do this. Start the PSA tests and when it performs the color test it will ask you if you see the color bars on the screen. Deliberately fail the test by answering no (press the "n" key) instead of yes. When you do that the PSA test will emit a series of beeps. Listen for the beeps.
<br />
<br />&gt; If you don't hear the beeps or tones that means that the speakers have become disconnected or have failed.
<br />
<br />&gt; If you do hear the tones that means that the speakers are working and are connected.

<h2>            after re installing flight sim 2004 in win 7 will not run properly now, it was ok until I probably selected to quarantine a file on Bullguard</h2>
                    this prog has been running ok, until bullguard prevented it with a file e5d 141.tmp came up and then I think I selected the wrong option.

            <p>Hi Keith Howells,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What exactly happens when you try uninstalling the game? Do you receive any error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer the following article and follow the steps to manually remove Flight simulator 2004 from the computer. Once you uninstall the game successfully installed it again
 and check for the issue.</p>

            <p>Hi KeithHowells,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What happen when you try to run the game? Does it give you an error code or message? If so, what is the exact error message or code?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known
 as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After troubleshooting, make sure to set the computer to start as usual as mentioned in
<b>Step 7</b> from the KB article mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, open event viewer and check if there are any significant error messages/codes related to the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open Event Viewer</b></p>

<p>I am unable to download the photos from my camera to my pc (Windows 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the Photos app and clicked on the import button (top right hand corner). It asked me to select the drive for my camera which I did. It then said, You have 6 photos, would you like to download them. I clicked Import and got a message "Something went
 wrong", it offered to try again but that failed too. It then took me back to the screen to select the drive again. No error messages or useful information of any kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this camera for several years and never had a problem before on Windows 8 / 8.1. I also tried downloading with another program (Firestone) which I often used but it failed too. I know it's not the connection 'cause it can find the photos and even
 show me a thumbnail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something new in settings that I need to alter?</p>

            <p>The new Win-10 PHOTO app is a complete joke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When getting photos from my iPhone to the computer I just use:<br />
<strong>File Explorer \ This PC \ Devices and drives \ <em>my.iPhone</em> \ Internal Storage \ DCIM \
</strong></p>
<p>pick a folder then drag-n-drop</p>
