    <title>Unreasonable Email Blacklist for company server IP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unreasonable Email Blacklist for company server IP</h2>
                    <p>Hi<br />
<br />
we do not pay Microsoft for the privilege of being able to send emails to our clients who use Microsoft email accounts.
<br />
<br />
However, our company has operated for over 15 years and has used Microsoft products from day 1; we currently have 28 Windows 8.1 licenses, 4 Surface Pro devices - everyone is running office - just as a start. Suffice to say I feel we have spent enough money
 with Microsoft over the years, to consider ourselves Microsoft customers and worthy of some support.<br />
<br />
We have operated a clean, opt-in-only email newsletter, for nearly 15 years. We have some 300,000 opt-in subscribers on our mailing list. Approximately 25% of our subscribers are on Microsoft email accounts (@live, @outlook, @hotmail etc).<br />
<br />
We operate a thorough list hygiene system, which will unsubscribe any address that bounces back to us a specified number of times.<br />
<br />
We ONLY send emails to subscribers who ACTIVELY CONFIRM their email address by clicking a link. It is impossible to receive a newsletter from us, without actively and consciously confirming that you WISH TO RECEIVE NEWSLETTERS FROM US.<br />
<br />
Every newsletter has a great big no-fuss UNSUBSCRIBE link at the bottom, that unsubscribes users the instant they click it.<br />
<br />
We send our newsletters out from our own dedicated servers, located with reputable hosts in Europe.
<br />
<br />
We send a value-added newsletter out to all OPT IN subscribers, once a month, sometimes less.<br />
<br />
We have been very careful to conduct our email strategy in the most compliant and legitimate manner, to avoid issues with possible blacklisting.<br />
<br />
Despite that, we have apparently been blacklisted as a result of user complaints. Complaints from users receiving emails from our system, after ACTIVELY SUBSCRIBING OR REGISTERING ON OUR SYSTEM. The latest 3 complaints detailed by Microsoft are:<br />
<br />
2 actively confirmed newsletter subscribers complaining (in September), both about receiving&nbsp; newsletters back in January?? (suspicious)<br />
1 actively registered and confirmed site member, complaining about receiving a login reminder email??<br />
<br />
We have no control over subscribers who will subscribe to our mailing list, then complain about receiving the newsletter they subscribed for. We have no control over network members who will register on our system, then request a login reminder email. No amount
 of tweaks to our newsletter or mailing strategy could EVER protect anyone against this. After nearly 15 years I do not believe that we do not have THOUSANDS of whitelisted email users.<br />
<br />
We rely on our newsletter for marketing purposes. It's worrying to see that basically any competitor or troublemaker can submit a complaint to Microsoft, whether it makes any sense or not - and Microsoft will happily destroy small businesses at the drop of
 a hat.<br />
<br />
Microsoft previously partially-mitigated our server IP address, and offered some guidelines of things to change. We spent some time implementing those changes - before we had the opportunity to roll them out, Microsoft decided to entirely blacklist ALL emails
 coming from our IP. Whether users had whitelisted us, or not.<br />
<br />
<strong>WHAT WE HAD NOT DONE</strong><br />
- We had our bounce system set to 5 bounces instead of the recommended 1.<br />
- We had not set up the mailto:spam thing in the email header<br />
<br />
Aside from this, every other recommendation was already in place. These were the only 2 issues visible with our system - everything else is (we believed) impeccable. 2 minor things and some 75,000 Microsoft users don't get their mails.<br />
<br />
I appreciate spam and unsolicited mail is a major problem, and I have put up with a ton of junk mail in my inbox, the same as everyone else has. However being a legitimate newsletter sender for well over a decade I don't really see how Microsoft can justify
 doing very real damage to our business with absolutely no warning whatsoever?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, if after complying carefully with anti-spam legislation for around 15 years - if WE do not have the very BEST reputation, I am struggling to see who does?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our only options at this stage seem to be A. cease catering to Microsoft users (losing some 25% of our business). Or B. start shifting our IP around - this where Microsoft essentially MAKE us into spammers, where currently we are legitimate marketers. Neither
 of these options is particularly attractive.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping for C. - wherein we receive some support, suitable guidance, and a solution to this problem that is not simply another bunch of canned responses.
<br />
<br />
Your assistance in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>as predicted yet more canned responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already filled that form in 3 times. And all that is happening is I am receiving the same unhelpful, evasive canned responses via email too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is for this reason that I wish to conduct this conversation publicly, where my solicitor and every other interested party might have a read, and assess Microsoft's conduct for themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reiterate - we have been operating a clean opt-in-only newsletter for over 10 years, and have some 75,000 subscribers using Microsoft email accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of nowhere Microsoft decides to change it's policy to include: </p>
<p>A. several complicated software changes required to all mailing systems, and </p>
<p>B. an entirely unrealistic complaints system whereby anybody can have anybody elses mailing system blacklisted, without any recourse to investigation or appeal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft did not warn us about these software changes, you simply blocked our mailing server IP from 75,000 of our subscribers / members.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we complained about this, Microsoft 'partially mitigated' our mailing system, without actually specifying what 'partially mitigated' meant. It said we were limited to a low level of emails per day until we had rebuilt our reputation. What is a low level
 - 2? 2000? We run a busy portal with many members doing lots of things and generating lots of mails. And we are supposed to guess what 'a low level' means? While our business and our team's jobs all hang in the balance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In light of that, we sent no newsletter (only system mails being sent - registration passwords, confirmations etc), and ran around busily updating our software in line with Microsoft's requests. I can assure you, we were being extremely careful to do the
 right thing and get our system back up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some 5 minutes later and again without warning, we find out that Microsoft has now completely blacklisted ALL mails coming from our system. All our customers using Microsoft email accounts, can no longer receive mails from us. No new registrations, no new
 customers, if they happen to be using Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand spam is a problem, and hard solutions are needed. Similarly I need Microsoft to understand, that with this current policy they are making big problems for legitimate businesses that have gone to a lot of trouble to keep things compliant. I would
 not be making such a big song and dance about all this, if we were not an entirely legitimate company aiming for full compliance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we require at this stage, is a fair investigation / assessment, taking numerous important factors into account. We are happy to make whatever changes required to make our mailing systems 101% compliant with Microsoft's wildest compliance dreams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further to that, we are happy to provide Microsoft with suitable evidence to indicate that every individual submitting complaints about our system, has actively subscribed to our mailers by virtue of the fact they are actually receiving them. We can provide
<p>
</p><p>EVERY mailing list out there, will receive X number of subscribers - from this, Y% will unsubscribe, and Z% will complain. Having worked in other companies with newsletters - I know this, and I imagine Microsoft knows this too. I expect any Microsoft mailers,
 also receive Z% complaints. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we (and many other businesses) only send mails to individuals who request them, it calls into question exactly who is complaining. We suggest, competitors, hackers, vandals, and really anyone in a bad mood that day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While Microsoft is ruining businesses at the behest of competitors, hackers et al - I can see a very real problem with this system. Without some recourse to appeal and investigation - you are essentially encouraging legitimate marketers to take underhanded
 steps through necessity. This system is basically creating spammers. I do not think that is your aim. All new policies run the risk of problems, as you can see there are some problems with this new policy. I hope you will look into this, on behalf of us and
 every other company out there who relies on email newsletters to survive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would very much like to resolve this amicably and in a way that is satisfactory to all parties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I request that we can appeal this decision to block our IP. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            New HTC Touch Pro 2 missing icons - help</h2>
                    Fisrt, I've never submitted questions to a forum before, so please understand and be kind if I'm asking in a wrong forum. I'm a longtime Blackberry user and just switched over to new windows phone last week &amp; it's&nbsp;much smarter than me. Think I messed up
 from the beginning thinking I could just jump right into it.&nbsp; But I find I'm missing&nbsp;icons for setting up my phone identification (name does not appear on Today screen) - which I know know that probably should have been priority&nbsp;#1 in setting up, but nothing
 guided me to that area until I tried to download some things from Handango and it requires me to enter that info precisely. Searched windows mobile website and went to security portion. Tells me exactly how to do it but the final icon I click on is missing
 from my phone. I've also tried to&nbsp;download programs from Omarket (which may not be a good site - don't know). Example: found Opera mini 10. I tapped download and it took appropriate amount of time (I th

<p>Are you running Windows Mobile 6.1 or 6.5 on your HTC Touch Pro 2?</p>
<p>Showing your name on your today screen is simple head to Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Today-&gt;Items tab and check the Owner's info tab.(this is setup under&nbsp;Owner Information in Settings.)</p>
<p>Most of your new programs should be listed under the start directory. If the shortcut and icon are missing you can manually add them either by using the File Explorer on the device or using a connection via WMDC/Activesync and use the file explorer to view
 and edit files on your device.</p>
<p>When you download a program most files go to the My Documents directory either on your device or on your storage card if you set it up that way. IF you can't find the file and know the file name you can use the search function - Start -&gt; Search(Phone) depending
 on the build/OEM/carrier of the phone,</p>
<p>Your icons and shortcuts&nbsp;are&nbsp; generally saved under My Device-&gt;Windows-&gt;Start Menu-&gt;Programs</p>
<p>To place new shortcuts into this directory or a (new)file folder all you have to do is find and select the program executable file from the installed directory, copy it and then in the Programs directory choose paste shortcut. You may have to edit the name
 via rename to remove the shortcut text.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. :)</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 for Mac won&#39;t open after latest update.</h2>
                    Did the latest update - MacBook Pro - Yosemite 10.10.5. Word won't open from the menu - but can open new document from a previously saved one.&nbsp; Powerpoint works fine.

            Try one by one...Leave whatever is not feasible.
<br />
<br />1. Check out below link for troubleshooting. 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2693802/word-for-mac-error-microsoft-word-has-encountered-a-problem-and-needs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/269380...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Go to Tools &gt; Disable all Add-ins and see whether the problem disappears. If yes, enable them one by one and see which one is culprit.
<br />
<br />3. Try updating your office again. This solves many problems.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Check-for-Office-for-Mac-updates-automatically-bfd1e497-c24d-4754-92ab-910a4074d7c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Check-...</a>
<br />
<br />4. Try updating your Mac OS
<br />
<br />5. Is uninstall and install again is an option for you? I mean to say that either you have a microsoft account or product key? If you have, uninstall the current installation completely. (If you don't have, please do not uninstall)

<h2>            Outlook on Android - GoDaddy based mail account</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one issue.</p>
<p>I'm trying to setup my mail in Outlook for Android.</p>
<p>Everything is just fine with anything else (Google, live, Hotmail etc.) except with account based on GoDaddy.</p>
<p>When I try, after entering the mail account, outlook crashes with "An error occur".</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some digging in the net, I found the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://uk.godaddy.com/help/outlook-app-on-android-set-up-email-8905</p>
<p>
</p><p>From that video, I found out, that the outlook crashed when had to display the GoDaddy sign in screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please give me some advice, how I can handle that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
                </div>

<br />Do you have two-factor authentication enabled on the GoDaddy account?  Or does it crash when it asks you for the password the first time?

<p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the replay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually it's not two factor authentication. It looks like a standard procedure for sign in there.</p>
<p>As you may see form the video, it redirects to GoDaddy sing in screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By me it crash when that redirecting has to happend.</p>

<h2>            Persistent internal slide links</h2>
                    <p>My sincere apologies if this topic is covered elsewhere or if the answer is painfully obvious but I have looked everywhere and find similar questions but nothing specific. I am&nbsp;far from&nbsp;powerpoint power user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am required to create&nbsp;a status report in powerpoint with input from a number of team members. The report has slides with volatile info, updated each week, and overview slides, which are generally static.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no document management system. Each team member takes the latest aggregated set, extracts the slides they must change, update and return this subset, which are then finally re-compiled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I face is that each slide contains links to the static overview and summary pages for reference and on extracting and saving the subset, the links to the static slides (now removed) are lost, requiring me weekly to go through and reset them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I was hoping is that there was a way to create a fixed eg&nbsp;"Link to Slide 10" or better still "Link to slide project1summary" that is maintained across the extraction/recompilation process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The former solution would be nice enough but the problem is sometimes complicated if a new project or slide is added because then what was slide 10 may become slide 11 next week. The option to distribute and work with complete files (hoping to maintain the
 links) was not considered desirable by management who wish to review each team members updates independently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice anyone may have that results in my not having to reset 200+ links each week would be VERY gratefully received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance </p>

<p>I can't think of any way of doing this with PowerPoint as it comes off the shelf, but I have a strong hunch that a solution could be automated with VBA.&nbsp; Do you have any VBA programming experience, or have access to someone on staff who does?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If each of the static slides were uniquely identified (say with what VBA calls "tags" ... invisible to the user), and then you ran a macro on the show that looked at each link and if it points to one of these static slides, tags the shape the link is applied
 to.&nbsp; That'd be the setup phase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then as the deck is updated, you'd run another macro that looks for each link and if the shape the link is applied to has a tag, it converts the tag to the corrected hyperlink (ie, points it back at the original static slide).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of us write this sort of thing for a living.&nbsp; If you'd like to leave your contact info or, probably better, request the email address of anyone who wants to pursue the project further, you may get some takers.&nbsp;

<p>Thank you Steve for your kind response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have programming experience in a long since forgotten life. Nothing useful any more&nbsp;I'm afraid. If there is no&nbsp;in-app solution, I guess at least I can stop looking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see your thinking though and agree. In fact the structure of the slide set would lend itself to an algorithmic solution, were I smart enough. Unfortunately there is nobody in the organisation that could help and nobody&nbsp;would be interested in funding&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess one&nbsp;could 'nested loop' through the&nbsp;objects on each&nbsp;slide and create an array to cross reference eg slide title with slide number and based on that, be able to establish the required link reference, as each status page has either a 'link to overview'
 or overview has a 'link back to status', ie only one link per page. I guess the question is if the boxes are definable from their position. If not I guess some level of string parsing on the text box contents could be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I would be more than happy to give more detail to anyone interested in it as a thought exercise but totally understand and respect that this is not necessarily what this forum is&nbsp;for.</p>

<p>With a bit of "pre-prep" you can set the presentation up so that the needed slides and linked shapes can be found easily.&nbsp; No need to guess at things based on position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you probably don't want to tackle this, but as another thought exercise, this will give you some notion of how you might approach it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, to prep the static slides:</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<p>Sub TagStaticSlide()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim sTemp As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sTemp = InputBox("Name the selected slide", "Slide name")<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' User's either entered a name or blank<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' If blank, do nothing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Len(sTemp) &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Tag the slide with the value user entered (Uppercased)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWindow.Selection.SlideRange(1).Tags.Add "STATIC", UCase(sTemp)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>You could then use something like this to locate the slide with a </p>
<p>given tag (in this case, I've called it Slide 4)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub TestFindSlide()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim oSl As Slide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oSl = FindSlideTaggedWith("Slide 4")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not oSl Is Nothing Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Slide index is: " &amp; CStr(oSl.SlideIndex) _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; vbCrLf &amp; "Slide ID is:" &amp; CStr(oSl.SlideID)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub<br />
Function FindSlideTaggedWith(sTemp As String) As Slide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim oSl As Slide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each oSl In ActivePresentation.Slides<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If oSl.Tags("STATIC") = UCase(sTemp) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' FOUND it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set FindSlideTaggedWith = oSl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Function<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
Now if another routine tagged each hyperlinked shape with the tag of the slide it's linked to, you'd have a way of relinking the correct slide later.</p>

<p>Again Steve, thanks for your kind response, especially for being so kind as to trouble yourself with the&nbsp;code segment.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually think my problem may be easier to solve, as the slides are well structured and the links are all navigational, so I could, for example, use the slide titles to 'pair up' the associated slides and then use the text in the text box as a search string
 which, being navigational, remains the same, eg (link to project description, link to project status,&nbsp;link to project summary, link to project plan etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately, it's a typical&nbsp;issue of&nbsp;using an application for something it was not designed to do, just because it's available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'm still a little way off tackling this personally, although I have decided I will give it a go out of stubborness. It just means starting at square one, which I have to make time for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also need to be pragmatic and take into account that two to three&nbsp;hours every week updating hyperlinks is still less time than the hours I would have&nbsp;to spend learning VBA to resolve the problem automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll&nbsp;revisit the issue if I get a contract renewal beyond July ROFL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again Steve :O)</p>

<p>Sensible approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it's quicker and simpler just to do the thing manually than to spend the hours of time it'd take to automate it.</p>
<p>

<p>I would have less of an issue spending the hours coding if I knew I would get the solution at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm less keen to invest unknown number of hours installing an IDE, realising I need a&nbsp;new pc that is powerful enough to run the IDE, learning the IDE, learning the&nbsp;language, realising I have to learn the API, discovering the examples on-line were for an
 earlier software version, struggling with the syntax, coming to terms again with the painful fact that I wasn't born to be a programmer, and throwing my new computer down the stairs in frustration. Nine months after I decided I could save myself an hour a
 week updating 200 hyperlinks.</p>

<p>Hi John</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've hit the nail on the head. To be fair to the 'answers forum',&nbsp;Steve (and your good self) have answered what was the&nbsp;original question, which was 'is there a way in powerpoint to keep hyperlinks persistent in a file, regardless of how that file might
 later be messed with'. The answer appears to be&nbsp;'no'. I only say this because&nbsp;I don't wish to trouble the kind contributors here unnecessarily to take time helping with programmatical&nbsp;solutions I'm not smart enough to implement, although I'm always happy to
 think through a problem to those who are happy to chat about it :O)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;slideset is an aggregation of updates from around ten different people.&nbsp;The following month this&nbsp;one file containing links throughought to various part of the slide set (eg summary pages) is broken up into little bits,&nbsp;played with by a variety of individuals
 in a variety of ways I have yet to decypher,&nbsp;returned in piecemeal fashion, at which point I have&nbsp;to put it back together and make all the links work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you suggest, the key problem around persistency is that each person would only ever return their subset of slides. In deleting all others and saving&nbsp;their personal update,&nbsp;powerpoint, recognising that a&nbsp;link point to a non-existent destination,&nbsp;removes
 the link. More problematically, every now and again, a slide would be moved into a different section, which would change some of the link dependencies, eg to which summary section the link should point etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since discovered that the&nbsp;slideset included&nbsp;the entire&nbsp;corporate master template.&nbsp;Simply by removing all unused slides from the master I have reduced&nbsp;the filesize from over 5mb to 400kb so sharing the whole file is less problematic. I now&nbsp;request
 everyone works from and returns the&nbsp;complete aggregation, summarising in their delivery simply which slide numbers they have edited. This should mean that hyperlinks won't be broken. The issue of slides moving still exists but the&nbsp;edit summary at least points
 me to where things mighty be broken. I'm also putting the onus of correctness of updating&nbsp;hyperlinks&nbsp;on each contributor. The issue remains that not all have the time, patience,&nbsp;interest, inclination or&nbsp;ability to follow that&nbsp;set of instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There will always be a chance that it&nbsp;gets messed up so the&nbsp;aggregation will always remain down to me working from a single master, but at least with these changes, the amount of weekly 'fixing' should hopefully be significantly reduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would very much like to have&nbsp;the&nbsp;knowledge/experience to craft a more elegant programmatical solution (I can see of a ton of wonderful ways I could play with the slides) but to be pragmatic, the solution of educating the contributors of cleaning up at
 source, together with keeping the file structure simple enough to update easily and keeping the file unbroken throughout the edit cycle, should have a major positive impact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If only someone came up with a way to make this sort of task simple and straightforward. They&nbsp;could called it something like a 'document management system' ;O)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks to you all for your support.</p>

<p>thank you for posting in the forum. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the .xap file has been installed, so once the app is installed on your phone, it will be on your phone, not stored on the Sd card anymore.
</p>
<p>If the app is not installed properly, may I ask if it works to install the apps directly through the Store on your phone?

<p>In Excel 2007 and 2010 (and Word, Access, PowerPoint...) there was a QAT button for Open Recent File.&nbsp; Where is that button or its equivalent in 2013?</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Jinjinshu,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>根据你的截图，我们发现好像你的</span></span><span><span>Office365</span></span><span><span>并不是从世纪互联购买的。你可以尝试从</span></span><span><span>portal.office.com</span></span><span><span>登录你的账号看看是否能正常登陆。</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>一般来说，</span></span><span><span>Office365</span></span><span><span>登陆和服务器没关系，如果你的公司没有设置什么策略的话，你可以在任何设备上登陆</span></span><span><span>Office365</span></span><span><span>。</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>另外，如果你担心密码的安全性，我建议你设置多重身份验证保护你的账户。当你登陆</span></span><span><span>Office365</span></span><span><span>时，你除了输入密码外，还需要进行手机认证才能成功登陆。</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>相关设置请参照</span></span><span><span><a href="https://support.office.com/zh-cn/article/%E4%B8%BA-Office-365-%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE%E5%A4%9A%E9%87%8D%E8%BA%AB%E4%BB%BD%E9%AA%8C%E8%AF%81-8f0454b2-f51a-4d9c-bcde-2c48e41621c6?omkt=zh-CN&amp;ui=zh-CN&amp;rs=zh-CN&amp;ad=CN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>为</span></span>

<h2>            Search query returns empty when a field is empty</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, I'm fiddling around with a small database. I have a table of contacts/addresses. I created a form that has a search box beside a subform, and that subform runs off of a query. In the criteria row, I wrote...&nbsp; Like "*" &amp; forms!frmSearch!txtSearch
 &amp; "*" to filter the contact name. Normally this works well, but when even one contact field is empty, the entire query returns empty. Any ideas how to work around that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi! Just add a Null parameter like the following query:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>SELECT ACCOUNTS.* FROM ACCOUNTS WHERE (((ACCOUNTS.[PROC DESC]) Like "Limit*")) OR (((ACCOUNTS.[PROC DESC]) Is Null));</p>

            If you want to search for a specific contact then an unbound combo box is a better method than a text box.&nbsp; The combo box would be set up like this:<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT ContactID, LastName &amp; ", " &amp; FirstName FROM Contacts ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit of the last one to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.<br />
<br />
The subform's query would be something like this:<br />
<br />
PARAMETERS Forms!frmSearch!cboSearch LONG;<br />
SELECT *<br />
FROM Contacts<br />
WHERE (ContactID = Forms!frmSearch!cboSearch<br />
OR Forms!frmSearch!cboSearch IS NULL)<br />
ORDER BY LastName, FirstName<br />
<br />
In the combo box's AfterUpdate event procedure requery the subform with:<br />
<br />
Me.[NameOfSubformControl].Requery<br />
<br />
Note that NameOfSubformControl is the name of the control in the parent form's Controls collection which houses the subform.&nbsp; This might or might not be the name of it's Source form object.<br />
<br />
You might like to take a look at FindRecord.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly.<br />
<br />
This little demo file includes examples of various ways of searching for records.<br />
<br />
Another file in the same OneDrive folder is NotInList.zip.&nbsp; While primarily intended to illustrate the use of the NotInList event procedure, the demo's opening form includes a combo box in which the contact's address data is shown in another column in the drop
 down list.&nbsp; This enables two or more contacts of the same name to be differentiated.&nbsp; The concatenation is done by a ConcatValues function in the basConcat module.&nbsp; This function is adapted from the CanShrinkLines function published by Microsoft.<br />

            <p>Hi RobOley,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand how difficult it is to catch up with the new email service Outlook.com. We are here to assist you to get familiarized with Outlook.com. Follow the steps below on how to add and delete contact addresses in a group:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To add a contact in a group:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>1. Go to
</font></span><a href="https://people.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0000ff">https://people.live.com</font></span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>2. Select the contacts you want to add to your group. You need to tick the check box icon beside your contact name.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>3. Click
<strong>Groups</strong>, then tick the check box beside your group name.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>4. Click
<strong>Apply</strong>.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To remove a contact in a group:</strong></p>

</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>2. Click the arrow down button "<strong><span>v</span></strong>" beside the word
 ALL and select the name of your group.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>3. Your contact list for the group will appear. Tick the check box button beside the name of your contact list that you want
 to remove from the group.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>4. Click

    <title>Windows Defender Refuses to Turn ON &#58;&#40; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yukie.milly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender Refuses to Turn ON &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    <p>I woke up this morning (September 30, 2016) when someone from "Windows Tech Support" called me saying that my PC was sending them some "mysterious errors"! (I know... They were those darn scammers....)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, to my surprise when I booted my PC to start my work, a message from Windows Defender appeared saying that I needed to "scan my PC", so I did, but Oh Surprise!!!</p>
<p>I tried to update the virus definition files and it failed, then the problem started!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As many have reported here, WD refuses to Turn ON!! :( WHY?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was working perfectly ever since I upgraded to Windows 10! I do have other antivirus installed, but they are not actively scanning my machine, only on demand because I thought that WD would do its job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot of my issue:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27988872-9a3b-4832-acb4-8f62d8c62ea7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27988872-9a3b-4832-acb4-8f62d8c62ea7" /></a></p>
<p>As mentioned before, it was working fine as I scanned my PC two days ago with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has happened? What changed? Is there a new update that breaks WD? What is error code 0x800705b4? Why WD cannot be enabled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see endless posts here and I'm not sure if they actually solve the problem. They just tell you go here, here, there, over there, read more stuff, etc and nothing seems to work.... :(</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the answer to my questions regarding this error. It seems that Windows was updating in the background and WD was part of the update.</p>
<p>After Windows finished updating, which took more than two hours, and the standard reboot was done, Windows Defender happily, merrily and automagically started to work again. This is great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER</p>
<p>
</p><p>This situation brings another question:</p>
<p>1. Why is a crucial Windows piece of software disabled during the update? During this blackout period, whatever it is, a PC is potentially exposed to virus infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy with Windows and Windows Defender again! :)</p>

            <p>Omar - this was the fix for me. I am on a domain joined machine where we have a GPO defining where to get updates from - an internal WSUS server. And even though I moved my computer in to a GPO that was excluded from policy - the setting remained tattooed
 in the registry until I changed it.</p>
