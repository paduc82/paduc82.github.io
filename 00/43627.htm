</p><p>Regarding your concern, you can definitely unblock a purchase for a kid. You can follow the steps provided on this link:

<h2>            How to safely reboot or shut down PC when screen freezes</h2>
                    How do you safely reboot or shut off the PC when the screen freezes? There have been a few times where a pop up box appears and says that Windows is not responding etc. When this occurs everything seems to freeze and not work. Which means that I cant access
 the "Start" menu to access the "Power" button to reboot or shut down the PC. What do you recommend I do when this problem occurs. Is it safe to just turn off the Power Surge outlet? If I did this I'm thinking it might harm the PC and OS. What other options
 do I have?

            <p>Hello Samson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that computer is unable to normally shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before proceeding as an initial recommendation, please check for the amount of hard disk space remaining, as the available free space is also responsible for Windows to run at optimal level of performance.</p>
<p>Also, e<span><span>nsure to install any pending updates and also update all device drivers from Device Manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Ref: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now please follow the below methods and check for the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party applications to be causing the slow down.</li></ul>
<span><span>1.&nbsp; </span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p><span>Follow: <span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp; </span>To disable any 3<sup><span>rd</span></sup> party unwanted startup programs in Windows 8 and above, follow:
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Try Autorun and disable any start-up programs you don't need.</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run the <strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter. and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type&nbsp;troubleshooting in the search bar.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select&nbsp;View all&nbsp;on the top left corner.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>System Maintenance</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>

            <p>My question was a basic simple question. I did check my hard drive space and there is still alot of space on it. I also have "all" the latest Windows 10 updates. I have all new latest drivers. I have done a "sfc/scannow' and the PC found nothing. This problem
 happend 2 times. It first time it happened immediately after installing the latest Window 10 update. This update was the one right after the major Nov, 2015 update. I did the update and restarted the PC and that's when it first started. After logging on etc
 the screen froze and I was not able to do anything, like clicking on the "Start" menu to access the "Power" option to restart or shut down my PC. That's when I turned of the power from the surge protector. The PC works fine now, but when I asked this question
 to you I was hoping for an answer "IF" this situation came up again what should I do in a safe manner.

            Can any one just give me a simple answer without all the technical stuff? How do you reboot or shut down a PC when the screen freezes and you can't access the "Start" button to access the "Power" button option. Is&nbsp;shutting down the PC by turning off the
 power from the surge protector a good Idea if you have no other option?

            <p>There's no one right answer for your question, but there are opinions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'right' answer would depend on knowing why the computer froze, which could happen for any number of reasons. Hence all the opinions. This is my opinion:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing to do is to wait until Windows figures out what to do. Sometimes this can take a&nbsp;<em>long</em> time. Like drink-a-cup-of-coffee long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're able to open Task Manager, 'end' the application that has frozen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're not able to open Task Manager, give the three-finger salute [CTRL+ALT+DEL] and you may be presented with several options from which you can choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the three finger salute doesn't do a damn thing, shut down your computer from the Power button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should ignore the so-called Microsoft Support Engineers. They mean well, and they're certainly polite, but they don't have the knowledge to help you. Most are third-party contractors reading from scripts.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Feldberg,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You need to contact the manufacturer of the printer for the latest drivers. You may refer the below link:
</span><a href="http://www.support.xerox.com/go/prodselect.asp?Xlang=en_US&amp;Xcntry=USA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.support.xerox.com/go/prodselect.asp?Xlang=en_US&amp;Xcntry=USA</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As per the website from the manufacturer there are no drivers for Windows vista and windows 7 rolled out. Link you may refer
 to:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.support.xerox.com/go/results.asp?Xlang=en_US&amp;XCntry=USA&amp;prodID=3150&amp;ripId=&amp;Xtype=download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.support.xerox.com/go/results.asp?Xlang=en_US&amp;XCntry=USA&amp;prodID=3150&amp;ripId=&amp;Xtype=download</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As a workaround you may try installing the drivers of Windows XP in compatibility mode and check if it helps. Steps to follow
 to install in compatibility mode:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on Compatibility tab
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select Run this program in compatibility mode and select windows vista</span></span></p>

<h2>            windows 10 Program uninstal problem</h2>
                    I have recently moved from Windows 8.1 to 10. I now want to remove the program 'Spy Hunter 4' by Enigma Software Group LLC. Whenever I try to remove the program and press the Uninstall button the User Account Control box comes&nbsp; up to verify use of 'Spy
 master 4' Enigma Software Group LLC software. On accepting this an Enigma box comes up to verify the language, on pressing o'k a box stating SET UP FAILED&nbsp;'Installer failed with error code: 1' is displayed together with an Exit box. On trying to repeat the
 process you are into a loop.

            <p>Hi Chiara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file that tells Windows how to start is missing. To fix it, you need your Windows Installation media. Do you still have the DVD or USB you used to install Windows 8.1? If so, reply back with yes. If not, you can use another Windows 8.1 Computer if you
 have one to make media to recover your PC. To do so (and this only works if you have another Windows 8 PC) follow the instructions in<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Create Recovery media in Windows 8.1">

                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 in July 2015 I had limited WiFi access (no internet connection) and had to restart Windows 10</p>
<p>every time to get full access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On some forum in August I found a solution in disabling some not used services and everything was fine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest windows 10 update of 13/12/2015 reset- ed everything and the problem is back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly I didn't note the changes I made and I cannot find them anymore; is there someone who can help me,</p>
<p>It is very annoying to power-up the computer 2-times to get it working.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you posting on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's try the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong><span><span>Disable third party anti-virus software</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have any third party software installed on the computer, then I would suggest you to disable the anti-virus software and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Important Note: </span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Put the computer into
</span><strong><span>clean boot </span></strong><span>state</span><strong><span>.</span></strong>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> </span></span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run
 a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3: </span></span></strong><span><span>Run inbuilt <strong>
Internet connection&nbsp;troubleshooter</strong> and <strong>Network Adapter&nbsp;troubleshooter</strong><br />
</span></span></p>

            <p>Bonsoir Sachin Venkatesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for looking into my problem,</p>
<p>I tried your 3 methods but they didn't solve the problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think we should concentrate on the fact that the issue is their on starting before logging in, known by the Astrix on</p>
<p>the WIFI sign.</p>
<p>Restarting always cures the issue!</p>
<p>When I google this problem it seems a lot of people suffer of this and I feel sorry I didn't note the solution</p>
<p>I found in this forum somewhere in July or August. In fact I didn't expect Windows was going to reset</p>
<p>my settings with an update.</p>
<p>Thanks again, Jan.</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>Sounds like a problem with the adapter.&nbsp; Have you checked on its Status then?&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. disabled as a "power-saving measure" perhaps?&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Suresh,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might have caused due to the corrupted user account or changed account settings on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Is the Hotmail account used as Microsoft account to login into the user profile?</span></li><li><span>Did you make any recent changes to the system account settings?</span></li><li><span>Did you check if you are able to login into the user account on booting the PC in
<strong>Safe mode</strong>?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: If haven’t tried, use
<strong>On-screen keyboard</strong> at login screen and check if you are able to login into the user account.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>On-screen keyboard</strong> is located in the
<strong>Ease of access</strong> center located at the bottom left corner of the lock screen.&nbsp;It acts as a temporary keyboard in-case your keyboard does not work.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Follow the steps below to use on-screen keyboard at the login screen:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on the <strong>
Ease of access</strong> icon located on the bottom right corner of the screen.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
on-screen keyboard</strong> option and type the password.</span></li><li><span>After typing, click on the icon located next to the password entry box and check if you have typed the correct password.</span></li><li><span>Press <strong>
Enter </strong>and check if you are able to login into the user profile.</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> After logging in,
<strong>update</strong> the <strong>keyboard drivers</strong> manually from <strong>
Device manager</strong> and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows logo + X </strong>keys on the keyboard and select <strong>Device Manager</strong> from the context menu.</span></li><li><span>Expand <strong>
Keyboards</strong>, right click on the keyboard driver and select <strong>Update this software</strong> from the context menu.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the update to complete.</span></li><li><span>After the update is complete, close the window and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: Boot the PC in

<h2>            On refunds</h2>
                    So..I've submitted a refund request because&nbsp;I accidentally purchased the Xbox version of Minecraft instead of Windows 10. It has almost been 48 out of 72 hours and I have not gotten a single response. I know there is time away until the 72-hour mark, but
 I'm just wondering...could there be a reason for them not contacting me?<br />
<br />
Also, I'm sorry if this is posted in the wrong place, I don't know where I would ask these types of questions.

<h2>            How to stop Hotmail from automatically opening the next email when I delete an open email.</h2>
                    gmail and Yahoo mail both send you back to the inbox after you delete the message you are reading. How can I get Hotmail to do the same. I have lost all the information on one of my computers caused by Hotmail automatically opening an email I would have
 never opened.

<h2>            Windows key &#43; H Does Not Trigger Windows Dictation &#40;Issue&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello folks,<br />
<br />
I recently upgraded to version 1803. Everything seems to be working fine except the<strong> dictation feature</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speech recognition is perfectly fine but when I press <strong>Windows key + H</strong>, (as per the instruction to use dictation mode) -
<strong>nothing happens</strong>!<br />
<br />
Can you tell me what am I doing wrong here?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</p>

Then it is useless to include such products into bundles with Xbox, otherwise there should be a warning, that the bundle can be used for only 1 person, which would hugely reduce the buyer audience.

    <title>How to I activate my LEGAL Windows XP without a product key - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to I activate my LEGAL Windows XP without a product key</h2>
                    <p>My computer is telling me that I have to activate Windows XP but I am unable to find my product key which was apparently lost during a move. My computer was top of the line approx. 10 years ago and my Windows XP was purchased at that time. Once in the past
 I was able to get a product key from Microsoft. However, since they no longer support Windows XP they tell me they can no longer help me. I am unable to upgrade to a newer version of Windows because my system will not support a newer version. I a retiree and
 am on fixed income and cannot afford to replace a computer that is a perfectly fine computer except the fact that I no longer have the product key for Windows XP. This is ridiculous that I should be forced to buy a computer and through out a perfectly good
 computer solely because Microsoft decided to no longer support Windows XP.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me. I cannot believe that there is not some kind of fix that would allow me to activate my Windows XP. Please, please help me and keep me from being computerless at a time when I cannot afford to replace a computer that works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would greatly appreciate any help you can give me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>operating systems after xp.A intel 478 socket processor (10 yrs old),barely works</p>
<p>with Vista,&amp; 7 8 or 10,forget it...So,if you lost the product key,dont spend the time</p>
<p>trying to activate,a new product key could only come from microsoft,&amp; even if</p>
<p>it did,youre pc wouldnt be compatable with newer operating systems..</p>

            <p>Are you still able to load XP or does it fail to boot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you purchased a "Retail" version of XP and you can still run XP you can use one of the keyfinder utilities to retrieve your key.</p>

<p>I was trying to avoid reformat and reinstall with my original disk and key as I thought it might cause difficulty reinstalling only program I keep XP for, Nikon's Capture NX 2. However decided to use sledgehammer and reinstall. XP Now working fine but only
 partial success with CNX2 as it's unsupported by Nikon .</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>I tried turning on my computer today and it began to boot up but then suddenly a blue screen flickered and the computer rebooted. &nbsp;This happened several times and I was never able to boot, whether in safe mode or last known good configuration, etc.
 &nbsp;The blue screen flickers quickly but I was able to grab what it says by taking a video with my digital camera. &nbsp;It says:</p>
<p>"A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.</p>
<p>If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Disable or uninstall any anti-virus, disk defragmentation, or back up utilities. Check your hard drive configuration and check for any updated drivers."</p>
<p>That's all it says. &nbsp;It's not followed by any kind of codes. &nbsp;Any idea? &nbsp;Thank you in advance!</p>

Do you use Apple iTune, or other softwares which take hardware control? Have you visited Facebook/MySpace kind website?</p>
<p>The two issues can be identified as:(i) video card or monitor connection to the computer&nbsp;is lose in case of desktop computer, (ii) malware injecting into boot device sequence. Some disk defragmenter which do MFT defragmentation can cause BSOD. Also, recent
 Windows Update coul dhave caused crash.</p>
<p>To solve this, check all computer connections. In case of desktop, reseat video card. That would leave you with one choice: remove malware. You can use Ubuntu 10.04, Live CD&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiren Boot CD 11 or UBCD to access hard drive to recover data. Then re-install
 OS to save complexity and time.</p>

<p>Well, that's no fun.</p>
<p>What is your system make and model?</p>

<p>Have you installed or updated any new software lately?</p>
<p>Have you applied any new automatic software updates that may have come into your system?</p>
<p>Fill in the blank:</p>
<p>My system was working fine until ______________________________.</p>

<div>The next time you press F8 to get to the boot options&nbsp;choose the option:</div>
<p><strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong></p>
<p>Then you can see the BSOD.</p>
<p>If you do not see that option, you need to get a little busier with your F8 pressing (try again sooner and faster) until you do see it.</p>
<p>Here are some BSOD blue screen of death examples showing information you need to provide:</p>

<p>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</p>
<div>Skip the boring text unless it looks&nbsp;important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know the other information that is specific to&nbsp;your BSOD.</div>

<div>You can also choose the option:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div><strong>Last Known Good Configuration&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>Last Known Good Configuration is the configuration XP saved the last time Windows booted successfully and choosing that option&nbsp;may allow you to boot long enough to undo (roll back) whatever got your system afflicted in the first place.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the system boots with Last Known Good Configuration, uninstall (roll back) the afflicted software or driver update using&nbsp;Add/Remove Programs or Device Manager and get the correct software/drivers for your system.</div>

<p>My system is a Dell Inspiron 2200.</p>
<p>I do not know the XP version or service pack. &nbsp;I would know how to find out that information if I could get past the boot stage, but I have not been able to.</p>
<p>I have a genuine XP disc.</p>
<p>My system has a built in optical drive.</p>
<p>I have not made any hardware changes.</p>
<p>I have not installed or updated any new software lately.</p>
<p>I don't recall applying automatic updates, but if they were happening automatically then I assume they happened. &nbsp;They did not happen immediately before this issue began.</p>
<p>"Fill in the blank:</p>
<p>My system was working fine until ______________________________."</p>
<p>My system was working fine until my AC adapter went on the fritz. &nbsp;In trying to figure out what was wrong, whether it was the AC adapter or something in the computer, there were a handful of times that my computer was turned on but would suddenly
 have the power cut to it when the AC adapter stopped providing power (the battery was fully discharged by this point). &nbsp;Eventually I determined the adapter was the problem and got a universal adapter from the store. &nbsp;This solved the power problem, but when
 I tried to turn on the system I got the BSOD reboot problem.</p>
<p>The system does not boot to last known good configuration or any other boot option.</p>

<p>What happen when you choose this F8 boot option?</p>
<p><strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong></p>
<p>Do you just not see that option when you press F8 to get to the boot menu?<strong>&nbsp;</strong> If you do not see it, you need to start pressing F8 sooner/more quickly/more often until you do.&nbsp; It may take a few attempts.</p>
<p>Since you have had some power problems, the first thing I would do would be to verify the integrity or your file system that may have been corrupted.&nbsp; You can do this by booting into the XP Recovery Console and running chkdsk /r.</p>
<p>The usual symptom of file system corruption after a power interruption is a message like this:</p>
<p>Windows XP could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:</p>
<p>\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM</p>
<p>Your exact error message would be helpful, but you there is nothing wrong with running chkdsk anyway - even if it finds nothing to do.</p>
<p>You need to boot the XP Recovery Console from your genuine XP installation CD.&nbsp; If you need to create a bootable Recovery Console CD, I have instructions for that too.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp; These adjustments are<br />
made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:<br />
<br />
Press any key to boot from CD...<br />
<br />
The Windows Setup... will proceed.<br />
<br />
Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.<br />
<br />
Select the installation you want to access (usually&nbsp; 1: C:\WINDOWS)<br />
<br />
You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).<br />
<br />
You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder.&nbsp; This is the same as the C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.<br />
<br />
RC allows basic file commands - copy, rename, replace, delete, cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.<br />
<br />
From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any problems on the afflicted drive.<br />
<br />
Running chkdsk is fine to run even if it doesn't find any problems.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:<br />
<br />
chkdsk C: /r<br />
<br />
Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; It may take a long time to complete or appear to be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; If the HDD light is<br />
still flashing, it is doing something.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount to be sure it is still making progress.&nbsp; It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.<br />
<br />
You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.<br />
<br />
Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.<br />
<br />
You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

            <p>I have this same issue.</p>
<p>A software problem has been ruled out as I replace the HDD with one I knew had a working copy of XP on it and still BSOD'd.</p>
<p>Hoping to get more info about the fault I booted into Linux hoping to receive a kernel panic, but rather then getting a kernel panic it just froze on the desktop with no error codes.</p>
<p>I used 2 separate diagnostics cards (one PCI-e and the other USB) and both are suggesting a problem with the BIOS.</p>

            <p>it is unlikely that you can take a HDD that has XP on it and stick it in some other computer and expect it to work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When XP is installed the installer looks at the hardware configuration - especially the motherboard, video, sound and network components and installs specific files for the hardware that the installer sees.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you have a HDD that works in one computer and stick that HDD in another computer it is unlikely to work unless the motherboard, video, sound and network components (among other things) are all exactly the same as the hardware from which you took the
 HDD in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, it is extremely unlike that I could take my HDD with XP and simply plug it into your hardware and expect it to work.&nbsp; I would expect it not to work.&nbsp; What will happen if you try?&nbsp; You are very likely to get a BSOD.&nbsp; If it did work, I would consider
 that a miracle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting a BSOD, there must be something on the screen or you would not know you are getting a BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the diagnostics are suggesting a problem with the BIOS and if you have no fear of updating the BIOS and if the motherboard manufacturers WWW site has a BIOS update that when you read the details of it suggest that the update might be worth installing,
 then why don't you update the BIOS and see what happens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even many BSODs suggest a problem with the BIOS as the cause, but those messages are all generic for many BSOD such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.&nbsp; If you need to use safemode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced
 start-up options, and then select Safe Mode.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>That is just a generic boilerplate message, usually the same for every BSOD and never really helpful.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>People tend to get hung up on it trying to figure out what it means and how to do it, but I just ignore it.&nbsp; What
<em>is</em> helpful is the information under that text (Technical Information) and the crash dump files:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/51c28ec1-7d5e-42e7-ae36-238c5642374c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS is probably the absolute last place to look for the cause of a BSOD unless the motherboard manufacturer WWW site suggests a BIOS update might solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course updating the BIOS can be a risky endeavor for if something goes wrong, your system may get "bricked" which means that it will never work again which pushes it further down the chain of</p>
<p>troubleshooting procedures.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
And, as usual with the MS Answer forums implementation does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers owners, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br /></p>

            <p>Did you even read what I said?</p>
<p>Do you even know how windows handles new hardware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1)I have used HDDs with existing windows installations several times in the past&nbsp;without issue</p>
<p>all that happens is the standard "new found hardware" dialogue box appears and then all I have to do is reactivate windows, no BSODs,errors or crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) also how would you explain a Linux LIVE CD (which auto-detects hardware during start-up) crashing shortly after loading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) the computer reboots BEFORE it can even show the error code (only showing half the BSOD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(4) I do know how to analyse crash dumps (that's one of the first thing I looked for when the HDD was in an external case but the computer rebooted before it could make one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(5) how would you explain the windows installation working after putting it in a different computer?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(6) how can I update the BIOS if there is no way to boot into any operating system, this isn't one of the motherboards that support updating the BIOS via USB.</p>

<p>Salut,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kinect se connecte sur un port usb de la console, Microsoft préconise d'utiliser le port à l'arrière de la console (modèle Elite, Premium) mais il tout à fait possible de connecter le capteur sur un port à l'avant de la console (sans utiliser le second simultanément),
 de plus il faudra brancher Kinect sur une prise électrique.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Un adaptateur est fourni avec le capteur pour&nbsp;la connectique sur les modèles de console nommés ci-dessus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pour une&nbsp;Xbox S, le port dédié Kinect est à l'arrière de la console et de couleur orange, ce port alimente également le capteur en courant électrique.</p>

<h2>            Can someone help me with a file called &#34;Program&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    For the last month I've had this file called program on my C: drive which has no extension. It was present the day I installed windows 7 ultimate edition, and every time I start my computer it asks me if I want to rename it. I was wondering if anyone knows
 what this is, and can help advise me on what I should do with it.

    <title>Pre-Paid Card not working. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maverick zer0h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pre-Paid Card not working.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased a pre-paid 3 month xbox live card. When i entered the code in on xbox.com it returned me an error message saying 'transaction error, try again later'. Thinking this was just an error with the website i entered the code in on my xbox
 360 console, this returned me a message saying 'cannot retreieve information from xbox live' along with an error code: 801613C9. This happened numerous times as i tried to enter it.</p>
<p>Searching online for the problem only gave me mixed results and made me unsure of what to do, according to my billing history the 3 month card is enabled as well as my account showing as 'Gold Member'. Although i cannot join parties or games telling me i
 have to have Xbox live gold.</p>

<p>I would suggest calling the billing department of Xbox Customer Support. If it is showing up as "Gold Member" but you can't access any of the gold member features, then there may be an issue with the account.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>When you call, You can give them the code off of the pre-paid card, and they can verify if it was put on your account correctly or not.</p>

THIS</a>&nbsp;thread. If you still have problems you could try deleting and downloading your profile to the console again, select delete profile only when doing&nbsp;this. Sometimes simply doing a network test on the console can fix this issue so I would try that first.</p>

<p>Local Currency or Microsoft Points cards are not currently available as of the moment for use as purchasing methods for Xbox Live subscriptions. Only valid payment methods such as credit cards or debit cards or Paypal accounts can buy subscrptions. If you
 do not have one, you may want to choose the Prepaid Code Gold type of subscription. Prepaid code Gold subscriptions do not auto renew, do not auto charge and do not require payments instruments to work.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Taskbar toolbars keep disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> threecleartones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Taskbar toolbars keep disappearing</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've been using the Windows taskbar "toolbars" feature since, well, since it first appeared in Windows (back to at least Win98) and it's always worked great... until Windows 8.1. Now, my toolbars randomly disappear from time to time and I have to recreate
 them, which works fine until they disappear again. INCREDIBLY ANNOYING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those who aren't familiar with this feature, you can right-click the Taskbar, go to Toolbars, and add one of the items in the list as a toolbar (for example "Desktop", which gets you quick and easy access to desktop items without having to minimize anything).
 For years I've created my own custom folders (which I keep in my Documents folder) and just point to them using the "New toolbar" entry, which allows me to have quick access to some shortcuts in there as well as the ability to quickly drag anything in/out
 of those folders without actually navigating to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since Windows 8.1, the toolbars will behave normally for weeks at a time, and then suddenly with no warning, I'll start up my computer and log in, and they'll&nbsp;just be gone, and I have to go back into the menu and add them again (and customize them -
 small icons, no titles, etc) which takes a while and is annoying to have to do over and over, especially for a feature which&nbsp;I've come to depend on&nbsp;and has always just worked before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if anyone has any ideas on how to fix this issue I'd be eternally grateful. I suspect that the Windows 8.1 team introduced something into the update which they didn't test adequately with this feature and there's probably nothing to be done, which
 adds to my headaches with 8.1. I've performed many searches for answers (including this forum) but haven't found a solution.</p>

<h2>            SkypeforLinux on elementary OS  on a mac machine - microphone not working</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed Skype on elementary OS on a mac machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for some reason, the microphone doesn't work inside Skype, even though it works perfectly fine under the system settings.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me how I can fix it? I find no other window than the Audio and video settings inside the newer version and hence many of the online support (https://askubuntu.com/questions/163729/microphone-is-not-working-in-skype/251006#251006) doesn't
 work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Skype is only available on the following versions of Linux:
<br />
<br />    64-bit Ubuntu 14.04+
<br />    64-bit Debian 8.0+
<br />    64-bit OpenSUSE 13.3+
<br />    64-bit Fedora Linux 24+
<br />
<br />Could you confirm the version of Skype installed on your Linux system? 
<br />
<br />Have you tried signing out then signing in?
<br />
<br />Also, try restarting your machine a few times then check if its working.
<br />
<br />Here are some other things you can try:

<p>Hey Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you response.</p>
<p>I am using&nbsp;elementary OS 0.3.2 Freya (64-bit) which is built on Ubuntu 14.04.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My skype&nbsp;version is 8.20.0.9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have tried this several times, both signing in / signing out, as well as restarting my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried setting with my microphone in system settings, but i guess the problem is with microphone inside skype, otherwise it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rgds,</p>

<p>Hey Blaulito,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>Pardon me for not understanding your system's language ;-).</p>
<p>I have already tried setting with my microphone in system settings but without any success. Or are you pointing me to install some additional microphone api&nbsp;?&nbsp;Btw i have an older version of elementary Os built on ubuntu 14.04.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again anyways.</p>
