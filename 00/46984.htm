    <title>External USB drive on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            External USB drive on Windows 10</h2>
                    I am using an external USB Superdrive with Windows 10 on a virtual machine (Fusion) installed on an iMac computer.&nbsp; Windows recognizes the external drive as F:, device manager shows the drive as working properly, however it will not accept a disk. If I
 insert a disk part way, it won't go in, but if I click on "eject", the disk is ejected. Strangely, when I installed Windows 10, it was from a disk and the external drive accepted that disk for the installation. The external drive does work when connected to
 the Mac.

    <title>Why does Microsoft make payment method impossible to remove&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thickernico  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Microsoft make payment method impossible to remove&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>After paying a Xbox Live annual subscription, I wanted to remove my credit card from my payment options, since my son bought another game without my authorisation. I removed the auto-renewal option, but even if I tried to remove my credit card from the list,
 the Xbox website answered with an error (and no further explanation: Microsoft should fix their web application!).</p>
<p>So I called Microsoft customer support and I was told that it is explained in Terms &amp; Conditions that it is impossible to remove payment options because I have a Xbox Live subscription active, even if I do not intend to renew it or buy other games. My credit
 card seems now to be in hostage by Microsoft! The only way to free it, they says, is to cancel my subscription (as a fee to redempt my credit card!).</p>
<p>I wonder why this bad and very irritating policy. I think that it does not help to increase customers' loyalty, but it looks like a way to get other money exploiting the distraction of customers or their sons.</p>

<p>Can someone answer me and explain if there is any other reason?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well two things first yes it is in the terms of use for good reason</p>
<p>When you buy a subscription you are subscribing for an continuous subscription so it renewal for the said period</p>
<p>That's the definition of a subscription</p>
<p>How ever this brings ms to point 2</p>
<p>You do realize your son does not need to be on your profile right?</p>
<p>Xbox one has home gold which means anyone in the said console will share the membership</p>
<p>You can pass code protect your account and create his own account and he can't touch your billing option</p>
<p>Unless you are home sharing with a friend which you shouldn't be doing anyways</p>
<p>That being said there is a bright side</p>
<p>As long as you didn't buy a promotional membership (very important where you re waiting for. A promotional item like currency or bonus games is given to you at a later date you can remove the payment option)</p>
<p>If you remove the payment option before the promotional items is given you lose those items</p>
<p>Firstly turn off autorenewal</p>
<p>Then contacted support and ask them to remove your creditcard </p>
<p>What will happen is they will turn off your account for 2-3 days and then. Send your a code for the remaining period and remove the creditcard.it's probably easier to make your son his own account</p>

<p>No one but you should be on your account</p>
<p>And if minors are using the console you are responsible for their actions </p>
<p>Also as mentioned no one should be in your profile since they can have their own account and haven't the sake benefits minus the creditcard</p>
<p>You can actually read why the creditcard info is needed in the terms of use. And it's pretty much straightforward</p>
<p>If you want pay as you go you will have to buy prepaid codes </p>

<p>Thank you both for your answers. Here below just some other details following your comments.</p>
<p>My son used is own account. Not being sure the subscriptikns made on my account can be used by my son too, I added the credit card to my son's account only (and this waS accepeted by Microsoft). So, he is not using my account, but my credit card is linked
 to his account. So, I am responsible for actions of my son, but Microsoft makes me &nbsp;impossible to change the situation.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is not yet clear why the credit card is needed any more. I already bought the annual subscription (and I have the right to use what I payd for), I already turned off autorenewal, so for what else is my credit card needed by Microsoft if I do
 not intend to renew?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no other answers. So, it really looks like credit cards are impossible to remove without any suitable reason. Very disappointing... not a good behaviour towards customers. It is not a right way to intend customer loyalty!</p>

<p>You were answered already</p>
<p>You must keep your billing info upto date for reoccurring subscription </p>
<p>A subscription requires you to keep a payment option on file as per the definition and the terms of use</p>
<p>If you read the last of my msg you would find your solution </p>

<p>Dear ngocphi, I know Microsoft obliges to keep a billing info, i.e. credit card, uldated for recurring subscription. The fact is that I already paid in advance the annual subscription to xbox live and removed the autorenewal option. So, for what is the credit
 card needed by Microsoft anymore? Your answer seems to confirm that the only way to avoid this is to buy prepaid cards. If you insert a credit card for the first time, instead, you have no more freedom to remove it: iit is captured by Microsoft till the end
 of the subscription with no evident reasons.</p>
<p>Dear CuCaMuNgAcRaKeR, I already visited billing.microsoft.com and tried to remove the payment method, but an error is displayed without any further explanation but saying it cannot be removed. And if you call customer support, they will tell you you cannot
 remove it because they stated it in the terms of use or you have to loose the (already paid) subscriptiion. Incredible to believe, do you agree?</p>

</p><p>Microsoft Support, you did NOT answer this question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We already know how to choose the Navigation pane. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to see ALL individual files listed under each folder in ONE pane only -- at a glance like a classic file tree.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your answer still forces us to move our eyes back and forth between the left navigation pane and the right pane. It's a split view. We are asking for ONE PANE to view each file directly under each folder in one place.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be a way to do this .... ?</p>

                    I have noticed some web links posted in skype are failing to send.&nbsp; Is skype starting to filter some websites from being able to be used in sms links to known contacts?&nbsp; To be clear the links are adult content, and I am an adult sending and receiving with

    <title>Replace Drive in a Windows 7 RAID 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d_i  say:</h3>
<h2>            Replace Drive in a Windows 7 RAID 1</h2>
                    
<p>I have two Samsung drives in a RAID 1, configured in Windows 7 (NOT hardware/BIOS). This Dynamic volume is not the boot drive, but it does hold a page file. Windows informed me of late that one of the drives is critical. Speedfan shows that the SMART read-out
 indicates the drive is about to die.</p>
<p>I have a large amount of data on this volume. Obviously the idea of RAID 1 is that this isn't lost. I know which drive it is, I have the serial. But what now? The disk manager indicates that the drives are synchronising, though this takes some time.</p>
<p>Can I just unplug the dying drive or should I wait for the sync to finish?</p>
<p>And then I just unplug?</p>
<p>And plug in the new (identical) drive?</p>
<p>Can I use the machine in the mean time? (at increased risk, I realise)</p>
<p>Will Windows walk me through the steps to add the new drive? What will I have to do then?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm surprised that despite quite some searching I've found nothing. Can anyone assist please?</p>

<p>You say that you have "...a large amount of data on this volume and that idea of RAID 1 is that this isn't lost".&nbsp; Please note that RAID-1 is a disk redundancy solution meant for mission critical servers and workstations and that it is a poor backup solution.</p>
<p>To remove the failing disk use the Disk Management tool to break the mirror:</p>
<p>1- Select (right-click) the failing disk and remove it from the mirror.</p>
<p>2- Physically replace the failing disk.</p>
<p>3- Use the Disk Management tool to Initialize the new disk and convert it to a Dynamic Disk.</p>
<p>4- Add the new disk to the mirror.</p>

<p><span><span><span>You may check again if you have set up the RAID configuration in accordance to the instructions located here: &nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/323432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/323432</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>I would suggest you to wait for the synchronization to complete. Thereafter, turn off the computer and unplug the drive.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may also go into the disk management and recreate the RAID configuration and check if the issue persists.</span></span></span></p>

            Typically with hardware RAID you would see the details when the computer boots, just after the POST screen.&nbsp; If it's a software RAID you will be able to get the RAID information with the built-in Disk Management tool, typically the disks will be dynamic
 and they will have the same drive letter and the Windows RAID tools will be available, if these are not there you definitely do not have software RAID.<br />

RAID 1 was never a backup solution, why do we need speak about it as "not good" if the goal is just to have data lossless box?&nbsp;

            Hello jimmyruptash,
<br />
<br />Those are not dead pixels, but they are still an issue. That should not be happening to your device. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend contacting support directly to get the issue repaired. It seems like this could be a start and the display will most likely only get worse.

<h2>            Skype videocall on Huawei smartphones bad...</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On two brand new Huawei smartphones (honor 9 lite and P20 lite) skype call is okay but as soon I turn on video (camera) sound is less good and person on the other end see video in sqares, as I have bad internet connection. On other smartphone brands like
 LG, Samsung, HTC (that I tested) video call is great on same internet connection (home wifi). Little bit bether video is on 4G mobile internet, but still not good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speedtest on P20 lite is 42Mb/s DL and 36Mb/s UP, and pinging shows normal results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for test, the Viber video call is normal and clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do? Help.</p>

            Which version of Android is installed?
<br />
<br />Go to your Phone settings and look for Applications or Application Manager.
<br />
<br />Look for Skype and then select Force Stop &gt; Clear cache &gt; Clear Data &gt; Uninstall.
<br />
<br />After uninstalling, kindly do a reboot on your device.
<br />
<br />Once it pop-up, please install Skype using Google Play Store.
<br />
<br />After installing Skype, please do another restart before signing back in.

<p>It was installed on both of brand new devices. If would be only on one huawei, I would do factory reset, but same thing on two different models? Somehow, Skype and Huawei does not like each other, or maybee Android 8 and skype, I do not know, but every single
 other applications that I use, they work normally.</p>

<p>Do you know, how much stuff I have on smartphone? And all setting up again, and installing and else, just to find out, that skype does same thing? Skype for Web does not work on those smartphones. I am using other VoIP services, but some people&nbsp; are only
 on skype, they can not change that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution is, that Microsoft find out the problem and solve it SOON! I am still on Skype only because I have to be.</p>

            Try sending in feedback:
<br />
<br />
<br />    From your profile tap Help &amp; Feedback, then tap Send Feedback.
<br />    Let us know what you'd like to tell us and tap Send.
<br />
<br />
<br />In Skype on iOS and Android (6.0+) you can also enable Shake to send feedback in Settings &gt; Help and Feedback. This will allow you to shake your device at any time in the Skype app to generate a report, including a log file and screenshot of what you are seeing. This is helpful if you see a specific issue and want to share it with us.

<h2>            Purchased App on App store does not work. Company asking to buy again from their website</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I purchased an App on the MS App store. It was just crashing instead of doing any useful stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I contacted the support on the supplier's website, they are asking me to purchase a costlier software instead of offering any support for the software I already purchased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it totally unprofessional and an un-ethical. What about the money I paid?</p>
<p>Why are such people allowed to operate on MS App store?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Hello, I see that you are having some issues with using the apps that you have paid for. This may just be an account synchronization issue. You may want to try to log out of your Microsoft account from your Windows 10, then try to log back in. Do you also have a proof of purchase, or a receipt for the app that you have purchased?
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further questions! :-)

            Hi Babu
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the name and version of the software?
<br />
<br />Microsoft does not have much control over the vendor policies. The Store is really a distribution channel. 
<br />
<br />You should be able to reinstall the software using the following steps:
<br />
<br />Click the ellipsis in the top right corner of the screen (...)
<br />	Click My Library
<br />	Scroll through the list then click the app if its listed there, then click the download button.
<br />
<br />	If doesn't help, let us know and we can explore more options. 
<br />
<br />You can also report the app to the Microsoft Store:

<p>Hello Ryo,</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>I tried the account synchronisation as you suggested ("Sign in with a local account instead", from&nbsp; "Your info" page and then "sign in with microsoft account"). That did not change the behaviour of the app. It tried to open the file and just crashed - thank
 you for suggestion, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the proof of purchase (invoice) in from Microsoft store.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The name of the App is "Afanche 3D STEP Viewer Pro". Version is 3.4.0.2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did re-install the software too, based on your suggestion. Still the behaviour is same. When I try to open a STEP file in the app, it just crashes. I verified the integrity of the STEP file on a 3rd party website with an online viewer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I contacted the support link on the app and I was asked to try a different version of the software directly from the supplier's (Afanche) web-site. Interestingly, that worked.</p>
<p>When I gave that feedback to the supplier, they asked me to buy that version of the software from their website - that was disturbing, least to say.<br />
</p>
<p>I will be reporting this App.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards</p>
<p>Babu</p>

            Hello, my name is Bradford, and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community. 
<br />Please use the link below for the steps and links to report the App's developer for their behavior in the Windows 10 store.

<br />I apologize that you've had this negative experience, but I'm happy to say most of the time the Windows app store is a great place to shop.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you Bradford.</p>
<p>I have already reported the issue in the Windows 10 store, after Andre's reply above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have previously purchased another app on MS store and the experience was smooth. There was an option for a trial for a week. It worked well during trial and I purchased it at the end of trial - and it still works well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A related question is, how does an issue like this get resolved?</p>
<p>Does the Microsoft store team work with the developer to fix the issue or get me a refund?<br />
I am OK either way. Is reporting the issue in the Windows 10 store sufficient to resolve this?<br />
</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Babu<br />

            As far as I understand reporting to the Windows 10 raises a flag that an incident has to be resolved with the developer. However, contacting Microsoft through the Windows 10 feedback page you can request for a refund I believe in the message submitted itself.

<p>I have. I've looked on other forums and gearbox have acknowledged the glitch and are in the process of repairing it but it'll be weeks before its released. It's the first mission of dr. Zeds
</p>
<p>What I did was talked to tannis before the cut scene which has messed up the quest completion.
</p>
<p>I'm just wondering how many others have had this?</p>

<p>You could try finding someone who's doing that mission and jump into their game to do it... it may clear it for you that way...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: or start a new game on a new profile on your xbox, play up to that bit, then have your main profile join in split-screen for that mission... dunno if that would work.</p>

<p>Well I'm hoping gearbox send out the repair that has been mentioned but it didn't say when. Only thing is I'm now stuck just shooting things to level up as I can't use those missions to level up.
</p>
<p>I have asked around a few people some are not there yet, others are past it and the last lot said no due to either playing it co op with someone offline or because it could glitch their game having my glitches character in their game which it bull cause
 to glitch it you need to talk to tannis before her cutscene</p>

<p>Hey Sparkles</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you saying you still haven't given the Erridium to Tannis?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spoke to her and she told me to get away from her.... then while I was wandering Roland's Hideout (which is, I belive, where you find her) the cut scene introducing her just tripped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I spoke to her again and everything just carried on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried going back to her?</p>

    <title>Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 8000 not detected at all - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris cioffi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 8000 not detected at all</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought a Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 8000 and my computer will not detect it at all.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 64 bit on a Lenovo T510 with integrated bluetooth.&nbsp; The mouse I bought came in OEM packaging and did not come with a bluetooth dongle,
 which is fine because I want to use the integrated bluetooth.&nbsp; I installed the Intellipoint software for this mouse from microsoft.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to add it as a bluetooth device it is not detected at all (never has been).&nbsp; I have rebooted my computer, turned the bluetooth off and back on again, and pressed the button on the bottom of the mouse numerous times, but no luck.&nbsp; I also have an
 Asus bluetooth mouse which connects with no problem. I have uninstalled that mouse and turned it off, and there are no other bluetooth devices around so interference is not a problem.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you would suggest.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<h2>            The conference ID is not recognized</h2>
                    <p>Some users not all. When they call in to Skype for business meeting the system does recognize the conference ID.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to join Skype for Business meetings with their AT&amp;T phone. Some others use T-Mobile connect with no issues. This has been an issue for only a couple weeks. It worked before. I confirmed the users are in fact typing the correct conference ID.&nbsp;
 This happens&nbsp; to the all AT&amp;T customers calling into our conference.&nbsp; We are using Lync Server 2013</p>

            Hi 
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />Questions regarding Skype for Business are more likely to be answered faster in the  Skype for Business specific forum.  
<br />
<br />I would recommend post this question in that forum as well as they have experts who are specialized in that version of Skype :). This way you can get help from experts from both forums :).

<h2>            Blue Screen Of Death caused by csrss.exe</h2>
                    I am having multiple computers with the BSOD. After running the dump file in WINDBG I am noticing the same error.

CSRSS.exe is being terminated by outlook. Has anyone seen this before? I have included the whole string that I receive.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can download the drivers for your scanner from the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/DriverDownload.jsp?prodNameId=73502&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;taskId=135&amp;prodTypeId=15179&amp;prodSeriesId=73500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/DriverDownload.jsp?prodNameId=73502&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;taskId=135&amp;prodTypeId=15179&amp;prodSeriesId=73500</a></p>
<p>Since there is no available drivers for you scanner for Windows 7, which are provided by HP, I would suggest you to install the drivers in compatible mode.</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Download the drivers for your scanner for Windows Vista.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Right click on the setup.exe file and select properties.</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> Select the compatibility tab.</p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b> Check the box “Run this program in compatibility mode for” and from the drop down list select Windows Vista.</p>
<p><b>Step 5:</b> Click on Apply and Ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Remote Desktop Connection jump list entries do nothing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection jump list entries do nothing</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;am unable to use jump list entries for Remote Desktop Connection.&nbsp; This includes both recent and pinned items.&nbsp; When I click on a jump list entry, I get the spinning blue circle for a fraction of a second and then nothing.&nbsp; If I open Remote Desktop Connection,
 I can use the MRU entries from within the application.&nbsp; Here's a list of what I have tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Clearing the entries by turning off "Show recently opened items in Jump Lists on Start or the taskbar"</li><li>Deleting all recent entries from registry (suspecting one or more corrupt entries)</li><li>Deleting all entries from C:\Users\Default\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Jump lists for all other applications that I have tried still work as designed.&nbsp; This issue started around the time that I installed the Anniversary Update, but I cannot tell for sure if that was the cause.&nbsp; Has anyone else run into this issue?&nbsp; Ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide!</p>

            <p>As is usually the case, I had more ideas immediately after posting my question! :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to simply open Default.rdp from the Documents folder.&nbsp; It yielded the same result (i.e., spinning circle for a few seconds and then nothing).&nbsp; I verified in Default Programs that .rdp was correctly associated with Remote Desktop Connection, and
 I even re-associated it just to be sure.&nbsp; Even if I right-click an RDP file, choose Open With..., and click on Remote Desktop Connection, the application still will not open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any ideas.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p class="contentStandard"><strong>Still no internet in Build 14279</strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><br />
I installed Build 14279 on the computer (my current working build is 14267 on 64-bits system). I can successfully login to my ISP, but I can't ping any host - there is no data transmission, no sites available.<br />
I have the Ethernet adapter Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller (Driver version: 9.1.404.2015) connected to the ADSL modem (the modem is in bridge mode).<br />
I can open the web interface of the ADSL modem by using http://192.168.1.1<br />
<br />
I disabled the Widows firewall, updated Ethernet adapter drivers, but it all gives no result. IP4 and IP6 protocols are installed.<br />
<br />
This is my Windows IP Configuration (ipconfig /all) for old working Build 14267:</p>

As it can be seen, there is no "Tunnel adapter 6TO4 Adapter" and "Tunnel adapter Teredo Tunneling Pseudo-Interface" in the last 14279 build.<br />
<br />
How can it be fixed?<br />
<br />
I can't use my computer without Internet, so I rolled back to Build 14267.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We&nbsp; regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The known network issue with Windows 10 Build 14279 is mentioned below.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Connectivity to older Wi-Fi networks using the WEP encryption security method may be broken.&nbsp; WEP is an insecure method for protecting your Wi-Fi connection but a small percentage of Windows users still use it.&nbsp; A workaround would be to configure your wireless
 routers to use WPA or WPA2 or wait for the next Insider flight when this is fixed.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>But you're using Wired Ethernet connection. Right? I guess the problem might be with the incompatible network drivers. As the network connection is working fine with the Build 14267, suggest you to make note of the drivers installed. Press
<strong>Windows logo key+ X,</strong> select <strong>Device Manager </strong>from the list.
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Double-click on the network driver and go to Driver tab. There look and make note of driver version details.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Post which, try to imitate the upgrade to
</span>Windows 10 Build 14279 and see if everything works fine. If not, try to replace the existing network driver with the one which you seen on the previous build to see if it fix the issue. Do refer the article

            <p>We found the problem - it's incorrect configuration of the routing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix it, I did this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Disable the checkbox for "Use Default Gateway on remote network" option in "Advanced" tab of "Internet Protocol version 4" properties of the MTS adapter (it's the name of the connection).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Add IP address 192.168.1.1 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0 to the "Internet Protocol version 4" properties of the Ethernet adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Connect to the ISP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Use the command 'route print -4' to see network routing tables. Remove a suspicion route, in my case it was</p>
<p>'route deleted 83.0.0.0'</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.Use the command </p>
<p>route add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX</p>
<p>where XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX is my IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have to do it every time I go online, that's the problem.</p>

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">I have played the game over 70hrs so far with no issues. i run an R9 amd video card, and
 dual monitors, but i only play the game on one monitor. Since the update of the game through steam every time i start the game when it tries to load the title screen my system shuts down and goes into this unwakeable sleep where my HDD light is still powered
 but the PC is basically powered down. i have to turn the power off completely to the PC in order to start it back up again. I know its something to do with just this game. i can play other games such as Black ops 3 with no issues at all that i have on steam.
 as well as several other games that are not on steam. I have never had this issue before until the 1.11 update to rocket league.I have even uninstalled and reinstalled the game. I remind you that this is the only game out of the 40 some games i have installed
 on my pc that is doing this.</span><br />

<h2>            How can I disable &#34;Startup&#34; for Sticky Notes, on Windows 10 1607</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wonder how can I disable "Startup" for Sticky Notes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I need to say:</p>
<p>My organization has disabled any of Windows 10 metro app (?) such as cacluator, edge browser, and all the others.</p>
<p>Thus I can't start "Sticky Notes."</p>
<p>But once I tried to run Sticky notes, every time when I reboot PC it tries to run as "Start up".</p>
<p>Even I removed Sticky Notes folder at appdata.</p>
<p>C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Sticknote (Something like this directory)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Taskmanager -&gt; Startup does not have Sticky Notes.</p>
<p>%user%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup -&gt; Does not have&nbsp;Sticky Notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I control startup for Sticky Note???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Professional, 1607 (14393.693)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the steps provided did not help, we'll try a different approach. We suggest resetting Sticky Notes first then proceed on doing the same steps on how to disable it on startup. Follow the steps provided below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Apps</strong>.</li><li>Find <strong>Sticky </strong><strong>Notes </strong>under <strong>Apps </strong>
<strong>&amp; </strong><strong>features</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Advanced </strong><strong>options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>Repeat the steps provided by <em>Confused Caribou. </em></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Ultimate demands a driver then finds no new hardware and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate demands a driver then finds no new hardware and will not install</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a completely new build--Gigabyte GA-X58A-UD9 motherboard, Intel Core i7 980x CPU, 24 GB of Kingston RAM; I created a RAID 1 array of the 0 and 1 disks on the SATA drives (WD 2 TB); when I try to continue to installation, booting from the installation
 disk, I reach the "Install Windows" box.&nbsp; When I select "Install now," it shows "installing" then opens a box labeled "Install Windows" with an instruction to select the driver to be installed; a separate box overlaying that one is labeled "Load Driver" and
 states, "A required CD/DVD drive device driver is missing.&nbsp; If you have a driver floppy disk, CD, DVD, or USB flash drive, please insert it now."&nbsp; When I select "OK" I am dumped back into the "Select the driver to be installed" dialogue; if I click "Browse,"
 I see only the C: and X: drives (C: is the USB drive where I have Gigabyte RAID drivers and X: is the Windows installation disk).&nbsp; When I select the driver folder on the USB drive, I do not see any drives until I de-select the "Hide drivers that are not compatible
 with hardware on this computer."&nbsp; Then, after selecting the only driver in the folder (which is repeated 8 times in the list), and clicking "Next," the "Load Driver" box appears, with the message that "No new devices could be found.&nbsp; Make sure the driver files
 are correct and located on the driver installation media."</p>
<p>When I close this box, I get a box warning "To install or upgrade Windows, you must run Windows installation.&nbsp; Are you sure you want to cancel Windows installation?"&nbsp; Selecting "Yes" returns me to the "Install now" screen.&nbsp; Closing that by using the "X"
 button at the upper right corner of the box opens a warning that "To install Windows, you must run Windows installation.&nbsp; If you cancel the installation, your computer might restart.&nbsp; Are you sure you want to cancel Windows installation?"&nbsp; Selecting yes leads
 to a restart, back into this same loop.</p>
<p>Previously, the installation dialogue boxes showed a&nbsp; C: that was a reserved system disk, a D: that was a third SATA drive not part of the RAID 1 array, the USB drive (E:), and X:, the boot/installation drive.&nbsp; Whatever I did resulted in the same process,
 except that one of the restarts showed the RAID drive as bad; when I deleted that array and recreated the RAID 1 array in the RAID BIOS (and it now shows a healthy array), I ended up in the loop described above.</p>
<p>This has been a long process:&nbsp; I had tried to use different memory before that was not compatible (only eight of 24 GB were enabled), I had two of the hard drives fail before use (and one is still not replaced--I hope to have two RAID arrays, one for the
 operating system and programs and one for data), and I had tried to use a computer services company to install Windows in the RAID array; as long as I was willing to install into a regular drive (non-RAID), Windows installed without a problem (and everything
 worked, even while the incompatible memory was installed).</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated; please be very specific--while I understand a lot, my understanding is probably pretty shallow.</p>

<p>Some device drivers are downloaded as a .exe and must be expanded before they can be installed. Create a folder on the USB drive, move the RAID driver .exe file to the new folder and double click to expand it.</p>

            I did that when Gigabyte support suggested that I try additional drivers from its site--I expanded the .exe files before trying them.&nbsp; See the first paragraph in the question (only driver only shows after de-selecting "Hide drivers that are not compatible

<p>I read the articles--it seems I chose badly for a RAID setup--but the problem was going to occur with any large hard drive.&nbsp; That still does not explain (at least to me) why Windows won't install.&nbsp; Gigabyte says the information I provided indicated that
 the issue was not with the hardware, since I could see the RAID volume; it has not responded to my updated information about the RAID volume's disappearance from the available places to browse.</p>
<p>If I give up on the hardware RAID, is there any reason not to try to set up a RAID under Windows 7 (I understand it has a software RAID capability)?</p>

<p>I have a current Gigabyte mobo which I made the mistake of configuring raid 0 (gigabyte controller) on win7 64 bit sys, all was well for some 6 months untill I began experiencing program hangs. The controller utility showed no raid sync probs. Drivers were
 gigabyte, no winupdate drivers. Attempts to run a repair win7, resulted in driver err msgs for the controler. In the end I broke the raid, the sys then ran perfectly.</p>
<p>I should have learnt from previous raid problems I had with an Asus motherboard, the raid/disks went out of sync allthough raid controller showed no problems. Asus admitted there had been problems they thought had been cured by a bios update.</p>
<p>I then went to a dedicated raid card, a decent one will cost more than your motherboard. Unfortunately the card was not compatible with win7</p>
<p>So short answer, avoid onboard raid at all costs - I wouldnt even consider win, software raid</p>

<p>Thank you all very much for the insight.&nbsp; I really liked the idea of a good RAID system to mirror my OS and apps, and a separate one for my data--this board and the large hard drives looked perfect.&nbsp; I guess I assumed too much.&nbsp; I suppose I will just have
 to be very conscientious about backing up internally and externally myself.</p>
<p>I think I will give up on RAID for this system.&nbsp; I will post again soon to update about installation from this point forward.</p>

<p>Apparently, my entire problem is somewhere else.&nbsp; I deleted the RAID volumes and tried to install with BIOS settings not using any advanced features for the hard drives.&nbsp; Same results as noted above ("Load driver" dialogue boxes).&nbsp; I disconnected the hard
 drives except where I wanted to install; same result.&nbsp; I swapped hard drives--still the same result.&nbsp; I never see the screen/box to select the type of installation (upgrade or custom) or to select the location for the installation.</p>
<p>I am completely without ideas, but I have a whole lot of valuable hardware and software that is useless right now.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
