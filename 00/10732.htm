<p>Hello Nikki_82,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. I know how frustrating this is, rest assured, I am committed to advise you on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I check, how many e-mails are you trying to send? You can only send up to 300 e-mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presumed you have already done the above steps to raise your account's limit? Such as
<a href="https://account.live.com/reputationcheck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
verifying your account with mobile number</a>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            Hello Nikki_82, 
<br />
<br />I do not have the information with me, but it sounds like you are very new to Outlook.com, thus, you have a very low sending quota of just 10 emails per day. 
<br />
<br />How can I raise the limit? 
<br />
<br />1. add phone number, alternative email address and enable two-step verification in your Microsoft account 
<br />2. continuing to use your account normally 
<br />3. building a good reputation within Outlook.com e-mail algorithm system 
<br />4. upgrading to ad-free Outlook.com 
<br />
<br />What is the sending limit? 
<br />
<br />It is anywhere from 10 to 300 e-mails per day varies by account, but maximum 100 recipients per e-mail. 
<br />
<br />So how can I get my privilege restored? 
<br />
<br />You have to wait until the (invisible) time count down that limits your sending limit is over. 
<br />

<h2>            Build 14279 installation fails</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had build 14271 installed in a virtualbox (Lenovo PC Yoga 2 Intel i5). I used Windows update to download and installed 14279.</p>
<p>Download went fine but installation failed:</p>
<p>After each logging screen, I get an error message, system is logging error and says it's an "unexpected kernel mode trap" and it's looping on that error.</p>
<p>I can't get back to 14271. System wants to roll back to W7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clue to avoid starting my VM from scratch?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Deleting a second account- when you no longer have the sign-in info for that second account.</h2>
                    I just rejoined Skype, and realized that an old account I made (at some point of which I now do not remember) is still up and running. This creates confusion when people try to add me as a contact on my new, currently active account. I want to erase me
 old account, but the problem is that I have had the same email for the last 5-6 years; therefore, the second Skype account (which I want to erase) HAS to be linked to the same email that my active Skype account is. First of all, I am not sure how this is possible
 or how this works? Secondly, I am afraid to mess with anything until I get further instruction.&nbsp;

<h2>            Create new Skype Name with same email</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will soon be using Skype for my work, and need to use the same email address so that my work contacts can search for me. My Skype Name was created a long time ago and I would like to change it to a more professional name. It appears that it is impossible
 to change the Skype Name without deleting my Microsoft account, so I am wondering if I can create a new account using my same email address. Appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />One option available it to change your Display Name instead of the Skype name. 
<br />Would this be an option for you?
<br />
<br />To do so please:
<br />- Login to your account  : <a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/account/</a> 
<br />- Click on Edit Profile &gt; Edit Profile to enable in Edit mode &gt; You can change your Display Name here
<br />
<br />Have a great day (or night :) )!
<br />Margarida

            Hi  K_661
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, you cannot, because the Skype account is already associated with your existing Microsoft Account email address.
<br />
<br />You would have to create an entirely new account.

<p><span>Hi Eduardo,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>To fix this issue, I suggest you
<span>first perform a completely uninstallation based on the Option2 in this article: :&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8</span></a>&nbsp;.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Then for Office 365 for Business user, we recommend you download and install Office suite from
<a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Office 365 Software portal</span></a>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please try and feel free to post back for the result.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></p>

<h2>            Office Classic Menu</h2>
                    <p>I am finding the&nbsp;ribbon extremely user-UNfriendly, and trying to figure it out&nbsp;reduces my productivity immensely.
</p>
<p>I understand that the ribbon is easier for new users and that&nbsp;this is your target market.</p>
<p>However, what about those of us who took years to master the menus and tabs... and (apart from the ribbon) like Microsoft Office products?</p>
<p>Why&nbsp;not at least offer the classic menu as an option&nbsp;... as a&nbsp;courtesy to long-time *loyal* users??</p>
<p>It would be very&nbsp;good customer service as well as good PR for Microsoft. </p>

 to what is causing this? and how can this be corrected?<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the update I would suggest you to flush DNS by performing the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, Click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong>
</li><li>
Type: <strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong> and press enter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>
<p><strong><span>Note: </span>
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
The <strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong> command provides you with a means to flush and reset the contents of the DNS client resolver cache. During DNS troubleshooting, if necessary, you can use this procedure to discard negative cache entries from the cache,
 as well as, any other dynamically added entries. <span>
</span></li><li>
Resetting the cache does not eliminate entries that are preloaded from the local Hosts file. To eliminate those entries from the cache, remove them from this file.</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persist, I suggest you to follow the methods given below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:
</strong><span>Try running </span></span></span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">The Microsoft Account Troubleshooter</span></strong></a><span><span><span>and
 check if it helps to fix the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span>
</strong></p>
<p><span><span>Try creating new user account and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Create a user account</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-user-account</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

            <p>Hi Sajid,<br />
<br />
Creating rules is a perfect way of managing and organizing all emails in your inbox. To auto forward an email from
<strong>a specific email address</strong>, from <strong>the </strong><strong>Subject line that contains a specified text</strong>, and
<strong>email addresses from the CC list</strong> and all other recipients, you'll need to create each rule for every description and move it to a specified folder. You may check the steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and go to the
<strong>What would you like to do?</strong> section and click the <strong>Create a rule</strong> option for the steps.</p>
<p>

            I usually get generic answers to my questions like this... well i don't want to move my emails to any folder. I just want to forward that email to a person and keeping some other persons in CC. When i do it by creating a rule I don't find option to add
 person in CC. I just find option to forward email with TO option only.

            <p>That is the problem. I can not find "CC" option when specifying the people to whom I want to CC email. There is only TO option there. See the screen shot for your reference...</p>

<p>Thanks, but that didn't not solve the problem.&nbsp; Excel says there is no background to remove.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program is somehow automatically&nbsp;adding the watermark...and the size of the watermark varies with the size of the array (or table) defined.&nbsp; In this case, the fonts are approx. 4"x4" in size for a 12 x 322 cell array.&nbsp; To compound the problem, I have
 defined four different&nbsp;arrays/tables such that the screen is clobbered with these watermarks.&nbsp; This product is intended for commercial applications and I cannot show this to my customers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anybody else having this problem?&nbsp; I'm running Windows 10 Pro,&nbsp;64 bit config. ,&nbsp;i7 chip&nbsp;on a&nbsp;powerful&nbsp;PC with 20 Gigs of memory.&nbsp; ???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

 subscribed to these newsletters because they are important to me. I want to be able to see them and read them.&nbsp; All of my newsletters related to topics on photography and Photoshop effects...nothing pornographic or anything like that. How do I get rid of Outlook's

            <p>Hi ps1130,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. As what I understood on your post, you are saying that when you are receiving newsletters on your account, you get the message to "unsubsribe" or "shedule&nbsp;automatic cleanup". I would assume that you are accessing your account
 through a PC browser, is this correct? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Well What is the answer? How do you see a mail that MS mail does not let you see. Be very careful with your answer as i already want to move from MS Mail as outlook is ruining my email experience<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t syn all Google Calendars on N97</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the MFE on my N97, and it works fine by syncing my contacts and my MAIN gCal (that is, the cal that is your name).</p>
<p>However, when I create more calendars, they are not synced with my N97.</p>
<p>How can I fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello SORIN1000,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post in forum. Regarding your description, I'd like to give following suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Please open outlook in safe mode. For opening outlook in safe mode press <strong>
Windows + R</strong> key and type <strong>outlook/exe /safe.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a space between <strong>outlook.exe</strong> and
<strong>/safe</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Please disable real time antivirus protection in windows security if any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Please try to disable all Add-ins in outlook and check the result. For disabling Add-ins &gt; open
<strong>Outlook</strong> &gt; in <strong>File</strong> tab &gt; click on <strong>Option</strong> button &gt; then click Add-Ins &gt; Select
<strong>COM Add-ins</strong>, and then click <strong>Go</strong> &gt; <strong>untick</strong> all boxes &gt; click on Ok &gt;
<strong>Restart Outlook</strong>. If the issue doesn't occur, start adding the add-ins one at a time until the issue occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if the issue still persist, I'd like to collect below information from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Could you please provide us outlook client version? For knowing outlook client version
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>2. Could you please provide us video about "attend to meetings crushing Outlook 365" for further assistant?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Does this issue happen with other user in the organization?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Darpan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I already made more then that. I remade the Windows user profile from 0 and the outlook exchange profile of course was remade from 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I will tray to change the laptop of the person with another and try to recreate the .ost and observe how it works. Seems to be something in Windows O.S broken. I'll put a fresh and clean image to see if is happening further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other ideas please tell me.</p>

<div>Hi SORIN1000,</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Thanks for the update. You may try to switch from Semi-Annual Channel to Monthly Channel for the Office 365 suite to check this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I understand that using Office Professional Plus 2016 to configured the same email account Outlook doesn’t crash/freeze. You can use as a workaround for the time being.</p>
<div><br />
<div><span>Your understanding will be highly appreciated.</span>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best regards,</div>
<div>Shyamal</div>

virustotal gave me 3 warnings. I am also surprised that there is very little information about these add ins on the net. So I wonder, if anyone has any positive or negative experience with add ins from onenotegem.com.

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Access Point Name settings may not be set correctly. This can also be a phone's software issue. For us to resolve this, please answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which OS build version is currently running on your phone?</li><li>Have you tried using your Jio SIM card with another phone to isolate the issue?</li><li>Are you getting an error message or code when you're launching any apps?</li><li>Have you checked if there's an available update for your apps on the Store app? To check, just go to Store app &gt; tap the menu at the upper left corner, then select Downloads and updates &gt; Check for updates. Note: Please connect your phone to a Wifi connection.<br />
</li><li>Have you tried performing the suggested troubleshooting steps in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12497/lumia-internet-connections-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I cannot connect to the internet using a mobile data connection?</a></strong></li></ul>

<p>If you loose the signal bars and you are not even able to call, you face a different symptom. If Microsoft support worked, the would send you a private message to track down this issue. Because I would not wait for that, please, remove the microSD and&nbsp;go
 for the&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?Linkid=522381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recovery Tool</a>. After that, do not add any Wi-Fi or Microsoft account. Now, you ruled out all configuration issue. The last step would be a replacement SIM
 (you keep your number and balance, if you ask for ‘replacement SIM). If the issue persists even then, I would return that phone to the point of sale (retailer).</p>

<h2>            Outlook&#58; When sending emails with IMAP account - can not make it only be stored 1 time</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following problem: I'm trying to connect my Outlook to an email account on my mail server via IMAP.</p>
<p>When I'm sending out an email, it will be stored twice, so, after reading in some forums already, I tried to tick the option "Do not save copies of sent items". But if I do that, then, when sending out emails, not any copy of the email is stored anymore
 in my sent items folder.</p>
<p>I'm using IMAP on Port 993 with SSL and authentication. Mail Server is hMailServer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to happen only in Outlook. I never saw such a behavior, with the same email account and IMAP server, in any other email application I use (like AfterLogic Webmail, Thunderbird or with Gmail on my Smartphone).</p>
<p>And, in Outlook, it does not happen only in one system (my laptop) but also with another installation inside a VmWare&nbsp;I'm having the same problem. And I tried with 2 accounts already - the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to make Outlook save the sent items one time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Office 365 Business. The version shown&nbsp;in Outlook is "Version 1810 (Build 11001.20108)"</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p><span>Hi Armin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to get only one email in the sent item folder after you sent out an email in the outlook with your office 365 account. The recommendation for you is that please configure your office 365 account to outlook with
 Exchange Protocol ( use your office 365 account and password directly to sign into outlook and don’t use manually set up).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Based on your description, if seems that you have configured office 365 account with Exchange Protocol in the different profiles of outlook, please change to other profiles in which you are using Exchange Protocol then send some emails and see if you
 still got duplicate emails in the sent items folder.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, I’d like to share with you that as we talked before, we don’t recommend customers to configure office 365 account to outlook with IMAP/POP Protocols, for it may cause data loss ( for example your calendars and
 contacts can’t be synced between different devices with IMAP/POP). And for IMAP/POP accounts ( protocols) , we have limited resource regarding to the related issues of office 365 accounts which were configured as IMAP/POP accounts. So for your current issue,
 we recommend that please change to Exchange Protocol and then see if the issue disappears.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your understanding will be highly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Oliver</span></p>
