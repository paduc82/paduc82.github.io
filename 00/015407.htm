<h2>            Can&#39;t login, now have multiple accounts, all I want is to know&#47;change my Skype name</h2>
                    I was auto-signed into my account (which has money on it) and was trying to figure out my skype name, so I logged out thinking it would take me to a login screen. Instead, the app closed. I opened it back up and logged-in, but apparently, it just created
 another account for me. I have an email from when I originally changed the email associated with my account specifically stating it was changed, but now I seem to have 2 accounts with the same email? And I still can't seem to change my skype name, which was
 never even an option. Instead, it is some weird number beginning with ID and no article works for explaining how to change it.&nbsp;

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e6662a9c-50dd-4f00-bd94-f9670b8e486d" title="smsh1093">
<p>
</p><p>I just want to clarify something about your thread post. Did you sign in to Skype using your Skype email address and not the username? If that is a yes, can you try to sign in using the Skype username?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, let me set your expectation, when you sign in using the email address,&nbsp;this will generate a new Microsoft Skype account and there is no option to change Skype username ID, only thing that can be change is the Skype display name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further questions or clarifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Answering the questions in the reverse order:<br />
<br />
3. To prevent Word from applying the "List Paragraph" style: Click the File tab, click Options, and then click the Advanced category. Select "Use Normal style for bulleted or numbered lists."<br />
<br />
Note that the command is slightly misleading; it does <strong>not</strong> mean that Word applies Normal style if some other style is already applied to the paragraph. It simply means that Word preserves the style currently applied to text. (But note that if
 you are applying a numbered or bulleted style, obviously the style will change.)<br />
<br />
2. This is determined by the option I mentioned under (3) above. If you select the option, the style won't change as you press Enter twice. Word will just clear the numbering or bullet formatting.<br />
<br />
1. No, you can't (which you may already guessed based on my replies above). But you can use a specific style, a custom style or a built-on one, when applying numbered or bulleted list formats.

            "List Paragraph" is a paragraph style that Word uses by default to format&nbsp;any paragraph (spacing before/after, line spacing, etc.) to which you apply a numbered or bulleted list. It has nothing to do with the list format that you select.
<br />
<br />
Note that you get more control if you actually make use of a bulleted or numbered style. For example, try the built-in List Bullet or List Number styles.

<p>Hello CHRISSPANO,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further assist you, are you pertaining to Skype to Skype calls or is it calls to landline/mobile numbers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're pertaining to the Recent tab, Skype will show you the failed and answered calls for your reference. If you made a call to someone who is not yet added on your contact list, it will appear on the Recent tab. This will give you an option to go back
 to that contact and if you wanted to add him/her, you can do so. Same with people who is on your contact list, if you do not want to search that contact every time you want to make a call, simply search that person on your Recent tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll look forward to your reply.</p>
<p>

            Hi EG0919, Word has limited ability when it comes to opening PDF files.
<br />
<br />It can open PDF files originally created with Word or the Windows Print to PDF function, but that is about it.
<br />
<br />If the PDF was created with an application like Adobe Acrobat, Word will not successfuly open that file. There are plenty of free online PDF to Docx converters that you can use to convert the PDF into an editable Word document.
<br />
<br />Smapp PDF is free and very fast:

            Recent versions of Word should be able to open PDFs, but you may not be able to edit the files, depending on how they were first created. Typically, PDFs consisting of text are editable in Word, but not PDFs created by a scanner which must first be converted
 into an editable format via OCR (optical character recognition) software.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 build 10240 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 build 10240</h2>
                    <p>I have Acer&nbsp;w510. I am a windows insider member and was following windows 10 development closely. On 17.Jul.2015 I installed build 10240 on my system. It was working flawlessly apart from windows store and few other app problems. I decided to do a clean
 install as my system has limited space and it was full. While performing full install windows got stuck and installation was not proceeding beyond 66%. System was not allowing me to do either clean installation or restore old version. I have an old image (build10166).
 Seeing no other option I decided to install this on the system. I somehow managed to open&nbsp;command prompt and initiate the installation. Installation is complete now but now system is asking me Product key (which I don't have but I got it from other discussion)
 and post keying and choosing Express settings&nbsp;it is asking me to wait and&nbsp;getting restarted bring the same product key page to me. I tried skipping the step but result is same. Further system is not allowing me to boot from USB pendrive (where I have build
 10166 bootable disk).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was working on legal version of windows 8.1 before I embarked on this journey of windows 10. Now my system is completely stuck and I don't know how to proceed.

    <title>Internet Explorer freezes when downloading fairly larger files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> complete confusion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer freezes when downloading fairly larger files &#40;100MB or greater&#41;</h2>
                    <strong>Original title: Files Keep Freezing Before Completion. <br />
<br />
</strong>For anyone who can help me, I'm very grateful. I'm using IExplorer 8.0 &amp; my problem is when I try to download fairly large files, at least 100MB or up,&nbsp;over half the time the download will freeze and just sit there till I cancel or let it time out,
 and they don't always stop at a certain percentage. Other files could be downloading at the same time and wind up finishing. When trying other browsers they tend to do pretty much the same way. I've tried my Dad's laptop (same router) with several files and
 it worked fine. I don't have any problems loading pages or anything else that I'm aware of. I've tried all I knew to do by unplugging the router, the modems coaxial &amp; power cord, waited for a while and them plugged back in, also tried resetting the IP address,
 deleted the network on my laptop &amp; started it back up. I've had no problem since I'd been connected (couple years ago); but for unknown reasons have had these problems for a month, and to the best of my knowledge hadn't messed with anything that would cause
 this. Not sure if&nbsp;it's helpful but I also ran Spybot, Malwarebytes, and AVG; all came up clean.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your time.

<div><span>Hi,</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Follow the steps mentioned below and check if that makes any difference in that fixes the issue.</span></div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>To start Internet Explorer without add-ons,</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button, and select
<strong>All Programs</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Accessories</strong>, and select
<strong>System Tools.</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which
 add-on is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the following articles and follow the methods mentioned in the order of appearance to fix the issue:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-Internet-Explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Tips for solving problems with Internet Explorer</a></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Boot into&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/what-is-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>safe mode</strong></a>&nbsp;with
 networking and check if the issue persists.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Advanced
 startup options (including safe mode)</strong></a> for more information on booting into safe mode with networking.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> If the issue does not occur in
 safe mode, <span>you may put your system in clean boot state (in normal mode) to troubleshoot the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>How
 to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer
 to start as usual as mentioned in <strong>Step 7</strong> in the above KB article.</span></p>

<h2>            Reinstall Outlook</h2>
                    We recently upgraded to Outlook with Office 365.&nbsp; Everything transferred beautifully.&nbsp; All emails, files, contacts and calendar showed up as they had been before the upgrade.&nbsp; Yesterday one of our computers decided to throw a fit.&nbsp; We did a reset to reinstall
 Windows 10.&nbsp; This morning I reinstalled Office 365.&nbsp; When I opened Outlook I was prompted to add email addresses.&nbsp; Our emails began to download but the calendar, files and contacts are not there.&nbsp; Have I missed a setting?

            Are you using an Exchange mailbox? Then everything should be on the server and will sync down - calendar &amp; contacts may not sync down immediately, but should begin within a few minutes after mail starts syncing.  If you are in the mail navigation pane, you'll only see mail folders. Switch to the folder list (ctrl+6) or the calendar or people modules to see the contents.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My iPAQ rx5935 has suddenly decided not to reboot into Widows.</p>
<p>History: relatively problem-free. Synchs with Vista with no trouble. Had run the battery down to zero to keep it 'fit'. Recharged as normal. turned device on by main power button &amp; nothing happened at all. Pressed Reboot button and it went thru'
 initial startup routine but failed to continue into the Windows Mobile home screen. Have tried soft reboot several times with no progress. Have tried removing battery, reinstalling and then soft reboot - nothing. Have tried connecting to PC and repeating;
 again nothing.</p>
<p>The thing has locked completely at the end of the boot loader mode.</p>
<p>WHAT CAN I DO?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been a huge fan of and user of windows phone going back to the HD7. I bought the Lumia 650 a month ago and three weeks later I had to get it replaced for several issues. The new one I received worked better but still have some issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. First of all how do you make a phone without a dedicated camera button?????</p>
<p>2. Pinned contacts pictures only show half picture and name where all other phones showed full picture with name.</p>
<p>3. Messages (Text) and emails do not show up in contacts pin.</p>
<p>4. On occassion I get a error message pertaining to my 128 GB sd card. (It's happening less on this phone).</p>
<p>5. Camera is not the stablest as past window phones.</p>
<p>6. Why is the only email sharing choice outlook and no other email account choices?</p>

            <p>Hey Joe Men,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply and advice. I apologize for the late response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Contact images will show correctly if you cropped the contact image properly. The pinned contact tile will animate after a certain time and will show you the name.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>* I have never had to crop a picture for pinned contacts. The picture is fine for the small box but only shows half the picture (lower half at that) on the large box.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>

<p>
</p><p>* They are showing up as I am use to seeing them but with the new design instead of taking you to the message or email it takes you to the contact's profile and from there you chose where you want to go. A little inconvient but I can live with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">On occasion I get a error message pertaining to my 128 GB sd card. (It's happening less on this phone).</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Please provide the error message that you've received, and I will troubleshoot further.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>* I figured out on both of the phones I used neither on could handle the 128 gig card they are reported to be able to. I recently switched to my 64 gig card and put all the same files, music, videos games and more on it and no problems for the three days
 until I ran into another problem which I will get to shortly. In about a week or so I am going to buy another 128 gig card and see if it works better.</p>

<p>
</p><p>* Camera works a bit better on this phone. Focus and stabilizing is a bit sketchy.</p>

            <p>Hey Joe Men,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay I am having a new problem as of yesterday. As I said about three days ago I started using my 64 gig sd card until I get another 128 gig card and it was work great at that time I had only 3 (my main outlook account, my gaming gmail account one of my
 class account Yahoo) of my 8 email accounts (all of which are gmail) loaded on the phone when I started to load my next account and select gmail it takes me to a web page ever other email choice works fine it is only gmail. I tried a soft reset didn't help.
 I tried a hard reset (settings - system - about - reset your phone and that didn't help. I then tried the other hard reset turning the phone off then hold the power button till you see the microsoft icon then pressing the volume down button till you see the
 exclamation icon then pressing the volume up then down then power and then volume down again. And again nothing changed.</p>

            I agree with you, the worst phone i ever had, the unlabled chinese one are hundred time better than this piece of s**t, apps crashing all the time, frequent reboot, you need to restart the phone to use the earphones, otherwise you will get an 0x000000
 error when tryin to play music, youtube shows "video cant be encoded", apps wont install, pictures are ruined by the "add finitions" option that you can't disable, random notifications, sometimes you recieve message without any sound, ........ I hate it so
 much, i want to destroy it to take revenge, and i will do or i will have a hypertention.

                    <p>I recently upgraded to a new desktop with Windows 10 and Office 365.&nbsp; Before the upgrade I Migrated the existing Outlook e-mail to .pst files which are on the old hard drive connected with a USB drive.&nbsp; How do I get the new outlook to be able to read these
 .pst files.&nbsp; I get a a message saying I do not have permission to look at the .pst file.</p>

    <title>Pause Music player when headset unplugged - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stoinov---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pause Music player when headset unplugged</h2>
                    
<p>It will be great if you culd add option to choose (or even change the default) whether to pause the music player when you unplug the headsed or disconnect bluetooth one.</p>
<p>It is very annoying to remove the headset and then the music continues through the loudspeaker. The same happens when I listen to my stereo headset and if the battery dies the music continues over the loudspeaker, which I think it's not the logical thing.
 I explicitly added headset to listen to music - so I want if I disconnect it to stop listening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please Nokia ad such functionality in the next versions of the Music Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. the iPhone has this behaviour.</p>

            Nokia might add this feature in the future, but bear in mind that what happens now is the logical thing for any portable audio device.<br />
<br />
What happens if you disconnect the headphones from a transistor radio that you're listening to? The sound starts coming from the radio's loudspeaker.<br />
<br />
What happens when you disconnect the headphones from a portable cassete/CD player? The sound starts coming form the sound system's speakers.<br />
<br />
Do you see a pattern emerging here?

<p>this is correct, but I see all these as a dedicated sound systems. My phone on the other hand is multitasking device. When I plug the headset I tell him that I will use it as a music player. When I unplug it I will want to use it as a normal smartphone and
 I want it to behave as such.</p>
<p>What is more the build in loudspeaker does not have the quality of a sound system or even radio and people rarely (if ever) use it for listening to music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So anyway it would be nice to have such option.</p>

            I think this is one of those things were Nokia phones tend to be a little inconsistent or they for some reason the suddenly decide to change things. A 5200 pauses the music when the headset is pulled out and gives you a time period where it will continue
 if you plug it back in. I got used to this and then had to adapt when I got my N82. I understand s60 phones and s40 phones will not always behave the same. What gr wrote above makes a lot of sense but I also wish the phone would stop playing music when I pull
 out the headset

            Do you have Norton's Outlook addin installed? If yes, disable it. There's no need to have any 3rd party Outlook A/V addin installed if you have an up-to-date system level A/V program installed from any of the major providers. Integrated A/V addins generally
 do nothing but cause problems with very little (if any) real benefit.

            <p>Thank you. Yes, I spent a couple of hours in chat 1st with Microsoft (3 different people) then Norton. The Norton person uninstalled Norton Internet Security and the problem went away. Then reinstalled it and it came back. They promised to call again tomorrow.</p>
<p>I don't understand who the "major providers" are. I would have thought Norton would be one.</p>

Norton is certainly one of the major players so as long as you keep it updated - there's no need to install the Outlook addin component. As for the speed issue, Norton isn't the only one that can cause a serious drag on things.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Like I said - integrated 3rd party A/V addins tend to the cause of all kinds of issues. Know that first hand where ContactGenie programs were reduced to a complete "crawl" doing nothing more than a simple import. Once the addin was disabled - the world
 returned to normal. In one case, a problem started after the addin went through a normal "program update" - earlier version caused no interference - updated version slowed things down to the point of being unworkable.</div>

What are you referring to? Question is related to folders being created so don't understand what your question pertains to.</p>

            The folders are sitting&nbsp;under each of&nbsp;&nbsp;my personal folders. I got tired of deleting them one by one (multiple picks are not allowed!). I was able to move these into a junk folder except for the two folders that could not be deleted, and then delete the
 junk folder. Now I have the two remaining folders sitting in under each of my personal folders. I hope that explains it. Thanks.

            <p>1) Are these folder names consistent to the problem originally identified?</p>
<p>2) So in your scenario, closing and re-opening Outlook does not enable you to delete any of these folders - is that correct?</p>
<p>3) Do you have the Norton A/S Outlook addin installed? If yes, solution is going to be to disable it? If not - what 3rd party Outlook addins do you have installed?</p>
<p>4) Assuming that by "deleting the junk folder" - you mean "empty it" since you cannot delete the Junk folder entirely</p>

            <p>Thanks for the input. Based on that information I went to Symantec, opened a chat, and got an agent who worked through shutting off the Norton AV add-in. Sure enough, the problem went away. Upon reinstalling it the problem returned. Another agent tried some
 tricks, then finally agreed shutting down the AV was the best available option. It solved the problem. Hopefully they are working on a better solution.</p>

            I am sorry I may being obtuse but as far as I can tell the same Norton add-ins have been in place for several months at least on my computer but this replication issue has arisen on my computer only for the last month. It seems it is most likely a Microsoft
 update which has caused the problem and Norton is being blamed. I am concerned that I lose a level of protection if I disable the Norton outlook add-ins. In any event I am not sure how to do this safely anyway. I don't want to turn off more than I need.
<div><br />
<div>Karl - have Microsoft identified where the conflict is and therefore what changes to Norton settings are essential to correct this very annoying problem. Please take me through the necessary changes</div>
<div><br />
<div>On a separate issue approximately four months ago my computer refused to allow any access to the internet through Internet Explorer. This required an expensive trip to a (respected local) computer specialist to sort. He was insistent that this problem
 had been caused by an automatic windows update which was conflicting with my DELL/Windows set up and was a problem which a number of his clients had encountered. I now only use Chrome.</div>

            <p>First see my post in the following thread dated Oct 3rd which explains the two issues that need to simultaneously exist for this problem to occur when a 3rd party program is involved</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Outlook 2010 Autonomously Creating Personal Folders <br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-outlook/outlook-2010-autonomously-creating-personal/be05b06a-efff-45cb-9cb7-82af0bea0dd5?page=2&amp;tm=1380832149186#LastReply">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-outlook/outlook-2010-autonomously-creating-personal/be05b06a-efff-45cb-9cb7-82af0bea0dd5?page=2&amp;tm=1380832149186#LastReply</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In short - not something that in any way can be resolved by a "setting change".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On a more generic and general note regarding problems and "blame" etc. a simplistic overview of "trouble-shooting 101". There are 2 facets to any problem, the "symptom" which identifies that a problem exists and the actual "cause" which may end up being
 something completely unexpected since it is quite possible to have many "identical looking" &lt;symptoms&gt; each with a different and completely unrelated cause. The priority is (at least for most of us who respond here on a regular basis) is to try and determine
 the actual cause and provide an answer as to how to either resolve an issue or work-around it until a permanent solution is found. Personally, I leave the&nbsp;"blame game" to those who spend their lives in a glass house living in a non-existent perfect world.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In this case, to date, the only 3rd party program that has come up in any of the forums that is triggering this issue has been the Norton addin and &lt;IF&gt; the actual cause is what has been identified so far, one question is "why is the program taking a lazy
 approach of automatically trying to retrieve &lt;default&gt; folders in every information store it accesses when &lt;default&gt; folders may not exist?" That doesn't take away the fact that the problem was introduced in an O'2010 update resulting in a compound error scenario.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In regards to your question "....has Microsoft identified where the conflict is?...." - can't answer that but do know with absolute certainty they are aware of it (only applies to O'2010) and it has been assigned a bug report number. Found it odd that nothing
 had been reported to MS prior to this given that obviously at least one person at Norton is familiar with exactly which update caused the issue as per &lt;Charles Le Grand's&gt; last reply and his interaction with Norton. If they are aware of the exact cause - why
 on earth would that not have been reported to MS and save everyone a whole of aggravation trying to find something that is "known". I passed the issue along to the Outlook team which in turn resulted in a bug report being filed after the problem was replicated
 but there was no other report on file from anyone else at that point in time. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>At the end of the day, every problem encountered by someone is considered the "most important issue" that exists and should absolutely warrant&nbsp;immediate attention. Fact is that in the scheme of millions of Outlook users - this error does not rise to that
 level and Norton can implement a work around in their code to avoid the problem if they so choose (again assuming the actual cause is what has been identified to date - not something I can say with absolute certainty since I don't know what Norton's code does
 other than trigger a "symptom" that is identical to something that can be replicated).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As for the last issue you mentioned, no way to comment on it since there is absolutely no way of knowing what this is in reference to - could be an MS update problem, could be a Dell issue, could be any combination of things etc. Your tech may have been
 absolutely right as to the cause but out of curiousity - did his insistence that the issue was caused by an "automatic update" also happen to include which update was involved or is this just another case of it being easier to make a universal statement? (Have
 no desire to continue the discussion in regards to this last paragraph since it has absolutely nothing to do with Outlook, the focus of this forum, especially since&nbsp;absolutely nothing positive would result)</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>No, this worksheet is my entire household budget and I'm running it out for 10 years in order to payoff my HELOC.&nbsp; I only show my HELOC as a balance (as a positive number (L44)).&nbsp; The difference between income and expenses for a given month, M35 could be
 a negative number which would require a withdrawal from the HELOC or if it is a positive number, then it becomes a payment to the HELOC (M44).&nbsp; When the HELOC balance becomes a negative number (M44), it then becomes my running slush fund used to to meet monthly
 expenses.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use L44-M35-M8=M44, it appears to work.&nbsp; When M35 is a negative number, it appears to add when there are two negatives [a negative number and a - in the formula]) although I haven't check the entire spreadsheet.&nbsp; I'd feel more confident if I knew the
 Excel formula 'added' the negative number to the HELOC balance and 'deducted' the positive number consistently.&nbsp; Or is there a formula that says if M35 is a negative number then add it AND if it is a positive number then subtract it? &nbsp; I use Excel (unsophisticated
 formulas) but can confuse myself.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</p>

<br />
I think that spybot can have the sort of interfering effect I mentioned.&nbsp; Why not try disabling&nbsp;and uninstalling it as a test to see if your drag and drop reordering will persist?&nbsp; Otherwise I think it could help to be more aware of when the change of ordering
 occurs and the conditions that happens under.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since running ProcMon for that long would be impractical the only thing that I can think of for getting more precise information would be adding a audit on the registry key and value involved.&nbsp; You do that using
 the key's Permissions dialog via RegEdit.&nbsp; One way that your symptom would occur for example would be when an Order value under a MenuOrder subkey&nbsp;would be deleted.<br />
Another thing you could do in RegEdit is try managing the key's permissions so the only time changes to it could happen would be when you were aware of them having to happen, e.g. when you&nbsp;were making changes to your Favorites.&nbsp;&nbsp; That would probably be impractical
 if you change your Favorites a lot; otherwise it would be an effective way of testing your hypothesis about whether "a new update" could be the cause.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

    <title>Nokia 6600 Slide with no backlight for keys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sikamikarina  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6600 Slide with no backlight for keys</h2>
                    I bought a brand new nokia 6600 slide last night and for some reason the backlight for the keys does not work. This of course prevents me from being able to use it in the dark (verrrrrry annoying!!) Has anyone had this happen or any ideas if there is a
 quick fix ie i am stupid and it is a function i somehow have to set. I'm guessing it is just a dud?? The backlight on the screen works and all other functions appear to be fine ....

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got the same problem with my Nokia 6600 slide (which is now exactly one year old). Service told me that the cause must be a damage by fluid. But I'm really sure, that the mobile was the whole time very dry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the hints (software upgrade, remove battery, reset settings, ...) didn't work. So I've got give this damn thing to the service to repair it. I was a big fan of Nokia ... until now. That's really annoying.</p>

    <title>Run macro in another workbook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Run macro in another workbook</h2>
                    I'm writing a procedure that will run a macro from a series of workbooks in a folder and paste the results in the current workbook. The code I have opens the workbook but gives me Run-time error '1004': "Cannot run the macro: C:\Priya\2017-0702\035-Jenni.xlsm!ComputeSecReport.
 The macro may not be available in this workbook or all macros may be disabled." I saved the workbook as "2017-0702-2.xlsm" before running the following code.<br />
<p>Sub SecReports()<br />
Dim path As String, ppe As String, filename As String<br />
Application.ScreenUpdating = False<br />
Application.DisplayAlerts = False<br />
path = "C:\Priya\"<br />
ppe = "2017-0702"</p>
<p>'ppe is going to be a user defined input, but I kept it as a variable to make testing easier</p>
<p>filename = Dir(path &amp; ppe &amp; "\" &amp; "*.xl??")<br />
Do While filename &lt;&gt; ""<br />
Workbooks.Open (path &amp; ppe &amp; "\" &amp; filename)<br />
Application.Run ("'" &amp; path &amp; ppe &amp; "\" &amp; filename &amp; "!ComputeSecReport")<br />
Workbooks(filename).Sheets("SecReport").Rows("1:" &amp; Workbooks(filename).Sheets("SecReport").Rows.Count).EntireRow.Copy<br />
Workbooks(ppe &amp; "-2").Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A" &amp; Workbooks(ppe &amp; "-2").Sheets("Sheet1").UsedRange.Rows.Count + 1).Paste<br />
Workbooks(filename).Close savechanges:=False<br />
filename = Dir()<br />
Loop<br />
Application.DisplayAlerts = True<br />
Application.ScreenUpdating = True<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>035-Jenni.xlsm (and all of the other files in that directory) has a worksheet called TimeSheet that is protected, but where users can input data in a specified range. The macro I'm calling, unhides a sheet called SecReport (an unprotected
 sheet) which creates rows of data based on the TimeSheet. The VBA code for this procedure is protected as well. I can open these workbooks and run the macro without any problem, but I can't do it through another workbook. I've checked all of my spellings and
 filepaths and everything is spelled and referenced correctly as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Thanks, but I figured it out already and got the code running. Now I'm trying to figure out how to disable the spell checker from opening when I open the workbooks. I used the Application.DisplayAlerts method but it doesn't work.
