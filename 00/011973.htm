<h2>            I can no longer access One Drive on my Lumia 930</h2>
                    My Lumia 930 runs Windows 8.1 (and cannot be upgraded to Windows 10 apparently) and I can't access my One Drive files anymore. &nbsp;The message is 'You don't have permission to download this file. For help try contacting the person who manages this site' &nbsp;Can
 anyone help please? &nbsp;My Windows phone is useless to me if I can no longer access my files and sync to One Drive documents!&nbsp;

            Can you open your OneDrive from PC and access all your files normally?<br />
<br />
Also, why cant you update your phone to Windows 10? It is a supported device and will get the update. Download the upgrade advisor app, open it, follow the steps and you'll get the update.

            Thank you for replying. &nbsp;Yes, all files absolutely fine on PC, so clearly a phone problem. &nbsp;Also, I have downloaded the upgrade advisor app, but on running it it advises that my handset cannot be currently updated to Windows 10 -possibly it is too old
 a model as I have had the handset for 3 years or more. &nbsp;Doing more reading it appears that others are having this problem and it seems this is all on handsets that haven't been (or as in my case, can't be) upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;I will wait to see if this
 is a temporary issue, but if not it seems Microsoft have basically made certain handsets unusable with your own documents overnight!

            <p>You can get the update if upgrade advisor is not working for you. Just follow these steps,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">1. Download the Windows Insider app from store.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">2. Open the app and sign-in using your MS account. You'll be greeted with a page full of warnings and other stuff(read it once though), move on.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">3. You'll get an option to choose Insider Rings to get Insider preview builds for your phone. Use&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/all-you-need-know-about-windows-insider-rings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this
 link</a>&nbsp;to know more about them.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">4. Now that you have understood about the different insider rings, click on 'Production Ring'. The device should reboot(if it does not, do &nbsp;a soft reset yourself) and check for updates by going to settings&gt;phone update.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">5. If you still don't get the update, repeat the above step but select the 'Release Preview Ring' instead.&nbsp;The device should reboot(if it does not, do &nbsp;a soft reset yourself) and check for updates by going to settings&gt;phone
 update.</p>

            Thank you so much for the detailed instructions - I thought it might work for a while there! Basically, the Windows Insider app just goes round in circles, either saying I may not be registered (which I am and if I go to the web page it recognises I am
 registered and logged in) or says 'no builds' and again asks me to register or use an alternative log in, which just gets me logging in with my MS account again. I also tried deleting stuff in case storage/space was an issue as phone was pretty full. Also
 tried uninstalling app and starting from scratch, but nothing I try gets me any further unfortunately, so I cannot get to the stage of selecting Rings - or into the app at all now. No idea what else to try as according to Windows Insider info page a Lumia
 930 should work, it was on the previous latest software update, I've cleared storage space, etc, etc. I think i may have to admit defeat at the moment after spending about 3 hours with no results, but I really appreciated your advice.

            <p>Hey, thought I was just unfortunate to have this happen to me but apparently, it might be something related to the online Office App/OneDrive authentication service? &nbsp;</p>
<p>The OneDrive app works just fine, it's the Office one giving trouble opening cloud files or navigating through the OneDrive locals. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"Upgrading" to W10M is out of the question for now, so if anyone could come up with a solution I'd be forever grateful to you. Already tried reinstalling OneDrive, no bueno, also tried re-signing in in the OneDrive app, nothing. Can't really try that on
 the Office app because it's integrated into the system and we can't re-sign in the main account.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply but I've been there, done that. No good :( .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything seems to be working and syncing just fine, just Office &lt;-&gt; OneDrive integration that seems completely off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If I download the files with the OneDrive app and then open them locally using Office, they're fine, the issues really is opening them on the cloud and real-time sync'ing them.<br />

            I have tried all of the above too without success. I think this shows there is a wider problem, and it seems those of us without Windows 10 mobile may not be able to carrying using our phones as we want to. I hope there is a fix soon or I'll have no choice
 but to get a new handset - and that really makes me angry!

            I have exactly the same problem, it stuck a few days ago without any obvious reason. I may add that this Onedrive problem concerns only Office related files: doc, onenote, etc. Pdf and jpg files download and open flawlessly. Office-related files produce
 "you don't have permission to download..." error message. (syncing and opening of the same files works flawlessly between laptops and ipad )

            Yes, I hadn't specifically noticed this before as the files I use daily ( or did until 2 days ago!) are Word and Excel documents. I still can't open jpegs or PDFs if I go into One Drive through the Office app (that I've always had pinned to my start screen,
 so always use) but they WILL open if you access One Drive separately. Excel, etc still says 'you don't have permission' though - and these are the files I need to use, but seems there is currently no way to do so 😣

<h2>            AfterUpdate vs. LostFocus</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I need to do the following validation on a field:</p>
<p>If a user enters data, this data is validated against data in another field, but if the validation fails, VBA needs to make the value of this field null AND the focus has to stay on this field. How do I achieve this?</p>
<p>The code i have so far, which works fine as far as the validation goes, but not as far as making the value null or going back to the field, is as follows:</p>
<p>if "*"&nbsp;&amp; &lt;field2&gt; &amp; "*" like "*" &amp; &lt;field1&gt; &amp; "*" then</p>
<p>msgbox "The data is invalid",vbcritical,"Error"</p>
<p>me.&lt;field2&gt; = null</p>
<p>me.&lt;field2&gt;.setfocus</p>
<p>end if</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any help.</p>

<h2>            Macro to create a new worksheet for each row of data</h2>
                    <p>Hi all ~</p>
<p>I need a macro that will create a new worksheet for each name in Sheet1 and copy 1) the heading row (row1), 2) the row of data related to the person whose worksheet it is (including it's hyperlinked email address), 3) a second heading row (row 11) and 3)
 a row of averages (row 13).&nbsp; The cells in row 13 contain an average function and need to copy/paste special as the value.</p>

            <p>Here is another possible solution.&nbsp; The "limits/assumptions" are provided in the code as comments.&nbsp; It automatically figures out how long the list of names is without user input (and how many columns are used), and will deal with duplicate names (such as
 two Brown or two Johnson entries in the list), example: you have two Brown entries, first sheet would be named [Brown], the second one for the second Brown would be named [Brown-2] and if there were 3 Browns, last one would be [Brown-3], etc.</p>

                    <p>I've posted this before, but I need to know if anyone know exactlywhat has changed on builds after 10130, which install and runs completely fine on my AsRock h97m Pro4 board. &nbsp;The bios settings are the same throughout all previous builds on and before 9978

Something MS changed after 10130 that has made it totally impossible for me to do a update install or a iso clean install (restart death loop from hell after a brief showing of the Windows Logo).<br />

            <p>Thank you&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 24, 143, 1); text-decoration-line: underline">Kiran Kishore</span> for reply, I really hope you can help me with this one - and yes Sir, I did, many many times, tried fresh installs of builds downloading the .iso
 &nbsp;then using Win7 USB tool to create boot drive(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>g3258, AsRock h97m Pro4 (latest Bios Ver1.9), 8g ram, Samsung 850, 600OCZ Power supply, everything brand new brought.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Only Build 10130 installs fine.</strong><em> I can install and run 10130 and all the builds before it any kind of way with zero problems. &nbsp;</em>Something changed starting with me attempting to install 10158, 10159,10162, and 10166</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try a fresh install of the builds 10158 and beyond, I get the '<em>death loop'
</em>- a brief Windows Logo then instant reboot. &nbsp;With the builds coming in so fast I had the most experience with 10162., all fresh attempts (see no.3)</p>
<p>
</p><p>10166 did the exact same thing (but attempted from with 10130 via windows update, no .iso yet)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;I wiped the SSD removing all partions and everything between each and every install attempt, tested it on another build, installs over 10130 installed fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still no trusting the SSD, I put in a new standard spin-drive, (in the AsRock h97m Pro4 board) exact same problem - - - its not the hard drive(s)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Tried 3 different Usb keys, the installs above 10130 installed fine on other systems, but use the same keys on this AsRock, death loop - - -not the usb key(s)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;MOST IMPORTANT - When <em>any</em> attempt at a higher build failed, I reserved 10130 to its own usb drive and right away it ALWAYS WORKED when anything
<strong>before it failed</strong> on whatever condition my system has been set up for.
</p>
<p>Yet, on the same USB flash drive that had failed attempt 10162 iso, that drive would install fresh on
<strong>other builds</strong> I have with zero problems, so it cannot be the &gt;&gt;&gt;iso/usb drive(with 10162 on it)&lt;&lt;&lt; either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did let 10130 install and update itself, then let it attempt to install via windows update with the recommendations you posted ( all builds from 10158-10166) Once the New Installs restart, it crashes the same way
<strong>giving me the the error code</strong>, then backups to 10130, which continues to work fine (I'm using the system now to type this)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks Lawrence, NO EXECUTE MEMORY PROTECTION has always been enabled in the Bios :)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have a Toshiba P55W - B5224 that never could, not once even, update ANY builds via Windows Update. It would crash at 27-30% then crash back to the old build. So I always had to do a fresh install from
 a iso. Today, it suddenly did go from 10162 (fresh install) to 10166 via windows update. &nbsp;W O W&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I just want to now I'm not crazy (all the way at least)...</span></p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am having&nbsp;what looks like the same issue with one of my users, so here are the answers to your questions.</p>
<p>1. I have attached the screenshot (below)&nbsp;but removed the users name.</p>
<p>2. The user&nbsp;has a basic&nbsp;account and has full access to the&nbsp;other mailbox (named 'Office')</p>
<p>3. Other users with the same permissions can still access the&nbsp;other mailbox.</p>
<p>4. The issue is only occurring for this mailbox and started to happen 2 days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you need anymore information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hello Admin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I need to know:</p>
<p>1 . Does this user always have the issue, or it occurs randomly?</p>
<p>2 . What if you use other browsers? Is there any difference?</p>
<p>3 . Please sign in the same account on a unaffected user’s device to see if it works on that device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the screenshot, I can see that the user is using <a href="http://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App(OWA)</a>. If you have Outlook desktop client, please check if you can see the emails in Outlook client.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue occurs randomly only in OWA, the issue should be related to the browser. Please use other browsers(like Edge and IE), and
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10607/microsoft-edge-view-delete-browser-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clear the cache</a> to see if there is any difference. </p>
<p>If the issue always occurs in OWA and Outlook client, it is suggested to remove the user’s permissions(including Full access, Send As and Send on Behalf) to the shared mailbox, then re-add the permissions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

            Hi Cody,
<div><br />
<div>Doing my research, I found a "sidestep" solution to this problem. Not happy about it, but it's working and I'm really disappointed with Word (even though I worked with it for over 15 years now).</div>
<div>Solution for keeping heading as bookmark in PDF format is by using Open Office. Sadly, why pay for Word if a free tool is doing the same job and even better?</div>
<div>Anyway thanks for your answer. I will surely post a feedback.</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            The streaming automatically downgrades and upgrades the&nbsp;playback quality between SD and HD&nbsp;based on your network bandwidth.&nbsp; It's not possible to force the app to start and only&nbsp;stream the SD version because of this.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you purchased the movie rather
 than rented, you can choose to download the SD&nbsp;version.

            <p><span>Hi Killson, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these methods: </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: </span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open Internet Explorer (IE) in no add-ons mode and see if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To start Internet Explorer without add-ons, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the <b>Start</b> button, and select
<b>All Programs</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Accessories</b>, and select
<b>System Tools.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer the “Disable add-ons” section in the following article for further instructions:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Also follow the other steps from the article. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: </span></b></p>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business</h2>
                    
<p>I had an Outlook account with a custom domain let's say *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. With it i signed up for OneDrive two years ago and was using it since then.</p>
<p>Now my company switched to Office 365 and i got a new mail lets say *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. It says i get 1TB of OneDrive space, i can log in into it trough the web client, but the desktop OneDrive app says that the account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** doesn't exist.</p>
<p>First of all the OneDrive desktop app doesn't work if you first dont tweak your registry, jesus chirst Microsoft are you effin serious?<br />
<br />
Second, i have 21000+ files (30+GB) in my existing free OneDrive folder and i can not sync them into my new "OneDrive for business" folder because i get errors that some filenames and/or path names are too long or invalid. Seriously? It works with my free OneDrive
 account but the payable "OneDrive for Business" account rejects them? Of course i don't get a list of all the files/folders that are too long, so that i could systematicaly fix them, i get an one by one error for each one of them... What am i supposed to do
 now, click and change every one of them for hours or possibly days?<br />
<br />
This is terrible Microsoft. I'm switching back to the free OneDrive and am looking to switch to another provider alltogether.</p>

<p>Hi user235072,</p>
<p>I agree that changing the registry in order for the new OneDrive is something which needs to change fast. For some users and companies this is a no go before exploring the next generation sync client. However, I must say this new OneDrive software does a
 very great job in what it must do.</p>
<p>You might already know how to do it etc. but I recently wrote a blog about upgrading to the newest sync client for OneDrive. If you want any information or a small guide on how to upgrade, please check it:

<p>Every other application and their dog do the registry changes automatically. MS chooses the users to do....when we pay for a service....that so far has been SH1T. The new onedrive client is good for OneDrive only. Having to have 2 clients to sync both SP
 and OneDrive is pathetic even in the month where everyday is a Sunny freaking Sunday...</p>

<p>I agree Panos. It's also supported in Windows 7 and not on Windows 8.1 This confuses me as well. The status for syncing Sharepoint libraries to this new client is switched from status Q1 2016 to just confirmed it will come at some point. Hopefully we will
 see it before 2017 :-)</p>

<p>I'm used to editing the register but the notion that i have to do it to install/use a mayor Microsoft service is beyond ridiculous to me :D</p>
<p>The deal breaker is that i can't seamlessly transfer my files, since i get errors that the filenames/paths are to long.</p>

<p>Thank you Jiaxing, but i checked my F:\OneDrive with dir * /b /s &gt;&gt; files.txt and sorted the output by length and the longest file path was 226 including F:\Onedrive and the filename, so that is still 30 chracters short of the limit.</p>
<p>Maybe special characters are the problem, but the error message distinctly said it was file/path length.</p>

<p>It's not the path length in your local system but in OneDrive online. So for example in my OneDrive
<a href="https://yourcompany-my.sharepoint.com/personal/test1_yourcompany_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Ftest1%5Fyourcompany%5Fnl%2FDocuments%2FImportant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
yourcompany-my.sharepoint.com/.../onedrive.aspx</a></p>
<p>In the new next generation sync client you can even use special characters but in the OneDrive for Business old client there are limitations. You can't use certain characters.

<p>Youre talking about "new next generation sync client" but this client is not available yet am i correct?</p>
<p>Anyway i have 130GB space on my personal OneDrive (i got some bonuses). So i'll just keep using this for another year. It's just to much of a hassle to move to OneDrive for Bussines for me with the long filenames and all. I'll revisit the idea in a year
 when my 100GB bonus on my personal OneDrive expires.</p>
<p>also:</p>
<p>Are the files in my &nbsp;"OneDrive for Bussines" only accessible by me or can other people in my company/domain see/access them (like the administrator for example)?</p>
<p>Does the Android OneDrive app support OneDrive for bussines accounts?</p>

<h2>            Please disable coffee mode &#40;slow as turtle&#41; on OneNote Online&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I wonder how is possible that Microsoft considers OneNote online a working product.</p>
<p>Have you tried to use it in any web browser? It is so slow to open any note that is like it's asking:<br />
Hey, grab a coffee while we load this note for you.</p>
<p>The experience is just awful. It takes up to 10 seconds to open a single note, a simple note with only text, no images or anything else besides text.</p>
<p>And before anyone from Microsoft says, no, this not a problem in my computer. OneNote online doesn't simply caches anything.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if I'm on Linux, Windows, using Chrome, Firefox or Edge. It is just way too slow to be usable.</p>
<p>The Android app and Windows 10 app works the way they should, but for OneNote online, this needs to be fixed.</p>

<p>Hi BobCosta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some aspects influencing the perfomance of OneNote Online. Such as network connection speed, firewall, etc. To further isolate this case, may I know if the perfomance issue also occurs to other OneNote notebooks? Also, you may try accessing the
 notebooks through OneNote application and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.</p>

<p>I'm sure it's not a problem on my end.</p>
<p>I'm using a 50mbps connection and everything works great. Not a firewall issue also.</p>
<p>I've tried on another connection and yet the problem persists. Different browsers, different connections, even different OSes, it's a OneNote online problem.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 app and the Android 10 app works great since they cache the files.&nbsp; I can move from one note to another note instantly, but with OneNote online, the experience is terrible, way to slow to be usable.</p>
<p>I understand Microsoft is looking forward to customers to use Office 365, and I do even use it but, if I have to use OneNote online from time to time for whatever reason, I can't because it's way too slow.</p>
<p>This needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>

<p>Hi MahirAnwar,</p>
<p>Based on the screenshot, it looks like you have sent a lot of meeting acceptance emails to the meeting organizer. You also mentioned it happens on most of(???) the calendar items.</p>
<p>To isolate this problem from the client and server side, can you do a test of accepting the meeting item via
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App (OWA)</a>?<strong> Please make sure to close the Outlook for Mac client during that time.</strong></p>
<p>If you get the same result, please post here. If not, I would suggest you re-build your email account with a new Outlook profile on your Outlook for Mac. Before creating a new profile, I recommend you remove all your previous account data from your Outlook
 for Mac.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;To remove the data:<br />
a.&nbsp;Navigate to “Tools”&gt; “Accounts”.<br />
b.&nbsp;Select the accounts you want to delete&gt; “-“(delete).</p>

<p>Hi MahirAnwar,</p>
<p>I’d like to reconfirm whether the issue happens after you close all the Outlook clients and other devices where your Office 365 account is set up.</p>
<p>Besides, to determine whether this issue is related to a specific account, please try using other accounts to send the invitation, then accept it and check to see if the issue will be fixed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, please also let me know the message trace result (please double click the message trace result to get the detailed information) via a private message for further checking.</p>
<p>I've sent you a private message to collect the information. Here are the steps to access the private message:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I manually deleted all the meeting invites that were sending people the multiple acceptances. I deleted it from the outlook online account, since my local outlook was not updating the online outlook.</p>
<p>I reinstalled outlook on my local machine. As of now things seem to working fine and the issue is resolved.</p>

            <p>To elaborate on what Charles has said, some inkjet printers, for reasons their manufacturers consider sufficient, use composite black (made up of the colors in the color cartridge) instead of true black (from the black cartridge) for envelopes and other
 smaller paper sizes (possibly because this is what is best for photo printing, and small formats may be assumed to be photos). When your "black" starts coming out red (or blue or green), it's usually a sign that the balance of inks in the color cartridge is
 no longer even, and you will soon need to replace it.</p>
<p>When printers are designed this way, there is no way to force them to use the black ink cartridge for smaller paper sizes other than to define the paper size as Letter or A4 and make up the difference with larger margins. Even in that case, the difference
 in feed method for smaller paper sizes may prevent you from deceiving the printer.<br />

            Any chance you are out of one or more other colors? It is quite conceivable that envelopes would be printed using combination of inks while letter-size would be printed using the black cartridge.<br />
<br />
Stupid, but quite conceivable.<br />

<h2>            Only one MP4 file corrupt&#63; Please help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm dealing with a weird situation.&nbsp;With the recorder functionality on my Nokia N97 I have recorded 7 clips.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5 of them have an icon of a musical note.</p>
<p>1 has an icon of a filmstrip</p>
<p>And one has an icon of a question mark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have copied the files to my pc and all files play except for the one with the question mark.</p>
<p>Googling the internet I read an article about adjusting the headers with a hex editor. That didn't work for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'corrupted' file starts with&nbsp;</p>
<p>iÿN q"1 \ÍÏ sÒn</p>
<p>q<span> </span>ŠÃØ»©£“_~ ‡çÆ‡</p>
<p>iN«Ig|ŽõUë !àúÉ</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And a 'good' file start with:</p>
<p>﻿﻿....ftypmp42....</p>
<p>mp423gp4isom..Û%</p>
<p>mdat..V^@. ^"!!.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried to chance the headers but with no luck. Also I've tried multiple players, converters, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the backup contains also the 'corrupted' file</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file size is &gt;8MB but it doesn't show the playtime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyone who can help me out? Or maybe somebody who can fix the headers for me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, Mitch</p>

<h3> rtesysadmin  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I disable outbound ICMP traffic from Outlook 2016&#47;2019&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We have several workstations with Outlook 2016 and 2019 desktop software installed. Some use IMAP to access Office 365 accounts because the automatic account setup wizards (for both Office 365 and Exchange) did not work on those machines. Some machines were
 able to use the wizards. Those that are connected to the Office 365 servers in Exchange mode frequently send ICMP requests to the servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the purpose of having Outlook desktop software configured with Office 365 email accounts use ICMP? I've blocked those requests at the firewall, but is there a way to stop the Outlook desktop application from sending those requests? The last thing
 our network needs is more useless traffic.</p>

<h2>            Where&#47;What are folders created upgrading Win 10&#47;my many failures have gobbled lots of free space&#47;Can I regain it by deleting&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since I installed 9996 I have tried to upgrade and failed many times.&nbsp; Every time I do I lose significant (Gbs) free space.&nbsp; I have tried to find folders as well as logs to delete so I could&nbsp; take back my much needed free space.&nbsp; What are the folders that
 an aborted attempt to upgrade Win 10 make? Can they be deleted safely to take back your&nbsp; lost free space? I can get back some by running cleanmgr.exe but I'm not sure that's helping.</p>

<p>Thanks for your response Andre.&nbsp; I can't find Windows.old now although it has shown weeks before.&nbsp; I also went to control folders in run to try to show all hidden Windows folders. I assume you mean to claw back space by deleting Windows.old which makes sense.&nbsp;
 Wow that space allotment sounds like a lot even cons idering that MSFT has since I think Vista had an expansion /compression paradigm for a Windows setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried your idea of going to Windows 10 Build 10041 last night.&nbsp; The way it got "offered" was that I went to slow ring and ran update and then back to fast ring and it was shown.&nbsp; It ran until about 50% download and gave me that familiar back to your former
 build message.&nbsp; <strong>The closest I got was when I tried to mount a .iso for 10014 after (as you know) MSFT doesn't make available for a few days until they make the latest build available for slow ring.</strong>&nbsp; It went all the way to 100% installed with
 the big circle and black background then dashed my hopes by rebooting and reverting back to 9996.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the middle of typing this out of the blue I got a big dialogue box that said "Your PC needs to restart to install a technical build" but I haven't been installing one or even starting for a few hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do find a C:\$Windows.~BT folder that takes up 550MB worth of real estate dated today (last time early this morning I attempted to install 10041 and it ran to 50% downloaded before rebooting and reverting back to 9996.&nbsp; Does that folder that has boot and
 setup contain the files for the aborted setup and if so can I safely delete that to get back some space?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx</p>

    <title>Problems with hyperlinks in PowerPoint 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agustin romero valencia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with hyperlinks in PowerPoint 2010</h2>
                    I have a client using PowerPoint 2010. A lot of people works in the same presentation, so, they work in a network drive and when it´s finished, they copy the presentation and the folder with all the resources linked to the presentation to a pendrive. When
 they do so, the hyperlinks don´t update. If you modify the hyperlinks locally, and you change the folder´s location anywhere, the hyperlinks update. My question is how can I update the links automatically? Thanks

<p>That'd depend on the type of links and how they were created, but it's quite possible.&nbsp;

<p>What type of links are you/client working with?&nbsp; You can create links in PPT in any of several ways and to several different types of files.&nbsp; They're liable to behave differently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fill us in on *exactly* what you/the client is doing and perhaps we can work out what the problem is.&nbsp;

            I will try to explain me better.<br />
<br />
My client has to show a presentation to its board of directors, about the company evolution.
<br />
It´s a ppt file, with a lot of embeded xls files and hyperlinks to more presentations.<br />
<br />
It´s a file quite big, and that needs collaboration from different departaments, so, all work in a folder in a network drive, where all of them put the resources to link and the "master presentation".<br />
<br />
When the presentation is finished, they put the presentation´s folder with all the linked resources and the "master presentation" in a pendrive to show the presentation to the board of directors.<br />
<br />
The problem is, that when they copy the presentation´s folder in the network drive to the pendrive, all the hyperlinks point to the network drive, for example:<br />
<br />
The link appears as \\srv-cpefs2\chairman\commite\example.xls<br />
&nbsp;<br />
and the file really is at:<br />
<br />
H:\pendrive\commite\example.xls<br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
<br />
what´s the default way of show hyperlinks? Absolut or relative paths?<br />
Is there any way to update all the links automatically to the new pendrive´s folder?<br />
<br />
The user insists that this procedure works with Office 2003 and all the hyperlinks updated automatically, and now, with Office 2010 doesn´t work.<br />
<br />
I hope that I have explained myself well. I will be waiting for your answer. Thanks for your help.

            my client creates the hyperlinks with insert --&gt; hyperlink on a button created and looking for the file to link, just that.

Thank you very much again. <br />

<h2>            Margin changes when pasting text</h2>
                    When I Paste &amp; Match Formatting (text) into a blank Word document, even if it's set to Normal margins and the amount of text is small, the document changes to Narrow margins. If I type something first, the margin holds, but that's a pain. Isn't there a
 setting for default margins when pasting text?

            <p>It depends greatly on exactly what is being copied &amp; the source from which it was copied. It usually involves far more than just the visible content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if the source has 1" margins &amp; the entire body of content is copied [including the ending ¶] the layout specs are copied as well. When you paste into an otherwise blank document, the margins of the destination document will be reset according
 to those specifications... Just think of the new document as being a lump of clay waiting for someone to give form to it. Especially if a Word document is the source, avoid copying the ending ¶ in a Section or at the very end of the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those markers carry more information than just the location of a paragraph break. If you aren't in the habit of doing so, I strongly recommend having the nonprinting characters displayed when doing any editing.</p>

            I've since found that when I copy and paste text from Quark XPress, I get none of that nonsense. It's just when it's from Adobe inDesign. No matter what I do, the formatting is screwy, probably due to the info in the paragraph mark. Once I Clear Formatting,
 I'm OK. &nbsp;As far as the margins, I've taken to typing a space before I paste text, and that keeps the setting.

            <p>You cannot delete files from within Word. You need to be in the Finder. Once there, select the file(s) or folder(s) to delete and use either of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>File &gt; Move to Trash</em> in the Finder's main menu</li><li>Press ⌘⌫ (Command Backspace)</li><li>Drag the files to the Trash can</li></ul>
<p>In the Finder's window you can do multiple selections by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking and dragging to select a group of items</li><li>Pressing ⌘ (Command) and single-clicking on an item to add it to or subtract it from a selection</li><li>Clicking on the first item of a list, then ⇧ click (Shift-click) on another item to select a whole span</li></ul>
