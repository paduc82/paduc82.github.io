    <title>Why does svchost&#47;BITS download unlimited amounts from Akamai - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does svchost&#47;BITS download unlimited amounts from Akamai Technologies&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 install "downloads" apparently unlimited amounts of data from deploy.akamaitechnologies.com when BITS is enabled. And when I say unlimited, I mean it spends hours maxing out my 20 mbit Internet connection to the point where it clogs up and
 nothing else can be done on the Internet (it's an asynchronous DSL with just 1 mbit up, that gets saturated with acks and then nothing moves - except the 20+ mbit endless phantom download.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling the BITS service instantly drops network usage to zero, but since BITS is needed for updates and is literally unkillable (you can knock it down and disable it but it resurrects itself in short order and starts hogging the connection again) this
 really needs an actual solution. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows insists there are no upgrades for it to download, but still the machine keeps pumping 20+ mbits for hours on end. I have no idea where that is GOING, either, because if it went onto my hard drive it would be full long since. At 20 mbits, that
 means 1 gigabyte every 6 minutes or so, and I'd have noticed that since my machine only has 40 GB free.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can't even turn around and go back out on the Internet, because of the aforementioned 1 mbit uplink. This whole thing just reeks of a bug or failure.&nbsp; I just don't know how to stop it. Killing BITS temporarily halts it.

<p>
</p><p>Instead of stopping it how about trying to control it instead?&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. you could use PowerShell to try to see when a big update is being downloaded and try to throttle it.&nbsp; I haven't actually had to do this myself but using&nbsp;
<strong>man bits</strong>&nbsp; in PowerShell&nbsp; makes it look as if something might be possible using BITS related cmdlets.&nbsp; FWIW just using&nbsp;
<strong>Get-BITSTransfer&nbsp; -AllUsers</strong>&nbsp; has shown me that the latest thing transferred was a SkypeUpdate.&nbsp; Presumably if I had done it earlier I might have noticed it in a different state, actually transferring and then been in more of a position of being
 able to change how long it could take.&nbsp; E.g. we could then check whether Suspend-BITSTransfer would do something useful or more hopefully that Set-BITSTransfer would help us throttle WU's use of the available bandwidth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you could also start using Resource Monitor to try to get some ideas about which tasks and files were involved.&nbsp; E.g. the Network tab would show you which ones were connecting to your problem server(s) and then you could try to spot what other I/O
 those tasks were initiating (unfortunately possibly involving other tasks concurrently and thus making it more difficult to see a direct association).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

    <title>Cortana Not Setting Reminders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kecleon-x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana Not Setting Reminders</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I updated to Windows 10 several months ago. I upgraded and loved the new Cortana feature, taking great pride in the fact that I could speak to my machine to set a reminder. It was great! Until, interestingly enough, it stopped. There was nothing that
 changed to prompt such a change and now Cortana won't do anything other than simply searching Bing for "Remind me on Friday at 11:00 am about my call". I figured that it was perhaps some issues with my Logitech G930 headset, something that I was having some
 now resolved issues with prior so I tried doing it with text after unplugging my headset and a reboot. Same thing. Audio commands to set reminders won't work aside from searching Bing, and text does the same thing. It starts to, even saying "Set a reminder"
 with the lightbulb, however sending me to Bing shortly thereafter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, I haven't an idea in the slightest on what it could be. Hope you guys can help me with this! Cortana's other functions work just fine, by the way; even the movie quiz.</p>

<p>You were only scammed if you paid them. On the other hand, if you told them to
<em>f-off</em>, even in your own mind, then you were the victor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you see a web page like that, don't click on it, not anywhere. Not even on the 'X' that would normally close the page. Instead, open Task Manager [CTRL+SHIFT+ESC ] and 'End task' on your web browser. You'll lose all the tabs you had open, but at least
 your computer won't be harmed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should scan your computer with your anti-malware program.&nbsp; You should consider changing all your passwords, for every website where you have to sign in. If the slimeballs had access to your financial information, you should be on the lookout for attempts
 to remove your money or steal your identity.</p>

            Hi Vernon,
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />" I feel like I have been scammed by Office 365 techs for them to "remove problem, added Norton security, AdBlock, CCleaner professional,  Uninstalled Mcaffe program"  did I get scammed to buy these services? ?'
<br />
<br />I am sorry, you have been scammed, but not by Office 365 techs . . .
<br />
<br />There is a lot of Tech Support scams out there . . .
<br />
<br />Anyone that contacts you through a browser, Email or Phone is not to be trusted.
<br />
<br />Microsoft or its employees will never contact you that way and would never install software like Norton security, AdBlock, CCleaner professional
<br />
<br />You should if you can immediately stop any payment you made to those scammers and remove any software they installed on your system . . .

<h2>            Trouble accessing account</h2>
                    <p>I set up a Skype account with a username a while ago but haven't used it.&nbsp; I created a new password for it but it wasn't able to access my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just set up a new account.&nbsp; All it asked for was my email address but it has not asked for a username.</p>
<p>I am a US citizen on business in London expecting a Skype call from Italy tomorrow and I am not sure what address they need to contact me.&nbsp; This is important and I don't want to miss the call!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Yes it is. But in irder to get them you are supposed to get som messages about that you have deluxe edition, and that message have not reached me.<br />
<br />
As far i can se i have paid for the deluxe content with the Deluxe edition. But no extra content.

<p>Easy thing to fix this would be to uninstall and then reinstall the game if you can see that you have the deluxe items installed (Press the start button when hovering over Rage 2 and click manage game)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also try clearing the cache but I'm not sure if you can do that anymore on xbox one&nbsp;</p>

            Some dlc is unlocked when you reach a certain level, or you have to go to the in game store, or you have to find it in game some how.&nbsp; I would recommend looking at the Rage2 forums and see what others have done to unlock the content.

            You didn't mention which version of Windows your running.&nbsp; There is a DOS based program called MSCONFIG that you can use to alter your startup items.&nbsp; It is normally accessed through the accessories tab from the start windows icon, then clicking on Run
 which will present a DOS window.&nbsp; In the DOS window you will key in msconfig then press enter.&nbsp; This will show a list of your startup items.&nbsp; The ABP item you mentioned should appear in this list.&nbsp; ERASE it.&nbsp; Then close MSCONFIG.&nbsp; Reboot your computer.

<p>It's an add-on for Internet Explorer- Adblock Plus. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Launch Internet Explorer. Click the Settings button (gear). Click Manage Add-ons. Look for an Adblock Plus listing. If you can't uninstall it you should at least be able to disable it.<br />

<p class="contentStandard">when i open a project on windows movie maker 2.6, and then press play, it plays. But once the video is over, it won't play again. (actually it's if i haven't played anything else or moved anything else yet, it will play, otherwise
 not.) The play indicator that shows you where you are moves, but the screen just keeps the start of the video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>I will put a video so you know what I mean:</del> I guese that's not possible, but if it is, i'll put in on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and i added a chroma black and chroma white transition to windows movie maker, if that makes a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if someone could help.</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>

            Hi  KitK1
<br />
<br />Go to the Security Tab, do you see 'Secure Boot'?
<br />
<br />If so,:try this sequence, look for each particular step on each Tab in BIOS, if it does not appear on any tab, move to the next step . . . Let me know, if you still cannot boot and we will work through this . . .
<br />
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi KitK1
<br />
<br />It seems once you have turned off Secure Boot you are now in Legacy boot mode . . .
<br />
<br />What options are you now getting on the Boot Tab?

            Hi KitK1
<br />
<br />Is there no boot order list anywhere in BIOS, so you can move the USB drive to the top of that list?
<br />
<br />If not:
<br />If you press F10 to save those settings and exit BIOS does your PC then boot form the Installation media?

<p>
</p><p>Is there a specific key I press to change the order and move the USB drive to the top of the list? Sorry for asking- Iâ€™m very inexperienced with technology!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I saved and exited the boot menu my laptop did not boot from the Installation media unfortunately.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi KitK1
<br />
<br />If that did nt boot form the USB, this may be caused by the format of the USB drive, according to this thread on the Lenovo website, the Lenovo requires a specific file system to be on that flash drive . . .

<h2>            External Hard Drive &#34;Unknown&#34; and &#34;Not Initialized&#34; under Disk Management</h2>
                    <p>Hello Windows community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent a lot of time researching my problem and have seen many similar posts here but none have solved my problem. I hope someone can lend some aid because this is really stressing me out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is with my <strong>external hard drive and computer not recognizing and opening the files</strong>. I will try and list all details that may be relevant and possibly help solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Device and Usage Details:</span></p>
<p>I have a "<em>Silicon Power Rugged Armor A80 Portable External Hard Drive</em>" I purchased off Amazon in March of 2015 and is under a 3-year warentee. I have had no issues with it until a few days ago and have taken very good care of it (easy on the wires
 and ports, not dropping it, etc.) I use the hard drive to store various documents, pictures, videos, backups, games. I use it primarily on my Microsoft Surface RT 64GB refurbished and my Xbox 360 250GB Reach Edition. I usually remove it "safely" but of course
 when using it on an Xbox you cannot unplug the device safely but I never would think that to cause a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem Details:</span></p>
<p>When plugging in to my surface, it is recognized as a device but <strong>does not open</strong> to view files under "<em>File Explorer/My Computer"</em>.</p>
<p>It <strong>does open</strong> under "<em>My Devices</em>" and I have the option to eject. When looking at it's properties it says both the USB storage and SP device are "working properly.
</p>
<p>When navigating to "<em>Computer Management"</em> and entering "<em>Device Manager"
</em>my device is listed both under "<em>Disk Drives"</em> and "<em>USB Serial Bus Controllers</em>" as "<em>PHD 3.0 Silicon-Power USB Device</em>" and
<em>"USB Mass Storage Device</em>", respectively. Both are listed as "Enabled" and "Installed" with
<strong>no</strong><strong> evil red down arrow. </strong></p>
<p>All my drivers are up to date and troubleshooting has not detected any problems.</p>
<p>When navigating to <em>"Disk Managemen</em><em>t</em>" under "<em>Storage</em>" I can see my Main Hard drive listed as "Disk 0" and everything is allocated and working properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Important Part:</span></p>
<p>Also under Disk Management I see my hard drive listed as "Disk 1". However there is a
<strong>evil red down arrow</strong>, and the disk has no blue nor black bar depicted allocation. It is listed as "Unknown" and "Not initialized" and "Offline". I have attached images for easier viewing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Other Important things I have tried:</span></p>
<p>I have tried to plug it in on other computers including Windows 7, 8, and a Mac. No avail.</p>
<p>I have tried to complete "<em>diskpart"</em> under Command Prompt and my disk is not listed when I enter "<em>list disks"
</em>(only Disk 0 is listed)</p>
<p>I have tried to disable-enable and uninstall-install device. No avail.</p>
<p>I may have forgotten several attempts but evidently nothing has worked.</p>
<p>On some computers it didn't even show up under Disk Managment. It would pop up for about a millisecond then disappear as I unplugged it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need to save the important files on it so if need be, would it be wise to download a data retrieval program? If so, what is a good program?</p>
<p>If I use a USB adapter thingy and take out my hard drive and plug it directly into my computer would I possibly be able to retrieve my files? (Kind of like making it an internal hard drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight or help on this would be greatly appreciated! It really does not make sense to me why my drive would just cease to work unless it was a faulty device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Halp!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I was going to screenshot my disk management page but currently as I was creating this post now my device is not even showing up in disk management! I don't know if it is just a lag and is taking a while or what. It would say unknown,
 not initialized, offline. And does not allow me to initialize nor does it allow me to turn online.</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already contacted SP and reached a point where they told me I should send it in because they could not offer any further troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would assign the drive a letter if it was online, but alas it is not. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have multiple USB cables and they did not work so it cannot be that. Unless of course it is the port. But then again there is no issue with the computer realizing the device is connected so this probably is not a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really think it has to be something with the hard drive. Which is quite unfortunate as it is supposed to be a really safe and relatively indestructible SSD device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What is your, or anyone elses thoughts of buying a USB hard drive adapter off of Amazon. Then taking my hard drive out of the enclosure and hooking it directly up to my PC. If it is a bad driver issue I think this would work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want to just get my files off this thing so I can finally take a sledgehammer to it.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen this situation a few times especially with Silicon Power ssd units. IT doesn't appear to be related to an MLC or TLC situation. I suspect the Sp controller is the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had one Sp S55 drive I used the Sp Toolbox on and after that the drive would no longer initialize. All I was trying to do was a secure erase so I could use the 480gb drive as Windows 7 boot drive. Now I have a brick and no recourse but to return to the
 manufacturer. I hate that with a passion.</p>
<p>You can start that procedure here:&nbsp;http://www.silicon-power.com/web/service_03 or here:&nbsp;https://www.silicon-power.com/web/RMA_service.php. I do recommend Web Service first because you will have to jump through hoops to get anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, with SP ssd drives I recommend not using them for multiple situations where you will be re-partitioning them or erasing or reformatting. I think you will be asking for trouble with these "value drives".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solid performance with robust expectations will probably come from Samsung drives. I say this because they make their own controllers and have produced the most in the industry. Albeit the most experienced. It will cost a few dollars more but you get what
 you pay for usually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for listening to me.</p>
<p>Ben</p>

            Just in case you haven't thrown the darn thing away, I had similar problem recently and all I did was open the thing up and see if there was anything loose in their. To my surprise I observed that the SATA to USB converter was wobbly. I just pushed it
 in tightly and, voila!, the hard drive came back to life.&nbsp;

Yes, the line-in jack has been disabled.&nbsp; I did not have the option to disable it in the Realtek sound application.&nbsp; I did disable it via the Sound in the Control Panel, in that Sound there is a Recordings Tab which lists all devices that are available. In
 that tab the Realtek line-in jack is listed and is listed as disableed.&nbsp; However sound from my stereo receiver still passes through the jack and into the speakers that are also plugged into that integrated sound card.&nbsp; BTW, when those speakers are unplugged
 and the sound output default is changed to the speakers built into the monitor, the sound from the stereo receiver is not heard.

<p><span><span>Hello emmausdan,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since removing the speakers and disabling Line-in does not play the sound, this means that the sound is Line in is mapped by the Realtek software.
 Hence, disabling Line-in would ideally not work. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have the RealTek Audio Management software, I suggest that you check for the option to disable Microphone.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
The RealTek HD Audio Management Software does not show any options for Microphone.&nbsp; It has only two tabs: "Digital Output" and "Speakers".</p>
<p>Within Control Panel, opening Sound displays some tabs: "Playback", "Recording", "Sounds", "Communications"</p>
<p>Under the "Recording" tab there are four devices listed:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Microphone/2 - Microsoft LifeCam-VX 7000 Default Device" </li><li>"Microphone/Realtek High Definition Audio/Disabled, unplugged" </li><li>"Line In/Realtek High Definition Audio/Disabled" </li><li>"Stereo Mix/Realtek High Definition Audio/Disabled" </li></ol>
<p>I tried to follow your suggestion and disabled the "Microphone/Realtek High Definition Audio/Disabled, unplugged". I also plugged back in the line-in jack and left it disabled to see if I reagain started getting sound through the speakers plugged into the
 integrated sound card. When I had my stereo receiver turned off this time, the sound from the TV did not come through to the pc speakers.</p>
<p>However, when I turned on the stereo (with the tv sound plugged into the stereo receiver) the sound started coming through the pc speakers (even thought the line-in jack is still disabled).&nbsp; As a test I also disabled the "Microphone/2 - Microsoft LifeCam-VX
 7000 Default Device"--the sound still continued to come through the speakers.</p>

<h2>            Please help. Windows App &#40;Store&#41; icons keep disappearing, coming up blank in Taskbar&#47;Start etc&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Fresh install of Windows 10x64, although this has happened to me every single time I've installed Windows. It seems to be related to user accounts! The thing that fixed it the first time, was changing my computer name then rebooting. However, soon after
 many icons disappeared again. ie) Skype, Todoist, Windows Store... Most Windows store app icons are just blank. I have tried clearing the icon cache to no avail.<br />
<br />
Anyone figured this out?<br />

            <p>Nathanial, I had not made any changes no. In fact, the issue seems to start occurring on it's own out of nowhere. I have seen other people speaking about having similar problems, often creating a new user will fix the issue. However, I am not going to do
 that; since it would negate all the work I've done in setting up this user account on my desktop.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
I will try the trouble-shooter apps; although I highly doubt they will find anything.
<br />
</p>
<p>Update:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
First Trouble-shooter found no issues.</p>
<p>Second one asked me to turn on UAC, did not fix the missing icons :/</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen error after I enable Virtualization in BIOS</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Dell laptop Latitude E5470 Windows 10 OS.(Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise)</p>
<p>I am in plan of creating virtual machines using Oracle Virtual Manager tool which is installed in my laptop.</p>
<p>While creating VM observed that i am unable to find 64bit option and only i can see 32bit option while creating virtual machine. On research got to know that this is due to Virtualization is disabled.</p>
<p>I tried enabling the Virtualization in BIOS and rebooted laptop but by doing so i came across blue screen error and was unable to start my laptop until i disable it in BIOS settings.</p>
<p>I want virtualization to be enabled so that i can create virtual machine 64bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me out to get the permanent solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking in Advance.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate the details provided in your post. There are cases wherein some settings on your virtual machines needs to be tweaked and at most cases, like what you've performed modify your hardware settings such as your
<strong>BIOS</strong>. We also noticed that what you're using for your computer is a
<strong>Windows 10 Enterprise</strong> thus, we would like to know more information to get you to the correct troubleshooting or the right channel to properly address your concern:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your computer connected to a domain?</li><li>Are you experiencing issues with your <strong>Windows </strong>without using your virtual machine?</li><li>Have you made any hardware changes to your computer aside from installing your virtual machine?</li><li>Are you getting errors when using other desktop apps or modern apps on your computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you start your PC in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-hk/help/4026206/windows-get-to-safe-mode-and-other-startup-settings-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong> for us to isolate
 the issue and see if there would be a need in reverting back the changes you've made on your
<strong>BIOS</strong>.</p>

<p>We appreciate the update. Since your computer is connected to a domain, this would only mean that there is a possibility that there might be some permissions that needs to be amended for you to be able to have those changes be allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases a server might also be a requirement in setting up a virtual machine aside from your hardware. That being said, it would be best to have your concern be posted on our
<strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=win10itpronetworking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet forums</a></strong>. This is so other
<strong>I.T. Professionals</strong> and <strong>Specialists</strong> would be able to&nbsp; provide you with the correct troubleshooting steps in setting up the virtualization for your virtual machine.</p>

            <p>Hello Delaware,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use Windows/Store Update or Microsoft Update to install updates, you may receive error
<strong>0x80070490</strong>, if the Component-Based Servicing (CBS) manifest is corrupted. I guess the problem might be with that particular update. However, suggest you to try the below mentioned troubleshooting steps and see if it fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before doing that, ensure that your laptop Time, Date and Region settings are set accordingly. Go to
<strong>Start /&gt; Settings /&gt; Time &amp; Language </strong>and check the same. If your PC is installed with any third party Antivirus Software or Online Security Software, then ensure that they shouldn't&nbsp;be causing any issues to Windows Updates. If in case problem
 still persist, then try&nbsp;the below troubleshooting steps to see if they fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Use System File Checker to repair damaged Windows files</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the System File Checker tool to repair damaged Windows files. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows logo key + X</strong>, select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Run the "<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>" command by copy/pasting it into the Command prompt(Admin) and hit
<strong>Enter </strong>key.</li><li>Once it complete, try to install updates again to see if they work correctly</li></ol>
<p>For more information about the System File Checker tool, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Run the DISM tool </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem continues, use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to fix Windows Update corruption errors. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows logo key + X</strong>, select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Run the "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth" command by copy/pasting it into the Command prompt(Admin) and hit
<strong>Enter </strong>key</li><li>Once it complete, try to install updates again to see if they work correctly.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Important:</strong> </span>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair
 source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\RepairSource\Windows /LimitAccess</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note </span>Replace the C:\RepairSource\Windows placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference

Windows 7 does not have an inbuilt email program.<br />
<br />
You have to download <a href="http://download.live.com/wlmail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Live Mail</a> which is the successor to Outlook Express<br />

<h2>            Remote Desktop can&#39;t find the computer</h2>
                    I have 2 windows 7 home premium 64 bit computers. One has no problem to use VPN and Remote desktop to connect to my office PC, but another one can VPN, and can ping my office PC, can browse company's internal web site, but remote desktop complains that
 it can't find the computer. I used IP addess in remote desktop, and I can ping the address no problem. How can I diagnose where the problem is? Thanks.

<p>Hi yaomingd,</p>
<p>Your Windows 7 question is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums as it is related to getting connected to Virtual Private Network(VPN). It is better suited for the IT Pro audience on TechNet.</p>
<p><span>Please post your question in the&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itpronetworking/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>TechNet

            <p>Hi Markglass,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the issue confined to Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Were you able to hear sound through Internet Explorer 9 earlier?</p>
<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you make any hardware or software changes on your computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What exactly happens when you try to play online audio or video file in internet explorer, do you get any error message?</p>
<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When exactly do you receive the error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
