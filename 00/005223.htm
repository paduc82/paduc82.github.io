<h2>            Outlook 2016 on Windows 7 - Jump List will open, but nothing happens when clicking list item</h2>
                    <p>A few weeks ago, my jump list was working without issue. &nbsp;Something has happened recently that has disallowed me from using the jump list anymore. &nbsp;It still shows all of the items on the jump list, but when I click any of the items, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Procedure:</p>
<p>- Right-click the pinned program for Outlook.</p>
<p>- Click on any of the items (New Email, Appointment, Meeting, Contact, Task).</p>
<p>- Nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked this process with Outlook both opened and closed. &nbsp;Same results each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've deleted the pinned program and re-pinned it, but that didn't make any difference. &nbsp;I've also deleted the registry key for "LastUILanguage" and it didn't work, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently using Window 7 and Outlook 2016 (It's an O365 ProPlus account, but help menu shows Outlook 2016).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier today I uninstalled Office, restarted my computer, downloaded and installed Office, restarted my computer again. &nbsp;This Windows install is fairly new (within the last 3 months).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only environmental change I can think of is the installation of an antivirus program - Avira. &nbsp;I've removed the software recently to see if that would help, but it hasn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot recall installing any plug-ins or extensions that would have any type of impact on Email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook seems to work fine and I don't see it affecting any other&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can see here that you are having issues using the jump list on Windows 7. We suggest that you launch your Outlook app in safe mode to check if you will encounter the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Press and hold the CTRL key to open an Office application</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Find the shortcut icon for your Office application.</li><li>Press and hold the <strong>CTRL</strong> key and double-click the application shortcut.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> when a window appears asking if you want to start the application in Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
Note:&nbsp;To stop Office Safe Mode, exit and restart your Office application. It will start in normal mode unless there's a problem opening the application.</li></ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Use the /safe option to open an Office application<br />
</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the Start button (lower-left corner) in Windows, and click
<strong>Run</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>outlook /safe</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If you cannot start a Microsoft Office application in Office Safe Mode or you have recurring problems opening applications in normal mode, you can try to repair Office. For more information, go to

<p>Ma. Lau,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened Outlook in Safe Mode, but I didn't notice any difference in performance or function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be clear, previously I was able to right-click the pinned shortcut and create new emails or contacts without even having to open the software by using the jump list / pop-up menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Online Repair tool for Office and the issue still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned previously, I had uninstalled and reinstalled Office, but I understand that the repair tool could have fixed something that wasn't addressed during the install/uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been doing additional research online, but haven't had any luck with finding resolution. &nbsp;From what I've seen in the past, it seems like it might be a registry issue, but I'm not finding what edits I need to make.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

<p>Here's some additional information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have access to pinned files and recent files in other programs:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When I opened a few files in Excel, all recent files show. &nbsp;I can pin a file in Excel and it stays at the top as a pinned file.</li><li>When using Windows Explorer, I can right-click the pinned shortcut on the taskbar and my pinned folders are there, along with recently accessed directories.</li><li>When using Outlook or Teams, I'm unable to activate any of the list items (new mail, new chat, anything "new"), but I can initiate another session of Outlook by clicking the "Outlook" option. &nbsp;Outlook just opens a second time. &nbsp;I don't believe Teams will
 allow for multiple sessions, so I just get a busy icon when I click on Teams.</li></ul>
<p>I'm continuing to do research and test things out, but I'm just not having any luck yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Just to be clear, in explorer you locate outlook.exe, rt click&gt;Pin to Task Bar........ then when rt clicking that shortcut and clicking any New.......... doesn't open that task/item (whether OL is closed or not)</p>
<p>Or Win Key in Programs locate Outlook 2016 shortcut rt click..........etc</p>
<p>(PS the option is not a jump list, as seen in other Office components)</p>

<p>Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are absolutely correct. &nbsp;The shortcut I right-click is the Outlook icon pinned to the taskbar. &nbsp;When I right-click the Outlook icon (with Outlook opened or closed), I get the option to new mail, appointment, contact, etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for pointing out that it's not actually a "jump list". &nbsp;I have been labeling it incorrectly. &nbsp;To me, it seems to operate the same, but I can definitely see how it's an Office feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the shortcut info for the Outlook shortcut on the taskbar:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\OUTLOOK.EXE</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if there's any additional information you need or testing that I can do.</p>

<p>Ma. Lau,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good evening. &nbsp;I had been working on resolving the issue since I posted my question and I believe I have found the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier today, I rebooted my computer. &nbsp;As it was still loading programs, I tried to right-click the pinned Outlook shortcut on my taskbar and choose "New Email". &nbsp;It worked! &nbsp;I waited until all of my other software loaded and tried it again. &nbsp;It failed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I began looking at process running in the background and icon tray and closing programs randomly. &nbsp;I found that when I closed the software for Gladinet Cloud software, I was able to use the context menus. &nbsp;I opened the software; my context menus would stop
 working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why this program would disallow my context menus to stop working in Outlook, but that's the issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I'm not a very technical person, but I am good at guessing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the issue now is getting my Gladinet Cloud software to run without messing with my Outlook context menus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the time being, I'd like to close this ticket. &nbsp;The Gladinet Cloud software is not critical for me, but the context menus are. &nbsp;If you have heard of this issue and have a suggestion, I'd be grateful to hear it. &nbsp;Otherwise, I feel this issue has been
 resolved to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for all who have replied. &nbsp;I have a workaround and I'm more familiar with how things operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

            <p>I had a similar problem with Windows 10 mail not being able to sync emails etc.</p>
<p>I overcame this problem by doing a simple restore back to before the Mail program was working OK.</p>
<p>Everything appears to be working fine again now.</p>
<p>I think one tends to forget how useful the Restore program can be.</p>
<p>You may have to pause your virus program to carry out this restore.</p>

<h2>            IE11 in 8.1 Automatically Minimizes</h2>
                    While visiting any website, the sites appear, everything works, looks good except ... while on any site, the IE window will suddenly minimize. It doesn't crash, the IE tile is visible when I place the mouse in the upper left corner. I&nbsp;can click it to&nbsp;return
 to&nbsp;the page I was viewing. A semi-crash, you might say. Thoughts on how to make this stop ...?

 today. I am still having the same problem. I cannot install the App Troubleshooter on the RT. A reset should be equivalent to Method 2. There are other users experiencing tins problem ... look in the RT 8.1 section of this forum.

    <title>Mail Merge postcards Publisher 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robh80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail Merge postcards Publisher 2013</h2>
                    I use Publisher 2013 to print a lot of postcards for a small business.&nbsp;&nbsp;I never have any issues printing mail merge postcards unless the merge list is large 100+ names.&nbsp;&nbsp; I always print 4 postcards to a page, double sided and go through the mail merge
 steps one by one.&nbsp; The printing on large lists always starts out fine printing on both sides for the first 10 sheets or so, then it starts printing blank sheets until it finishes the list.&nbsp; At first I thought this was a printer problem, so I switched to our
 newer HP printer to my surprise after about 10 sheets, Blank page started coming out again! The printer was still printing as if it was still getting a feed and printing other both sides.&nbsp; My only fix for this so far is to work around it and make my merge
 lists smaller to avoid this issue.&nbsp; Hope you can help with this.&nbsp;

    <title>Sharepoint Online Library with required approval show as read only - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sharepoint Online Library with required approval show as read only when synced.</h2>
                    <p>I am in the process of setting up a Sharepoint online subsite.&nbsp; I've got the document library setup and syncing with Onedrive with no problems both when all revisions are major versions as well as when it uses major and minor versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as soon as I set approval required the synced library becomes read only despite the fact that the user has Full control.&nbsp; Is there any way around this or am I just missing something simple?</p>

<p>Hi Newlyn,<br />
<br />
May I ask what is the Approval Status of the files? When you set approval required for a library, it will add a column like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69003eda-40a5-413d-9516-824788cf0416?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69003eda-40a5-413d-9516-824788cf0416?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For new files just uploaded, if the Approval status is still Pending, only the creator can edit the file and the file is not visible to others. For new versions of old files, if the Approval status is still Pending, others will see the files but will not
 be able to edit it.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>I've tried with both approved files and pending files. All files are created by me and I'm unable to edit them from Windows (I can open them for editing from the web portal no problem).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I set approval required I get a onedrive notification that the site is read only and all files become read only.&nbsp; I will try to update with some screenshots of what I see once some files finish importing.</p>

<p>Hi Newlyn,<br />
<br />
Does this only happen to the local synced folder? What if you open it online then click Edit in Word? Will it give any error messages?<br />
<br />
Besides, could you share a screenshot like this? It's in Library Settings &gt; Versioning Settings:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30eecfde-b34c-4bfc-9c68-f63089372eb9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30eecfde-b34c-4bfc-9c68-f63089372eb9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Please also share the OneDrive Sync Client version with us: Right-click the blue OneDrive icon &gt; Settings &gt; About. The latest version could get here:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/new-onedrive-sync-client-release-notes-845dcf18-f921-435e-bf28-4e24b95e5fc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
New OneDrive sync client release notes.</a> If you are not using the latest, you could download and install the latest version of it.<br />
<br />
You could try to unlink the SharePoint library and sync it again: Right-click the blue OneDrive icon &gt; Settings &gt; Account tab &gt; find the folder and click stop sync.<br />

<p><span><span><span>Hi Niranjan,<br />
<br />
By default all cells in excel are protected or locked, select the cells you</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>want to unlock and go to format, cells, protection and uncheck locked, then</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>go to tools, protection, and protect sheet, enter a password if you want,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>now only the cells that you unlocked<span>&nbsp;
</span>can be edited. Be aware that this</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>protection is very easy to break, the code to do so can be found very easy,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>but it will work for most people .</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you only need a few locked I would select them all first, Ctrl A, then</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>go to format, cells, protection and uncheck locked, then select the cells</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>you want to lock and go to format cells and check locked, the go to tools,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>protection, and protect sheet, enter a password if you want, now the cells</span></span></span></p>

<h3> banu_banu2  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t install nokia pc suite&#59; 6300&#59; driver problem</h2>
                    
<p>OS: Win XP SP3</p>
<p>Phone: Nokia 6300</p>
<p>Nokia PC Suite: ver 7.1.60.0</p>
<p>Nokia OVI Suite: ver 3.0</p>
<p>connecting through miniUSB from Canon manufacturer (please, don't tell me that USB-to-miniUSB cables from different manufacturers are different &nbsp;:)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the previous Nokia installations and programs have been deleted, also the registry has been cleaned up.</p>
<p>When trying to install &nbsp;new version for Nokia PC Suite have gotten a message (tried several times - the result is the same):</p>
<p>"Can't remove the previous version of Nokia PC Suite. &nbsp;Installiation aborted because of an error."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though I can easily install Nokia OVI Suite (the same thing happens with Nokia Software Updater). But (!) when trying to connect the cell phone to PC I get a message: "There are problems trying to install driver."
<strong>So may be the new driver doesn't fit with my 6300. </strong>But where can I get the older one, which would fit &nbsp;well with newly versions of Nokia software? I even went to "Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Hardware Installation" and tried to &nbsp;install manually the
 cell phone. But the yellow "?" was near "Nokia 6300", and also got a massage "Please, reinstall drivers to this device".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia PC Suite ver 6.83.14 and the Connectivity driver that had been installed previously worked well (with this Canon miniUSB cable).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I update software? And can I update cell phone's software using an old version of PC Suite?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I installed the new Nokia PC Suite in the following way:</p>
<p>1. Uninstalled all the previous versions of Nokia software.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Took a disk which came with phone (the old version).</p>
<p>3. Chose: "Install Nokia PC Suite" .</p>
<p>4. In the opened window (after some time of program's "thinking process") there was an inscription: "New version of PC Suite 7.1.40.0 available"; clicked OK. Though, the downloded version was not 7.1.40, but 7.1.60.0.</p>
<p>5. The program downloded the new version and installed it without any problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT after this I still have problems with connectivity of &nbsp;Nokia 6300 to PC by USB cable.</p>

<p>hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; i just bought my nokia C3 last saturday and it was nifty coz of the built in chats it offers, like msn and yahoo,but i encountered bugs from it,there are times that i am not receiving any messages from msn even if im connected to the internet,sometimes
 i need to sign in and out just to make it work but its kinda annoying doing that often,there are moments that it works out fine,but there are times that it's not letting me receive msn messages.there are also a time that it happened when my sister turn the
 wifi off in our house,so i need to reconnect to our wifi and sign back in to msn,but after doing that,phone msn stopped receiving messages eventhough i can send messages.</p>
<p>pls help! :[</p>

</p><p>I have, however, done the following since initially creating the table</p>
<p>1. Renamed if to "WorkRecord4" in Name Manager</p>
<p>2. Added a new column (Month) on the right (was used in a data relationship, which has now been deleted)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>

            <p>Is it definitely not converted to a range because converting back to a range does not remove the formatting with the banded lines and still looks like a table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After converting to a range, when you click in the table range area can you see the Table Tools at the top of the ribbons because this is&nbsp;a good test to determine if it is still a range</p>
<p>
</p><p>After converting to a range, use the Fill icon and set Fill to none and then the column headers font will need to be set to automatic (or another color) because they are usually white font in the table and then cannot be seen when the fill is set to none.</p>

                    Hi, I just bought Surface Pro 6 and installed Windows 10. The AV installed with Windows 10 is Windows Defender. Is this AV good enough for all protections or should I buy a renown AV on the market instead?

            Hi PIBzzz,
<br />Defender is enough.
<br />Moreover, third-party AVs may decrease security.
<br />Please see <a href="https://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/01/disable-your-antivirus-software-except.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/01/disable-yo...</a>

            HI PIB.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Yes, I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br /> If you want the best on-demand scanner install run Malwarebytes free scanner.  In the rare case you get infected with Defender you can turn on Malwarebyte's Real Time Protection which is inexpensive.
<br />
<br />After uninstalling antivirus in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, restart the PC, then type Security in Start Search, open Windows Defender Settings, there and in Windows Defender Security Center fix anything that's flagged.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi PIBzzz,
<br />
<br />Windows 10 now contains a full and competent Security Suite . . .
<br />
<br />Windows Defender has, over the last few years become a fully featured Security solution 
<br />
<br />It is on a par with paid for Anti-virus software, the virus definitions are updated regularly, it will not slow our PC down, works well with Edge and it is Free 
<br />
<br />Defender now has a new feature - Controlled Folder Access, which protects against a ransomware attack
<br />
<br />Honestly, you do not need more protection than Defender can supply . ..

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>Since this issue happened after changing Office 365 password, I'd like to first suggest you clear local cached credential so that you can sign in with the correct credential and check if it works. Here are the steps:<br />
- (Exit OneDrive for Business first)Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>
User Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Credential Manager</strong> &gt; Windows Credentials
<br />
- Remove all Office 365 related credentials here. (E.g. MicrosoftOffice15_Data:orgid:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)<br />
- Try to lauch OneDrive for Business again and sign in with the new credential(whether from browser sync &gt; sync now or right click OneDrive for Business icon in system tray &gt;
<strong>sync a new library</strong> &gt; copy the library URL and paste it here &gt; <strong>
sync now</strong>)</p>
<p>If you still encounter the SOAP error, please refer to the following thread for troubleshooting(Pay attention to Andy's answer that personal Microsoft account is signed in instead of Office 365 account):<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/154/p/424538/1066385#1066385</p>
<p>If the issue persists, we would like to know some information below for further troubleshooting:<br />
1. The version of OneDrive for Business and Office.<br />
In Word, go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account</strong> &gt; <strong>About Word</strong> to get Office version.
<br />
To get OneDrive for Business version, go to <strong>task manager</strong> &gt; <strong>
Microsoft OneDrive for Business</strong> &gt; right click and select <strong>properties</strong> &gt; select
<strong>Details</strong> tab &gt; find <strong>file version</strong>.</p>
<p>2. To identify if this issue is related to specific library, could you verify if this issue happens to other libraries or try syncing the same library from another computer if possible?</p>
<p>We look forward to your reply.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Vincent</p>

<p>My Programs and Features shows only one version of Office installed: Microsoft Office Professional 2016 - en-us.</p>
<p>When I run the Activation Troubleshooter, it displays the following error.&nbsp; I can currently open my Office applications if I cancel the Activation popup shown in my previous message, but I'm concerned about the time limit it displays.&nbsp; So I guess this still
 doesn't solve my problem.</p>

            Did it say the suite was activated after you entered the key? 
<br />
<br />Typically, when you redeem the key for Office 2016 or 2019, you go to office.com/setup, sign in with a microsoft account and enter the key to redeem it and install office.

            <p>Hello Aravinda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue does not occur when sending from my browser using bigpond webmail. The emails arrive&nbsp;at gmail ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails show as sent in the Outlook Sent Items folder and no error messages are received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No notification is received regarding the message not being delivered to the recipient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account is set up as POP3 in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested Outlook in safe mode as suggested and this made no difference. The emails still did not arrive at gmail so I did not disable the add ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking you for your help&nbsp; ---&nbsp; KarraKid</p>

<p>Try these steps one by one:</p>
<p>1. Take out your battery and SIM after turning off your device. Put everything back in after 5- 10 minutes and turn on the phone.</p>
<p>2. Restore Factory settings: Type *#7780# at the standby screen.</p>
<p>3. Format phone memory (WARNING: This might result in loss of data in the phone memory, so back up the contents in your phone memory using PC Suite before you proceed): Type *#7370# at the standby screen.</p>
<p>4. Hard reset: If nothing works, then try this: Turn off your phone, press and hold down the Green (Call) button, * key, 3 key; turn on the phone without releasing the three keys. Release them only after you see the Nokia logo (The lock code is 12345)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the default lock code for Steps 2 &amp;3 is 12345 unless you've changed it at any point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If these steps do not work, then it's time to visit a Nokia Care Point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Good luck :smileyhappy:</p>

<p>You say that the shortcut buttons on the right side of your n73, are light.</p>
<p>In my N82 also, if i forget or let the camera cover open, then the shortcut buttons (the camera, the gallery and the volume shortcut buttons), are light&nbsp;(after some seconds). So, if you let the camera cover open, the keys&nbsp;light.</p>
<p>Sorry if&nbsp;I didn't understand right&nbsp;or if I am wrong.</p>

    <title>Queries in VBA not running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roblloyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Queries in VBA not running</h2>
                    This is really baffling.&nbsp; I have code running with SQL's in the code as well as queries that run in a sequence to update the database from a legacy system.&nbsp; I just noticed that some of the queries are not running.&nbsp; I have put all the code together after
 creating queries and SQL that you all helped me with that inserts data into tables and does all kinds of things and separately everything works fine.&nbsp; When I join all together in the proper sequence, I notice that the data is not being updated.&nbsp; I stepped
 through some of the code and found that one particular append query did not run at all.&nbsp; I got no error alerts or anything. I have ran the process several times and that query for sure is not working.&nbsp; Makes me wonder if any thing else is not actually performing
 as I have created.&nbsp; When I execute that query by just going to the design view and then clicking run, it populates the table correctly.&nbsp; Not in the code.&nbsp; Anyone had this before

            Daniel, it is the database itself.&nbsp; None of the queries run.&nbsp; Last night they ran if I clicked on them individually.&nbsp; Now they don't run at all.&nbsp; I have an old backup database that doesn't have all the updated objects and code and the queries run on that
 one.&nbsp; Somehow, the database is corrupted.&nbsp; I can look at the objects and view the designs and the SQL but they don't run.&nbsp; What is even stranger is some of the code that changes visibility of controls and updates controls that are unbound and such; that code
 is working.&nbsp; But the SQL and the queries don't work.&nbsp; I have never seen anything like this and I worked with a lot of Access databases.&nbsp; Any suggestions.&nbsp; I finished this part of the database last night and wanted to send in for testing today.&nbsp; Good thing
 I didn't.

            <p>Rob, without seeing your code we cannot tell what is going on. When you run an Action query directly, it should tell you (unless you have Warnings turned off) that it will affect x # of records. It will then tell you whether those records were affected.
 If nothing at all happens, then you may have warnings turned off.</p>

            <p>Well I really feel like a fool....lol...I did realize before you posted that I did have the Warnings Off at the beginning of the process and forgot to turn them back on.&nbsp; So when I clicked on the run, it looked like nothing was happening.&nbsp; Then, the reason
 that there was nothing happening is because the table that I had joined on to do the append had no records.&nbsp; The records were to be populated from an SQL statement that I had in the process and I was referring to the wrong table in that part of the process.&nbsp;

<p>Rob, you would do well to remove the SetWarnings commands from your code entirely, then covert all your RunSQL commands to CurrentDB.Execute "&lt;query name&gt;", dbFailOnError.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a large number of queries to run, I would suggest using an array and a single call to CurrentDB.Execute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Function RunUpdates() As Boolean</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error GoTo Err_Process</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const MAXROWS = 9<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strQueries(MAXROWS) As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim intRow As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim blnReturn As Boolean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blnReturn = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strQueries(0) = "app_GovDepartment"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strQueries(1) = "app_GovOrganization"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strQueries(2) = "app_Ref_AnnuitantIndicator"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strQueries(3) = "app_Ref_BargainUnitStatus"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strQueries(4) = "app_Ref_EducationLevel"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strQueries(5) = "app_Ref_EmployeeType"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strQueries(6) = "app_Ref_FTPStatus"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strQueries(7) = "app_Ref_GeoStateFed"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strQueries(8) = "app_Ref_GeoCityFed"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strQueries(9) = "app_Ref_InstructionProgram"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For intRow = 0 To MAXROWS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.Execute strQueries(intRow), dbFailOnError<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next intRow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

            We're all human. I've committed similar errors in my time. But the behavior certainly did indicate Warnings were disabled. I tend to use CurrentDB.Execute instead of RunSQL because it doesn't require Warnings to be turned off. However, then ever I set
 Warnings off, I also add a line to turn them back on immediately. Then I add my code in between the two.

            <p>That sounds like a good idea however some of my queries are actually query objects instead of just SQL in the subs.&nbsp; Thanks for the replies.</p>

            Wow...I am learning more and more about working with VBA.&nbsp; I will definitely work on using this code.&nbsp; Didn't know you could write the queries in this manner.&nbsp; I have been using Docmd.OpenQuery for all of them and in some instances the query stays open
 so I have to put Docmd.Close in there as well.&nbsp; Will this set them up so they just ran in the background and not actually open.&nbsp; Someone else suggested using RunSql but I didn't know how to write the syntax.&nbsp; Thanks so much.

<p>Yes, using currentdb.execute will cause your queries to run silently unless an unhandled error occurs.&nbsp; Glad to be of help.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start and Key-problems</h2>
                    I installed W10 on a Desktop in our Company to test it. Joined Domain etc. But after a while the start (Windows) button doesn't worked only the context menu with the right click. I installed the Desktop about 6 times to Trouble shoot this- Domain Join
 GPOs logon scripts etc.--&nbsp;&nbsp;but I didn't find a clue. The next Problem is the activation key, I was not able to activate it. So it was not possible to install new Features. By the way I trid the german and the english Version of Win10, always the same. The
 last Thing I tried to install .NET 3.5 so I can use a few of our corporate application, but the Installation Fails a few time. So I stopped all of my testings and waiting for the next Beta Release. Hope it comes soon.

    <title>Read Aloud - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Read Aloud</h2>
                    I'm currently using Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016.&nbsp; I have been using the "Read Aloud" feature under the "Review" tab in Microsoft word for quite some time to review my papers for school.&nbsp; However, after writing a paper today, I went to click
 on "Read Aloud" and the icon was gone.&nbsp; I made sure my product was up to date, I restarted the computer and then added "Read Aloud" back into the ribbon (which I don't know why it was gone in the first place), but now I can't click on it.&nbsp; It's like it no
 longer works.&nbsp; Any advice?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that some settings were accidentally changed, causing the "Read Aloud" feature to stop working. We suggest using the
<strong>Speak</strong> feature instead by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch <strong>Word</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>File</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Options</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Customize Ribbon.</strong></li><li>Select <strong>All commands </strong>from the drop-down under <strong>Choose Commands From.
</strong></li><li>Choose <strong>Speak</strong> from the list of commands.</li><li>Select the <strong>Custom Group</strong> that you created for the <strong>Review</strong> tab on the right column and click
<strong>Add</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Once <strong>Speak</strong> has been added to the Review tab, highlight the text that you want, then click the
<strong>Speak</strong> icon to use it. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the Speak feature works after following these steps.</p>
        </p>

            Thank you for your response.&nbsp; The speak feature does work.&nbsp; I'm not sure what settings I would have accidentally changed causing Read Aloud to stop working.&nbsp; I never adjust the settings.&nbsp; Just wondering, does Read Aloud no longer work on Word?

<p>In Version 1710 Build 8625.2055, the Read Aloud feature does work here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that the registry entry that connects the Read Aloud command in your Word to the text-to-speech engine may be missing or corrupted. Try

repairing Office</a>, which would rewrite the registry entries if they're damaged.</p>
