    <title>E66 date and time resets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tajio---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            E66 date and time resets</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all, in the last couple of months I've noticed that when I power off my E66 then turn it on again, the date and time needs to be entered again.&nbsp; Now, it's not very often that you usually need to turn a phone off, but the E66 is known to have the phone
 log problem (which I'm not immune to) which means I need to power off the phone quite frequently.&nbsp; Needless to say, I'm starting to get fed up with this mobile&nbsp;:smileymad:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have tried hard reset and a firmware update without success (I'm now on 300.21.012).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't remember this being a problem since purchasing the phone in Aug 08 - unless I took the battery out which makes sense.&nbsp; Unfortunately this means the phone is just out of the warranty period. SIGH!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've looked through menu after menu and can't find a setting that may help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            installing the latest firmware, so check for firmware updates and install if available.
<p>2. If firmware update is not available you can reformat the phone using the *#7370# reset. This basically returns the phone to the state it was in out of the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Always remember to backup yor phone to both memory card and by using pcsuite before attempting any updates or resets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that you have to set the time everytime the battery runs out usually means the auxilliary battery is faulty. This battery is different to the main battery and is inside the phone. It keeps the clock going when the main battery runs out or is removed.
 The auxilliary can only be replaced at a Nokia Care Point.</p>

            Thanks for the reply - what you say makes sense, but the time and date resets even when the main battery is full.&nbsp; Does the phone utilise the aux battery even when the other battery is charged and in place?

<p>no the aux battery is for time only and if its gone its gone<br />
<br />
1. Get the Auxiliary battery replaced at your nearest Nokia Care Centre<br />
2. Set the clock to auto update. This is not a proper solution and the phone will only give you correct time after it downloads the correct time from your network. providing your network supports this feature</p>

<p>Cheers, just tried a reset and it hasn't helped.&nbsp; Need to get a back up phone before I send this off as there is no local Nokia Care centre...&nbsp; Vodafone here in NZ doesn't support network time unfortunately.&nbsp; Hmmm might just get a replacement :smileyindifferent:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
That's wierd - I just did a content restore and the time and date remained (after the phone did a self reset). It looked like a normal power down and start up but perhaps its not??</p>

    <title>Lack of Cursor Control to Edit Header or Footer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevinciotta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lack of Cursor Control to Edit Header or Footer</h2>
                    I can start and/or access a header or footer in Word for Mac 2011 documents by double-clicking in the appropriate place at the top or bottom. However, once I am in the header or footer, after I type text --- or when I try to edit existing text --- my cursor
 immediately returns to the left-most position in the header or footer. This makes it impossible to make any changes.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is also happening in Word for Mac 2008. I have to go back to Word for Mac 2004 if I want to work with headers and footers! Thoughts?</div>

            OK, so we need you to click your "Show/Hide" button ¬∂ which is on the Standard toolbar. &nbsp;This will reveal the control characters so you can see what you are doing.
<div><br />
<div>Each header and each footer behaves like a document within the main document. &nbsp;The position of the cursor is controlled by the properties of the objects you see in the header or footer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you're in a paragraph, we need you to tell us which style is applied to that paragraph, and what the formatting properties of that style are.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If it's a table, we need to know what the Cell Alignment properties are, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When you first go anywhere in a Word document, what you see is not "blank", it's "empty". &nbsp;If it were "blank" like a sheet of paper you could write in the middle and your writing would stay in the middle, because the paper would keep it there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But a Word document or Header is "empty" like a bucket. &nbsp;Whatever you put in there will fall to the bottom and sit on top of whatever else is in there. &nbsp;In a document, whatever you type rises to the top left corner and sits below and to the right of whatever
 else is up there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The thing that causes text to depart from the top left corner is the Formatting Properties of whatever object you are typing in.</div>
<div><br />
<div>We can help you further once we know what is already in that header, and what its formatting properties are.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>

<h2>            Office Starter 2010. Created Word Document and Track Changes came on automatically.  How do I turn it off&#63;</h2>

                    <span>
<p>I have a new Windows 7 machine. &nbsp;Was pleasantly surprised to see Office 2010 Starter edition installed on it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Opened a word document I had created in Microsoft Word 2003 on another computer. &nbsp;It looked fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Edited the file. &nbsp;No problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Saved the file with edits to PDF. &nbsp;No problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Closed the file. &nbsp;No problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Reopened the file. &nbsp;Now track changes are on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Could not find a way to turn off track changes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Read that track changes is not supported in starter edition. &nbsp;Have no problem with this, but wondering how to turn it off, and wondering how it got turned on in the first place.</p>

<p>AFAIA, you cannot turn it on or off in the Starter edition because it doesn‚Äôt support TT. You can't even do it through VBA because there's no VBA editor either.</p>
<p>But it is really bizarre why it has happened. I did read of a similar incident a couple of weeks back.</p>

<h2>            Request to include Lumia 920</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Team,</p>
<p>I have my Lumia 920 since 2012, issued by my company as a business tool for me to do my work more effectively.</p>
<p>Last month, March 2017, I noticed that FB messenger had stopped working on my phone and that I need to upgrade it to Windows 10 to continue enjoying the apps, but too bad, my phone is not listed on the Windows phones which can be upgraded.</p>
<p>May I know why? Can you do something about this to include it in your list? I love this phone and I don't want to let it go yet, at least for another year or so.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

    <title>Outlook won&#39;t connect to Exchange account if a personal Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wwejason  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook won&#39;t connect to Exchange account if a personal Office 365 account exists</h2>
                    <div>I've now run into the same issue twice with different users at different clients. The scenario in both cases is as follows:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The company uses on premise Exchange 2013.</div>
<div>The end user creates a Microsoft Account using their Exchange email address.</div>
<div>The user creates a trial or goes ahead and purchases Office 365 Home simply for the software license for home usage.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>While outside of the office, trying to add the user's Exchange account to a newer version of Outlook (i.e., Outlook 2016 or Outlook 365) results in Outlook asking for the password over and over again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Something occurs when the user adds Office 365 Home to their 'personal' Microsoft Account that basically prevents newer versions of Outlook from finding the Exchange server and successfully connecting to their account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>While in the office, Outlook has no issue connecting to Exchange. Outside the office, Outlook only wants to connect to 365. Even if I choose the option to manually setup the account and click on Exchange as the account type.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I discovered this was the issue by looking at Credential Manager in Control Panel. After trying entering the password a number of times, I looked in Credential Manager and saw that it had saved a credential for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. The company,
 again, does not use Office 365 at all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In troubleshooting this, it might sound like a DNS problem. Running an Outlook Autodiscover or Outlook Connectivity test at Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer (MCRA) results in all green checkmarks with no issues found. All test results point to the
 company's Exchange server. And of course no other users have any trouble with using or setting up Outlook outside of the office.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Further, when I discovered this problem with the second user, I accessed the 'personal' Microsoft Account (MA) setup against the work email address. I found that he had a personal email address setup as his default sign-in and the work email address on
 the account simply as a backup address. I removed the work email address from the account. I again tried to setup Outlook against the Exchange account and it WORKED RIGHT AWAY!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So the question is:&nbsp; Why is Outlook ignoring AutoDiscover for the domain and instead trying to add the Exchange account as if it were an actual corporate Office 365 account?</div>
                </div>

            It‚Äôs related to direct connect - this is to make it easier to set up outlook. See if the registry key at <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/office-365/directconnect-office-365/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/office-365/directconn...</a> stops it. <br /><br />For best results, the users shouldn‚Äôt use their work address as an alias, but setting it as a recovery address shouldn‚Äôt affect this.  (I use my office 366 business address as my recovery address. )<br /><br /> --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The link I posted above is to my personal site and is safe to use, however, I am required to add the following disclaimer when  posting on this forum:<br /><br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website.

<h2>            Microsoft Teams Custom Permissions</h2>
                    <p>I just started exploring Teams and I love it, but is there a way to customize the "member" permissions, or make a new permission group? In my situation, I would like my members to be able to invite external users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Max3060,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you mean you want the detailed steps to add guest (external users) to your teams? Please refer to the followings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Sign into Office 365 with admin authentication. Then navigate to Microsoft 365 Admin Center&gt; Settings&amp; add-ins&gt; Microsoft Teams and turn Microsoft Teams on for Guest as the following picture shows.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6833c58f-8787-40e0-8040-fd32ac90b51f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6833c58f-8787-40e0-8040-fd32ac90b51f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>2. Then you can go to the Teams &amp; Skype for Business admin center to turn on guest access to Microsoft Teams and manage guest access in Teams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you want your members to be able to invite external users. Please kindly note that only the Owner of the team have the permission to invite external users. You need to invite external yourself or make your members as the owners of the

<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>First try clearing the Temporary Internet Files from Internet Options&gt; General&gt; Browsing history&gt; Delete.</p>
<p>If unsuccessful with that step, try resetting IE settings.<br />
With the warning that a reset will delete AutoComplete data, such as<br />
passwords and you will have to reinstall or re-enable browser add-ons, use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings button (Internet Options&gt; Advanced.)<br />
<br />
What a reset of IE settings will do:<br />
Reset Internet Explorer settings [Windows 7]: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hope this helps,<br />

<p>hi eddy,</p>
<p>thanks for your consistent patience. after doing more tests and research, i found that it‚Äôs not feasible to refresh data in a workbook like the one you created in a browser window. below is the detailed explanation:</p>
<p>first, i followed your steps and created a workbook similar to yours. i&nbsp; could refresh the data locally as you did. after&nbsp; uploading this workbook to a sharepoint library, i inserted it into a page in sharepoint site using excel web access web part as you
 did. <br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6c0a0abd-6073-4f1c-a7ef-040d3350bf01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6c0a0abd-6073-4f1c-a7ef-040d3350bf01" /></a><br />
when i tried refreshing the data, i got the same error message:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=36b65f3f-5970-480d-a42a-364588a704fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d36b65f3f-5970-480d-a42a-364588a704fe" /></a></p>
<p>after searching online, i‚Äôve found this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/comparing-excel-services-and-excel-web-app-sharepoint-2013-855ee1a3-9263-425d-bccd-4070d2413aa7?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
comparing excel services and excel web app (sharepoint 2013)</a> and the information below in it:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=36b65f3f-5970-480d-a42a-364588a704fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d36b65f3f-5970-480d-a42a-364588a704fe" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f480d765-db81-4a7e-a6bb-9bf7f2ac75ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df480d765-db81-4a7e-a6bb-9bf7f2ac75ba" /></a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>so i went to sharepoint online and checked the url of the excel file i inserted in the excel web access web part:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=943a33d9-a48d-47e8-9fde-e9387e9b1e45" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d943a33d9-a48d-47e8-9fde-e9387e9b1e45" /></a></p>
<p>seems excel web access web part uses the excel web app as the article mentions above and when power pivot&nbsp; refreshes data, it will use data model.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a03e6a1f-8f93-472f-9578-83d2800c2e9f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da03e6a1f-8f93-472f-9578-83d2800c2e9f" /></a></p>

<h2>            Power point footers keep changing on reset</h2>
                    <p>Hi People, Im working on Mac 365 Office</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with creating footer styles that stay correct and true to the slide master settings</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The issue is as follows:</strong></p>
<p>I have a slide master of about 20 or so slides and 2 of the slide backgrounds are dark, so I would like the footers to be white.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made the footers white Arial on the dark master and apply the footers in the slides - all OK, even when I reset slide all stays correct.</p>
<p>When I save and close the file and then reopen, the slide appears to be fine, but when I reset the slide the font becomes black Calibri, even though there is no other fonts on the slide master.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have about 15 other templates for different business units with the same master slide configuration, with a couple of dark background - while some of these work with no issue when resetting the slide. I even copy the OK footer elements over to the problem
 slide deck the issue still continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone shine some light on my issue please</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can understand the situation at your end and sorry for that, when we tested at our end in PowerPoint version 16.21 (Build 190115) on macOS version 10.14.2, the font of Footer didn‚Äôt change in the slides (Normal view) when we click on the reset after reopen
 of presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps we followed:</p>
<p>1. Created a Slide master with few slide layouts.</p>
<p>2. And Font used for the footer in Slide master is Arial, and the slide layouts also uses the Arial as footer font.</p>
<p>3. Added black background for some slide layouts with text color as white.</p>
<p>4. After doing certain changes, close the Master view and switch back to Normal view.</p>
<p>5. Created some new slide using slide layouts created under slide master.</p>
<p>6. Close and saved it.</p>
<p>7. Reopened the presentation, selected slide and click on the Reset (where there are no changes taken place)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, tested by changing the font of footer in slide master, as the changes are applied all slide layouts under slide master.</p>
<p>

<p>To move further, can you please provide the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Your PowerPoint version.</p>
<p>Open PowerPoint&gt; PowerPoint&gt; About PowerPoint.</p>
<p>2. Your macOS version.</p>
<p>Click on Apple icon&gt; About Mac.</p>
<p>3. Provide the problematic presentation via <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox?tm=1548935937161">

<p>This should make sure your content package (*#0010#) is at the same version as your firmware (*#0000#). Furthermore, if that SMS thing continues it might be normal for your network operator. Which one do you use, actually?</p>

            <p>So i just figured it out, so i made the subscription a separate transaction so that 1 client can subscribe only once.</p>
<p>Then a create a statement table to relate with client.</p>
<p>I want 1 client can have many statement, how do i relate this ??</p>
<p>(note: there is no relation with subscription)...</p>

<p>Your version is significantly out of date... 16.10 (or later) is the present level. Use
<strong>Help&gt; Check for Updates</strong> in either Office program to obtain the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, confirm that your macOS is current &amp; check the printer mfr's support site to see if there is a newer driver and/or firmware revision for your model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another consideration is that not all printers will print edge-to-edge or will do so only for
<em>photo</em> printing. You may have to make a settings change in the Print dialog.</p>

<h3> duchess of kent  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia Icon 929 vs 930</h2>
                    <p>I hope someone can help me with this. My Icon is on the blink. I am not ready to buy a different phone, plus cannot lock myself into another contract right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only phones I can find, are the original Icon's which are 8.0 or the 930's (8.1) which were made specifically for Europe. I have read reviews good and bad about the 930's. I know they can be used with any network over there. I have Verizon so would still
 have to get a phone with the same provider.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question: does anybody know if the upgrade from 8.0 - 8.1 - 10 is still available.&nbsp; Or is the 8.1 - 10 available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do not want to go back to 8.0 or 8.1.&nbsp; I love my Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you ask why I do not get a 950 or 950 XL, they cannot be used with Verizon, sadly they are AT&amp;T only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am holding out for the overlay of Windows 10 functionality on Android.&nbsp; Then I will get a new contract.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

            All versions of onenote  should have Insert menu &gt; Symbols. If you need other symbols you can copy from the Windows character map if using the browser version.
<br />
<br />In the desktop and universal app, you can enter the Unicode codes and press alt+x. for example 00ff Alt+x will convert it to ≈∏ (type the 0's on the number row)

</p><p>I know&nbsp;I can embed an Excel workbook&nbsp;in a Word document;&nbsp;worksheet 1 is the pie chart and worksheet 2 is the data sheet, then by selecting the&nbsp;pie chart worksheet it will display&nbsp;on p.1 of the Word document. And, I can embed a second Excel workbook on p.2
 of the Word document displaying the data sheet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What I cannot solve is&nbsp;how to force Word p.1 with a single worksheet pie chart,&nbsp;Word p.2 with a single worksheet data sheet, and update the pie chart when values change in the data sheet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, Thomas</p>

<p>This kind of thing used to be possible in Word 2000, just about (I just went back and tried it, to be sure)&nbsp; but as far as I can remember, it was always a bit shaky. I do not think it has worked at all since around Word XP or 2003.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the only viable workaround is actually to have an external Excel file, not an embedded one, and create two separate links to the data and the chart in your document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To attempt the embedded approach, what you would do is</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. embed a worksheet on p.2 of the document, containing (say) a Sheet1 with the data, and a Sheet2 with the chart</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. ensure that the Sheet1 data is what Word displays</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. select and copy the chart (ctrl-C)</p>
<p>&nbsp;d. In Word, click out of the embedded object, click in page 1, then</p>
<p>&nbsp;e. Paste Special-&gt;Paste Link to insert a LINK to the chart inside the embedded object.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That actually works in Word 2016 - you do get a LINK field that shows the chart. But when you try to update it, Word cannot findthe linked object, despite the fact that all the necessary information to identify the object is actually in the document.</p>

    <title>Outlook not sending messages on slow network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amusser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook not sending messages on slow network</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Outlook at work for several years now without any issues, but recently moved to a home office with DSL internet (max of 12mpbs), and Outlook routinely seems to lose synchronization with Exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Outlook 2013 with a single Exchange account. When I first open up Outlook in the morning, I can usually send a few emails fine, but after Outlook has been open for 5 or more minutes every message that I attempt to send gets stuck in the Outbox.
 Here's the full sequence of what I've observed:</p>
<p>1. I hit the Send button.</p>
<p>2. Message is sent to Outbox folder.</p>
<p>3. When I check the Outbox folder, the message subject is still bold and italicized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Outlook says it is 'CONNECTED TO: MICROSOFT EXCHANGE' in the bottom right corner of the app.</p>
<p>5. If I hover over the Outlook icon in the task tray, I see that it has a little hourglass appended to the icon, and the following text appears: 'Microsoft Outlook is requesting data from the server'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. If I try to open the message in the Outbox folder by double-clicking it, I get the following error message: 'Sorry, we're having trouble opening this item. This could be temporary, but if you see it again you might want to restart Outlook. Outlook has
 already begun transmitting this message'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook will hang indefinitely in this state, and once it's hung it will neither send nor receive any new messages. The only solution I've found thus far is to close Outlook, and re-open. The messages then once again will send fine for a few minutes (including
 the one(s) that was stuck in the Outbox previously), and after these few minutes are up we're locked up once again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most helpful clue in my opinion here is that this does not occur anywhere except in my home office, so it must somehow be related to my ISP. It does not seem like it could be a blocked port, though, or else nothing would ever get out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help? I've scoured online forums and tried many approaches, and although many people have a similar problem none of the suggested solutions have helped (nor have I found an identical problem posting).</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Re-start the PC, then when fully loaded, start Outlook using the safe switch (Hold the Ctrl Key when starting OL) see if it then functions OK</p>
<p>If it does then likely its outlook add-ons causing the problem, eg Integrated anti-virus, sync utilities etc</p>

 noticed there was a folder "McAfee Anti-Spam".&nbsp; I did not open the folder that had about 300 deleted emails marked as Spam.&nbsp; I did not consider most of the emails as Spam.&nbsp; Should I uninstall and reinstall Office 365?&nbsp; Is that possible? Will it resolve the

            &gt;&gt; my Outlook icon had a red circle with a "x" on it, mail stopped coming in.
<br />That sounds like the offline indication - look on the Send/Receive tab - is the work offline button highlighted? if so, click it so its not highlighted. 
<br />
<br />
<br />At some point, you had MacAfee installed and the antispam addin was filtering your mail. You can delete the Spam folder as long as the addin is disabled. 
<br />
<br />You'll need to unistall MacAfee completely, reboot then repair office. (Repairing office may not be necessary, but the quick repair is fairly fast.)  
<br />
<br />If the program won't uninstall you'll need to use the removal tool linked here: <a href="https://service.mcafee.com/webcenter/portal/cp/home/articleview?articleId=TS101331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://service.mcafee.com/webcenter/portal/cp/...</a>

<p>Kelly, thanks so much!!&nbsp; After purchasing an HP Envy with Windows 8.1 and Internet Explorer 11, I had nothing but trouble with slow loading, sticky web pages.&nbsp; In particular, my Hotmail and Facebook accounts were a nightmare to deal with.&nbsp; After researching
 this, and trying some ineffective strategies, I did an online chat with HP and allowed them remote access to my PC.&nbsp; When the HP agent was not achieving success, I had him&nbsp;uninstall the SimplePass, and presto, magic, back to high speed loads.</p>
