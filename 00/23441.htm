<h2>            Rotate a photo in a PowerPoint Table Cell</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to rotate photos in a powerpoint table cell so they display properly, that is, right-side-up instead of sideways?</p>

            <p>It looks like the image was rotated BEFORE being inserted. Some photo programs used to rotate images incorrectly (ie they looked rotated in the program but were not really.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could maybe try adding the image to the slide first. Rotate to correct. COPY and then in the table choose picture fill and click CLIPBOARD. Looks like you will get a distorted image as it will fill the cell.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Project 2016 Crashes</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently installed Microsoft Project 2016 and on my first time of using it, whenever I go into the resources menu and click on assign resources, the screen comes up but then Project stops working and restarts.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the program and tried to fix it in the control panel.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>I am not happy considering I paid for the product and you expect it to work.</p>

            <p>I have been on the phone with various members of Microsoft sales and support with no success and I am more than just unhappy. No one will address the problem from beginning to end. When I asked how can I reach the complaint department I was told by Microsoft
 sales and support there isn't one. &nbsp;As a long time customer I am very dissatisfied. Everyone I have spoken with, English was their second language. &nbsp;A couple times I got disconnect and the person I was talking too did not return my call. I had to start the
 process all over. Not helpful. It seem Microsoft has gotten so big it no longer needs to provide professional customer support. Is Microsoft saying they no longer need the average person's business. My time is just as valuable as yours. Over a week trying
 to resolved this problem with no success.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>WendellLilly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much that you describe above is the same in my case too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem to me that, since the beginning of time, MS has kept their Project software an "orphan."&nbsp; It has never been quite "adopted" within their MS Office suite products (WORD, EXCEL, etc.).&nbsp; It seems they kind of want to keep in in their "back room"
 for some reason or other.&nbsp; To be a MS support person or team for Project 2016&nbsp; must seem to be&nbsp;tantamount to a&nbsp;assignment to Mars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found&nbsp;my personal solution to the problems with Project 2016 yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I grew up on Primavera Project Planner which is now part of Oracle.&nbsp; This past weekend, I decided to switch back to Primavera by buying a subscription to their Primavera P6 Professional Project Management software, Release 15 R2.&nbsp; It loaded seamlessly in
 Windows 10.&nbsp; The only call I made to them was about Oracle's initial downloading process.&nbsp; The&nbsp;woman I spoke with was friendly, spoke English as a first language, and was very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Primavera P6 is a more technical program than Project 2016 and there is a bit of a learning curve for newcomers.&nbsp; And, yes, the Primavera p6 software is pricey, but so is my time.&nbsp; The bottom line is that I am going back to a project scheduling software&nbsp;environment
 that I am comfortable in and quit fighting the complex MS labyrinth for an answer to its Project 2016 woes.</p>

            <p>I'm having a similar situation.&nbsp; I'm running the company's Office 2013 and installed a copy of Project 2016 Professional for testing.&nbsp; While I can add resources if I choose Active Directory, if I choose to add them from the Address Book it immediately crashes
 with an Access Denied error from <span>AppVIsvSubsystems32.dll</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've confirmed Outlook 2013 is my default app, there were&nbsp;no corresponding entries in the Security log (other than registry queries), tried while Outlook is running or closed,&nbsp;and even tried running Project as Administrator all with the same result.&nbsp; I'm
<em>hoping</em> it's related to some kind of GPO configuration of Outlook, but it is quite disheartening to 1.) not receive enough information on what denied access and 2.) having the application crash when access is denied rather than simply informing me of
 the results.</p>

</p><p>I'm not sure what it was looking for or why it wants to do this but possibly it's related to the issue you're having?</p>

            <p>Same issue. &nbsp;Project Pro 2016 on Win 10 was working great, now if I navigate to the File &gt; Open (or any other command from that panel) Project shuts down. &nbsp;I've repaired it, I've uninstalled every other Office App I can think of, I only had Visio 2013 installed
 and that has been removed. &nbsp;I've uninstalled Project 2016 and reinstalled it twice and still, shuts down as soon as anything on the File panel is selected!</p>
<p>Only thing that changed is updating one of the MANY system updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: If I open an existing project file I have no issues. &nbsp;I can even complete a File&gt;Save As operation with no issue, but File&gt;New, or File&gt;Open results in the app shutting down.</p>

    <title>The Pros And Cons of Microsoft Security Essentials. What Are - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackplatt  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Pros And Cons of Microsoft Security Essentials.  What Are Yours&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Answers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very interested in community feedback regarding the following: Pros and Cons of Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The Pros:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Lightweight-</strong>There are very few system resources used compared to other anti-virus and malware scanners.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Auto-Updates</strong>-You don't have to do anything, It runs in the background and keeps its mouth shut.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>No Ads or Promotion Pop-Ups</strong>-The other companies always have these toaster pop-ups trying to get you to update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>No Add-On Prompts During Installation-</strong>You don't have to opt-out to prevent some tool bar, mini-browser, or other junk from installing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The Cons:</span></strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>No Control Over Exact Timing For Updates</strong>-Because MSE relies on Windows Updates in conjunction with data from the Microsoft Security Center and other sources such as IE's Smart Screen Filter, there is a strong Windows Network integration
 with the product. However, users have no control over exactly when the product will update. You have to "check to make sure."</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Scanning Interval is unreliable and sometimes does not work- </strong>
The default 2am scan time is extremely approximated! My own experience has shown scans to start around 1:30am to as late as close to 3am. If you are using your computer during that time, the scan will be missed, I once changed it to "Daily Scan" but the scan
 did not pick up, so I went back to the Sunday 2am default. It's like MSE scans "When it feels like it." The timing interval could be improved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If Updates are missed it can take up to 48 hours (some have said 72 hours) before they are force downloaded-</strong> Supporters of MSE have said that it is OK for MSE to be out of date for a few days, and when a new threat is found any time before
 that 48 hour forced update, MSE will force a new definitions download. My concern is, wouldn't that be too late if the threat has already compromised a users' PC or data? Maybe several daily definition updates may be old school, but are customers really getting
 MSE updates at least once a day? I either reboot my system once a day OR shut down giving it a six hour or more rest each night. On any cold boot or restart MSE should be connecting to its servers and downloading those updates regardless of the day or time
 interval of last system check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>No Notice of New Features in MSE Program Updates-</strong> Microsoft, likely for security reasons, does not publish a list of bug fixes or security ehancements with new releases of MSE. Users could benefit from a list of enhancments from version
 to version, bug fixes, and any bugs that are still being evaluated by Micorsoft. Hope others can contribute to this discussion!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jack &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>I recommend Microsoft Security Essentials for the pros you listed above. Eversince I started using it in March of 2010 I have installed it on at least 10 PCs and activated Windows Defender on 2 Windows 8 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I don't have any problems with the cons you mentioned. For one thing, I only scan about 3 or&nbsp;so times per year, and I don't pay attention to MSE all that much anyway, so I don't notice anything about updates or anything new.</p>

            <p>Yes, sometimes, MSE will miss the 24 hr update interval. But I find that it updates itself the next time you turn on (or restart, wake up from standby, logging-on, etc) the machine. What you describe happens in older versions, not in version 4.x.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having old signatures is only an issue if you're not connected to the Internet. MSE through DSS fetches dynamic signatures from the cloud. For example, you're one update late. The old update installed doesn't detect a new threat. The newer update on server
 can detect it. If you're connected to the Internet, MSE will fetch that new, exact signature for that threat from the cloud. That dynamic signature will be erased when MSE updates.</p>

            Usually through droppers you get from dodgy sites. It's either given to you from a deceptive download or was delivered by a page ad or pop-up. Detecting those types of threat is touchy for MS. They need to change their criteria. They're indecisive on the
 matter. Is Mr. Laudanski still with MS? And that fakeav expert with a blog from like 7+ years ago? They should help MMPC modify their criteria.<br />

    <title>Insert a chapter after the endnotes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sub212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insert a chapter after the endnotes</h2>
                    
<p>I have to have my endnotes as a chapter of my book, and have to insert a chapter AFTER those endnotes.</p>
<p>according to http://www.ehow.com/how_3391266_add-information-after-endnote-word.html</p>
<p>this is method:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start Microsoft Word 2007 and open a document that needs additional information after the endnote.</p>
</li><li>
<div>Step <span>2</span></div>
<p>Point the cursor in the main area of your document that contains the endnote and click to place your insertion point there.</p>
</li><li>
<div>Step <span>3</span></div>
<p>Select the "References" tab at the top of the Word 2007 screen, if necessary, to display the References ribbon. Click the button that is depicted by a small half box with an arrow beside it in the very bottom right of the "Footnotes" section. The "Footnote
 and Endnote" dialog box will appear on the screen.</p>
</li><li>
<div>Step <span>4</span></div>
<p>Choose the "Endnotes" radio button from the "Location" section of the "Footnote and Endnote" dialog box.</p>
</li><li>
<div>Step <span>5</span></div>
<p>Click the drop-down menu to the right of the "Endnotes" radio button and click "End of Section" from the list of options.</p>
</li><li>
<div>Step <span>6</span></div>
<p>Select the "Apply" button at the bottom right of the "Footnote and Endnote" dialog box to apply the change. Select the "Cancel" button from the dialog box to close the box instead.</p>
</li><li>
<div>Step <span>7</span></div>
<p>Create a new section after the endnote and before the page break. You can now enter your additional information after the endnote but before the end of the page.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>BUT: Since I have to have different numbering styles, and the numbering to commence with "1" in each chapter, I have entered a section break after each chapter.</p>
<p>This means that now my references are dispersed throughout the document (at the end of each chapter), and sequentially numbered throughout the document.</p>
<p>If I want to have them all in a specific chapter, without removing section breaks, how could I do that?</p>

            <div>You have to suppress the endnotes in the sections where you do not want them to appear; see

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Assuming you will want to have some dividing titles between the notes for each chapter, this can be handled by creating a new paragraph before the first endnote for each chapter (press Enter before the endnote reference mark in the note). Note that, while
 you can apply a heading style to these paragraphs if you like, headings in the endnotes section will not appear in the TOC.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I understand the question, you want your endnotes numbered beginning with 1 at the end of each section. In the References tab, click the launcher at the bottom right of the Footnotes section (looks like an arrow pointing southeast).</p>
<p>Under Location, click Endnotes, and choose End of section.</p>
<p>Set the Number format: as desired.</p>
<p>Set Numbering: to Restart each section.</p>
<p>Set Apply changes to: Whole document.</p>
<p>Click Apply.</p>
<p>Does this do what you want?</p>
<p>After following most of your post, the very last sentence confused me, since it contradicts the previous paragraph. On the one hand, you seemingly want what I describe. But, the very last sentence seems to say that you want all of the endnotes to appear
 "all in a specific chapter". You can accomplish that simply by having all of the endnote cites appear in that chapter. Otherwise, why would you want an endnote that's cited in chapter 6 (for example) to appear at the end of chapter 2 (for example)?</p>

<p>The book I write requires me to put the references of each section together into one chapter at the end of the document.</p>
<p>However, it also requires me to put some drawings and further text AFTER that bibliography chapter.</p>
<p>thanks for your comments, this was one of the two things I looked for (the other was Suzanne's answer).</p>

<p>I can no longer provision SfB Voice users. Before, I did not need to license them for Cloud PBX but it seems that is necessary now.</p>
<p>Can the license be made available in my tenant?</p>

<p>I got a update for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloud PBX is available for Skype for Business Plan 2, Enterprise E1, E3 or E5.</p>
<p>After checking, we found you‚Äôre using E3. However, the Subscription Source is from Volume Licensing Center. Thus, you might need to contact Volume Licensing Center to purchase the add-on subscription.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>After checking, there‚Äôre several Office 365 subscriptions in your tenant, among which, only the E4 was purchased from Microsoft. However, it‚Äôs suspended now.</p>
<p>For sales and billing related issues, if the subscription is purchased from a Microsoft partner rather than the official website, they are not supported in our forum. Thank you for your understanding.</p>

<h3> nigel-uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10130 worked till samsung touchpad update</h2>
                    <p>Apart from the logoff/shutdown issue build 10130 worked fine on my Samsung 900x notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows update offered a new driver for the touchpad, as we know you can't turn down Windows Update so it was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On restart nothing worked as expected, things got so bad that I installed the 10130 ISO on a usb drive to enable me to reset the PC.</p>
<p>Things returned to normal then yesterday WU reinstalled the new driver now my touchpad doesn't work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This proves the need (IMHO) for an ISO to be available for each build so that repairs can be done.</p>
<p>My notebook doen't have a DVD drive so USB is the repair route.</p>
<p>But also it shows the need to be able to decline an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else had a similar issue?</p>

                    <p>I need help! Just recently, I have noticed that when typing up or editing any document in word 2016, the bottom tips of letters are not viewable on the next line, almost like the spacing between sentences scrunches them all together but I have not changed
 any settings and the settings are all normal (1.0 line spacing)</p>

<p>When I create some paragraphs of text in Arial 10 pt font and 1.0 line spacing, none of the descenders are cut off. The only way I can get that effect is to set the line spacing to an Exactly value of 10 points or less. However, selecting the 1.0 item in
 the dropdown shown in the screen shot changes the line spacing in the Paragraph dialog to Single, and the descenders are no longer cut off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you post a clearer screen shot as Suzanne suggested, it would also help to have a screen shot of the Paragraph dialog taken when the cursor is in the affected text.</p>

    <title>Sending Emails Using Row Data from Excel Spreadsheet&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sending Emails Using Row Data from Excel Spreadsheet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could use some help in learning how a particular task I have in mind is done...that is if it can be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spreadsheet in Excel that I use to follow up with customers for payment on orders. &nbsp;It is in the following format:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7a5a372-50b3-4c17-853a-b71e6a0ff15c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7a5a372-50b3-4c17-853a-b71e6a0ff15c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be sorta "out there," but you don't really know until you ask, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal is to be able to highlight a row, click on a button I'd create, and have it assemble the following email to be sent to the corresponding email address in Column "I," preferably in Outlook, pulling the requisite
<strong>[Parts]</strong> from the corresponding columns, and displaying the email prior to my clicking "Send" (in the event I need to add any minor details prior to sending):</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Dear [First Name]:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
I am contacting you in connection with your recent order (#[Order Number]), placed on [Order Date]. &nbsp;Please contact me at (000) 000-0000.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in the case of Row 4, for example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>mailto: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Dear David:<br />
<br />
</strong><strong>I am contacting you in connection with your recent order (#345), placed on 10/23/2016. &nbsp;Please contact me at (000) 000-0000.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
</strong><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Am I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">completely</span> asking for a magic wand, here? &nbsp;It's certainly okay if you have to say that I am. &nbsp;MS Office has surprised me before with its capabilities, and I don't know that I know its limits. &nbsp;I'm sure,
 though, that there are people here who can tell me if it's in Office's power to do this or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S.: I do have very, very rudimentary experience with inserting scripts into Outlook and Excel using VBA. &nbsp;Just thought I'd toss that out there, too.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Word 2016 for Mac&#58; I can&#39;t cut-and-paste an image from a vector drawing program</h2>
                    <p>I am a scientist and I routinely create images in a vector drawing program called ChemBioDraw. &nbsp;In past versions of Word, I was always able to copy these images to the clipboard and paste directly into the text of a document. &nbsp;With Word 2016 for Mac, all
 I get is many lines of gibberish code and no image. &nbsp;Am I missing something, or has the ability to handle vector graphics been eliminated from the program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(FYI- a friend of mine who does design is having the same problem with a CAD program)</p>

            <p>In both Windows and Mac, newer versions of Word have less capable vector graphics filters than in previous versions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your version of Word still has the <strong>smiley-face icon</strong> in the upper-right corner of the window, click on it and choose
<strong>Tell Us What Can Be Better</strong>, then file a bug report. If you bring up a sample of the gibberish code beforehand, you can include a screen shot of that. Microsoft rarely acknowledges these reports, but they do receive them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't see the smiley-face, please visit the Word for Mac User Voice forum and add a suggestion:&nbsp;<a href="https://word.uservoice.com/forums/304942-word-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Word for Mac User Voice</a></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update not working</h2>
                    <p>When I try to check for updates I get the following message:</p>
<p>We couldn't check for updates, because you aren't connected to the Internet. Make sure you have a cellular data or Wi-Fi connection and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have WiFi working and have tried a wired connection as well. I have internet access in my browser, Outlook will get my mail etc.</p>
<p>Some other programs are also not working. I can't access the Windows Store or the Xbox app and some of the other 'metro' style windows apps. The event viewer shows the following error when I try to launch them.</p>

            <p>1. I upgraded from Windows 7 Ultimate</p>
<p>2. I had Norton 360 installed. It has since been uninstalled. I replaced it with Kaspersky.
</p>
<p>3. I do not think this computer has ever had McAffee.</p>
<p>4. Norton is uninstalled. I uninstalled Kaspersky. I ran both the Norton removal tool and the McAffee one and rebooted. Issue still persists. Looking into finding out if Kaspersky has a similar problem with uninstall/removal now.</p>

            Don't fall for these kind of offers. They generally sell volume license keys which either don't work or expire after few days creating problems for you.
<br />
<br />Always buy it from reputed sources preferably from Microsoft. This will ensure peace of mind.

<br />what is meaning of refurbished office?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Under normal circumstances, when something is described as "refurbished", it means that it's something that has been returned to the vendor and restored to "as new" prior to being resold again, something you would commonly see in terms of computer systems or peripherals like printers, phones etc
<br />
<br />Have no idea what a "refurbished software package" means (as in "refurbished Office" but in general should mean that it's something that was opened and returned by the customer. Whether the key associated with the product is still valid now (and in the future) is an interesting question. 
<br />
<br />Personally not something I would risk but that's just a personal opinion and not a statement about &lt;Impkey&gt;

            Hi MAPOLson
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download Skype, on that page, select the appropriate version for your system from the drop down list
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
<br />
<br />Before installing Skype, you should remove the previous version:
<br />
<br />If you are on a PC, go to Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />
<br />If you are on Windows 10, go to Settings - Apps
<br />
<br />If you are on a Mac, delete the Skype folder form the Applications Folder in Finder       
        </p>

            Hi 
<br />
<br />Uninstall Skype.
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows 8 or earlier, open Control Panel &gt; Programs and features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:
<br />

            The error indicates that you have an add-in installed&nbsp;which exposes itself as "emailscanner.dll". Sounds like you have a Lavasoft product installed (Ad-Aware). Uninstall its Outlook integration component and try again.

</p><p>MMS is SMS + pictures it is essentially for small data (SMS 160 characters)</p>

</p><p>That makes this phone pretty much garbage when it comes to MMS since i can't send quick pics to anyone other than via e-mail.</p>

<h2>            How to turn off flash permanently in Nokia E6</h2>
                    
<p>How does one turn off the camera flash permanently in E6? The turn off option seems to be only temporary: I start the camera application, turn off the flash; but after I exit the application and start it again, the flash is turned on again. How do I make
 the off state the default one?</p>

                    I bought the Microsoft Lumia 640 2 months ago and now I see the dark blue stripes on my screen.. When I make the screenshot, it isn't visible on the photo. I didn't fall it on the ground. What should I do?

<p>Hi Dogo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually the device itself will only automatically use the mic from your headset when inserted. So when you make a call, no more additional setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that you need to use a headset compatible with your handset or device as using third party headsets might cause an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
        </p>
