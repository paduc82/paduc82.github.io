<h2>            A simple question to Microsoft, Is my preview install of 10240 ever going to be activate&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My install of 10130 was updated to 10240 and is still un-activated 8 days later, with error code 0xC004C003. is this ever likely to be activated or am I wasting my time waiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 9 months of previews, what was promised has not materialised, I don't have any spare Win7 or Win8.1 licences &nbsp;and I am most certainly not going to fork out almost £200 for a retail licence. As a Microsoft Partner and insider, I feel very let down by
 this fiasco and can't recommend the product to any clients.</p>

            <p>How did you discover an expiry date of September for Build 10240?&nbsp; It uses the same generic Product Key as the public Windows 10 free upgrade and displays no Expiry Date, which makes me wonder how it will be deactivated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We were also told by Gabe Aul, in Blogging Windows, that if we left the Insider Program with Build 10240 installed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">"If your system upgraded from a Genuine Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 license
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/06/19/upcoming-changes-to-windows-10-insider-preview-builds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/06/19/upcoming-changes-to-windows-10-insider-preview-builds/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I do not expect my Build 10240 to expire in September, since I am able to wipe my computer and clean install Windows 10 Pro&nbsp;on it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps the device activation can be pulled by Microsoft, if it was upgraded from an Insider Preview License that did have an expiry date, even if there is no indication that the current License is temporary?</p>

            <p>That was a Screen capture of a Hyper-V VM, on which I had done a clean install of the ISO made using the Windows 10&nbsp;Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; This VM has never had Windows 7 or 8 activated on it and no Product Key was used for the clean install of the ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a VM that was clean-installed and activated&nbsp;with <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 9926</span> and then <em>upgraded via Windows Update&nbsp;this
</em><em>morning (2015-08-09)&nbsp;</em>to Build 10240.&nbsp; The only ISO ever used on this VM was the 9926 ISO as a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I don't see much difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the activation servers are tracking the license we upgraded from on each device, I suppose they can pull a device's activation at any time they choose, or perhaps these "permanently activated" Insider Preview installs will still expire on the same date
 as the OS they were upgraded from?</p>

            <p>All I had to do in Build 9926 was to change one item in the Registry to TH1 and Build 10240 came in via Windows Update.&nbsp; This works if the prior Build is activated or not, but will only activate 10240 if the Build being upgraded from is also activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Registry Key Name I changed is at:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the BranchName to TH1.&nbsp; My activated Build 9926 downloaded several Windows Updates and then upgraded itself&nbsp;to activated Build 10240.&nbsp; I then wiped the hard disk of all partitions and clean installed it from the public Windows 10 Pro ISO, which
 auto-activated.&nbsp; This was in Hyper-V.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;just tried&nbsp;the same now on an old laptop that&nbsp;also had an activated Build 9926 on it. An it now has Build 10240 activated too.&nbsp; I haven't tried the clean install on the laptop yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; The clean install, booting from the ISO, worked on the laptop as well.&nbsp; It is "permanently activated" now until whenever the Insider-based activation expires.</p>

            <p>If you happen to have any older Insider Preview Builds that can activate with an old Product Key (10130 or lower) that is what worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned 10160, do you mean Build 10162?&nbsp; If your Insider Preview Build is activated, just upgrade it using the official Windows 10 Pro ISO made with the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; You have to run setup.exe, choose to keep Windows settings and Files and
 do not enter any Product Key when asked, in order for it&nbsp;to upgrade properly and activate.</p>

            <p>So you tried upgrading to Windows 10 final with the ISO -- not activated.&nbsp; (I have upgraded from 10162 to 10240 using the ISO and remained activated).&nbsp; You then&nbsp;rolled back to 10162 -- it is activated again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When upgrading via the Media Creation Tool, it says that we must first use "Upgrade this PC now".&nbsp; I haven't tried this, but it sounds similar to the Windows Update/GWX/Get Windows 10 method for Windows 7 and 8 devices, as it will download and install Windows
 10 that matches your version automatically and not ask for a Product Key.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install#</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to best duplicate the Windows Update approach I always do this with the ISO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that I have the correct ISO to match the version I am upgrading (Home, Pro, Single Language, etc.)</li><li>Run setup.exe from the ISO from within an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
activated</span> Windows 10 Insider Preview, Windows 8.1, 8 or 7</li><li>Always choose to Keep Windows settings and files (otherwise I have seen the "upgrade" display "Installing Windows" instead of "Upgrading Windows" as it is processing).</li><li>Never enter any Product Key during or after the upgrade.&nbsp; Choose Skip or "Do this later" on these screens.</li><li>Stay connected to the Internet during the upgrade, especially at the end.&nbsp; Login properly to the wireless network if necessary to connect.&nbsp; However on the one I did not do this, it was not activated after install, but activated instantly as soon as an Internet
 connection was made, without having to choose Activate Windows.</li></ul>
<p>Choosing "Upgrade this PC now" from the Media Creation Tool eliminates the potential of doing one of the above&nbsp;steps wrong.&nbsp; For example, many people will at least attempt entering some Product Key when asked to enter one, which might prevent activation
 of the free upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only time it has not worked for me is when trying to do a clean install of Windows 10 Pro on a device licensed and registered for Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On computers licensed for the Home edition, I can <em>upgrade</em> from activated Windows 10 Pro&nbsp;Insider Preview to an activated Windows 10 Pro using the ISO, but I can only
<em>clean install</em> Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; This shows that the activation servers are capable of allowing Windows Insider upgrades separate from the actual licensed OS of a device.&nbsp; I have Windows 10 Pro and Home activated on separate partitions on the same device.&nbsp;
 But since the actual license is for Home, I can only clean-install the Home edition.</p>

<p>Hi. Please help!</p>
<p>I have an "unread text message" envelope symbol on my Nokia Asha 300. I definitely do not have any unread messages from the person it says I do. I don't want to delete the whole conversation to get rid of this problem. I have tried switching on and off and
 removing battery for a few minutes. Any other ideas please?? Many thanks, Clarey.</p>

<p>Hi. Sorry for the delayed reply - I have been away.</p>
<p>Please forgive my ignorance but how do I check for SIM messages? It says the unread message is from one of my friends (in my phone contacts) but there is definitely no unread message from this person. I have noticed that this can also happen if I open a&nbsp;message
 as soon as the alert tone begins rather than waiting for a little while.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<p>Hello Support,</p>
<p>I have a problem with one shared Mailbox that every time we access the Search Mail and People, it hangs and shows an error as indicated in the Subject. This is happening on all users who is accessing the same Shared Mailbox via OWA using browsers IE-11 and
 Mozilla Firefox on a Windows 8.1 O/S. The personal/individual mailbox doesn't&nbsp;encounter this problem.</p>

<p>Please helps in resolving this issue.</p>

<p>Warm Regards,</p>
<p>Marcos Yambao</p>

    <title>Unable to send text messages on my unlocked Verizon Nokia Lumia 822. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to send text messages on my unlocked Verizon Nokia Lumia 822.</h2>
                    <div>Would appreciate any help available on this issue !!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using an Nokia Lumia 822 Verizon unlocked phone in India.</div>
<div>When I got this phone everything seemed to work fine, even the text messaging.</div>
<div>Unfortunately over the past few weeks i'm unable to send any text messages. I keep getting the reply "Can't send message Try Again". Its only for sending where the problem arises. I do&nbsp;receive regular text messages on my phone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was last able to send a text message 25 days ago. When I use this SIM on another phone I'm able to send messages just fine. So no problem with the SIM, network or network provider.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>I've already tried the power cycle. Infact I also did a hard reboot, ie. removed the battery while the phone was switched on and inserted the battery after a couple of minutes and powered the phone on. It did not help.</div>
</div>
<div>I've checked the APN and server setting too with the provider and it's correct. Infact internet connection works fine through the same network provider.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using this phone since Feb 2013 and was able to send text messages till mid march 2013.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I strongly think it was an update (8.0.10211.204) to the software that i did a couple of weeks ago that is causing this. I thought it would be nice for the phone when i got the update notification. The latest update to the software mentions additional
 features for messaging. This could the reason this problem has surfaced.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope Nokia, Windows and Verizon correct this issue immediately and send an update across soon.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

            I don't think there's an upgrade for your device. If there's one, you will get it from Verizon. But Windows Mobile 6 is not for sale the same way as Windows Desktop.

            Okay. I've noticed the same thing on my 920 occasionally but there really isn't anything we can do about it. It's probably just the OS takingllonger than it should to clear out the RAM.

<p>Hi Santhosh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems the browser requires a certificate from server. Please try to change another browser to check whether it’s a browser issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And may I ask:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>If others in your organization also have the same issue?
</span></li><li><span>What is your tenant deployment environment? Are you using pure Office 365 online service or are you using on-premises services such as Exchange hybrid and Directory
 Sync? You may consult your admin about this question.</span></li></ol>

<p>Hi Santhosh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I ask if you have tried another browser on your phone? This is an important troubleshooting step since we need to find out where the issue is, on browser or on the server. Besides, if you are
 not sure about your deployment environment, you can send your domain ( suffix after @) to me and I will help check it, since this kinds of issues usually happen on on-premises servers based on my experience. To protect your privacy, please send it via

<p>Hi Santhosh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your update. To further help you, we still need to know your deployment environment and moreover, where is your mailbox hosted. As I said before, this kind of issues often happen in
 on-premises environment. Furthermore, could you provide the link you used to log on Outlook on the web? To protect your privacy, you can send all these information in PM.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Dynamic Distribution Groups - errors for external senders</h2>
                    
<p>I've been having issues with our DDGs not accepting emails from external senders, despite the 'Senders inside and outside of my organization' being checked in the delivery management options. I did some testing today with inconsistent results.</p>
<p>Created 6 identical (aside from the name/email address) dynamic distribution groups in powershell, making sure to allow external senders. Then I send an email to each from a gmail account. It worked for 4 of them and failed for 2 (the delivery failure email
 notes: The error that the other server returned was: 550 5.4.1 [*** Email address is removed for privacy ***]: Recipient address rejected: Access denied).</p>
<p>Next I created 6 identical distribution groups (non-dynamic) in Powershell, also allowing external senders. These also had mixed results, 3 worked and 3 failed when sending an email from my gmail account.</p>
<p>Then I created 6 identical distribution groups (non-dynamic) in the Exchange admin center, again allowing external senders. All 6 of these received emails from the external source with no errors.</p>
<p>The next test was 6 identical dynamic distribution groups in EAC, allowing external. This time I had 2 work and 4 fail.</p>
<p>So from what I can tell, there are a few problems here: first, that groups created in Powershell are inconsistent (both dynamic and non); second, that there is an issue with DDGs accepting email from external senders (whether created in Powershell or EAC).</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>Thank you for your detailed description.</p>
<p>According to your description, I’d like to summarize as below:</p>
<p>1.<span> </span>You created 6 identical
<b>DDGs</b> using Powershell, 4 of them can receive messages from Gmail account, 2 of them failed (with 550 5.4.1
<b>NDR</b>)<br />
2.<span> </span>You created 6 identical<b> DDGs</b> using EAC, 2 of them can receive messages from Gmail account, 4 of them failed.<br />
3.<span> </span>You created 6 identical
<b>DGs </b>using Powershell, 3 of them can receive messages from Gmail account, 3 of them failed.<br />
4.<span> </span>You created 6 identical
<b>DGs </b>using EAC, all of them can receive messages from Gmail account.<br />
5.<span> </span>Gmail e-mail address is the only one.</p>
<p>About your first question, we have something to confirm:</p>
<p>1.<span> </span>When you create 6 identical DDGs and DGs using Powershell, respectively, do you use the commands as below?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>DDGs</b>: <b>Set-DynamicDistributionGroup -Identity "***" -RequireSenderAuthenticationEnabled $False</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>DG</b>: <b>Set-DistributionGroup -Identity "***" -RequireSenderAuthenticationEnabled $False</b><br />
2.<span> </span>Did you receive <b>
NDR</b> (not 550 5.4.1) or other error messages after you send messages to these DGs created using Powershell?</p>
<p>To look into the issue, You can copy the whole NDR into private message to us, here is the link to access it: &nbsp;community.office365.com/.../conversations</p>
<p>About your second question, unlike regular distribution groups that contain a defined set of members, the membership list for dynamic distribution groups is calculated each time a message is sent to the group, based on the filters and conditions that you
 define. When an email message is sent to a DDG, it’s delivered to all recipients in the organization that match the criteria defined for that group. Therefore, I'd like to collect some information as below:</p>
<p>1.<span> </span>Did you configure the Domain Type of accepted domains @***.onmicrosoft.com to be
<b>Authoritative</b>? If so, please select Internal Relay. Enter into <b>EAC</b>-<b>&gt;mail flow-&gt;select</b>
<b>@***.onmicrosoft.com -&gt; Internal Relay-&gt; Save</b>.<br />
2.<span> </span>Whether you configure some Rules or specify the types of recipients when you create
<b>DDGs </b>using Powershell?</p>
<p>Moreover, I need all error messages (the whole <b>NDR </b>or others) responding to 2 situations except for 550 5.4.1
<b>NDR</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can copy that information into private message to us. Here is the link to access it:
community.office365.com/.../conversations</p>
<p><br />
Regards,<br />
Peter</p>

<h2>            Excel formula for vacation accrual and sick leave</h2>
                    <p>Our company's vacation accrues monthly with a maximum amount that can be accrued.&nbsp; I would like to create a formula that will subtract the amount used for the month, and add the monthly accrual if the maximum amount hasn't been met for the month.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once they
 dip below the maximum amount, I want the formula to start adding the monthly accrual back.&nbsp; The sick leave is based the same way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, may have an employee that jumps to the next level of accrual during the middle of the year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - 5 years, accrue .84/mth with a total of 10 days, </p>
<p>6 - 12 years accrue 1.25/mth with a total of 15 days,&nbsp;and </p>
<p>13 - 13+ years 1.67/mth with a total of 20 days.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>An employee who has been here 4 years would be accumulating .84 days per month but could never go over 10 days.&nbsp; Once 10 days has been met, there is no longer any accrual.&nbsp; Employee uses 1 day and now had 9 days, accrual of .84 begins and stops once 10 days
 has been met.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say this employee has his 5 year anniversary in June.&nbsp; He would be granted another 5 days June 1 and would begin accruing 1.25 days in July.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Android 8.0.0 should not have any issues with the drop down list of countries within the dial pad of Skype.
</p>
<p>This feature is available on Skype version 8.33. If you don't see it with the current version of your Skype app, try on clearing the cache in the device and reinstall the Skype app.

<h2>            Autofill, Primary Key and Forms</h2>
                    <p>I am new to using VBA, so I'm not sure what code to use to autofill a fill a record number into a new form and/or if I should be using subforms.&nbsp; I have multiple&nbsp;disease tables linked to a primary report table&nbsp;based on the Record Number of the primary table.&nbsp;Right
 now I have created&nbsp;a form for the primary table and forms for the disease tables which contain information specific for that disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;I currently have it set up so the person enters the primary report information (information that will be provided for any
 disease), then they&nbsp;press&nbsp;a Command button of&nbsp;the disease being reported which opens a new form&nbsp;to enter the disease specific information.&nbsp; I want the Record Number of the primary report to autofill in the disease specific form as this is what links the primary
 record to the disease specific information. I also want to ensure that if someone needs to update the disease specific information when they press the Command button for that disease it brings them to the record they already entered information in vs. a new
 record.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I have read, it seems like&nbsp;a subform is what I should use.&nbsp; However, for subforms it's not clear to me if a subform can only be built from one table vs. multiple tables.&nbsp; The amount of disease specific information for each disease would exceed
 the maximum fields allowed in one table, so I have to have multiple tables.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone please advise on how I should proceed and if coding is required sample code I would appreciate the assistance.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I would use subforms on a Tab control. With each Tab representing the disease. Alternatively, you use a generic subform and fill in the source of the subform control after the disease is selected.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>In either case, the subform would be linked on the recordID and would automatically fill in.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I see no problem i using disease specific tables but it might not be necessary. it sounds like you may be using field names to encode your data. This creates a horizontal structure, where you should have a more vertical structure, If you can give us an
 example of the structure of your database we may be able to advise further.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Scott,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are right the database is set up more horizontal than than veritcle as far as the primary report and disease specific information.&nbsp;This is due to the number of fields. I believe trying to get all of the fields in one table will exceed the max for a single
 table in&nbsp;access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently the primary report has the information that will be on any disease report as well as fields for tracking work flow.&nbsp; The disease specfic then contains the, disease specific record number,&nbsp;exposure history, clinical signs and laboratory information
 that is unique to each disease.&nbsp; The database is set up as a one to one relationship for the Primary Report and Disease Specific information with the Record Number being the primary key for all tables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if there are more questions on the structure that will help with identifying the best way to set up the forms for data entry and ensure the data is linked appropriately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            Again, without knowing your data model and structure its hard to answer. But I can tell you that using a heavily horizontal structure is not good design. Let me give you an example. Lets take a database with info on resorts. So you have a table that lists
 information about the resort (i.e. Address, phone # etc.). This would be like your primary report. Next you want to list the amenities offered by the resort. One way to do this would be to have a table with fields that list each amenity. This would be a horizontal
 structure and would not be good design. The better way is with a table like:
<div><br />
<div>tblResortAmentities</div>
<div>ResortAmentiyID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>ResortID (FK)</div>
<div>AmnityID (FK)</div>
<div>OtherInfo</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is a vertical structure that uses one record to describe each amenity in each resort. This is a normalized structure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now this could be applied to your Diseases table like so:</div>
<div><br />
<div>tblReportDisease</div>
<div>ReportDiseaseID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>ReportID (FK)</div>
<div>DiseaseID (FK)</div>
<div>DiseaseAttributeID (FK)</div>
<div>OtherInfo</div>
<div><br />
<div>So you would have ONE table for diseases (a similar table for workflow). Each record in this table would be tied to the Primary Report record, a specific Disease and an attribute of that disease that you want to track. The Disease and DiseaseAttributes
 would be chose from lookup tables. This eliminates the need for disease specific table it won't matter how many attributes you need to track per disease.&nbsp;</div>

            Transferring your number from the 520 won't affect anything but the ability to use the cell service, make calls, text, use cell data.&nbsp; The device will retain everything else and operate on the internet if you have WiFi. with WiFi you will essentially lose
 only text and phone capability. You really don't even need a SIM in the phone to do virtually everything it does. It will just say no service. The 520 actually is quite useful without a SIM, having an FM radio, GPS, you can even sort of make calls using Skype
 over WiFi.

<h2>            OneNote won&#39;t sync with IOS 9.3.5</h2>
                    I have two iPads.&nbsp; The newer one syncs fine.&nbsp; The older one, running IOS 9.3.5 (a model MC733LL/A) does not sync.&nbsp; I tried resetting OneNote on iPad, and now all I see are the Notebooks and the tabs, but no pages&nbsp;

            As the most recent app version (16.7) needs iOS 10 at least and te OneNote team seems to be in a process of optimizing the sync mechanism I would normally assume an incomatibility problem here. 
<br />But...as I also assume that there are still a lot of iPad 3 or earlier models out there there would be a lot mor complaints about this issue. So I think it's an idividual problem.
<br />
<br />1. Are the "loaded" section names colored or all grey? I'm asking because usually grey means it's still in the loading process and sync can be at times really slow. In that case jsut waiting (maybe hours, not minutes) could solve it.
<br />
<br />2. If not, maybe try this: Close the notebook on the iPad, open a web browser (e.g. safari) and navigate to www.onenote.com. login with your credentials and open the notebook from there. Normally it should automatically proceed with loadint it in the app. If not (it opens in the browser), choose "open in OneNote" from the menu.

<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tabs are grey.&nbsp; Interestingly, on this try I got the sign in request at the top.&nbsp; The last few attempts it seemed to blow by that bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I signed in the pages appeared, and it tried to sync, but the sync failed.&nbsp; Switching to a different notebook after signing in results in a long time to load even the tabs.&nbsp; Once the tabs are loaded it eventually shows the pages, and then the contents,
 then eventually ends with "Couldn't Sync" although the latest data is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The amount of time all this takes makes the app pretty useless.</p>

            There are two factors to syncing times:
<br />
<br />1. Yes, the sync is somewhat slow by design. I remember a OneNote engineer having mentioned something about 250 KB/s max wit the current protocol. I know they are working on the sync protocol so hopefully that will improve soon.
<br />2. Given the above speed statement and the fact that many users do not use OneNote as it most likely was desiged to (as a note taking tool) but more as a document management system, printing hundreds of PDF pages into notebooks (where they get PNG images), there can be a large amount of data in a notebook.
<br />
<br />I totally agree with you: Used in that way (opening / fully syncing notebooks on demand) is not a "very convenient way" to use OneNote.
<br />
<br />The idea with OneNote is *not* to open a notebook when needed and close it again after a search or edit but to stay open on the device all the time. That way only changes to the notes have to be synced instead of downloading the whole notebook every time (and copy all of it's contents to a local cache file). 
<br />OneNote also originally was designeds for PCs, not for mobile devices with maybe a limited storage capacity (local storage is used by the cache copies for open notebooks). So the concept of keeping notebooks open (and the local cache files intact) may be hindered by limited storage capacity on mobile devices.

<p>Turns out it is syncing this morning. Go figure.&nbsp; BTW, I have about 12GB of free space on my old iPad, well in excess of my needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you were spot on with how I use OneNote.&nbsp; I keep documents and lists.&nbsp; It works great for me (when it syncs).&nbsp; The one big thing I would wish for is to have multiple tabs and notebooks in view at the same time.</p>

<p>Thank you for helping me.. Unfortunately the SFC found errors unable to repair. I have a log file but its huge, so I am not sure I can paste it here. &nbsp;The app checker also mentioned the cache was corrupt but the issue still isn't resolved. Updates are up
 to date. &nbsp;Next steps?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still facing the issue, follow these steps:<br />
a. Click on <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>services.msc</strong> into the start menu search box and press Enter.<br />
b. In Services, scroll down to "Remote Procedure Call. Right-click on it&nbsp;and make sure the status says "Started"and set to Automatic.<br />
c. The second "RPC Locator" should be set to "Manual".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, try the DISM tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not help, could you please test the issue on another user account.&nbsp; If you do not have another user account,&nbsp;please create&nbsp;a new user account.</p>

</p><p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm editing Gabe's old post, but for good reason.&nbsp; Back when it was written, the PowerShell script (now removed) fixed some of the problems folks were seeing with Metro apps not launching.&nbsp; It was a good workaround until a fix was launched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With as much as Win10 has changed in the year (actually longer) since then, running that same powershell script now will actually make the situation worse for users.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After partnering with folks in Engineering to obtain updated workaround steps, we've created a new thread with steps to follow.&nbsp; Please navigate to this new thread and use those steps for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for posting your concern here at Microsoft Community and it's my pleasure to assist you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based from what I've read, you cannot attach multiple files at a time when composing an email. In order for us to isolate and determine the possible root cause of the issue, please provide some answers to the questions that I have outlined below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried to access your Microsoft account using different web browser and see if the problem still persist?</li><li>Can you please provide us the file size of the attachment that you're trying to attach when composing email?</li><li>Did you encounter any error after an attempt to attach multiple files? If yes, can you please provide us the exact error message that you received?</li><li>Have you tried any torubleshooting steps to resolve the issue?</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, please be informed that&nbsp;a<span> regular Microsoft account can only send
<strong>50 attachments</strong> with a total of<strong>25 MB per message</strong>. If the attachment that you're trying to send is over the allowed file size, &nbsp;I'd suggest that you upload it to
<a href="http://skydrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows Live SkyDrive</span></a><span>. It's an online storage where you can share files online with 7GB storage capacity and 300MB single file upload. For more information about Windows Live SkyDrive,
 please refer to the link below:<br />

<p>Thank you for additional information that you have provided. This will help us to easily identify the cause of the issue.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, I suggest for you to check if there's a Microsoft Silverlight installed in your computer. If<span><font color="#000000"> there is, please try to uninstall and reinstall it.
 Then after that, reboot your computer and try to attach multiple attachment again to see if this will resolve your concern.

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue started after an Office update, it seems like the issue is happening because of an outdated driver. As an initial recommendation, we suggest updating your printer driver and see if that fixes the issue. You can use this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong> as reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
