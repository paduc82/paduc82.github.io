            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are in a frustrating situation because you are unable to access Start Menu in Windows 10 Technical Preview build 9926. Please provide us with the following information to assist you in a better way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get any error message when you are trying to access the Start button?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to inform you that Start menu is not an app in Windows 10 TP.</p>
<p>I suggest you to refer to the suggestion by Sharath Srinivasa from the following link and check if&nbsp;&nbsp;you can access the Start menu.</p>

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PS Script you are using was designed for Windows 8x and not&nbsp;Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That script will remove all XAML or HTML5 based applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new Windows 10 Start Menu is also a XAML based application. This gives the new Start Menu many more possible functions than the previous Win32 based menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>Well that just sucks, because the script I ran is supposed to only remove Apps. The script I used was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>get-appxpackage -allusers | remove-appxpackage</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also used this to remove them from the hard drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>remove-appxprovisionedpackage -packagename "<em>package names"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If these commands are only for Windows 8/8.1, why are they still available? And why would it do something like remove the Start Menu when it won't remove several of the Bing apps or Camera or Photos, etc.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW. The short time I did see the 9926 Start Menu, I hated it. Applications by Alphabet? Really? Why do we waste precious screen space with the alphabet included into the menu???? Wouldn't be so bad if there was an option to change it to something else,
 but I didn't see an option for that anywhere before it disappeared.</p>

<p>So, the powershell command brought the start menu back, and thankfully, didn't bring back those lousy Metro/Modern apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a desktop. That's why I get rid of Store "apps", Metro apps, or Modern apps. I have no use for them. Tapping and sliding doesn't work on desktops, and the extra 3-5 mouse clicks to do what I could do in Windows 7/XP are a time waster for me. I know
 that Microsoft probably doesn't like to hear it, but Metro/Modern apps are ****. I need an OS for my desktop/laptop, not an OS built for a phone/tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone needs to modify what can and cannot be removed with the remove-appxpackage command. Why in the world would you ever allow the Start Menu to be removed with a powershell command?</p>

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad you were able to get the Start Menu working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Start Menu with the ability to Resize, enable Transparency, Turn off live tiles, etc, will return in a future build.</p>

            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you need to make a lot of customization in Windows 10 TP, I suggest you to&nbsp;post these in the&nbsp;Feedback app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in developmental stage, you can expect more features in the upcoming Builds.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>I recommend you join the Windows Insider Program to get more frequent preview builds and send your feedback straight to the people building Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you’re an Insider, use the Windows Feedback app to tell us which features you love, which features you could do without, or when something could be better.</span></span></p>

<p>I am in the Insider Program. I work for a living. I don't have time to play games or use childish "apps". For everything I do, "apps" are worthless. I don't download junk from the "Store". I don't use "apps", so they are removed from all of my computers.
 This is the only way I've found to provide information to MS without having to resort to using one of those "things".</p>

<h2>            Convert text to columns</h2>
                    I've extracted some data from a report in pdf format and each line has this type of data:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>135 W. Ocean Ave, Lake Bolingbroke Estates SF-1,353 $92,000 Nov 12 $110,000 Jun01 $1,386.97 1960</p>
<p>representing</p>
<p>Address,&nbsp;Type of home and square footage, (usually prefixed SF- or CO-),&nbsp;Sale price,&nbsp;Sale date, previous sale price, previous sale date, taxes and construction date.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although I've tried to use Acrobat's tools to 'save as table' it doesn't work, and as the fields are not routinely the same width and do not have consistent separators, I'm struggling... &nbsp;<span>I
 can probably dig out some previous help to strip off the last 4 digits from the right, and with help, probably strip the other fields off from the end by searching for the dollar sign or the 3-letter abbreviation for the month but (did I mention I need help?)
 I'm not sure whether I'm making it more difficult than it needs to be.</span></p>
<p><br />

<p>Looking forward to some suggestions, thanks in&nbsp;advance. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Actually, never mind that question... I found a work-around where I do not need to know it in advance. Give this macro a try (change the StartRow constant assignment in the Const statement to the actual first row number for your first piece of data... the
 code assumes Column A contains your text)...</p>

<p>HOW TO INSTALL MACROs<br />
------------------------------------<br />
If you are new to macros, they are easy to install and use. To install it, simply press ALT+F11 to go into the VB editor and, once there, click Insert/Module on its menu bar, then copy/paste the above code into the code window that just opened up. That's it....
 you are done. To use the macro, go back to the worksheet with your data on it and press ALT+F8, select the macro name (SplitOutDataOriginallyFromPDF) from the list that appears and click the Run button. The macro will execute and perform the action(s) you
 asked for.<br />

 of tabulated data, but not a highlighted selection or part of a document that has some columns and rows.

<p>Okay, now I am confused as well. I posted a macro that avoided the problem of spaces either being in the dates or not and you responded that you "I had looked at that myself - and no, the format wasn't consistent, at least not in the previous sale date field..."
 I presumed you meant you had already written code similar to what I posted and that it did not work for you... I further&nbsp;read into that comment (probably incorrectly)&nbsp;that maybe the number of fields was not consistent and suggested you needed to show us more
 examples. If you were only referring to the spaces in dates (and not my presumed possible extra fields), then the macro I posted (which you seemed to indicate did not work for you) works for that (or at least it did on the sample data I extrapolated from the
 single example you posted). If you did not already try my macro, please do and let me know if it works for you or not. As for the question about Excel... I was confused by your prior posting mentioning your having done something in Adobe Acrobat, so I wanted
 to be sure this was actually an Excel question... no sarcasm intended.<br />

I loved your solution, thanks! &nbsp;And it was handy to be able to download the excel sample and put in some more values. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I now realize (prompted by Rick's posts) that my scanned data just isn't consistent enough to be able to apply these formulae.
 &nbsp;For example, I only got as far as the second line before noticing that it doesn't have a comma in the address part &nbsp;:-( &nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Transfer Azure Resource Group or VM to different account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>FOro ne, I'm not sure how to categorize this, feel free to move this question wherever, I couldn't find a better fit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm switching employers over the weekend, starting new on monday. </p>
<p>I currently have an Azure VM and some attached stuff (IP, Firewall...) on my Visual Studio Enterprise subscription's 130€/month free credit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to take that VM, and if possible the whole resource group, to the new visual studio subscription that I get on monday, after my current one probably gets deactivated on friday (tomorrow).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I activated an Azure trial on my other account, hoping to somehow use that as transfer account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope to get the new subscription on the same account, but I can't activate the trial on that main account since it has the subscription so no trial for me there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how I can take my VM or resource group with me?</p>
<p>

<p>Seems that all is well, though the process was strange to say the least:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using the removal tool and re-installing everything worked fine.</p>
<p>I moved on to install the Hebrew proofing yet i got a notice that a different 32 bit proofing tool is already installed, though my laptop is 64 bit, Word states that no proofing tool is installed, and as i said, i've previously uninstalled all Office related
 software. Odd. </p>
<p>Than it went through a re-installing screen, that was also confusing - is it reinstalling just the proofing or the entire Office suite?...</p>
<p>
</p><p>At long last it was done. Again, nothing crashed thus far, but yeh, odd process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for your help with this<br />

            Hi Edward 
<br />
<br /> As long as the version of Office (Home and Business, Pro, Pro plus . . etc.) is the exact same, then yes, you can use that link for OEM or Retail versions of Office
<br />
<br />If the version is not the same, then Office will fail to activate . . .

                    Have been using an Excel 2016 &nbsp;shared workbook succesfully with my PA. Suddenly, when I look at the Review &nbsp;Tab, the Protect Icons are greyed out. I cannot find out how to unshare - there are no icons appearing. There are no grouped worksheets, it is only
 open now on my desktop and I have not protecetd the file. Because it is shared it will not let me copy or move individual tabs.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Office 2016 on my personal computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I want to open EXCEL file from OneDrive (saved via SharePoint of my jobs company)&nbsp; in my Excel 2016 desktop application it does not allow me to edit it if this file is used by another user (f.e. if i have it opened also via web browser Excel Online
 or my coleague). So I can not collaborate on this file. But for WORD or PowerPoint files it works fine and I can simultaniously work via web broser and also via Desktop application.&nbsp; Excel version is 1807 (build 10325.20082).</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Ondrej,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two possible factors that might affect the collaboration of Excel 2016 files. First, it could be a permission issue. And second, it could be an Excel app issue. To isolate and get to the correct resolution, I would like to gather more information.
 Please answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is the issue happening on all files being access in <strong>OneDrive</strong> and shared via
<strong>SharePoint</strong> or particular to the Excel file that you're working on?</li><li>Did you encounter any error messages upon opening the mentioned file in <strong>
OneDrive</strong>?</li><li>Are you using the email account similar to what you're using in your Word or PowerPoint app?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>

<div>
- yes, this issue stands for all my files via SharePoint</div>
<div>
- always when I open Excel file from SharePoint it is just read-only and I must allow it to edit by clicking button</div>
<div>
- for Word and Powerpoint I use same email adress as for Excel, but there it works..</div>

<p>Thank you for your prompt response to my questions. Since you mentioned that the issue is only happening on the files from SharePoint, it could be a permission issue and can be resolved by the admin of the SharePoint app. However, for better assistance on
 this issue, I recommend posting it in the <strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet Forum</a></strong>. This site has IT experts who can help you out with your concern.

                    Here is the situation.
<div><br />
<div>I get a message and I delete it from the inbox, and next from the deleted items folder. &nbsp;so far so good, message gone. &nbsp;Now if I do a search (via Mac find function) for the message it shows up as being in:</div>

<span>The last item being the message. &nbsp;I can open it by double clicking and there it is in its full glory. If I do a search within Outlook it shows up but has no folder located
 to it, so I suppose it 'finds' it in the same folder where the Mac finds it. &nbsp;Using the find inside Outlook I can find them, delete them again and find them again, etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

<p>

<div>Weird indeed, and that makes two of us who have no idea as to what is going on. &nbsp;I only found out by accident. &nbsp; Thanks for looking in to this, and I look forward to your findings.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And for those who are reading this, could you maybe do a test, and report here? &nbsp;This would show if it is a bug in Outlook or a local problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is how I suggest you go about it. &nbsp;Write a mail to yourself. &nbsp;Give it a unique title. &nbsp;Download it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now do a search on the tittle in Outlook and in the finder. &nbsp;both documents should show up. &nbsp;Now delete them (or nuke if you have the scrip- thttp://www.avernus.com/~phil/OEStuff.html), now delete them from the trash in outlook. &nbsp;They should be gone for
 ever. &nbsp;Do the search to check if they still are there. &nbsp;Next follow the suggestion of Corentin, and rebuild. &nbsp;Search again in both outlook and finder. &nbsp;Are they there? &nbsp;Mine are. &nbsp;Love to hear any reports.&nbsp;</div>

            AFAIK the Nuke Message script fails in Outlook.<br />
<br />
Is this a Gmail IMAP account? If yes, this could just be Gmail's settings.<br />
<br />
Messages that are deleted from an IMAP folder (except for those in [Gmail]/Spam or [Gmail]/Trash) only have that label removed and still exist in All Mail.
<br />
<br />
 They should be gone for ever.&nbsp; Do the search to check if they still are there.&nbsp; Next follow the suggestion of Corentin, and rebuild.&nbsp; Search again in both outlook and finder.&nbsp; Are they there?&nbsp; Mine are.&nbsp; Love to hear any reports.

<br />
I did a search after deleting a message and could not find it in either Outlook's search or Spotlight search in the Finder.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a Gmail account, I suggest you test in a new Identity.<br />

<div><i>&gt;&nbsp;AFAIK the Nuke Message script fails in Outlook.</i>
<div><br />
<div>Works fine for me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have no such thing as a Gmail (we like to spy on you) account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All my accounts are POP and I just checked this morning on two other POP accounts and the deleted messages are still there. &nbsp;Checked on a second computer with different POP accounts and have the same result.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I created a new identity. &nbsp;Here it seems to work. &nbsp;However it only permanently deletes the file after the next download. &nbsp;So all seems well there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Next question, how to best export my present stuff (including folders and my complete setup etc.) in to the new identity. &nbsp;And does this mean I have to setup al my accounts new (I hope not!)? &nbsp;Or can this also be exported and imported?&nbsp;</div>

            There is an unofficial way to setup accounts and rules, but you probably won't save much times.<br />
<br />
Under File &gt; Export select the default action to export all items as .olm file.<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Create a new Identity. <br />
</li><li>Quit Outlook </li><li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Option -drag</span> to copy over these folders from your current Identity to the new Identity. (if you don't copy and this fails, you could loose data)<br />
</li></ol>
<br />
Data Records<br />
&nbsp; Mail Accounts<br />
&nbsp; Recent Addresses<br />
&nbsp; Rules<br />
&nbsp; Schedules &lt;--not sure about this one<br />
&nbsp; Signature Attachments<br />
&nbsp; Signatures<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Open Database Utility and select to rebuild the new Identity.</li><li>You can safely delete the copy with the [Backed up ....]</li><li>Open this Identity and verify all the data is there that was moved. </li><li>Import the .olm file you exported from your other Identity.</li></ul>
The imported .olm file will show up under a folder in the folder list. You'll need to select the messages in the default folders (Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Deleted Items) and move to the local folders. You can drag any custom folder to it's correct location. You
 can delete the imported folder structure after you move all the messages.<br />
<br />
You'll also need to move the contacts, events, tasks, notes to their local folders.<br />
<br />
Rules will need to be reset once you get all your data imported.<br />

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been a windows phone user since LUMIA 720 came into market. Now I became a die-hard fan to it after changing to LUMIA 830. The only feature we have been short of compared to other mobile OS is the font change option. Can you please provide a
 provision to change fonts in the up-coming releases and also please add support to telugu in Key board. Rest all is super fine. If there is an update rolling out for LUMIA 830 can you please specify when it may be available for use in INDIA ?
</p>

    <title>Word for iPad marked up files displaying in PDF readers with very low - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewnu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word for iPad marked up files displaying in PDF readers with very low resolution images</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I've been benefiting from writing and marking up documents in MS Word (iOS) using my Apple pencil and then "printing" the document into PDF Expert with "Print &gt;&gt; Open in Another App".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, however, the imported PDFs display all of my Apple Pencil markups from Word as very low resolution mark ups. I haven't knowingly changed anything in my workflow or settings. The exported PDFs display poorly in Preview as well as in
 PDF Expert, so the problem seems to be a change to the Word for iOS app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest version of all apps and iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see a way to attach the original Word and PDF files to this post, or multiple images, so the image I've chosen is of the exported PDF showing the low resolution image quality rather than the high quality markups as they appeared in Word
 for iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Workflow:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. </span>Typed some random text directly into Microsoft Word</p>
<p><span>2. </span>Marked up using a variety of markups in Word using my Apple Pencil</p>
<p><span>3. </span>Exported to PDF Expert as follows: File Menu &gt; Print &gt; Open in Another App &gt; Selected 'Copy to PDF Expert'</p>
<p><span>4. </span>File opens in PDF Expert with all previously high resolution Apple Pencil markups showing as very low-resolution images.</p>

<h2>            How to copy a file from N8 to a USB-stick&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have this problem with my N8; when i want to copy a file to a connected USB-stick from the N8 the pop-up just shows the options C; phone-memory, E; mass-memory and F; memory card. This problem occures with any file i try to transfer, music, video or photo.
 The USB-stick shows up in the file manager (G:) but it seems impossible to transfer any file to it. I tried all USB-settings, mass storage, media transfer,...&nbsp;Somebody experienced this?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
According to your description, I understand that you wanted to search for emails in a particular folder in OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>). To do this, you can firstly select the particular folder and enter the keywords
 in the search field. Then it will only show the result in the particular folder. You can see the screenshots below that I tested on my side:<br />
1. I created a new folder in my mailbox and moved some emails in the new folder. Then I selected the new folder and search for the result.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48e49f02-692d-446a-ac89-108778398f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48e49f02-692d-446a-ac89-108778398f91" /></a>
<span><br />
2. In the search result, it only showed the emails in this new folder.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I see now that this is not quite an answer, when I search in a created folder I get results just in that folder but when I search in the "INBOX" I get results in "All Folders"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this able to be changed to show results only in the Inbox?</p>

            <p>Hi Daniel<br />
<br />
You can see the searching result only under "Inbox".<br />
When I perform a test, click “Inbox” and then search something, the result will show that the search is under “Whole folder”.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/942afc55-e579-4337-aeb2-b8a752c6e7ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/942afc55-e579-4337-aeb2-b8a752c6e7ff" /></a></p>
<p>You need to click the inbox again and then the result will show correctly.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/819566b4-46ef-473e-9e7b-d527d8967e81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/819566b4-46ef-473e-9e7b-d527d8967e81" /></a><br />

<h2>            Cannot update keyboard text suggestions on Windows 10 mobile</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to download keyboard text suggestion updates for Armenian and Persian keyboards, but it fails every single&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already factory reset my phone twice and the problem is still there. Actually, the problem started after the first reset. It was working before.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The specific languages in your phone depends as well on your mobile operator. Have you moved to another location since you have the text suggestion for Armenian working?</p>
<p>

            <p>No, and I don't see what that has to do with anything. I'm simply trying to update text suggestions. The keyboard itself works for those languages,&nbsp;they just show no suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, my phone is not a carrier phone anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bug with windows 10 mobile, AFAIK. It used to plague people about a year ago and seems to be back again.</p>

            For me, nothing worked. I reset the phone, registered for this insider program, changed the ring, but nothing solved the keyboard problem. A year ago the same happened with some of my apps eg. windows photos, word, excel, Instagram... thankfully a reset
 helped with them. And I fear the same happens with messenger and Instagram again.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Update, I did manage to get suggestions but I needed to sign into the insider program, slow ring and with update system managed to download suggestions. After that I signed out from program, now Im awaiting for next update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really would like this is not only solution, although this slow ring version works pretty well.</p>

    <title>Import from a spreadsheet - headings not found - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sven johannsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Import from a spreadsheet - headings not found</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue importing fairly simple information from a spreadsheet to project. &nbsp;Full disclosure, Access is the source of the spreadsheet. All involved Office products are 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can output a spreadsheet from an Access query (manually, via the ribbon, external data export or right click the qry, export&gt;excel) into an xlsx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can import that into project using the New from Excel workbook feature. Everything works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT</p>
<p>If I use&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; DoCmd.OutputTo acOutputQuery, "qry_POAM_Output_To_Excel_for_Project", acFormatXLSX, Location_Chosen, True</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project can't find any field names in the header. In Project if I go through the 'New Project from Excel' wizard, I get to the point where Project is supposed to provide the first row headers, to allow mapping to Project fields, and the Excel fields are
 blank. It doesn't see any of the header entries. &nbsp;It is noticeable that the first row from VBA is shaded and the Field Names are bolded. I don't think I specified that anywhere. I do notice a checkbox in the manual export that says "Export data with formatting
 and layout" which I don't check, manually. No such option pops up with the VBA of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears there is some</p>
<p>formatting that is in the VBA outputted spreadsheet that confuses Project. Anyone know what that might be and how to prevent it? Or at least consistently re-format the xlsx so that it does work. I have tried to make sure the first row only has text, no special
 formatting, no justification, that sort of thing. Is there someplace to globally specify no formatting if outputting via VBA?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Try editing a table in Project to show the columns you want to import, make sure there is relevant sample data then save as .xlsx from Project. This gives you a template format so make sure your Access columns have teh same names etc, which you can do
 in the View.<br />

            <p>Done that. &nbsp;Here is the issue. If I right click a query and export to excel I get something that looks like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5e7f8b8-1d8c-46a2-9df0-bef8ba89e145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5e7f8b8-1d8c-46a2-9df0-bef8ba89e145" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I output the same query to a spreadsheet using VBA I get this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d2a6992-5817-40ec-8d96-22919f813a61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d2a6992-5817-40ec-8d96-22919f813a61" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note: the beautiful formatting, background fill and bold on the first row, centering, word wrap, etc.</p>
<p>All great enhancements.</p>
<p>The top output will import into Project. &nbsp;The bottom will not. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Project can't find the field names in the header.</span></p>
<p>Generally I can re-save the bottom into a .csv and get that to import, but not consistantly. It also creates a cumbersome extra step for the user that must be documented, trained....remembered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question comes down to, how do I export the top "un-formatted" spreadsheet via VBA. Nothing in the docmd statement</p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; DoCmd.OutputTo acOutputQuery, "qry_POAM_Output_To_Excel_for_Project", acFormatXLSX, Location_Chosen, True &nbsp; &nbsp;(the last two parameters are just where to save it and open excel when done)<br />
<p>implies anything about format that I can see, unless that is setup somewhere else. &nbsp;How do I get right of the gorgeous formatting help that MS has so kindly provided, that kills the import?</p>
