<h2>            Customize the message when adding a contact</h2>
                    I have sent a request to someone, but I had to change my greeting message, and I accidentaly sent the request before I changed the message. Now, every other time when I remove that person form contacts and try to send request again, the program automatically
 sends the defaults message, and I don't get the chance to change it. Did anyone else had this problem, and does anybody know how to solve this? Thank you in advance!

<h2>            Office 365 for Business</h2>
                    <p><strong>Theoretical IT Training Question Regarding the Setup of&nbsp; Office 365 Administration Dashboard&nbsp; -&nbsp; For Administration of Emails (using the Exchange Server Online services)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi everyone.&nbsp; I want to understand how to&nbsp; <strong>"Link"</strong>&nbsp; (Connect) Office 365 Business&nbsp; ... (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>the Exchange Online Serve</em></span>r),&nbsp; to be able to
<strong>"see"</strong>&nbsp;(administer) my local office Domain Workstations (for email related stuff).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am trying to figure out how a System Administrator would typically set things up in order for this Link to be established</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Suppose i have the following setup:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>An office with say 500 Employees and their own Workstations&nbsp; (this number is irrelevant)</p>
<p>A powerful physical Server running <em><strong>VMware's Vsphere</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Suppose that I have defined one <strong>VM</strong> on VSphere to be running Windows Server 2016 with Active Directory Domain Services and it has been promoted to Domain Controller.&nbsp; &nbsp; Let us further suppose, like most modern day company setups ... that
 my Organization has registered a Domain Name for my company through an ISP&nbsp; (like say GoDaddy).&nbsp; &nbsp;Let us imagine I have registered my Domain as
<strong>MicroSite.net</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So in my local office I have set my Root Domain Name = MicroSite.net<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>So therefore, in my Office, this Physical Dell Server machine (running Vsphere)&nbsp; has one VM defined to be my Domain Controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>So here are some questions i need help with.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>from the little I understand...&nbsp; on the Office 365 Administration Dashboard,&nbsp; in order to link Office 365 Exchange Online Server to my local domain,&nbsp; it will basically ask for two key pieces of information&nbsp; (according to what a Technician told me)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1)</strong>&nbsp; I need to provide the Domain Name I have registered and I am using for my local domain.&nbsp; in this example scenario, we said it was&nbsp; MicroSite.net&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;-- this I need to provide to Exchange Server online&nbsp; (on the administration dashboard)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2)&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;Then from what I understand, I also need to provide something called an MX Record&nbsp; (which is like a text field) that I believe is established (provided to me) by a Domain Name Server which is providing Domain Name Services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Item 1 above is pretty clear.&nbsp; We registered a domain with an ISP&nbsp; (called it&nbsp; MicroSite.net)&nbsp; and supplied it to Exchange Server online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Item 2 is not so clear to me, and I need a little help understanding this part.&nbsp; You see... from what I understand, this MX Record is something I need to setup&nbsp; (and it is usually supplied by a Server that is providing Domain Name Services).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So does this mean that on my local physical server&nbsp; (the Dell machine that is Running Vsphere)...&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That in addition to that first&nbsp; Defined VM I am running which is providing Domain Controller services....</p>
<p>that I would need to define another VM ... let's again imagine running a copy of Windows Server 2016 ... and then on this second VM I would activate&nbsp; Domain Name Server&nbsp; (or Domain Name Services) .... and hence as a result of this Domain Name Server that
 I setup on my Vsphere ... somewhere on this VM I would be able to define (or use a pre-existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>MX Record?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then with this MX Record in hand ... then I would simply provide this MX Record to the Exchange Server Online&nbsp; (through the Office 365 Administration Dashboard)?&nbsp; &nbsp;And then this will help the Office 365&nbsp; (Exchange Server Online) to be able to&nbsp; "SEE"&nbsp;
 &nbsp;(link&nbsp; and connect with) my local domain in my office?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once such a link is established, then I believe I could&nbsp; "Migrate"&nbsp; my local company User Domains&nbsp; &nbsp;(using a User Domain Migration function that should be available on the Office 365&nbsp; Exchange Server online tools)&nbsp; ... and this way Office 365 can then manage,
 track and establish email policies for my local office workstation users?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you so much to anyone who can help me fill in any gaps in my knowledge about any of the things mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key is that I am trying to make sure that all my Email Administration for my local company&nbsp; (the physical workstations and users in my office)... can be&nbsp; "Managed"&nbsp; (controlled) from the Office 365 online Dashboard.... such that as long as I have access
 to the internet, I can log into my Office 365 Dashboard from any part of the world, and perform my Office 365 Administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>

            Hello Alexander !
<br />
<br />Let's Suppose you have your domain on an Exchange 2016 mail server on premises. Right now you should have an MX record in your hosting service that points to your server, say domain.net.
<br />
<br />Then you decide to use Office 365. In effect, you have to add the domain in Office, as you said.
<br />
<br />You can either migrate the organization to Exchange online or you can use a hybrid configuration, in which local mailboxes and cloud mailboxes coexist.
<br />
<br />The MX record is the address where your organization wants to receive your mail, and it is placed in the hosting service.
<br />
<br />
<br />When someone sends an email to domain.net, the records in the hosting provider indicate where "domain" lives and directs them there.
<br />
<br />The mail in that case can be left pointing to your old mail server on premises or change the mx record to point to Office, which is the recommended option. It would look something like this: domain-net.mail.protection.outlook.com. This option is recommended so that Exchange online takes over the spam protection.
<br />
<br />
<br />Assuming that you decide on the hybrid option, the administration of the mailboxes migrated to Office would be performed in the Office.com portal (transport rules, forwarding, audits, message trace, etc.), however, the attributes would be managed from the local servers. Local servers are the source of authority.
<br />
<br />Local mailboxes will continue to be managed on the on-premises server, and synchronized mailbox attributes will be managed by the Active Directory. So you would need access to local servers
<br />
<br />Basically, if you keep an AD and / or Exchange server, you will need to access those servers
<br />
<br />For total cloud management, you need to migrate everything to the cloud.

<p>Hello dear Germain,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;thank you so much for your kind reply.&nbsp; But I think I need to understand a few&nbsp; &nbsp;Basics about all Mail Administration and Setup stuff before I could understand the more advanced concepts from your reply.&nbsp; So allow me to explain and then you can kindly educate
 me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bear in mind that I don't have any experience with the scenario I am about to describe, so if I am missing any details below in anything I say, be sure to educate and enlighten me.</p>
<p>============================================</p>
<p>For a Traditional Mid to Large sized Office Setup.... Let's say we have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>An office premise with say 500 Employees and their own Workstations that they use in their cubicles</p>
<p>We would likely also have a powerful <strong>physical Server </strong>
(say from Dell or Cisco) and its running&nbsp;<em><span>VMware's Vsphere</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Suppose that I have defined one&nbsp;<span>VM</span>&nbsp;on VSphere to be running Windows Server 2016 with Active Directory Domain Services and it has been promoted to Domain Controller.&nbsp; The Domain Root Name =&nbsp;
<strong>MicroSite.net&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>let's say that this Domain of&nbsp; MicroSite.net&nbsp; is registered through an ISP provider like&nbsp; GoDaddy.com</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>This office could be using any kind of email services to manage its Emails.&nbsp; It could be using
<strong>IMAP Server</strong>, <strong>Pop Server</strong> or the traditional (and often more sophisticated and difficult to setup and maintain)&nbsp;
<strong>Microsoft Exchange Server 2016.</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;For any of these three types of Mail Servers (services)... I think that another VM would need to be defined, say again running the Windows Server 2016 operating system... and then on top of that Server 2016,
 we could install one of these three types of email services?&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Is my assumption about setting up a VM in this way (to provide email capabilities for my local office premise) correct?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Next, I move on to some other details that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
I am not at all clear on or have a background in</span>.&nbsp; This has to do with DNS (Domain Name Servers.)&nbsp; All I know about a Domain Name Server is that such a server is responsible for helping translate the web url's that we type into say a Browser, into a
 corresponsing IP address.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ehm...&nbsp; now...&nbsp; &nbsp; If I have an ISP provider that is hosting my Domain Name&nbsp; ( in this example MicroSite.net), that means that this ISP&nbsp; (GoDaddy) has a Server that is providing DNS services to my local office right?&nbsp; &nbsp;And
 I would imagine that this also means that GoDaddy's&nbsp; Domain Name Server will have an MX Record associated with that DNS ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here is where things get really confusing for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was under the impression that even my own organization (locally on premise, on my physical Vsphere machine), would need to have its own&nbsp; DNS server.&nbsp; &nbsp; I say this because how else can my ISP&nbsp; (GoDaddy) be able to route
 emails to my local Domain (on-premise) if they are not able to&nbsp; "See"&nbsp; my Server?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is where I had thought that I need to install a DNS server so i can have an MX Record, that I could then provide my ISP&nbsp; (for them to route emails to my domain)?&nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp;If this is not accurate... then perhaps the MX Record for my local domain is provided to me be an Email Server&nbsp; (something like IMAP Server, POP Server, or Microsoft Exchange Server 2016) ?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But in any case, it seems to me in my mind ... that in order
 for a&nbsp; &nbsp;"Link"&nbsp; &nbsp;(connection) to be established for "Hand-Shaking" to occur (transfer of emails to occur) between let's say my ISP provider&nbsp; (GoDaddy)&nbsp; and my local Domain,&nbsp; that I need to have my own&nbsp;</p>
<p>MX Record&nbsp; ... and cannot use any MX Records that might possibly be coming from my ISP?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now... once I can understand the above concepts about DNS servers, MX Records etc...&nbsp; &nbsp; Then I will need to advance this idea just a bit further in order to understand how Office 365 Services could be utilitized as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that since GoDaddy would be hosting a Domain For me:&nbsp; &nbsp;Recall my Domain Root Name = MicroSite.net</p>
<p>and since I also will have some way of generating my own Local Premise&nbsp; MX Record....</p>
<p>
</p><p>then I could simply logo into Office 365 Administration Dashboard, get into the Exchange Server Online area, and provide these two key pieces of information about my local premise infrastrcture and Domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this would mean that I would provide my Domain Name of:&nbsp; &nbsp;MicroSite.net</p>
<p>and I would also need to provide somebody's MX Record.&nbsp; Notice I say Somebody's because I am not sure if this&nbsp;</p>
<p>MX Record would also be provided to me by my GoDaddy ISP,&nbsp; or if it is my own MX Record that I have to create somehow locally on my domain&nbsp; (either by configuring my own DNS Server, or having my local Microsoft Exchange
 Server provide me that )?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So really the only thing I am really confused about is this notion about a Domain Name Server and an MX Record.&nbsp; And I am also confused as to where (from what location) this MX Record is coming from?&nbsp; &nbsp; Seems to me like
 if I want the Office 365 Exchange Server Online, to be able to&nbsp; "Link"&nbsp; (communicate) with my local Exchange Server (and hence my Domain Emails for my employees)...&nbsp; then I would need to provide my OWN&nbsp; &nbsp;MX Record that has been installed and configured on
 my local VSphere server&nbsp; (and not coming from my GoDaddy ISP)..... </p>
<p>
</p><p>So please clarify me on these details because as I say... I think my ISP&nbsp; (GoDaddy) would only be hosting a Domain Name&nbsp; of&nbsp; MicroSite.net&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...&nbsp; but the MX Record that I need to provide to your Office 365 Exchange Server
 Online is NOT coming from the GoDaddy&nbsp; DNS Server, but that I get this MX Record from some other component in my own local premise domain and server environment&nbsp; &nbsp;(either from my Mail Server, or from a DNS server that I need to install and activate)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>First, if you are really working in an organisation with 500 users, I would believe that email is going to be a fundamental and business critical part of daily operations. From the two emails that you wrote, my opinion is it its better for you to work with
 a partner, as your understanding is really too rudimentary to diagnose any problems should they occur. For that effect, I suggest paying an experienced office365 partner to help you setup your office365 and migrate your email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I think you are overthinking things. Office365 has been a round for a long time and the user setup has been much simplified. If your domain host is godaddy it is even easier, as Office365 will be able to connect with godaddy and automatically setup
 your basic DNS settings for you to allow Office365 to run - but that is for a basic O365 deployment, and yours may be far from basic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some comments on your post -</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>"This office could be using any kind of email services to manage its Emails.&nbsp; It could be using&nbsp;</em></span><em><span>IMAP Server</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>Pop Server</span><span>&nbsp;or

<p>
</p><p><span>Answer : Office365 is a family of "Software As a Service" products from Microsoft. The&nbsp;Email component is Exchange Online. Like Gmail or Hotmail or Yahoo mail, this service is entirely provided by Microsoft and does
 not require any on-premise or&nbsp;virtualised servers for it to operate.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Next, I move on to some other details that&nbsp;I am not at all clear on or have a background in.&nbsp; This has to do with DNS (Domain Name Servers.)&nbsp; All I know about a Domain Name Server is that such a server is responsible for helping translate the web url's
 that we type into say a Browser, into a corresponsing IP address. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>Ehm...&nbsp; now...&nbsp; &nbsp; If I have an ISP provider that is hosting my Domain Name&nbsp; ( in this example MicroSite.net), that means that this ISP&nbsp; (GoDaddy) has a Server that is providing DNS services to my local office right?&nbsp; &nbsp;And I would imagine that this also
 means that GoDaddy's&nbsp; Domain Name Server will have an MX Record associated with that DNS ?"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Answer : Who is hosting your domain? And who is hosting your DNS Server? Your DNS Server contains a directory of information required to interact with the internet services subscribed by your company. Office365 will require you to insert a number of entries
 into your DNS, firstly to prove that you own the domain (they will try reading these entries from the internet after you insert them). Then they will require you to enter the entries for SPF, Autodiscover, and the rest of the services like Skype for business.
 For more advanced setting, you may want to also insert entries for email sender authentication (ie DKIM and DMARC). All this would be better explained to you by a deployment partner that you work with.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I assume that since GoDaddy would be hosting a Domain For me:&nbsp; &nbsp;Recall my Domain Root Name = MicroSite.net</em></p>
<p><em>and since I also will have some way of generating my own Local Premise&nbsp; MX Record...."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Answer : No you do not generate your own MX Record. A&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">MX record is used to tell the world which mail servers (in your case&nbsp;Exchange Online) accept incoming mail for your domain and where
 emails sent to your domain should be routed to. So Microsoft will provide you the MX record&nbsp;during Office365 provisioning, and you insert this record into your DNS.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A hybrid deployment is even more complex as this involves routing mail between a on-premise exchange and exchange online. On top of that, there is the issue of authentication with your on-premise
 AD.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Based on your level of understanding (gathered from the two posts you made so far), the technical skills required to deploy an exchange Online Hybrid for a 500 user company, in my opinion,
 is far more complex than what you know now.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As a conclusion, work with an experienced partner that has proven track record deploying Office365 in a Exchange Hybrid&nbsp;environment. &nbsp;You get this wrong, everyone will have mail issues and
 will&nbsp;have significant impact to your&nbsp;organization.</span></span></p>

<br />we could install one of these three types of email services?Is my assumption about setting up a VM in this way (to provide email capabilities for my local office premise) correct?....."
<br />
<br />Absolutely. You could use  any of the three protocols.
<br />
<br />
<br />......."Next, I move on to some other details that I am not at all clear on or have a background in.  This has to do with DNS (Domain Name Servers.)  All I know about a Domain Name Server is that such a server is responsible for helping translate the web url's that we type into say a Browser, into a 
<br />corresponsing IP address.  
<br />Ehm...  now...    If I have an ISP provider that is hosting my Domain Name  ( in this example MicroSite.net), that means that this ISP  (GoDaddy) has a Server that is providing DNS services to my local office right?   And 
<br />I would imagine that this also means that GoDaddy's  Domain Name Server will have an MX Record associated with that DNS ?"
<br />Now here is where things get really confusing for me.
<br />I was under the impression that even my own organization (locally on premise, on my physical Vsphere machine), would need to have its own  DNS server.    I say this because how else can my ISP  (GoDaddy) be able to route 
<br />emails to my local Domain (on-premise) if they are not able to  "See"  my Server?     This is where I had thought that I need to install a DNS server so i can have an MX Record, that I could then provide my ISP  (for them to route emails to my domain)? "....
<br />
<br />
<br />Some organizations manage their own DNS records, but is not necessary. Most rely on third parties  Hosting providers, like GoDaddy.
<br />The MX record is just the address of your mail server,  it points to the public IP address of the mail server. 
<br />
<br />So when I ask on the internet where to deliver a message to MicroSite.net, GoDaddy, who has all the info about that domain, will reply: MicroSite.net lives in the IP 123.456.78 
<br />
<br />In Godday it looks like this :
<br />
<br />MX:MicroSite.net
<br />Pref	Hostname	IP Address	TTL	
<br />10	MicroSite.net	123.456.78      60 min
<br />	                                 	
<br />   
<br />........" If this is not accurate... then perhaps the MX Record for my local domain is provided to me be an Email Server  (something like IMAP Server, POP Server, or Microsoft Exchange Server 2016) ?     But in any case, it seems to me in my mind ... that in order 
<br />for a   "Link"   (connection) to be established for "Hand-Shaking" to occur (transfer of emails to occur) between let's say my ISP provider  (GoDaddy)  and my local Domain,  that I need to have my own
<br />MX Record  ... and cannot use any MX Records that might possibly be coming from my ISP?......" 
<br />
<br />-There is no mail transfer between Godaddy and the mail server. Go Daddy just tells the people on the Internet where you live in , in this case, you "live" in the IP  123.456.78  but you can "live" in Microsoft, or Google or in your local server
<br />
<br />IMAP Server, POP Server, or Microsoft Exchange ... these are protocols.. is like how you'd like your movie?: rental, ownership, physical bluray, digital download... is all about the same movie.  Is the same with the protocols
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />....." Now... once I can understand the above concepts about DNS servers, MX Records etc...    Then I will need to advance this idea just a bit further in order to understand how Office 365 Services could be utilized as well.
<br />
<br />I assume that since GoDaddy would be hosting a Domain For me:   Recall my Domain Root Name = MicroSite.net
<br />and since I also will have some way of generating my own Local Premise  MX Record....
<br />
<br />then I could simply logo into Office 365 Administration Dashboard, get into the Exchange Server Online area, and provide these two key pieces of information about my local premise infrastrcture and Domain......" 
<br />
<br />No, you can't . The mail flow is determined by the MX record in Godaddy , not  the Office administration panel.  The administration panel show the MX record required to receive your mails in Office, but is Goddady who gives the instruction.
<br />
<br />When I ask on the Internet about your domain MicroSite.net, Godday is who gives the answer. 
<br />
<br />You can tell Godaddy :  I live in this on premises mail server:
<br />
<br />MX:MicroSite.net
<br />Pref	Hostname	IP Address	TTL	
<br />10	MicroSite.net	123.456.78      60 min
<br />
<br />Or I live in Microsoft 
<br />
<br />MX:MicroSite.net
<br />
<br />Name     Points to                                                                                        time to live
<br />@	        MicroSite.net.mail.protection.outlook.com (Prority: 0)	            1   hour
<br />
<br />
<br />(look the capture of my MX record which is  actually is in Godaddy pointng to Office)
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />"......So this would mean that I would provide my Domain Name of:   MicroSite.net
<br />and I would also need to provide somebody's MX Record.  Notice I say Somebody's because I am not sure if this
<br />MX Record would also be provided to me by my GoDaddy ISP,  or if it is my own MX Record that I have to create somehow locally on my domain  (either by configuring my own DNS Server, or having my local Microsoft Exchange 
<br />Server provide me that )?
<br />
<br />
<br />Your MX is yours. Your mails service is who can tall you which MX needs in order to receive mails. When you go to Office admin panel , it tells you: "If you want to receive mails here, set this MX in Godaddy:  MicroSite.net.mail.protection.outlook.com
<br />
<br />My Organization for instance , is in in fact in  Office 365  and my hosting provider is Godaddy . In Godaddy , my MX looks like this: (attached picture is my real domain in Godaddy)
<br />
<br />MX	
<br />Name     Points to                                                                                        time to live
<br />@	         mydomain-com.mail.protection.outlook.com (Prority: 0)	            1   hour
<br />
<br />
<br />I told Godaddy that I live in Microsoft, but in your scenario, you can tell them that you live in the local server number 123.456..78
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />So really the only thing I am really confused about is this notion about a Domain Name Server and an MX Record.  And I am also confused as to where (from what location) this MX Record is coming from?    
<br />
<br />The MX is just the address where your organization lives.  The DNS iis like a phone book. If I'm looking for MicroSite.net, , the dns points me to Godaddy, and go Daddy  "tells me" that MicroSite.net lives in Microsoft, or Google or in the local server  123.456..78
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />......"Seems to me like  if I want the Office 365 Exchange Server Online, to be able to  "Link"  (communicate) with my local Exchange Server (and hence my Domain Emails for my employees)...  then I would need to provide my OWN   MX Record that has been installed and configured on 
<br />my local VSphere server  (and not coming from my GoDaddy ISP)..... 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />OK the next thing is the link between your local server and your cloud server.  Well, that is achieved through "connectors".  If you decide to receive 
<br />your mails in the local server, the mails to  cloud mailboxes will flow through "connectors" to  "cloud users" 
<br />Or if you want to receive your mail in Office (which is the recommended option because of the anti-spam)  the mails to local users will go down through the mentioned connectors to you on premises mailboxesâ€¦. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />So please clarify me on these details because as I say... I think my ISP  (GoDaddy) would only be hosting a Domain Name  of  MicroSite.net     ...  but the MX Record that I need to provide to your Office 365 Exchange Server 
<br />
<br />No, Goddady hosts your MX too,  and your www , https, cname, txt and so on â€¦. Let's say tomorrow you decide to switch to Google. Well, you go to Godaddy and change the MX record to point to google and that's it. You mails will be directed to Googleâ€¦
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope it  hepls !

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have purchased 10 apps over the time and to save on storage space I would delete them and reinstall them through the
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">windowsphone.com</span></strong> account on my PC, using the push notifications.Now the website keeps transferring me to the Microsoft website.</p>
<p>I can no longer find the reinstall option next the apps on my order history list, and some apps are not listed and few don't display name or details.</p>
<p>I've been trying for the past 3 days, and figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had my &nbsp;windows phone for over 2 years now and only yesterday I upgraded it from 8.0 to 8.1 hoping to solve this problem.</p>

<p>If I'm correct there should be a menu item 'My apps' or 'My Library'. This will show the apps you previously purchased/installed on any of your windows phones. You can re-install from there.</p>

And note, this is on a Macbook. How do I fix this?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2cd1056d-9b1c-4a58-8467-719464380d22?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2cd1056d-9b1c-4a58-8467-719464380d22?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>It sounds like Word may be trying to automatically recover a file that causes it to crash.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To break the cycle, hold the SHIFT key down (or the OPTION key, I forget which) when you click Word's dock icon to open Word. This bypasses the attempt to automatically recover files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that works, then you can go to the AutoRecover location and delete the damaged file. This article details the location of the AutoRecover files:</p>

Hi,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.123buy.com/cart.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.123buy.com/cart.aspx</a>&nbsp;works fine for me with Tracking Protection enabled. I added an item to the cart as a visitor (no account or login) and was able to view it in the cart.. Also I do not have any
 toolbar addons like the google toolbar...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I see that you are using the Google Urchin Tracker in your page scripts..... mmm have a look at the urchin tracker scripts... it passes the Google Account ID from the Google toolbar&nbsp;to the google analytics servers... you have not provided your google webmaster
 account details...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var _gaq = _gaq || [];<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-XXXXX-Y']); // Need Google account ID.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>see webmaster.google.com for instructions to add the urchin tracker scripts to your pages.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>this however should not be a showstopper... but regardless the first step in troubleshooting IE issues is to test in noaddons mode....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You should test again in noAddons mode..... If you do have the GTB installed go to toolbar.google.com and download and install the latest version.... there are considerable changes to the IE Security since the GTB for IE8 was released.... mmm.... you are
 probably missing the updates for the GoogleToolbarUpdateNotifier.exe... my strongest suggestion is to update your GTB to the latest version.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You are not using client cookies to store the cart lines, so browser cookie settings (Internet Options&gt;Privacy tab) is not an issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can also try</p>
<p>Internet Options&gt;Security tab, click "Reset all zones to default"</p>
<p>Trusted Sites Icon, "Sites" button, remove your site <a href="https://www.123buy.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.123buy.com</a> from the list of trusted sites.... IE has a security zone setting to prevent navigation to a zone of lower integrity....Other browsers do not have the security zone model of Ie, so you should target your site to work in the IE Internet
 Zone..... https will still work in the Internet zone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>IE10's Tracking protection blocked</p>
<p>SEC7114: A download in this page was blocked by Tracking Protection.<br />
<a href="https://ssl.google-analytics.com/ga.js" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ssl.google-analytics.com/ga.js</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>but this did not affect my outcome....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To debug your web pages in IE10, press f12 to display the developer tool, then select the Console tab and refresh the page to display any suppressed error messages.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I found no markup errors of consequence, and no script errors of consequence... as I said the cart page worked fine for me...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Post technical questions about html, css or scripting for website development to the MSDN IE Web Development forum... Include in your question a link to your website or a mashup and instructions to reproduce the issue...</p>

    <title>Not receiving Notfications for new Skype For Business &#40;and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Not receiving Notfications for new Skype For Business &#40;and Lync&#41; Messages</h2>
                    
<p>I am testing out the functionality of Skype for Business for our business and I am having some troubles. I am currently signed into Skype for Business apps on an iPad, my iPhone, and my PC. I have also been trying with Lync 2011 for Mac.</p>
<p>When I send someone a message, I do not receive the reply unless I have the app actively running on the device I sent it from. If I hit my home button and put the app in the background, I always then receive a Missed Conversation email and the message does
 not go to any of my devices. To me it looks like there is a syncing issue, I don't always show all messages sent on all devices either. I am wondering if we have something setup incorrectly (using Office 365 for Education plan).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any troubleshooting tips or ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi CoryBowers,</p>
<p>Base on your description, Iâ€™d like to collect some information:</p>
<p>1. On your PC and Lync 2011 for Mac, did you click the sleep for your computers or you always open the computers, but cannot receive replies?<br />
2. For your mobiles and IPad, may I confirm whether the issue occurs under the different networks? I will do some tests.
<br />
3. About â€œI always then receive a Missed Conversation emailâ€, you mean you can find the Missed Conversation email in Outlook clients?<br />
4. When you mentioned that you cannot receive any messages when the app is in the background, if you activate it again, can you see these messages?</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>

<p>1. It does not matter if the computers have gone to sleep or not. As soon as I minimize the app or in the case of iOS devices hit the menu button and go to a different app, a reply never makes it to my devices. If I get a response, I receive a Missed Conversation
 email.</p>
<p>2. I believe I also have troubles with it at home as well as at work behind a firewall, but I will try some troubleshooting at home.</p>
<p>3. Yes, I receive an email in my Outlook client saying I missed a message, usually in reply to something I sent.</p>
<p>4. The messages do not always reach my device. Sometimes they do load, but many times do not. Right now, if I look at one conversation on my iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Windows PC they all have different endpoints.
</p>
<p>Email - Missed Conversation email with the reply</p>
<p>Lync 2011 on Mac - None of the conversation, had the app running in the background.</p>
<p>iPhone - Do not have the reply, only what I sent to the other person (this is the device I sent the message on). iPhone had app running in the background.</p>
<p>iPad - None of the conversation. Had the app running in the background.</p>
<p>Shouldn't they all stay in sync? If I look at past conversations, sometimes they sync but usually they don't.</p>

<p>Hi Cory,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I made a summary based on your description: You send an instant message to someone via Skype for Business on iPhone, and then you hit the menu button to minimize the app. When someone replies to you, you donâ€™t get the reply, but you receive the missed conversation
 email in the Outlook client.</p>
<p>If my summary meets your situation, itâ€™s a common issue. When you are offline, offline messages will be sent to you in the form of missed conversation mails.</p>
<p>But if you hit Home button, will the Apple server make you offline? I suggest you involve the Apple server for more assistance.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Monique</p>

<p>Your summary is accurate. </p>
<p>I dont understand, it is a Microsoft developed app. The app should be communicating directly with Microsoft's Skype/Lync servers, it should not have anything to do with "Apple's servers".
</p>
<p>I guess then I don't see the point of even having a mobile app if it won't run in the background like every other communication/social app.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s based on my experience (we donâ€™t have confirmation from APPLE side), &nbsp;when we click on â€œhomeâ€ &nbsp;, the application goes to offline . so IM message send as a missed-message-mail.</p>
<p>Iâ€™d like to confirm this with our backend team side. &nbsp;Back to you if I have any updates.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Neo</p>

    <title>Microsoft OneDrive error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doctor-who  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft OneDrive error</h2>
                    <p>I know that the subject line is very generic, but so is the error message. In fact, it's too generic to have any real idea as to what's going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Office 365 Home Edition license. It comes with OneDrive. The OneDrive app in the system tray indicates everything is fine. All files syncing is caught up. All's right with the world. But, when I enter "OneDrive" in the Search textbox I get this
 generic error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6902119d-7e17-43bd-af54-83c9a81c84f4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6902119d-7e17-43bd-af54-83c9a81c84f4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Huh? How can I have a problem, of some sort (God only knows what), but not have a problem? What is the problem? Clearly, there's something wrong because OneDrive refuses to open, but the app in the system tray tells me all is good, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very confused. But also I can't use the OneDrive app. What's going on??</p>

            That does seem like a long time.
<br />
<br />There are two other steps to try - a reset of OneDrive, and if that doesn't work, an uninstall and reinstall.
<br />
<br />I'd suggest trying the reset first:
<br />
<br />To reset the OneDrive sync app:
<br />	
<br />	1. Press these two keys on your keyboard at the same time: Windows key and the R key. This will open the Run dialog box on your screen
<br />	2. Copy and paste this text into the Run window and press Enter:
<br />	
<br />	%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset
<br />	
<br />That will reset OneDrive
<br />After a couple of minutes, the OneDrive cloud icon should show in the system tray.
<br />	
<br />If it doesnâ€™t start, Click on Windows Start, then find OneDrive and start it

<h2>            Automatic updating for Office 2013 Click-to-Run is not automatically updating</h2>
                    <p>I am running the following (from the Account tab):</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Product Activated</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Professional 2013</p>
<p>"Updates are automatically downloaded and installed"</p>
<p>Version: 15.0.4454.1510</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the most recent Click-to-Run release is version 15.0.4551.1011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why won't it update automatically?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already tried disabling and then re-enabling Office Updates, to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe I am running the Click-To-Run version of Office (as opposed to a retail box version).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office updates are not listed when I run Windows Update from control panel.</p>

In the first part to get a handle on the problem we solve this: $120 each month for 5 years; with a 15% annual increase.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Now we note we have a geometric series&nbsp; a + ar + arÂ² + arÂ³ ..... where r = 1 * 15% (or 1+x using the named cells)</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
So in the second part we use a formula for the sum of a geometric series. And since the two approaches agree we pat ourselves on the back</p>

    <title>Difference&#58; Metadata Management&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Difference&#58; Metadata Management&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Forum</p>
<p>What is the difference between:</p>
<p>A) Term Store Management that Site Collection Administrators have access to via Site Settings on: (<a href="https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/SiteCollection/_layouts/15/termstoremanager.aspx)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">yourdomain.sharepoint.com/.../termstoremanager.aspx)</a>
 ?</p>

<p>B) Term Store that you can find on the Admin Center on: (<a href="https://yourdomain-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/termstoremanager.aspx)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">yourdomain-admin.sharepoint.com/.../termstoremanager.aspx)</a> ?</p>

<p>I am really confused on how has access to what and where (At what level) new terms should be created. I have read articles online e.g.
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-a-new-group-for-term-sets-2b6d2e1b-6b1f-43db-80dc-51ca777b3d17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 is better or why we have that in two places?</p>

<p>Hi Samer,</p>
<p>If you create groups including term sets in a site collection -&gt;site settings-&gt; term store management (<a href="https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/SiteCollection/_layouts/15/termstoremanager.aspx)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">yourdomain.sharepoint.com/.../termstoremanager.aspx)</a>,
 it means groups created here can only be used in this specific site collection.</p>
<p>If you create groups including term sets in SharePoint admin center -&gt; term store (<a href="https://yourdomain-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/termstoremanager.aspx)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">yourdomain-admin.sharepoint.com/.../termstoremanager.aspx)</a>, it means all groups created
 here can be used in all your site collection.</p>
<p>So, where to create them totally depends on your own situation. If you'd like to use the same groups including term sets in different site collections, the best practice is to create them in SharePoint admin center.</p>
<p>Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Sky Pei</p>

<h3> 6205  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Antimalware error 0x80070643</h2>
                    
<p>It seems like MSSE is unable to auto update itself. Every time it tries, it fails and writes errors to Event Viewer. Manual update trigered from Windows Update or MSSE itself it's working, but auto update not...</p>
<p>After error of <span>Microsoft Antimalware i will get always also Windows Update error</span></p>
<p>Pictures from my Event Viewer &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few notes after reading various forums regarding error 0x80070643:</p>
<p>- I have done just to resolve this issue clean installation of Windows 7 but without a success</p>
<p>- I DO NOT HAVE MS Office installed</p>
<p>- Besides these errors is my Event Viewer clean without any other errors. All services are by their default and working OK.</p>
<p>- I've tried also to delete folder C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution but id did not helped. This only clears updates history.</p>
<p>- It seems to be related to Windows Installer service, but IMO on my PC is everything with this service OK</p>

            <p>Hi Khristin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, you create a new Sway and want to share it with another user who has access to edit the Sway. However he cannot sign in with the organizational Office 365 account on the login.live page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check if you select share the Sway with Anyone with a link. In this case, when users clicks the link, they will be redirected to Microsoft login.live page. On this page, users need to sign in with their Microsoft accounts instead of organizational
 Office 365 accounts.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/289d09de-eea1-4be4-ab1d-672f3ca053f4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/289d09de-eea1-4be4-ab1d-672f3ca053f4" /></a></p>
<p>If you want the user to edit the Sway with his organizational Office 365 account, I suggest you follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Sign in to the Sway, click Share.</p>
<p>2. Selct Share with only my organization. </p>

            <p>Hello Millie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further assist you with your concern, you can perform a soft reset. This will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation.<br />
<br />
To perform a soft reset, you should have your phone turned on. Press and hold the
<strong>Volume</strong> <strong>down </strong>and <strong>Power </strong>button until your phone vibrates and restart. Please note that you shouldn't touch the device screen during the process not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears.<br />
<br />
For the detailed information of the steps, you can visit this link on <strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">How

                    I can not get the Quicktime plugin to show up in Internet Explorer 9 at all. I can see that the files are installed in the right spot. I have installed and uninstalled QT several times. Do I need to try uninstalling IE9?

            <p>I figured it out. The Quicktime plugin does NOT run in Internet Explorer 64-bit!! It will only run in the 32-bit version. That is because Apple only writes the Quicktime plugin for 32-bit operation. So, if you want to watch any website that uses QT, you
 MUST use the 32-bit version of Internet Explorer. Hope this helps others...</p>

            Thanks so much Andria for responding.<br />
I tried to access my Hotmail groups through both the apps and browsers&nbsp;&nbsp;(Explorer, Firefox, and Google Chrome) but cannot find the groups. I did not use Outlook.Com (except to access when already in Hotmail)&nbsp;but instead use Hotmail.com.<br />
The problem was noticed 2 days ago.<br />
I did sent group email on February 14, 2016.<br />
It is still not working.

            <p>I am having the same problem. Last week I discovered all of my groups were missing. I tried to log in from various browsers - nothing. In the end I manually made one of the groups again (very laborious!) and it worked fine.
</p>
<p>Today I have tried to send an email to the same group I made last week and it has disappeared again.</p>
<p>What is happening? I can't do this manually every time I want to send a group email...</p>
