<h2>            A Skype account was blocked due to wrong birth date</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have entered wrong year for my Skype account **************&nbsp; and now I can not access it any more.<br />
</p>
<p>Support links says I should have a parent permission to use it, so I was using the other account, logged into skype family,&nbsp;</p>
<p>added my other account as a child, and guess what - I need to pay something for this.. and I would pay the f.. 50 cents if I could use my card that is out of US!!<br />
<br />
Other way to unblock it, is to click on the link - <a href="https://account.live.com/ChildConsent/ChildLanding?ru=https://login.live.com/login.srf%3flc%3d1033%26sf%3d1%26id%3d292666%26tw%3d18000%26fs%3d0%26ts%3d-6%26sec%3d%26mspp_shared%3d1%26seclog%3d10%26claims%3d%26wa%3dwsignin1.0%26wp%3dMBI_SSL%26lw%3d1%26fl%3deasi2%26ru%3dhttps://account.microsoft.com/auth/complete-signin%253fru%253dhttps%25253a%25252f%25252faccount.microsoft.com%25252fprofile%26contextid%3d427F7F39A67545FB&amp;mkt=EN-US&amp;uiflavor=web&amp;id=292666&amp;uaid=0156fdc5f4d94db6a7983f07dcf3d9dd#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
I'm an adult. Why am I seeing this?</a>&nbsp;and I am asked to use a CC to validate my age.. but guess what, I can't use it as I am out of US!!<br />
<br />
How can I unblock my skype account?<br />
Thank you.</p>

<p>Good afternoon Juan_O789</p>
<p>
</p><p>My fried have exactly same problem as mentioned above. She already sent fax to mentioned number in MS guides. She did it 16/02/2018, but her Skype account is still blocked and she doesnt received any response what to do now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She tried also to unblock her Skype account using credit card, but she is from Czech Republic same as I am and her credit card information were not accepted as you are expecting only US cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please let me know what to do? I we tried to call to MS support numbers, no resolution was proposed/provide. I contacted MS chat support no solution was provided even proposed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly I am really confused that Microsoft such big international company is in 21st century using technology about 30 old to prove that person is adult, even if date entered to MS profile in this case was nonsense 01.01.2018, where person will be most
 probably not old 1,5 month where account is used from 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please let me know how to proceed? She really dont want to create new Skype account as she has already important contacts there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

<p>I couldn't unlock my account because their credit card method accept us cards only. This so stupid.. and I've described this in first post.. however their support gave me a link to the same stupid process that I've been through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly I had no option just to create a new account.</p>
<p>And like you said, you put an age that is like 1 month old kid and they don't have a f.. validation rule for this. They just assume there is a newborn who created an account and they wait for parents to approve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I imagine in 16 years to receive an email about Microsoft congratulating me that I can use Skype full features. :))</p>

            Using the link to change my birthdate has no effect. It accepts it and then when I check it again it shows the old state.

I spent 1h30 on the chat with someone who was totally useless. As a result, I still cant access my account.&nbsp;</p>

            As from May 2018 GDPR will come into play and Microsoft will have to respond to all requests on personal data. I am going to use this to free up my account or demand that they delete the data. In the meantime there is Slack, WhatsApp, WhateverIsNewTomorrow,

<h2>            Unable to play MSN Games</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:mr t</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have played on the msn games site for free for many years. I have primarily played hearts. Over the last 2 weeks the site has played up badly . Continuously told msn experiencing problems . Also very hard to gain access to games and when you do its always
 unrated and says that zero people are actually playing hearts; when they obviously are . when the game finishes it just resorts to saying their was a malfunction and you have been taken away from the site. I have been told that msn games is stopping all free
 access to games and that from now on their will be a yearly subscription and that is why the site is playing up because it is slowly shutting down. I live in London England and would be very grateful if anybody could enlighten me with what exactly is happening.
 Thankyou</p>

            I believe the feature you are looking for can be controlled in File menu &gt; Options command &gt; Trust Center option &gt; Trust Center settings ... button.
<br />
<br />There you can identify specific "trusted publishers", sources you trust. 
<br />
<br />Or  "trusted locations"
<br />
<br />Or "Protected View".  This sets read only based on where the files came from.

 retrieving the data, the title screen gives me that false message: (Not Responding). I am saying false because I still get the data in the same amount of time as the Windows XP Pro machine. And on that XP Pro machine, there is no such message. Is there a setting
 in Excel or Windows 7 (I am thinking about Timeout) that would prevent displaying that wrong message to users? They might think that Excel crashed and force a close on it. Any help would be really appreciated.

<h2>            I keep getting messages that my inbox is full and people are telling me that emails are bouncing back to them.</h2>
                    I have had the same account for years and recently got windows 8. Since then on several occassions I keep receiveing messages that my account is fast approaching its limit and to check the filters. I have duly deleated mail as it arrives and feel there
 is very little in my account compared to the past and yet the message comes back and people are finding that their mail is being bounced back to them. What else can I do when I seem to have very little in the account as it is, thanks&nbsp;

<br />
Thank you for contacting us.<br />
<br />
Regarding your concern, what exactly happened before the issue started? Are you not receiving emails from a specific account or domain (Outlook.com, Yahoo.com, Gmail.com, etc)?<br />
<br />
Please try to use a different account and send a test email message to your affected email address and see if it goes through or if you receive a bounce back email message.<br />
<br />
Also, in order for us to deeply investigate the issue, I initiated a private message for you. Please go to the Private message area for the instruction.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

Hi Ron I just double checked and it says I have over 2000 pages of sent emails. I know I have certainly not sent that many emails. It seems it has made duplicate copies of the same sent emails. Phone do I clear this. &nbsp;There is over 2500 pages :(

            <p>The Samsung mail app has the duplicating sent messages problem.&nbsp; There is an update that fixes the problem.</p>
<p>The Sony also has the problem and until Sony fixes their app, download and install the outlook.com mail app.&nbsp; Add your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The emails only send once.&nbsp; The syncing of the Sent folder messages in causing the duplicating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quickest way to delete the duplicates is to move the good emails to an 'old sent' folder, then right click on the Sent folder, Empty folder.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Update Software just refuse to install</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I would like to update my 6288 firmware but can't since the phone doesn't seem to have the first updating option, aka OTA option.<br />
<br />
There is the second option : Menu ---&gt; Settings ---&gt; Phones ---&gt; Phones Update ---&gt; Install Software Update.<br />
<br />
But I can't do that since I don't have the last firmware and can't find it anywhere on Nokia website.<br />
<br />
So I tryed the third option. The Nokia Update Software option but guess what ? It's NSU who don't install because of some error. I've these error codes :<br />
<br />
1) Install Shield Error 1603.<br />
<br />
2) And then this second error :<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://img502.imageshack.us/my.php?image=nokia02js2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg502.imageshack.us%2fimg502%2f4738%2fnokia02js2.th.png" /></a><br />
<br />
I would appreciate if someone was ready to help to use one of these 3 option.<br />
<br />
1) OTA Update<br />
2) Direct Update from the phone menu ( the best one I guess )<br />
3) Helping me to install properly NSU in order to finally doing the firmware update.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />
<br />
P.S : Club Nokia smartly told me to uninstall NSU and to reinstall it. I had already tryed this solution before emailing them.

<br />
Were you trying to upgrade PC Suite to 6.83 rel_14.1 from a previous version?<br />
<br />
If you've not used Nokia Software Updater before is Windows NET 2.0 or 3.0 FRAMEWORK installed? If you've loaded every Windows Update it is probably there, but is not a critical update and not on Xp install CD.<br />
<br />
I wonder whether remnants of previous version remain and perhaps you need to use Windows Installer Cleanup Utility - msicuu2.exe as mentioned in above article<br />
<br />
If you try to uninstall PC Suite 6.83 rel_14.1 you can remove core application but cable driver portion remains; these programs are "Nokia Connectivity Cable Driver" and "PC Connectivity Solutions"

            Hi scoobyman,<br />
<br />
Hey, great post, really. Many thanks.<br />
<br />
Ok, so here is the situation now :<br />
<br />
My PC Suite version was 6.82, and not 6.83. I've completely removed it, included all modem drivers and previous NPCS version with Windows Installer Cleanup Utility - msicuu2.exe ( Windows Script Host was deactivated because of XP Anti Spy and it took me 10
 minutes to find out why msicuu2exe was refusing to install ) as you told me to try.<br />
<br />
So now my machine is clean from all NPCS version. By the way, I've once again deactivated Windows Script Host with XP Anti-Spy for security purpose. If this WSH thing must be activated in order to use Nokia Update Software, just tell me and I will reactivate
 it once again.<br />
<br />
<br />
But for NPCS 6.83, unfortunately Nokia website doesn't propose me to install 6.83 l_14.1 but instead old 6.82 (
<a href="http://www.nokia.be/A4349226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.be/A4349226</a> ). I will make a 6.83 clean install when I'll have this version ( may be you can provide me with a link ? )<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
P.S : I've never used Nokia Software Updater before and Windows NET 2.0 or 3.0 FRAMEWORK isn't installed on my pc. Also, about the 1603 error, it's " point D " wich is my problem. Pretty odd since I've XP and not Win95/98/2000 as they're talking about.

            Hi antares<br />
<br />
You might like to visit this link concerning "install shield error 1603"<br />
<br />
<a href="http://consumer.installshield.com/kb.asp?id=Q111019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://consumer.installshield.com/kb.asp?id=Q111019</a><br />
<br />
Were you trying to upgrade PC Suite to 6.83 rel_14.1 from a previous version?<br />
<br />
If you've not used Nokia Software Updater before is Windows NET 2.0 or 3.0 FRAMEWORK installed? If you've loaded every Windows Update it is probably there, but is not a critical update and not on Xp install CD.<br />
<br />
I wonder whether remnants of previous version remain and perhaps you need to use Windows Installer Cleanup Utility - msicuu2.exe as mentioned in above article<br />
<br />
If you try to uninstall PC Suite 6.83 rel_14.1 you can remove core application but cable driver portion remains; these programs are "Nokia Connectivity Cable Driver" and "PC Connectivity Solutions"<br />
<br />
<br />
I've followed each step, I did everything what had to be done but the problem is still there. I just dont' know what to do next. Contacting Install Shield ?

<h3> james l. scheuren  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 &#47; Windows 7  Excel Crashing</h2>
                    I had links to an external website in an excel spreadsheet that worked fine until sometime last week.&nbsp; Now when I click on any web link, I get a pop up box that says "Excel has stopped working" and it crashes.&nbsp; I can open the same spreadsheet on other
 workstations and they (links) open normally.&nbsp; When I open Excel Options under Trust Center,&nbsp; even the link to "Microsoft Trustworthy Computing" crashes the application.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

            <span>Hi <strong>James</strong>,</span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try determining first if the issue is with the
<strong>Excel app itself</strong> or could be related to <strong>a specific spreadsheet</strong> only. Just to confirm, do you get the same behavior on
<strong>other Office apps</strong>, like Word, PowerPoint or Outlook? Is this happening to an
<strong>existing Excel file</strong> or even to a <strong>newly created spreadsheet</strong>? Can you verify the Office build and version that’s installed on your PC? See the
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></span></strong> for the steps on how to check it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the meantime, you may refer to this
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/excel-not-responding-hangs-freezes-or-stops-working-37e7d3c9-9e84-40bf-a805-4ca6853a1ff4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></span></strong> that discusses troubleshooting steps that
 can be performed when you encounter a not responding error and hangs at the same time. It’s advisable to try the methods there according to its order in the support article provided.</span></p>

<p>Hi Louis,</p>
<p>Per your message, this machine (Dell Optiplex 3020) is running Windows 7 Professional V. 6.1 Build 7601 SP1.&nbsp; This is an existing spreadsheet, not new.&nbsp; Spreadsheet is stored on a local server.&nbsp; I can access this spreadsheet from my other two machines (also
 Optiplex 3020) in the lab, one running W10, one running W7.&nbsp; No issues on those machines with the same spreadsheet.&nbsp; I am also unable to open links from Word docs (new or old) on this machine.&nbsp; See image attached, no error number given in popup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Vlookup failures when value exists - not the usual suspects, not spaces.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having trouble with lookup functions not working when there's some invisible formatting mismatch.&nbsp; The column of&nbsp;values I'm trying to match includes text,&nbsp;numbers and some&nbsp;numbers with leading&nbsp;zeros (therefore requiring the cell format to be TEXT).&nbsp;
 The visible formats that have been applied to the lookup values are varied and many as they originate from numerous sources.&nbsp; It's not a leading/trailing space problem.</p>
<p>It's not just vlookup, even a simple =A1=B1 returns FALSE when it should be true.</p>
<p>I've even tried copying the cells that should match and paste special values into A1 &amp; B1 in a new workbook, the equate still returns false.&nbsp; Len() and Trim() reveal nothing, nor does using CODE() to see the ascii of the numbers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It's still not a leading/trailing space problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found two 'solutions':</p>
<p>1) identify which cell has the hidden something wrong, copy a blank cell and paste special add onto the number.&nbsp; This adds 0 to the value in the cell clearing all formats in the process.&nbsp; There's no visible change to the cell but now the values match.</p>
<p>2) in the lookup function do this MATCH(D3&amp;"",'Sheet1'!$B$B,FALSE).&nbsp; Adding the &amp;"" makes the&nbsp;match work IF the hidden formatting is in the lookup value.&nbsp; If the hidden formatting is in the lookup range it still fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone explain what is going on?&nbsp; I'm hoping for an explanation that will allow me to write some VBA to set this hidden parameter on all cells to a known value.&nbsp; Then each time I receive a workbook for processing I can clean out this hidden irritation
 in one go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

</p><p>My system is looking for students who are absent from my college. When I put a date on an excel cell, then it shows absent students' roll looking as below:</p>
<p>Date: 1st July&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2nd July and&nbsp; &nbsp;so on.........</p>

<p>
</p><p>I want just an logic inclusion " consecutive absent column" of some students who are consecutively absent from college&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>See top data input:</p>
<p>For 2nd July, It has "consecutive absent"---2 days</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4th July has&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " consecutive absent"&nbsp; 4 days and I think you understand.</p>

<p>Dear Bernard,</p>
<p>Thanks for your kind response and at the same time I am so sorry that function does not work for my W7. And the consecutive days of Roll no. 5 (according to your table) will be 4 days. Because four consecutive "As" are&nbsp; sitting side by side and the rest
 is enough. Thanks for your arduously efforts. Please try another effort for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need more details, in order to assist you with the issue related to Outlook:</p>
<p>What is the type of email account configured in Outlook? (POP/IMAP/Exchange)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the steps below and check the result:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Remove and re-add the email account, check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>If the above steps fail, Open Outlook in safe mode and check the result:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hold <strong>Windows key + <strong>R. </strong></strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Copy and paste, or type the following command in the
<strong>Open box, and then press Enter:</strong></span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Outlook /safe</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>If the account is configured as POP type, then you may try scanning the PST file and check if it helps fix the issue:</p>

            This is a known issue (at least I know about it!)&nbsp; My solution is to use the small "x" (called an "instant action") that appears at the right end of the subject line instead of the large "X" that appears on the ribbon.&nbsp; I found that works more reliably.

            As I said, this is a problem Microsoft already knows about (I, for one, reported it).&nbsp; As in all cases like this, Microsoft will choose it's own time for issuing a fix.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 &#34;MrMAPI x86 stopped working&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am having issues with a 3rd party application sending emails from Outlook. This has worked in the past (as in&nbsp;less than 3&nbsp;months ago), so&nbsp;I ran the Microsoft Support &amp; Recovery Assistant for Office 365, and I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The operating system is not presently configured to run this application" This is the same error message I get when trying the send the email from the 3rd party software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then get the message: "MrMAPI x86 stopped working" but Microsoft doesn't have a "fix" for this problem.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I tried the "fixmapi" utility, but that doesn't seem to do anything at all. I have reinstalled Office; that didn't work either. Because I haven't had problems with the 3rd party software sending emails in the past (and that software
 has not changed), I have to believe that the problem lies with&nbsp;Outlook.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Any thoughts? I am at a&nbsp;loss!</p>

            It sounds like the third party software is no longer compatible with Outlook. You should contact the third party vendor to ensure their software is still compatible with Outlook.

<p>Thanks, Jason. I did contact the vendor, and it is still compatible with Windows, Office, Outlook, etc.&nbsp;That makes sense since the exact same software worked only a couple of months ago, but also because I get the same error when using the Microsoft Support
 tool without having any other software running.</p>

<p>I got it to work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the 3rd party software as Administrator and it let me send the email from that software thru Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't understand is this: I am logged in as administrator on my computer. Why do I have run the software "as Administrator" as well?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I found a new glitch. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I send the email from the 3rd party software and Outlook is closed, it will open Outlook and send the email. Outlook will then close. That is what it should do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if Outlook is already open, the 3rd party software will not send the email. This also means that I cannot send back-to-back emails even when Outlook is closed, because of the delay of the 3rd party software opening and closing every time it sends
 an email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have "run as administrator" set on all of the application files associated with the software. Is there a way to set ALL files associated with this program to "run as administrator"? Perhaps that isn't the issue? For now, I will use the "workaround" of
 not having Outlook open, but that isn't very efficient or practical for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions, I would appreciate it. Even if it's "file xxx doesn't appear to be working" so that I can go back to the 3rd party vendor with more information. I know there has to be a certain file that allows the 2 programs to "talk" to
 each other, but I have no idea what that is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Now another software program doesn't work - I have always been able to "scan to email" from my Fujitsu scanner. I can no longer as I get the same error message that I originally got from the other 3rd party software: "The operating system is not presently
 configured to run this application."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is clearly a Windows or Outlook problem.</p>

<p>Ok, here's the latest:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I run all 3rd party software (including my scanning software) as Administrator AND run Outlook as Administrator, then I am able to send an email through Outlook using the 3rd party software whether Outlook is currently open or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, this will be the end of it.&nbsp;Why, after literally 10 years of all of this&nbsp;software working perfectly together, did it suddenly stop working? The only variable is the Windows/Office updates that were pushed through in the past 2 months (because
 everything worked before then).&nbsp;I'm glad (hoping!) that it was a simple fix, but it took me hours and hours to get to that point. It's just like my mother used to say, "every time they "improve" something, they make it worse." VERY frustrating! /rant</p>

<p>
</p><p>Looking for some assistance.&nbsp; My client fired their IT person who was in the process of setting up an Office 365 account for them.&nbsp; It is being billed, so the credit card is attached.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to find a process to get it switched over to the main admin of the company.&nbsp; The previous IT person set the rescue email address to be his personal email address and his personal cell phone number.&nbsp;

I have been teaching myself VBA for 2 months and have cobbled together a series of code snippets to accomplish a number of tasks (may not look pretty), but the last of which is to copy a series of charts and gauges into a powerpoint. &nbsp;The code works fine on
 my machine, Windows 7, Excel and PPT 2013, but using the attached code it fails on other computers with earlier versions of Windows, excel and PPT, the code gives a selection.shaperange: Invalid request when it hits the "PPApp.ActiveWindow.Selection.</div>
<div>
</div>

The attached code is not optimum but it does work fine on my PC. &nbsp;Any ideas as to what is wrong with the lines of code associated with positioning the Gauges and Trend Graphs so it can work on prior versions of excel and powerpoint? &nbsp;Thanks.</div>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I have a related, but really annoying issue. &nbsp;I have a set of folders On My Computer that I used to store emails I received from a POP3 email account. &nbsp;The ISP upgraded all the old POP3 accounts to IMAP - much more useful across multiple devices! &nbsp; When
 I added the IMAP account, a new folder list was created. &nbsp;I decided to move my important folders from the On My Computer list of folders to the IMAP list of folders using drag and drop. &nbsp;All this worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, given that I had 500MB of emails and dozens of folders, it took time, much longer than I had allowed for. &nbsp;While it was slowly moving all these files, I edited some folder names and generally tidied things up, tossing out old emails and combining
 some folders. &nbsp;Obviously I should have not done this editing until the transfer had finished!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens now is that every 5 minutes (really annoying after 6-8 hours) I get an error yellow triangle message saying "The specified mailbox already exists" &nbsp;(&lt;name of offending mailbox&gt;) Error Code 1025. &nbsp;I have tried going on and off line deleting all
 the mailboxes with the offending name in the destination list, renaming them etc. &nbsp;I have also tried creating a new Main Identity. &nbsp;It seems to me that I need to get inside Outlook 2011 and stop the drag-and-drop function from trying to complete before the
 little error chime noise drives me crazy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello Medea,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my tests, if I reply someone’s email, the conversation will have a “show reply” button to remind you that you have replied this email. However, before he replied you, the sent emails will not be shown automatically in this conversation. After he
 replied you, the emails you sent before will show automatically in the conversatino. You can see the two screenshots below:

<p>My reply is that it is not feasible to meet your requirements, as this is a feature by design in Outlook for Mac client. I suggest you create a new vote in the

    <title>Putting a thumbnail picture of the first slide from other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bri7668  say:</h3>
<h2>            Putting a thumbnail picture of the first slide from other presentations on a slide</h2>
                    <p>I have a status PowerPoint presentation. On one slide I have hyperlinks to several other presentations. What I'd like to do is make each hyperlink be a live image of the first slide of the other presentations. Is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, right now when I'm building the status presentation, I must open each other presentation and manually take a screen capture of its first slide. Then paste that image into the status slide and link it to its presentation. The powers-that-be insist
 that they want the image, not just a link to the other presentation. Doing this manually each week takes a lot of time. Is there any way to have the hyperlink automatically "show" the first slide from each other presentation without my having to do the screen
 captures?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Brian</p>

<p>Short of having some custom VBA code written for you, the best thing I can think of is something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create screenshots as you would normally, but instead of pasting them directly into your status presentation, save them to files.&nbsp; Give the files names that you'll remember later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then in your status presentation, do Insert | Picture, select the picture to insert and then instead of clicking INSERT, click the downward pointing arrowhead/triangle next to it and choose INSERT AND LINK from the dropdown list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do this for each of the images you've saved to file.&nbsp; Then add your hyperlinks to the inserted pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, no time savings over what you're already doing, right?&nbsp; Right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But because you've linked and inserted the pictures, PPT will automatically update them whenever the original files change, so next month, you make and save your screenshots (to the SAME FILENAMES AS BEFORE!), open your status presentation and ... voila!&nbsp;
 It's already updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not totally automatic, but it might cut the amount of monthly work in half.</p>

<h3> badjjl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recover Outlook Password</h2>
                    <p>HI </p>
<p>I have forgotten outlook password and have tried filling in the form, but the form asks to fill in last emails details that I have sent.</p>
<p>But I cannot do this or answer this as I have not sent any recent emails as I mainly use my account to receive emails.
</p>
<p>I tried ringing Microsoft support but they say there is no telephone support for passwords and I must contact the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone at Microsoft help to reset my password ?</p>
<p>I have already tried the reset link but that just asks me to give a answer a memorable question that I cannot remember then forces me to attempt to fill in a form but I do not have the answers to that form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Meeting responses translated to Chinese</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something odd started happening yesterday in my Outlook 2011. The prefixes to my responses to meeting and appointment invitations, { Accepted: Tentative: Declined: } are being translated to Chinese. So instead of responding to the invitation with&nbsp;<em>Declined:
 Staff Meeting</em>, I'm sending&nbsp;<em>已拒绝: Staff Meeting</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this behavior? I've restarted Outlook and the Computer. I'm on 10.9.4. System language is set to US English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
                </div>

            <p>follow the steps in this link and restart the Mac in safeboot to check if there are any 3rd party softwares interfering with Outlook.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks you for the suggestion. Unfortunately it didn't work though. I'm going to do a permissions repair, and then maybe Disk Warrior. If that doesn't do it then I think I'll uninstall/reinstall Office.

            <div>That's an encoding issue somewhere along the way.</div>
<div>The encoding for the message changes somewhere between the moment you </div>

<div>I fear there isn't much you can do on your end though.</div>

            My email is with MS Hosted Office365. I just tried responding from Office365 online and the response was not encoded Chinese. So it seems that it is connected to my local Outlook 2011.

            <div>Well it all depends on how the client interprets the encoding on the </div>
<div>message and some apps are better than others at dealing with encoding </div>
<div>issues.</div>
<div>Where are you seeing that the message has some Chinese characters? On </div>
<div>the recipient computer? On your own Mac when you get a reply back?</div>

            <p>If I reply to a meeting or appointment invitation the Accepted: or Declined: part of the subject line is translated to Chinese. If I choose to respond with our without comments, the recipient that I send the response to sees the Chinese text in their inbox,
 and I see it in my sent mail folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I respond to the invitation from within the Office365 web site, the text is not translated.</p>
