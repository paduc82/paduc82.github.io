            Dear ManabenbraBiswas,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community using my experience with Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />If you are using Outlook.com in browser, try to use another browser, and In Private mode. Sometimes extensions or cookies can block authorization and cause problems. It is also recommended to clear cache and cookies from time to time. In this article you will find the way how to delete the cache and cookies for most of the browsers <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies</a>
<br />
<br />It is better to avoid Safari, Firefox and Chrome for this as there are lots of problems with browsers recently <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-...</a> That is why please test this in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer in Private (CTRL+SHIFT+P)
<br />
<br />If you are using Office Outlook, than try this:
<br />1. Try to open Outlook in safe mode <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-o...</a>
<br />2. Check for updates <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/instal...</a>
<br />3. Disable addins <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-m...</a>
<br />4. You can also try to repair Office <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair...</a>
<br />
<br />Also please get familiar with Fixes and workarounds for recent issues with Outlook <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-in-outlook-for-windows-ecf61305-f84f-4e13-bb73-95a214ac1230?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-...</a>

    <title>Hotmail no longer working with Android App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roamer12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail no longer working with Android App</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday morning email from 1 of my hotmail accounts (I have several) stopped synching/coming through to the Android Email app on both my Android devices - 1 is a Samsung wifi tablet, 1 is a Samsung smartphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Emails from another hotmail account kept on working with the app just as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked I had correct password by logging on through an internet browser, which worked just find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the account from the Android app on both devices, and tried to reinstall. I also turned off each device and restarted later. I've tried many times to add the account to the App, each time it says it cannot connect to the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've added another (3rd) hotmail account to the devices, it accepts these, these work no problem. It is only this 1 hotmail address which will not add.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked my hotmail account settings and made sure that 2-step verification is not activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the Outlook APP and successfully added the problem email to this, emails are coming through fine. I don't like the Outlook App and it won't synch to my Samsung Calendar - whereas the Android email app synchs beautifully with the calendar
 in the phone. I've tried adding the email/calendar address to the Android calendar but once again same message about not being able to access the account. This particular hotmail account contains all my calendar for my business, so it's a nightmare for me
 at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've received a 2 call backs from Microsoft. One said it was a Samsung issue. So why just one hotmail account?I'm currently in discussion on twitter with Samsung customer service. The second call back I requested said I should ask here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's only one particular hotmail account I'd guess it's a hotmail issue?Something in the settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed the appearance of some apps changing on my phone in the last 24 hours, which look like upgrades...........so I'm not sure if it's upgrades or hotmail being the problem. Or something quite different. When hotmail updated a few months ago I
 had issues across all my accounts with android, this time it's only one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help please?</p>

<p>Unfortunately I am still having the issue as many of you are as well. &nbsp;I started receiving emails again on Saturday but that was short lived. &nbsp;I have not received any emails on portable devices since that time</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many users are having success with creating alias but I have not gotten around to trying that work-around yet. &nbsp;Again that is a work-around and not a solution for a broken service. &nbsp;It may work for you and I would certainly recommend giving it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook is my primary method of personal email as I also use it for a a fraud detection aid. &nbsp;A couple of months ago I received a $2,400 confirmation email from Amazon for a purchase that I did not make. &nbsp;The notification came up on my watch and I was able
 to react immediately and stop the charge from going though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I received a email that I had requested to change my password to a site that I had not been on in 6 years. &nbsp;I did not get that email until 14 hours later after I signed into my laptop computer, which is not that often each day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think that Microsoft is aware of or even care about the amount of damage that they are causing to people who so desperately depend upon their email service</p>

            <p>Yes and know. I can pick up emails either via a username work around or using different email app. The work around doesn't work on one of my tablets. Result is I have emails coming through on several different apps, some to the same device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just need to use the Android app for everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Customer service from Samsung has been dreadful. They could have gotten the info needed in 30 minutes, instead of 48hrs of 2 hour gap direct messaging on twitter.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I suspect that if you were to create an alias using your existing *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account that this would work on all of your devices. &nbsp;Android, desktop, and iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only recommend the above suggestion while using any of the baked in OS mail clients. &nbsp;If it is a 3rd party app then mileage may vary. &nbsp;Unfortunately I believe that we may end up using the Alias workaround due to the hotmail/outlook conversion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck!</p>

            <p>Woke this morning to find my phone telling me that my password for the outlook alias was incorrect. I was bombarded with 'attempts to sign in security' emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These were genuine by the way - the phone app couldn't sign in. Each time I put the correct password in it declined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Signed in on PC with same password no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reveiwed security activity - the false sign in were my phone app trying to synch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have finally removed the outlook alias from my phone (the wrong password long in messages were overwhelming and stopping me from using the gadget).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have reinstated original hotmail.com account which has added just fine, but can't receive emails. It can send but not receive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original hotmail account has been working find on my Blackberry all throughout this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So stuck with android which can send only but not receive on the hotmail.com address for now!</p>

            Microsoft are moving Hotmail an Outlook.com to Office 365 without notifying us! In Android, the fix is to remove your account then add it in again as type Microsoft exchange active sync, and manually change the server from Hotmail or Outlook.com to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">outlook.</span><strong>office365</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">.com.</span>

    <title>Recent Files List in Excel 365 missing and do not synch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oscarluppi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recent Files List in Excel 365 missing and do not synch</h2>
                    <p>The list of recent files and pinned files on one of my Excel 365 installations was outdated and would not keep track of new files I opened.</p>
<p>I reset the list (first set to zero in Options) then reset cancelling all recents.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now it works locally and sporadically (most of the times, if I open a file and then close it it doesn't remain in the recent list).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And it doesn't synch with the other installations of Office 365 on my laptop (I am logged in).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I re-installed office already.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How do I reset/resync ?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p>Hi Oscar,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us navigate to the following locations and clear all the files present it:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\CustomDestinations</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>And</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us clear all the contents from the above locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now unpin Excel from Taskbar and Start Menu. </p>
<p>Browse to <span style="font-weight: bold"><font>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\ClentX86 or ClientX64\Root\Office15.</font></span></p>
<p>Right click on Excel.exe and pin it to Taskbar and Start Menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now verify if the&nbsp;Recent list works after you save the files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this suggestion is helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My path: <strong>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15 </strong><em>(This is for 64 Bit MSO Installs)</em></p>

<p>I have the same problem on Outlook 2007. I can log into my hotmail account via the web just fine. It's bad enough my Mac Mail quit picking up my hotmail but then my Outlook 2007 stopped some time ago too.</p>
<p>I never receive any email in the Outlook Connector inbox, even when there are emails to receive.</p>
<p>None of the troubleshooting steps listed above have worked, and additionally now that I went ahead as suggested and deleted the OST file there are of course NO local hotmail emails in my Inbox.</p>
<p>Hotmail as a client accessed mail system has been dead to me for months I can't understand what the problem could be when it seems to be readily available via the web. Outlook logs are not suggesting any immediate problem either:</p>

            Are you printing in greyscale (Black and White)?<br />
<br />
Did you create the black shapes yourself? can you select the black shapes on the slide?<br />
<br />
If you choose View &gt; Greyscale does the text disappear?<br />
<br />
Any chance you could turn CAP LOCKS off before answering!?<br />

<p>It means that you can either make a call or have a data connection, this is the connection on hold.</p>

<h2>            Word built-in styles and language&#47;locale of the Word application</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm working with a Software-as-a-Service provider managing our documents and creating PDF renditions. We have a problem of fidelity of the PDF when using built-in Word styles (Normal, Header...) as it substitutes Calibri where the document defines Times
 New Roman as the font for these styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our vendor explained the following: "The problem with default styles is that they do not guarantee a specific styling, and will change depending on the language/locale of the Word application opening it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have doubts about this statement. Can some expert provide some advice as to whether this is actually true?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>R</p>

<p>AFAIK, your provider's advice is only true insofar as certain locales don't use the western character set; all western languages use the same fonts&nbsp;for their built-in Style definitions. What does change is the local name of the Styles. See:

<p>
</p><p>Word will also substitute fonts if a given character isn't supported the font in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real problem, though,&nbsp;is likely to be that users have changed the attributes of the default Styles or have overridden them with direct formatting and your provider's process doesn't allow for that. Another possibility, is that your provider's system
 doesn't have the fonts you're using, so its conversion process is substituting other fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, I can't see why you'd bother with an external provider for PDF production when Office can do that directly - without the risk of formatting changes.</p>

<p>Creating PDF's is only a small part of what the provider's system does, but the only one relevant to my query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your insight. So it looks like using built-in styles defined to apply Times New Roman for documents written in English only should in no way cause a substitution with Calibri when the document opens on another machine, and that, in such a case,
 their claim that "default styles (...) do not guarantee a specific styling" is incorrect.</p>

<h2>            Calculate and present automatically the last date a row was edited</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;I have a excel 2010 spreadsheet with approximately 20 columns and 500 rows</p>
<p>Each row contains data about a&nbsp;question, a name, date created, source, assginee, and the answer to the question, diocumentation references, and so on.</p>
<p>Questions are answered periodically, sometimes answers are updated, assignees changed,etc.</p>
<p>I'd like to add a column to the spreadsheet called "Date last modified" and have that cell automically update with the modification date if any other values in any of the cells of that row are changed. Then users of the spreadsheet could autofilter on the
 last date modified to see recent chages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This sample uses column U (the 21st column) for the date.&nbsp; Enter the following event macro in the worksheet code area:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
Application.EnableEvents = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells(Target.Row, "U").Value = Date<br />
Application.EnableEvents = True<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Because it is worksheet code, it is very easy to install and automatic to use:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. right-click the tab name near the bottom of the Excel window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. select View Code - this brings up a VBE window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. paste the stuff in and close the VBE window</p>
<p>If you have any concerns, first try it on a trial worksheet.</p>
<p>If you save the workbook, the macro will be saved with it.</p>
<p><br />
To remove the macro:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. bring up the VBE windows as above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. clear the code out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. close the VBE window</p>

<h2>            We are attempting to migrate to office 365 and want to use adfs but having issue..</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to get ADFS to work with office 365. I have adfs set up and everything seems to work internally. I can go to: &nbsp;<a href="https://adfs.somewebsite.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://adfs.somewebsite.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.htm</a>&nbsp;
 and the sign in comes up just fine. When I attempt to add adfs to our office 365 domain it comes up to a non-descript error page.&nbsp; I suspect it is something still with adfs as I cannot access the site:
<a href="https://adfs.somewebsite.com/adfs/ls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://adfs.somewebsite.com/adfs/ls/</a></p>
<p>When I try I get event logs that say:</p>
<p>Microsoft.IdentityServer.RequestFailedException: MSIS7065: There are no registered protocol handlers on path /adfs/ls/ to process the incoming request. at Microsoft.IdentityServer.Web.PassiveProtocolListener.OnGetContext(WrappedHttpListenerContext context)&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have changed the SPN for the account for ADFS. I also am using a web proxy and the same issues occur even if I access the ADFS server directly.
</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;searched and read a lot but still haven't gotten anywhere closer to fixing the issue.&nbsp;

<p>You're not supposed to be accessing the /adfs/ls endpoint directly. A proper request should have all the elements applied at the end of the URL, such as
</p>
<p><a href="https://sts.domain.com/adfs/ls/?cbcxt=&amp;vv=&amp;username=username%40domain.com&amp;mkt=&amp;lc=1033&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;wtrealm=urn:federation:MicrosoftOnline&amp;wctx=MEST%3D0%26LoginOptions%3D2%26wa%3Dwsignin1.0%26rpsnv%3D2%26ct%3D1299115248%26rver%3D6.1.6206.0%26wp%3DMCMBI%26wreply%3Dhttps:%252F%252Fportal.office.com%252FDefault.aspx%26lc%3D1033%26id%3D271346%26bk%3D1299115248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sts.domain.com/.../</a></p>
<p>If you are just making sure the server is running, use the idpinitiatedsignon page, or open the Federation metadata endpoint, or say the windowstransport one.</p>

<p>Understood. The link directly to the page works fine. &nbsp;When i try to connect it up to Office 365 and it does indeed put more in the URL than just the directory. However it fails and gives page cannot be displayed type of error. I'll run some of the items

<p>Hi Aaron,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your efforts. I will monitor this thread in case you have any updates to share. Meanwhile, if the issue persists, please provide us with the following details:<br />
1. The exact user experience when your SSO users try to access their Office 365 online services (both from internal and external). If any detailed error message can be seen, please upload a screenshot by clicking
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> (at the bottom) -&gt;<strong> Insert/Edit Media</strong>.<br />
2. Check if you can find anything relevant in the <strong>Event Viewer</strong> log of the
<strong>ADFS proxy server</strong>. Since "everything seems to work internally", let's focus on the proxy server first.<br />
3. Perform the <a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Remote Connectivity Analyzer</a> -&gt;
<strong>Office 365</strong> -&gt; <strong>Office 365 General Tests</strong> -&gt; <strong>
Office 365 Single Sign-On Test</strong> to see if the test can be finished successfully. If not, please provide the entire test result.<br />
<br />
Moreover, I have sent you a private message to collect any detailed error message that you may find (from both the Event Viewer log and the RCA test result). Please see it by clicking
<strong>Private messages</strong> under <strong>your details</strong> on the right.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Allen</p>

<h2>            p08-imap.mail.me.com keeps rejecting my password - WHY&#63;&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I hit Send/Receive on my Outlook email, I get a small window on my screen that says
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet email -- **Email *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Enter user name and password for the following server.</p>
<p>Logon</p>
<p>Server: p08-imap.mail.me.com</p>
<p>User: lsposey</p>
<p>Password: ..........</p>
<p>Remember password</p>
<p>OK -- cancel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My user name and password are correctly entered, so far as I know. I actually have no idea where to go to check or change my password for this account. I actually use Earthink.net as my primary email server, but when I got my iPhone, I got this me.com account,
 and I have my iPhone synced to my email. That's when the problem started.</p>
<p>No matter which combination of boxes&nbsp;I click, this window keeps coming back as long as my email is downloading.&nbsp;HOW CAN I FIX THIS?&nbsp;The process seems to give up after a while, but every time I close Outlook and reopen it, it starts up again, with the same
 box appearing over and over each time I hit Send/Receive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THANKS! Linda</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The emails that you receive is basically stored on your webmail server. Outlook is an email client which fetches the emails from the webmail using the correct account settings setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if your account settings for the email account is setup correct. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p>Click <span style="font-weight: bold">
Tools</span>, go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Account Settings</span>, highlight the email and click
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not using the account, follow the steps from the link mentioned below to remove the email account:</p>

    <title>Autocorrect in Online Word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Autocorrect in Online Word</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I'm using online word, and as far as I remember, in the desktop version it was possible to ignore some words and to add or remove some. My biggest pain now is that online word is correcting the word "it" to "lit" when i'm typing it "too fast" there are a
 couple of more words with this symtpome and I'd like to know where I can check the autocorrect settings in online word if it's possible. if not, then i'd like to know why on earh is IT corrected to LIT, in what universe is LIT more often used as IT? :)</p>
<p>thanks guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: what i also don't want is to make (dotted) lists out of my conversations which are starting with - (dash). But i don't want to turn the autocorrect off, since it helps with capitalising sentences, typos, appostrophes, etc. So generally autocorrect
 is a big thumb up, but sometimes you put that thumb somewherer it doesn't belong...</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bring the feedback to us. It would be good if you could help check your language setting to make sure it's not due to the vocabulary in another language. It is on the left bottom of your editing window.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4bed3626-bf17-4111-bcd4-c5e423ac0320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4bed3626-bf17-4111-bcd4-c5e423ac0320" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the language is properly set, we will need further investigation on this matter. In the meantime, you might be able to bypass this issue by clicking that bar and choosing a different language. It's just a workaround for now since the spellchecker will
 not work as expected in a different language setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Providing user setting to turn on/off auto-correct is on our plan. &nbsp;For now, since autocorrect is undoable, you can cancel each auto-correct using Ctrl+Z.</p>

            <p>You might also take a Screenshot of actual Error. Perhaps it says OS X.10</p>
<p>A Mac shouldn't even allow you to download an IOS application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it sounds like, is that you have&nbsp;a version of OSX less than OS X.10.6. </p>
<p>In that case you need to upgrade system to latest version of X.10.x.</p>

<h2>            How to validate a textbox value in VBA so that there are no duplicates&#63;</h2>
                    Hi!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an userform with 10 textboxes. I have to enter different serial numbers on each one. Each serial number must be unique. How can I make the userform show a message if one of the serial numbers that I introduce in one textbox already is in another
 textbox.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I mean, if I enter a serial number on textbox3 and it has already been entered on texbox1, what code should I use so that the userform shows a message telling me about duplicates.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you so much!!</div>

            Hi Phyllis, the amount of time taken to download Office 2016 to your PC depends on your Internet Connection . . .
<br />
<br />However unless you have extremely slow Internet, that timescale is hugely excessive . . .
<br />
<br />The download size is around 1.5GB - 2GB.
<br />
<br />What speed is your Internet?
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager
<br />
<br />On the performance Tab, on your Internet Connection, what is the receive rate?

<p>The situation occurs only after a full scan by MSE, which runs about 12 hours on my system. The clean boot approach would require running a full scan while in clean boot state and re-iterating that until the conflicting software has been identified. I don't
 think that approach is practical for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now I'll just have to re-boot after each full scan, which seems to clear the problem until the next full scan.</p>

<p>As stated previously, the iterative approach at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us&nbsp;, selectively narrowing down the set of non-MS services, is not practical for me. Instead,&nbsp;<em>I restarted with only MS services enabled.</em>
<em>Restarting in that mode did not clear the problem. </em>That satisfies me that the iterative approach at kb929135 is not only impractical but also doesn't lead to a solution.</p>
<p>Please correct me if my assertion that running with only MS services enabled is the equivalent of the iterative narrowing approach in kb919135.<br />
</p>
<p>I previously observed that re-booting cleared the problem. However, my more recent experience contradicts that.
<em>Re-booting does not clear the problem.&nbsp;</em>I've now uninstalled and reinstalled. I haven't done a full scan yet but so far the problem has not occurred.

                    With the latest release I've noticed that when cutting, or copying a file or folder from one directory to another, there is no longer a display of the progress shown.&nbsp; Is this a glitch or could there be something wrong. If it's intentional then it's not
 very helpful, especially when transferring a large file with no indication what's going on!

            I have another problem with cut and paste in this build. If I change the focus to another focus while it is copying a large number of files it copies the files to that folder as well as to the original folder!

            <p>Hello Lawrence,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are aware, I already replied with a "thankyou".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately Microsoft have badgered me continually over the Xmas holiday for me to say everything is fine and that I'm deliriously happy with your clear answer. Fact is that although you have answered my question very correctly, there is no solution to
 the problem at all and I return to my work tomorrow as frustrated as I've ever been. Microsoft's lack of urgency when dealing with real people is legendary, seeing only the corporate horizon and the next future product launch! When will they ever learn?</p>

<p>Seriously ??&nbsp; Come on ( smiling and chuckling ) the insider builds are KNOWN to have bugs, and if people want to use beta / Buggy software then they should also have the skills to either have work-arounds, or the skills to fix it.
</p>
<p>To many people are using insider builds to try and get early releases and don't really have a clue on how to fix something, then go crying when someone else doesn't post a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Re this post --&nbsp; There IS a way to get the progress bar working -- A work-around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a read of another insider post, same question <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_files/version-10011082-wont-display-copymove-progress/6033d1b1-ebfd-42a0-bd73-b5ae5582bea9">
This post here</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Look for my suggestion on how to get it working ( work around) until M$ get it sorted.

    <title>Autosave in Excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trippap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autosave in Excel 2010</h2>
                    <p>I have Excel set up to "Keep the last Autosaved version if I close without saving". I've just recovered from a panic that happened when I closed a file without saving that had several hours of work in it. I clicked on Version on the Info category of the
 Backstage view and there's a choice to "Recover Unsaved Workbooks", but when I clicked on it, the file I had closed without saving was not there. The Recover Unsaved Workbooks command actually took me to the AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\UnsavedFiles folder
 from my profile, and it had some files in it; just not the right one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I looked at the setup in Excel Options for the AutoRecover file location, and that is the AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel folder from my profile. When I opened that folder, my unsaved file was there as a .xlsb file in a folder named for the file I had
 not saved. So the AutoSave process works, but it's inconsistent because Excel doesn't go to the right folder when asked to Recover Unsaved Workbooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to configure Office/Excel so it works as advertised? Why would Excel use two different AutoSave folders, one in AppData\Local and the other in AppData\Roaming? I have no idea where the location of the UnsavedFiles folder is specified, but I
 think I'd like it to be where AutoSave puts things, or maybe that's not a good idea. The feature is a really good one, but it should be more predictable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But even though is saves there, when you click on Recover Unsaved Workbooks in Excel, it searches in %<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">AppData%\Local\Microsoft\Office\UnsavedFiles, which is not where the files were saved by default&nbsp;</span>.
 I'd expect the location accessed by Recover Unsaved Workbooks to be the same folder where it saves them.</p>

            <p>Try </p>
<p>1. Disconnecting your internet cable and turn off your wifi if you are using&nbsp;wireless
</p>
<p><strong>during the</strong><strong> final stage of the build (when is asks how to connect)</strong></p>
<p>Create a local user only first and let windows 10 finish. </p>
<p>Reconnect your internet cable and turn on Wifi.</p>
<p>Login to&nbsp;windows 10&nbsp;and change the login to be Microsoft login in start, settings, accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Reboot to your<strong> BIOS </strong>and Check for a setting "<strong>Non-Execute Memory Protection</strong>" must be set to
<strong>ENABLED if you have a setting - ignore if you do not.</strong><br />
It may be called "Execute Disable Function" with a sub-menu of&nbsp; 'No-Execute Page Protection Technology."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If future - <strong>Uninstal</strong>l any third-party <strong>antivirus</strong>,
<strong>disconnect</strong> any <strong>extra USB devices </strong>like external hard drives,</p>
<p><strong>uninstall Nvidia or AMD video drivers </strong>and just have Microsoft basic display driver.
