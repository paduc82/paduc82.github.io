    <title>windows 10 - Search not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pelfed54  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 - Search not working</h2>
                    <p>This seems to be a common issue that has yet to be resolved by MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Version 1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typing in the "Ask me anything" no longer works for system settings and at the top it always shows "these search results may be incomplete".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed all the suggesttions, re-indexing, using powershell to reset but nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example; I type in "power" and the search displays "power &amp; sleep settings | system settings". clicking on this should take you to the settings page for "power&nbsp; &amp; sleep settings" but instead opens up a search results box with nothing in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need a proper anser from MS and not the "have you tried trouble shooting, have you tried re-indexing, have you tried the Power shell reset".... Yes I have tried!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried going back to a restore point. I do not want to have to reset until this is solved as have a lot of things to re-configure if I do so.</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not very helpful.&nbsp; There is a bug in windows 10 that is causing this.&nbsp; As I have said (and perhaps I should have listed absolutely everything) I have tried many suggestions, safe mode being one.&nbsp; My system is up to date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so that you know, when in safe mode, Search doesn't work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can MS confirm this is a known issue at least? This way many of us can wait for an update fix rather than spending hours trying to fix an un-fixable issue.</p>

<h2>            Reinstalling Windows XP Pro using Upgrade disc</h2>
                    I am planning to reinstall windows to rectify problem on my pc.&nbsp; I Have Windows XP Pro Upgrade Version (2002) CD and not too sure how to progress.&nbsp; I think I will need to provide validation of previous version but all i have is a sticker with Windows Millenium
 Edition&nbsp; licence number - which was on computer when purchased (many moons ago).&nbsp; I dont think any reference to that original piece of software exists any more since i have reformatted in the past.&nbsp; This time however i simply want to either repair or as a
 last resort reformat drive.&nbsp; Can any one help? Thanks in advance

<p>Thank you fro your reply.</p>
<p>I havea problem with PC running really slowl. I have followed the advice to reinstall Security essentials and so forth. Sadly it is still incredibly slow when i reinstall. I have (as far as I kno) unintalled all previous versions of ant virus and security
 programms.&nbsp; Decided it maybe better to try reinstalling windows.&nbsp; I have an upgrade disc which purshased legit in 2002 (PC World) to upgrde the version on PC. I think previousli I had Milleniuum edition pre-installed.&nbsp; I have the original 'sticker ' with licence
 number on PC - but no discs.&nbsp; Since then I have formatted the drive anmd remember the rather hit and miss procedures I had to go through. Howeverits has worked absolutly fine. Overall I am not sure what I should be doing and having to provide this previous
 validating software a pain.&nbsp; Probably need how find out if there is an easier way to get this procedure on a new disc without having to provide old information of previous versions etc so that i am left with a clean updated version for future use.&nbsp; So ......
 if i want to reinstall windows given that I have an upgrade only version on disc (and its licence key) and the licence for ME (not sure if this is deemed a qualifying product) what can I do.&nbsp; when I have tried before i seem to remember that i was told that
 the version that I have is older than the version (SP3) on my computer currently.&nbsp;&nbsp;can you help?&nbsp; Sory about the waffle but not quite sure how to explain and am rather new to the Forums and the more concise questions.&nbsp; Appreciate your reply and any help you
 may be able to offer. &nbsp;</p>

<p>You need a qualifying version cd, ie win9* or winME, you dont actually install this, but during the winxp clean install process it will complain that no qualifying version is found, at this point you swap the cd, point the installation to your cd drive,
 once confirmed, swap the cd again and continue the installation. It will be a clean install, no vestige of the qualifying version will be installed</p>
<p>Since I assume you are in the UK a local PC shop, or PC fair would probably supply an old win cd for pennies</p>

<h2>            Skype sign in</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am unable to sign into my skype account from the skype app and can only sign in from a live skype tab in a browser.</p>
<p>I get a security message that says there was some recent activity where lots of junk might have been sent from my account, but when I go to the 'recent activity' page, there is nothing there, besides me resetting my password.
</p>
<p>Based on that, it looks like my account has been temporarily suspended, so I can only sign into skype from a browser. How can I fix this problem? I need skype on my phone. Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Remove all power to system :</p>
<p>Check and reseat&nbsp;the&nbsp;memory&nbsp;- actually&nbsp;remove and replace - do not just snug. If you have more<br />
than 1 stick swap them in and out to see if the problem follows one stick or try new memory. This<br />
is rarely the problem though it can be. Make sure the vents are clear and that you can hear the fan<br />
running when it should be (if the system seems hot). Ensure there is adequate ventilation space.&nbsp;<br />
Also the hard drive connection could be in question so you might need a real computer shop (not<br />
leeks and peeks at BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or the&nbsp;Dell's Support. <br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Drivers, BIOS, low level chipset and others)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<p>thanks for your suggestion. My problem may be one of understanding one drive. I have about 800 pics that I downloaded from IPhone. I don't see a utility that allows me to connect with Snapfish. The only option offered is sending photo by email which wouldn't
 allow me to move pic, due to email bandwidth restrictions.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>What is your issue with OneDrive?&nbsp; The first link at the page suggested by George222(2) describes how to upload photos to Snapfish using Snapfish "Standard Upload."&nbsp; OneDrive isn't mentioned anywhere in those directions nor is there any mention of uploading
 anything using email.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to know some information.</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
What is the exact issue that you are facing?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
What is the error message or error code?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
When exactly do you get the messages?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to
<strong>Run DISM or System Update Readiness tool</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The DISM or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.
<br />
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.

<h3> indupriyakodali  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wi-fi connectivity issue after upgrade to windows 8.1 pro</h2>
                    I have the Qualcomm Atheros AR8172/8176/8178 PCI-E Fast Ethernet Controller (NDIS 6.30) driver on my Lenovo G500 laptop with Windows 8.1 Professional. I tried disbaling, updating and even rollbacking, but no luck. Could someone help me resolve this? This
 issue occurs only in places with common wi-fi.

<p>Por que o xbox 360 nunca teve um jogo de saint seiya? A microsoft vai providencia isso? Eu ja pedi muito para nancom bandai e a microsoft mas nunca me responderam, sou um entre vários fãs que ja pediram isso. A microsoft poderia converter a maioria dos games
 da franquia para o Xbox 360?</p>
<p>OBS: Estou pedindo do saint seiya &nbsp;brave soldier para&nbsp;o Xbox 360 e os outros da franquia classica&nbsp;o novo&nbsp;saint seiya&nbsp;soldier souls deixa para os dois: Xbox one e Xbox 360.</p>

<h2>            Win 8.1 most icons on desktop are blank</h2>
                    <p>The first week with windows 8.1 the desktop (the one that looks like the XP desktop) worked fine. But suddenly (shortly after installing Office 365 and trying unsuccessfully trying to install a usb modem) many of my icons were replaced by blank icons.</p>

<p><span><span>Hello MateoPerkins,
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand that it can be frustrating when you are not able to log into your system even after you have changed your password, we will look into this for you.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>May I know the error you are receiving when you attempt to login to your system?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Since you are using a Microsoft account and you have already reset the password, I would suggest you to check if the system is connected to the Internet. If it is
 connected to the Internet through the WiFi, please check by connected your system to Internet to an Ethernet cable and check if you're able to login. You may also try with the following suggestions and check if it works.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: On-screen keyboard.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may try entering the password using on-screen keyboard. If there is any corruption in the keyboard, we can check with the OSK. To know how to access it, you may

<p>Your recovery emails and phone numbers should be enough to prove to Microsoft who you are and then they should allow for a password reset.<br />

    <title>OneDrive&#58; High CPU usage for 19 minutes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andreas57  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive&#58; High CPU usage for 19 minutes</h2>
                    <p>I just discovered that my computer was getting extremely hot and had fans at full speed even though I wasn't doing anything on my computer. I went into task manager and discovered that OneDrive.exe was using one of my cpu cores completely (25% cpu usage,
 4 cores). I looked at onedrive "OneDrive is up to date" "Last updated 1 hour ago", so according to onedrive it wasn't doing anything..</p>
<p>This 25% kept up for a couple of minute before going down. In task manager I see Cpu time: 00:19:01 (second highest is 5 minutes). After OneDrive was done, it was still "Last updated 1 hour ago", what is going on?</p>
<p>I can upload the log files if that will help and you can tell me which, such that you can resolve this? These 19 minutes makes my computer heat up my room to currently 27 degrees celcius :|.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Win7, my onedrive only contains 50.000 files = 5.5 GB.</p>

<h2>            Reinstall &#34;Windows Media Center&#34; under Windows 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    I upgraded my computer from Vista Home Premium 64 to Windows 7 Premium 64.&nbsp; In the process I seem to have lost Media Center.&nbsp;
<br />
I preferred to go to Windows 7 Ultimate so I upgraded online thinking that it would restore the Media Center.&nbsp; It did not.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
How can I retrieve Media Center?&nbsp; An online solution would be preferred!<br />

<p>Hi mitchess,</p>
<p>I changed the screensaver on my machine here running Windows 7 to Bubbles. I had a similar experience. The bubbles change their pace randomly.&nbsp; It appears that the behavior of the “Bubble” screen saver is normal.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

            You can "Reset This PC", it re-installs Windows, keeps your data in tact or you can opt to remove them.
<br />Go to Settings (click on start, gear icon) look for Update &amp; Security, Recovery.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />
<br />I suggest you perform the following suggestions to resolve this issue:
<br />
<br />Step 1:
<br />1. Click "Start", type "services.msc" (without quotation marks) in the open box and press Enter.
<br />2. Double click the service "Volume Shadow Copy Service".
<br />3. Click on the "General" tab; make sure the "Startup Type" is "Automatic" or "Manual". Then please click the "Start" button under "Service Status" to start the service.
<br />Step 2: Run sfc /scannow to check your system.
<br />Step 3: Go to %windir%\System32\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\SystemRestore
<br />In that directory, rename SR to SR.sav
<br />Try to create the manual restore point again.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!       
        </p>

            I would suggest you to check the status of volume shadow service. If it is not running please start it and set it to automatic. If it does not start please check the dependency services and make they all are started when you click on volume shadow service you see a dependency tab. Make sure the services under the dependency tab are up and running.
<br />
<br />Services related to System Restore are:
<br />
<br />-      Volume shadow copy
<br />
<br />-      Multimedia Class Scheduler
<br />
<br />-      Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
<br />
<br />-      DCOM Server Process Launcher
<br />
<br />-      Plug and Play.
<br />
<br />Follow the instructions below and set all of the above services to Automatic.
<br />
<br />a. Click the Start button, and in the search box type in: Services.
<br />b. Press 'Enter' to open Services window.
<br />c  Find related services that are listed above, and check the Status (started) and Startup Type (automatic).
<br />d. Double click the service to change the status to started and set startup type to Automatic.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, try this method.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Performing a System File Checker Scan(SFC) on your computer.
<br />
<br />SFC tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions. 
<br />
<br />Check the below link for details:
<br />Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system

            Just had to do that myself. Click on "Ask me anything." There's a menu on the left. Click the second item (under Home) and then "About Me" and you can change the nickname from there.
