<p>Have bought Adobe Premier Elements 3.0 for our budding 11 year old animator because its the version he is familiar with in evening classes. Our XP-platform desktop was too old to handle the RAM and processor requirements so have upgraded. But new desktop
 is Windows7 and PE3 is barely functioning. Have tried W7 'Program Compatibility' back to XP without success. Can anyone advise? Do i need to re-load XP?</p>

            Premiere Elements 3 is now four versions old. It is unlikely to work well&nbsp;with Windows 7, if at all. See
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=3565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=3565</a><br />
<br />
You need to&nbsp;reinstall XP if you want to run Premiere Elements 3 successfully.

    <title>Wireless Mouse Not Recognized- Tried Everything I Know So Far - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 524038-2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless Mouse Not Recognized- Tried Everything I Know So Far</h2>
                    <p>I've lurked around on these forums and read other people's posts about this and still cannot find a solution... I have a Windows 7 HP laptop, and I have a Logitech M325 wireless mouse. I'm going to try and give everyone as much information as possible so
 this may be wordy... please forgive me. I'm notorious for typing a LOT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my symptoms:<br />
<br />
- When I plug the receiver into any of the USB ports, one of two things happen. 1) Nothing at all. 2) My computer tells me "USB device not recognized. One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it. For
 assistance in solving this problem, click this message."<br />
- When I restart the computer and immediately plug in the receiver and turn on the mouse, the mouse will work as normal for a good 10 seconds or so until it promptly ceases to work.
</p>
<p>- It used to work just fine for a good year or so before this, and would begin working immediately after I turned on the mouse and had the receiver plugged in. No first-second stutters or anything; jumped right to business. But one day (four days ago or
 so), in the middle of doing something for which I'd been using the mouse for for a good few HOURS now, it just magically stopped working and I've been having these problems ever since.</p>
<p>- No matter what USB port I use, I get the same results. </p>
<p>- Half the time when I plug in the receiver it shows up under Devices and Printers as "Logitech<span>¬Æ
</span>Unifying Receiver", and the other half of the time it shows up as "Unknown Device". Sometimes when it shows up as an actual known device, it has the yellow-triangle-exclamation-point warning symbol. Sometimes. Like... twice.
</p>
<p>- One time it even told me that the device driver software was successfully installed for the unknown device. (Wh-What?! How can a computer install software for a device it doesn't even know what is?!! Witchcraft!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I've tried so far: </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Replacing the battery in the mouse. (No change.)<br />
- Using it on a different computer. (Works perfect!)</p>
<p>- Plugging the receiver into different USBs. (No difference...)<br />
- Restarting my computer. (Hey it wor-!! Awh, it stopped working... :( ) </p>
<p>- Troubleshooting the mouse from Devices and Printers ("Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem.")<br />
- Troubleshooting the mouse from Devices and Printers when it has the triangle-exclamation symbol under it. (I can't reproduce this, but when I did, one time it told me something along the lines of "undetected changes in hardware", and said that the problem
 had been fixed, and the other time it told me that there was something wrong with the driver, and told me the problem was not able to be fixed.)<br />
- Viewing the properties for it. (One time, under the hardware tab, one of the USB Input Devices had the triangle symbol. I clicked on it, clicked properties again, and it said something like "This device cannot start (Error #)". I uninstalled it and reinstalled
 it and nothing changed.)</p>
<p>- Uninstalling and reinstalling the things under Universal Serial Bus Controllers in the Device Manager, and updating the drivers for them (No change.)</p>
<p>- Installing software from the Logitech site that was supposed to help out with Logitech devices on Windows laptops. (Did no good.)</p>
<p>- Trying to reboot the motherboard. (Negative... I'm actually not even sure if I did it correctly.)</p>
<p>- Starting my computer in safe mode and doing a system restore to a few days earlier. (Nein!)</p>
<p>- Probably other things that I can't even remember right now. (None effective.)<br />
<br />
So... I don't know very much about computers, but my best guess would be that I possibly have a virus or something. I'll be using Windows Defender to run a full system scan tonight so hopefully that'll pick it up if I do have one, but I've yet to do that. If
 I had to guess the closest I've come to solving the issue, it would be when I viewed the properties for the Logitech receiver under Devices and Printers, while it had the yellow warning symbol, and clicked on hardware, and saw that one of the USB Input Devices
 was malfunctioning, and saw that it could not start when I viewed the properties again for that specific USB Input Device.... I think that is the closest I've come to solving the problem. But if someone else wants to point me in an absurdly different direction,
 I'm MORE than all ears. I really want this mouse to work. I'll try anything. My computer has that crappy "traction" trackpad that has the weird bumps that make your fingers sore after a few hours of use... I need a mouse and my computer doesn't want me to
 have it. Please help. Much thanks. </p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I appreciate all your efforts and time spent on resolving this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mostly you have tried all the basic troubleshooting methods that are done in a similar scenario. However I would like you to try the following and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, Uninstall the drivers for the mouse and <span>Run fix it from the link:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>‚ÄúHardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows‚Äù</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, uninstall Ghost Devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em>Note:</em></span></strong><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Ghost devices are the previously installed devices which are
 not connected but the drivers for that device is still present in the computer and sometimes shows in the devices list.
</span></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To get rid of unwanted drivers, devices, or services, use the following steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open the
<strong>Start</strong> menu.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>Open as administrator.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1</strong> and press <strong>Enter. </strong>
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>(Note that nothing seems to happen. This is expected. You are actually setting an environment variable which is going to help you to see
 hidden devices.)</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On the next command prompt line, type
<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and press Enter. This will launch the Windows Device Manager Console.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>View</strong> menu, select <strong>Show Hidden Devices</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>As you expand the different drivers and devices in the device manager, you will see not only the items that Windows currently detects as installed on
 your PC; but you will also see drivers, devices, and services which have been loaded in the past but were not uninstalled or are not currently started. You can find your offending device, right-click, and choose
<strong>uninstall</strong> to remove it from the system completely.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Note that ghost devices, drivers, and services are ‚Äúgrayed‚Äù out, but that does not necessarily mean that you should delete all of them. Only remove items
 you know you do not need. Be careful that you do not change too many devices.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, restart your PC and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful.</p>

<h2>            Failed to install .NET Framework 4&#47;No Automatic Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously in a few weeks, I had never seen any automatic updates working, when I go to the Windows Update, it takes ages to load and it always says "Always install the latest updates" so when I click on "Check for updates" it keeps popping up with a dialog
 that says "Windows Update cannot currently check for updates, because the service is not running. You may need to restart your computer."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always go to Run &gt; services.msc and see Windows Update has an "Automatic (Delayed Start)", every time I restart it or stop and start it, I have to restart and to see if it's working. It always gets back to the same problem, why can't I install any more
 recent updates?</p>
<p>Even this error comes up when I install .NET Framework 4</p>

            <p>Have you run services.msc and looked closely at the services? start button &gt; select RUN&gt; type in
<i>SERVICES.MSC</i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>the following services are needed by the processes at windows update. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In services management console (services.msc) they must NOT be *disabled* - in the startup type.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>They need to show a startup type of manual or automatic.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here are the services &amp; their startup types:</p>
<p><b>background intelligent transfer service (BITS</b>) - manual</p>
<p><b>cryptographic services</b> - automatic</p>
<p><b>remote procedure call (RPC</b>) - automatic</p>
<p><b>system restore service</b> - automatic</p>
<p><br />
now then, look at the entry for automatic updates.</p>
<p>Does it shows started in the status column? If not, click on "start" the service link.</p>

            I have done the checking as you stated above, they are all in their right startup types and I have made sure the Windows Update service has started.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately that didn't change anything, Windows Update still refuses to work when clicked through Control Panel and .NET Framework 4 displays the same error even after I have used the cleanup tool given by the link above.<br />
<br />
What else am I supposed to do?<br />

            Just to reaffirm Georges answer, Chess Titans is not in Windows 7 Home Basic, you will need to upgrade to a higher edition such as Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate.

            While i was waiting your reply i tried to re-install Windows 8.1 WMC keeping all my files and applications. Doing this corrected system errors, and then sfc/scannow and DISM.exe showed no errors anymore. But unfortunately my ISDone error was not solved.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No; you can't reuse&nbsp;the Windows 8.1 License&nbsp;on your new machine.</p>
<p>You have to buy another 8.1&nbsp;License</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Product Key/License for the Qualifying Operating System, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, etc. is absorbed into the Windows 10 Upgrade during the installation process and becomes part of the Activated final install of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Qualifying Operating System License, whether it be Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, etc. can not be used elsewhere, or in a dual boot with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>alright, was thinking so since i technically dont have windows 8.1 installed anymore and im sure the license agreement states im able to reinstall as long as the old pc doesnt have the original os anymore, but thanks for the response<br />
guess microsoft thought of that, riperoni my pepperoni&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>The Windows 8.1 License&nbsp;was merged into the free&nbsp;UPGRADE License for 10&nbsp;to give you a FULL Windows 10 License.</p>
<p>Without the Windows 8.1 License, you would NOT have got the FREE upgrade to 10.</p>

<h2>            Sound is not working properly</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Sound Problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had the laptop for about a year and recently, the sound is not working properly. It sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't.</p>
<p>For example, I'd be on websites watching videos and listening music, it'd be fine. But when pauses the video/music to read something, when I go to play it again, it'll say the video is experiencing an error and the sound does not work.
</p>
<p>I usually run:</p>
<p>Troubleshoot audio playback and Configure a device to solve it. </p>
<p>The sound problem is solved, temporarily. After a while, it'll not work again.</p>
<p>I can't hear any sound at all.</p>
<p>Please, I need help.</p>
<p>

<p>When turned off the powerpack light is solid orange, When turned on the powerpack light is solid green.</p>
<p>Auto shutdown is disabled and I've cleaned the power button with a dry tissue.</p>
<p>I really want to know whats wrong with my xbox and if this problem is going to get worse?</p>

<p>BigMadBad,</p>
<p>Is your console in an open area that is well ventilated (gets plenty of airflow)? It always pays to make sure that your console has plenty of airflow around it and that there are no other heat-emitting devices (including set top boxes etc..) nearby, that
 may artificially increase heat in the area. It sounds like your console could be overheating.</p>
<p>If the console and power brick are both cool to the touch, then it may be another issue you are experiencing (likely related to the Power Brick it's self). You can find out a few more troubleshooting steps for this issue here;&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/console-turns-off-unexpectedly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/console-turns-off-unexpectedly</a></p>
<p>It may also be worth noting the solution found on this thread, by another person with a similar problem;&nbsp;http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/7/t/347205.aspx</p>

<p>System is a 64 bit desktop running Windows Home edition, automatically and fully updated. Skype is version 7.24.0.104. Have always used headphone with mic through a USB&nbsp;converter (manhatten). The mic suddenly stopped working on Skype test call. Checked on
 3rd party sound software - still no mic. Checked with different usb ports - same problem. This same USB converter setup works perfectly with Skype on an old machine running Win XP pro, so it isn't the mic or usb converter. Is the problem Skype or more likely
 Win 10?</p>

<h3> adamlaw_950  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change family&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so my Microsoft account is a child account in a Microsoft family. My mother is the only parent in sed amily and the outlook email she used is not the right one apparently. since she won't do anything about it, I decided to look for online help. I can't
 really do anything which requires parental permission on my new pc, which has really been bugging me. I need to see if I am able to independently leave this Microsoft family or if I am able to invite her as a parent account. As a child account there isn't
 much you can really do to change family, or leave family or add another person to the family, etc,. Does anybody here know how to deal with this problem as&nbsp; I am not able to get things which I would like to get for my pc. Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>I'd really appreciate an answer and I suppose there's some smart guy out there who can help.</p>

            Hi Adam.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Easiest to get out from under Family restrictions on a PC you own and administer is to change to a Local Account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Info at the link under your email address:  <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-switch-back-to-a-local-account-from-a-microsoft-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-swi...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you can keep a Local Account, create a new Microsoft Account to switch it to, or go back to your old MS Account once the family restrictions get lifted.  Your choice.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch-microsoft-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch...</a>
<br />
<br />If there is no option to change to a Local Account shown, then go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other People to create yourself a new Microsoft or Local Administrative Account, sign into it, copy your files over from the old account, then when ready you can delete it in the same place:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure the parent administering Family Safety follows these steps to remove you as a child account:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/34763-child-account-add-remove-your-family-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/34763-child-...</a>
<br />
<br />There are more troubleshooting steps as well as the opportunity to interact with a Family representative here:   <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security-winpc/troubleshooting-family-safety-features-in-windows/29533738-5766-4ba5-881c-c588e45201dc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Adam
<br />
<br />Changing your date of birth to an adult in your Microsoft Account will automatically remove you from Family Safety.
<br />
<br />Change the birthdate on your Microsoft account - Microsoft Support
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12411/microsoft-account-change-birthdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12411/...</a>
<br />
<br />Also
<br />
<br />sign into your Your Family at the following link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family</a> 
<br />
<br />Under the account, click More options, click Remove from family.
<br />
<br />Restart then check if you can sign into the account again.

            I'd like to change my original reply. does copying the files mean that you're just in a new Microsoft account but with all the uses of your old one including outlook and that. sorry if my sentences seem quite sloppy, I'm in a bit of a rush right now

            Hi again Adam -
<br />
<br />Your Mom should then change her password so she can get into the MS Account and remove you as Child account:  <a href="https://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live.com/</a>
<br />
<br />I already explained that the way to disengage now is to change to a Local Account, which you should be able to do if your are indeed the Admin on that PC because it is yours.  If not create a new Local or MS account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />You can make it a Local Admin account so that when your Mom gets her MS Account sorted out you can add your MS account back without the restrictions.  Or you can start fresh with a new MS account.

<h2>            Connect 2 XBox One controllers to 1 USB port &#40;PC&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>As for now, XBox One controllers can only be connected to PC by using a USB cable.</p>
<p>I was wondering, if it is possible to connect 2&nbsp;XBox One controllers to 1 USB port on the PC?</p>
<p>By using a USB splitter / Hub connected to 1 USB port on the PC and the controllers connected to the Hub / splitter.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the reply!</p>

<p>as many as 127 devices can be hooked up to a computer via a single daisy chain of USB hubs AKA splitter so yes you can do 2.</p>

 says " no controller", and it is supposed to be included in SO sofware. How can I solve this problem?

<p>Hi Enrique,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It would be best to contact Sony customer experience team for better assistance. The software that you mentioned is out of our scope of support. Thus, Sony can definitely provide an accurate resolution to make sure that the software will run smoothly in
 your device. What I can advice is keep your device up-to-date so it has latest fixes and improvement from the previous patch. This is also one good way to keep your device compatible to the applications that is running to your computer. To check for an update,
 go to Settings&gt; Update &amp; Security&gt; Check for updates. You can also manually download and install the update on this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4099479/windows-10-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, please let me know.</p>

            Hi Robert
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Some users reported similar issues and resolved them by doing the following:
<br />- use CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to launch the Task Manager
<br />- Kill any instance of Skype.exe 
<br />
<br />(1) If you are using Skype app from Windows from Microsoft Store
<br />- click Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall 
<br />&gt; then install Skype again from Microsoft Store (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>)
<br />
<br />(2) If you are using Skype for Desktop 
<br />- Copy the line 
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop 
<br />- Click Windows Key+R 
<br />- Paste into Run window by CTRL+V and then click Enter 
<br />- Rename this folder to something difference for instance Skype for Desktop_Skype_Old 
<br />- Reinstall Skype (<a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a> ) 
<br />Hope this helps! If this still persists, please let me know. 
<br />Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida

                    When attempting to configure my BT Home Hub via bthomehub.home, I'm to there's a problem with that website certificate. If I continue (or use http rather than https) im advised not to but all works ok. Any reason why, and any idea how to resolve this?

            That isn't really a website, it's actually stored on the home hub itself (i.e. it's not on the World Wide Web). The certificate it uses when you access the site using HTTPS is one issued by itself to itself, so that's why it's not trusted. Since there's
 no real reason to secure the connection between your&nbsp;computer&nbsp;and the hub, you might just as well use
<a href="http://bthomehub.home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bthomehub.home</a> to access it. I always just use
<a href="http://192.168.1.254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://192.168.1.254</a>.

    <title>Skype and Apple iPhone Contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype and Apple iPhone Contacts</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought this would be obvious but clearly I'm doing something basic wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Skype quite a lot and now need to use it more and more to call non-VOIP numbers overseas. I've topped up my account with money and all is good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make it easier, I'd rather try now to always avoid using the Skype App and go straight in from Apple Contacts on the iPhone. When I open the contacts, I can long press on the call icon and decide what to use (cellular, Hangouts, WhatsApp). For some reason,
 I cannot get Skype on that list. I also can't see the Skype user (if there is one) on my contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doing something basic wrong here with some sort of sync ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andy</p>

<span>In a response dated 2017-06-17 to a related post in this forum,&nbsp;</span><span>Microsoft Agent Moderator&nbsp;<span>Rhiza_E
 wrote,<em>"Accessing local address book (phone contacts) is no longer supported with the latest version of Skype for iOS."</em></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is the only time this has been acknowledged by Microsoft.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>In the beginning, Skype delivered a&nbsp;</span><span>convenient and economical way to make long-distance voice calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;But
 this&nbsp;<span>core functionality of Skype got broken mid-2017 (when&nbsp;</span>Skype was revamped to compete with Snapchat) and it is still not fixed - in spite of the outcry from users - and there are no reassurances that it will get
 fixed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>The inescapable conclusion is that Microsoft prefers users to&nbsp;<em>"Sync Your Contacts"</em>and/or&nbsp;<em>"Invite People to Skype"</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This might be for purely commercial reasons, or it might be something
 more sinister.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Wikipedia,&nbsp;<em>"The 2013 mass surveillance disclosures revealed that Microsoft had granted intelligence agencies unfettered access to supernodes and Skype communication content."</em></span></p>
<p>
<em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p>
<span>I guess we have to find other ways to make long-distance calling convenient and economical again.</span></p>

<li><strong>Check Windows Update for an updated version of KB2952664 (Windows 7 SP1) or KB2976978 (Windows 8.x)</strong></li><li>After installing the Windows Update, re-run the&nbsp;Compatibility Appraiser.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I reserve even if I didn‚Äôt get a notification? </strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update is not required to get Windows 10, you can still get it even though you don't get the notification. Just download it on July 29th 2015 when it becomes available. You will have one year to do so. The Reserve app is just a reminder/notification
 for its availability.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I cancel my reservation? I don't want to upgrade to Windows 10 at all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Reservation app in the notification area (double click it) </p>
<p>Click the&nbsp;Hamburger menu&nbsp;in the upper left corner, then select View Confirmation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the lower left, click Cancel reservation and then confirm (twice).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I change the email address used to reserve the free upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You have to cancel the reservation and reserve Windows 10 again if you want it to a different email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cancel reservation follow the below steps:<br />
‚Ä¢Click/tap on the Get Windows 10 app icon on the taskbar notification area. <br />
‚Ä¢Click/tap on the "hamburger" style menu button at the top left corner in the Get Windows 10 app.<br />
‚Ä¢Click/tap on View confirmation under Getting the upgrade.<br />
‚Ä¢Click/tap on the Cancel reservation link.<br />
‚Ä¢Click/tap on Cancel reservation to confirm.<br />
‚Ä¢Click/tap on Close.</p>
<p>This will cancel the reservation, now go ahead and reserve it with the new email.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I uninstall the Reservation completely from my computer?</strong></p>
<p>Click Start (or press Windows key + S for Windows 8.1 users)</p>
<p>Type: <em>view installed updates</em></p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard </p>
<p>
</p><p>Look through the list for the <strong>KB3035583 </strong>and <strong>KB2976978</strong>&nbsp;update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click each update and click Uninstall. </p>

<p>Why don‚Äôt I have the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em>&nbsp;app? </p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you don‚Äôt see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app on your PC, it might be because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your device isn‚Äôt up-to-date with at least Windows&nbsp;7 SP1 or Windows&nbsp;8.1 Update.</li><li>Windows Update is turned off or is not set to received updates automatically.</li><li>You‚Äôve blocked or uninstalled the necessary Windows Update functionality.</li><li>Your device is not running genuine Windows.</li><li>Your Windows License is from a MSDN or TechNet subscription. If it is, you will be able to get Windows 10 through your subscription if it is still active.</li><li>Your computer is part of a Windows Domain</li><li>Microsoft has not determined your device capable of running Windows 10 even though it meets the minimum system requirements.</li><li>You are running a volume license client: Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise
<strong>(only retail store bought or preinstalled OEM licenses) get the upgrade offer.
</strong></li></ol>
<p>Running Windows Update and installing any available updates will fix the first three issues. Need more help? Go to our

<p>PCs that we determine cannot run Windows&nbsp;10 will not see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app before July 29, 2015. After July 29, 2015, we‚Äôll enable the icon in the system tray. This is to help ensure that you can easily check your PC‚Äôs compatibility if you
 choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your device is managed as part of a school or business network, please check with your IT administrator about upgrading to Windows&nbsp;10.</p>
