<h2>            Import or Link to Google Spreadsheets &#63; Simple Solution or VBA &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I would like to import or link to a Google spreadsheet. I would have hoped that I would not have to do a workaround, but thats what it looks like.<br />
Can it be done in VBA so that I do it as easily as an Excel spreadsheet ?</p>

            <p>My situation, I run a sporting comp </p>
<p>&nbsp;- I want potential players to register using google forms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;- Have the form saved in a googlesheet </p>
<p>&nbsp;- Have the information from that sheet available to Access </p>
<p>&nbsp;- Having manipulated information publish the draw etc to the web.</p>
<p>I have seen a solution where the info from the form is published, I have one where it is private.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution</p>
<p>(1)Set up Google drive so documents had a path in my local computer.</p>
<p>(2)Created the form in Google docs&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3)Pasted the code onto my Google Site (note you can edit the code if you want to change layout)</p>
<p>(4)The Gsheet is visible on my C drive, when I click on it my browser opens with</p>
<p>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/dblah blah blah #gid=1112223333</p>
<p>(5)Opened a new excel sheet clicked on [data] [from the web] and used the above https:</p>
<p>The result was a spreadsheet with a bit of guff around it but with the data I wanted</p>
<p>Note:the Gsheet isn't a public document so only I can do this</p>
<p>(6)Set up the excel spreadsheet as a linked table in my Access database</p>
<p>(7) I needed an "event" to refresh the spreadsheet. You might want it to refresh on open but I have a button with the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Commandxx_Click()<br />
Dim appexcel As Object<br />
Set appexcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")<br />
appexcel.workbooks.Open "C:\Users\base\Google Drive\blahblah\mystuff.xlsx"<br />
appexcel.activeworkbook.refreshall<br />
Set appexcel = Nothing<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>(8)I had to filter a bit because some guff came with it but I just used the timestamp field, ie if it doesn't have a timestamp then it isn't something I am interested in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(9)I haven't done the last bit yet but I'll have the draw come out as a html file saved to my googledrive and then embedded in my googlesite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps some people</p>
<p>

</p><p>To clarify your concern, we'd like to know if you're referring to computer login or Outlook.com login. If your son uses a Microsoft account in logging in, he may reset the password on his account by following the provided instructions in the article below:</p>

            to get rid of the usb not recognized problem- its' stupid easy. this works with my 80gb. just connect directly from&nbsp;the computer. press and hold back button, and upper portion of central&nbsp;button simultaneously. the device will shut off and restart. when
 it restarts the zune software recognizes the device and it works normally. I don't know why it keeps happening, but at least it is an easy fix.

<p>
</p><p>This morning I restarted my computer and opened Outlook.&nbsp; When Outlook opened, there is now a blue rectangle on the left hand side of all of my unread emails. [see below picture]&nbsp; This has never been there before.&nbsp; My view is set to Compact as it always

<p><span>Hello Adam F_7,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your reply. Regarding your mentioned reply, it is by default in outlook. It is the normal feature of outlook about unread email message. We can manually do. For that click right click on
<strong>Inbox</strong> &gt; select "<strong>Mark All as read</strong>" option. The blue bar automatically go away.</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p style="margin-left: 0">
Generally <strong>it is by design feature in </strong><strong>Outlook for Unread message</strong>. So, we cannot remove this blue bar separately.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
</p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p style="margin-left: 0">
Also, I understand your concern and it cannot meet your requirement. If you are sharing your idea via our
<strong>UserVoice service</strong> <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            VBA&#58; Word has encountered a problem &#40;5097&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>I'm getting the above error at runtime from an extremely innocuous looking block of code (below), on only one of our 12 machines. Not sure what to look for on that PC;
 our PCs all have the same release of Word and none of the others trip up there. Googling the message points me to several arcane situations, most involving automation or Outlook or proofing, but the error comes from this simple function (code stops where shown),
 with a few very ordinary documents open:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Public Function ReportIsOpen() As Boolean
</span></p>
<p><span>Dim w As Window</span></p>
<p><span>For Each w In Application.Windows &nbsp;&lt;----- STOPS HERE</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If InStr(w.Document.Name, "RPX") &gt; 0 Then</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Report</span><span>IsOpen = True</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit For</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</span></p>
<p><span>Next</span></p>
<p><span>End Function</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any ideas? &nbsp;TIA.</span></p>

            Thanks Jay. The user got back today and I tried the repair. No joy. Ran through the usual checks &amp; found nothing amiss. Finally replaced his Normal template, a nasty move, granted, but it fixed it. So weird -- it's the same normal everyone else has.

<h3> bridget dummett  say:</h3>
<h2>            We are experiencing issues with Microsoft Planner where comments that are posted in tasks disappear after the task is closed.</h2>
                    <p>I have followed other threads for this issue but have been unable to find a solution but have answers to the questions asked by MS reps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. We have Office 365 Business Premium Licenses.</p>
<p>2. This happens in newly created tasks as well as existing tasks. Not all tasks are experiencing this issue currently.</p>
<p>3. This is happening to multiple users.</p>
<p>4. To create the issue, I simply type in a comment and hit send. You can view the comment but when you close the task it is not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you let me know a way to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Bridget,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to confirm if you see the following behavior:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>You open Planner from Office 365 app launcher, from <strong>Planner Hub</strong>, you click the name of the plan. Click any existing task, type in
<strong>Comment</strong> box and hit <strong>Send</strong>. Now you close the task (by clicking the cross icon on the top right corner of the task window), once you re-open the task, you see all the comments are gone.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above scenario is exactly what you are experiencing, then please check if you can view the comments from OWA. For this, open a browser, sign in to
<a href="https://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com</a> with your work or school account, click Outlook from the app launcher, under
<strong>Groups</strong>, click the affected Group name, check if you can see the Planner comments in the conversation.
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89609d56-3899-4ea1-9ce9-5f4066a940d5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89609d56-3899-4ea1-9ce9-5f4066a940d5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Additionally, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you able to add new comments? </li><li>When you add a new comment, is it visible for other users or it disappears just for you?</li><li>How did you create the affected Plans? Are they created from Planner or some other way?</li><li>Which browser are you using? Try using a different browser, post a new comment, see if comments disappear.</li><li>Do you have an exchange online mailbox?</li><li>Please confirm if you can see the name of the user who made the comment but not the actual comment or it's entirely missing. Please provide a screenshot for us to understand better.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neha</p>

<h2>            Blank word file after saving</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded a rtf file from my email and changed it to a doc file in order to work on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After several hours i finished working on the file and directly closed it, relying on word to prompt me to save the file since i had made changes, however this time it did not and i cannot find the file now as a doc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead i found an rtf. file on my desktop, however it has zero bytes and when i open it on word it is blank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way the file which was worked on can be recovered?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changing a file's extension does not change any aspect of the format it was originally saved in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had a .rtf file and changed the extension to .doc, you created a mess. rtf is a text file. doc is a binary file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't change file types manually. If you want to convert a file from one format to another, use File &gt; Save As in the application, and choose the desired file type in the Format pop-up menu.</p>

            <p>Either attempt to get the latest update or Hard Reset. &nbsp;Make sure you upgrade immediately after hard reset. I read people had same issue if they restored their backups before upgrading to new build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then Hard Reset again to restore your backup.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response (that actually did work for me a&nbsp;couple months ago with a Lumia 920; unfortunately no cigar this time).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to give an update. I just finished a hard reset on the 830 and it didn't help. Haven't done it on the 640 bc that's where my files/texts are still stored.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background info: I WAS in the process of switching over to the 830&nbsp;and I did attempt to sync all Windows 10 PC's and phones. But, I think the issue occurred on the 640 prior to that (it was after about 30 apps wanted to be updated) in the store. It updated
 all but 6, and has been bugged since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 830 started on build 10586.29 and updated to 10586.36 before the issue occurred on that. The 640 is still stuck on build 10586.29, but I haven't tried to hard reset yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: both phones look to CONSTANTLY be pushing data, but not receiving it. On WiFi or, if I turn that off, over-the-air</p>

            <p>Not sure if you did this, but I think the key is to stop all the app updates and grab the latest build as quickly as possible. &nbsp; Make sure you don't restore from a backup either. &nbsp;Just hard reset, log in and update the OS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That worked for me. &nbsp;I was actually able to stop all app updates and install Windows Insider and update to the very latest build that came out yesterday. &nbsp;All good after that.</p>

            <p>The hard reset and immediate update solved the power issue. the trick was to finish initial setup and go directly to Phone Update. Mine took about 30mins to download and reboot. Now, it is cool like my old 920.</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />I suggest you to try the following procedures :
<br />
<br />Try to working with the Word in Safe mode and check if it helps.
<br />Hold the windows key + Letter ‘R’ on the keyboard to launch the Run command &gt; Copy and paste the following command line in the open box and click Ok.
<br />Winword /safe
<br />
<br />If, word works properly do you need to disable add-ins:
<br />Go into Word
<br />Click on File menu.
<br />Click Options.
<br />Click Add-ins.
<br />Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-Add-in.
<br />Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.
<br />Close the Word and restart it.
<br />
<br />If, these procedures didn't work, I refer to repair Office in the following link for more information:

            <p>Thanks Hans,</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the problem occurred on the spreadsheet side.&nbsp; With the Developer ribbon exposed I enter design mode and turn on Properties which exposes the properties pane.&nbsp; However, sometimes, not always, when I open one of the color drop downs, say for the BackColor
 the palette does not display.&nbsp; After some experimentation I discovered that the palette opens but it opens "behind" the properties pane!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is why does this occur and can I stop it.&nbsp; I know I can see the color palette if 1. I go to the VBE or 2. If I resize the property panel down so much that the bottom entry is the one I am picking - (not a good solution).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Shane</p>

                    I plugged the printer into my usb port and received the message that I did not need to add the printer as by plugging in the usb, the computer would automatically add it to my list of printers.&nbsp; I am not very computer literate and simply want to be able
 to print my resume!&nbsp; What am I doing wrong and what do I need to do the get the document to print?

    <title>Outlook 2013 OST size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cosmicstorm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 OST size</h2>
                    <p>Our query is basically to understand how Outlook 2013 works. So lets assume a <strong>
scenario as below</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li>We connect to Exchange Online Mailbox with the Outlook 2013 <strong>Slider </strong>
set to cache One years mails.</li><li>At the end of first year of using outlook 2013, the OST file size has grown to 3.5GB</li></ul>
<p><strong>Our Queries</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Assuming the mail transaction in the second year, by size and number, is just half the amount as compared to first year, will my .ost file size shrink automatically below 3.5GB at the end of 2nd year?
<br />
</li><li>If the answer to the above query is YES, then is there any Microsoft document stating so?<br />
</li></ol>
<p>

            <p>No, your ost-file will grow and shrink as needed throughout the entire year but your cache will only contain the last 12 months at any time as you've set that with the Sync Slider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook will check in the background how much white-space the ost-file contains and when it goes over a certain threshold, it will compact the ost-file. The user doesn't have to do anything manually for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing it manually is possible though. See: <a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/compact-now-pst-and-ost" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Permanent Link to Shrink your pst-file or ost-file after cleanup with Compact Now">

    <title>Some Outlook Contacts not showing in People &#40;request for help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuckonwords  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some Outlook Contacts not showing in People &#40;request for help &#35;2&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I asked this question elsewhere, but the person who supposedly was going to assist me has never returned to attempt to do so. The thread seems to have gone dead, yet my problem has not been solved. I am forced to ask the question again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Outlook for years prior to choosing Office 365, so I had many contacts already stored in Outlook. When I chose Office 365 I associated my Outlook account (@msn.com) with Outlook.com. It appeared that the Contacts in my Outlook had sync'd with People
 in Outlook.com, but it now is clear that some contacts were not. I am finding occasional contacts that are in Outlook on my computer, but they are not in People. They are not in People on my computer, and they are not in the People area of Outlook.com. The
 People from Outlook.com is then sync'd with my Windows Phone, so it too is missing occasional contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All contacts in my Outlook on my computer are under the Contacts folder of my @msn.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, People has a delinquent subset of the contacts from the Contacts of Outlook on my computer. People on my computer is delinquent, People at Outlook.com is delinquent, and People on my Windows Phone is delinquent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, the contacts cannot be restored via Deleted Contacts, as they are not listed there.</p>

            <p>Inasmuch as my career is not in Computer Technology, it is difficult to definitively answer some of your questions. When I install software on my computer, I do what the instructions tell me to do. To say I know what's going on is another story. The following
 are examples of things folks who do this stuff for a living understand (but not those of us who don't):</p>
<ul>
<li>locally on an Outlook client</li><li>Exchange active sync&nbsp;or Exchange account</li><li>did [I] move the contacts to the Outlook.com folder</li></ul>
<p>Question #3 might give you the best information. As I said originally, I had Outlook for years (like ten) before Outlook 365. I had Office XP. I believe my first version of 365 was Office 2013. I have absolutely no idea how my contacts went from one to the
 other, although it is possible I might have imported a .pst. I won't swear to that, but it's possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do know is that once I had Windows 10 (upgraded from 8.1), my home version of Outlook and my online version were sync'd. That's been over a year now, and obviously the version has since upgraded from 2013 to 2016. I have no idea how long the online
 People has been delinquent, because I don't always go looking for certain contacts. As it turns out, I recently had to look for certain ones, only to discover that while they were resident in my Contacts on my home computer, they were not present in People
 online or on my new Windows Phone. I suspect that they had *always* been missing, but that I only now am discovering it. They even greater concern is that I have no way of telling just how many are missing, so it is important to me to try to find a way to
 resolve this. It is quite confusing to me to find that contacts exist on my computer yet have not been replicated online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in helping me. I'll do my best to answer any questions you may have.</p>

<p>Is there also a separate entry of a type pop/SMTP?</p>

            <p>Your use of the term "Desktop" is odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2016 is installed on my computer as a result of my purchase of Office 365.. It has a Contacts folder. I have contacts in that folder that do not appear on Outlook.com or on my Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I have Outlook on my computer, I do not waste my time with the People app on my computer. However, you are correct when you ask if the People app on my computer is also missing the contacts. My estimation is that the People app...on my computer,
 on Outlook.com, and on my Windows Phone...has 90% to 95% of the contacts from Outlook 2016 that is installed on my computer. Thus, 5% to 10% of the contacts can also said to be missing from the People app which are present in the Outlook 2016 software installed
 on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Contacts folder in Outlook 2016 does not say "This computer only". The Drafts folder in Outlook 2016 does say that, so I am familiar with that designation. My Contacts folder does not have that designation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Outlook, File&gt;Account Settings&gt;E-mail Tab says: "Name: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** Type: Exchange ActiveSync (send from this account by default)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is not a separate entry of a POP or SMTP.</p>

            <p>Desktop in this context means a desktop/laptop PC on which Office is installed and using MS Outlook desktop program and not Outlook or Office web access
</p>
<p>By People I was referring to MS Outlook Contacts which are referred to as People in Outlook.com - I was not referring to any People App in Win10</p>
<p>My understanding therefore is that MS Outlook (desktop version) shows Contacts/People and that both your win phone and Outlook.com web access do not show the same ie there are more in your desktop version than the other two</p>
<p>If these extra Contacts/People are not Designated as This PC only, the only explanation I could offer is that they were added by a user in the desktop MS Outlook and have failed to sync with the outlook.com server</p>

            <p>I was successfully able to do all of that. The newly added contact did show up in People at Outlook.com, as well as in my Microsoft Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the problem isn't that newly added contacts don't sync. I had not noticed that being a problem. The problem is that some contacts (and the biggest problem is that I don't know
<strong><em>how many </em></strong>contacts) which previously existed in Outlook on my PC have not sync'd up to Outlook.com. These are previously existing contacts, not new ones...contacts that have been in my Contact list in Outlook for a dozen years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am providing a screen shot (edited for privacy) of my Outlook 2016&nbsp;People that is resident on my computer. The highlighted contact..."Sharon"...is a contact that is present on my computer that is not present at Outlook.com or on my Windows Phone. As you
 can see in the details on the right, "View Source" shows that Sharon is in "Outlook (Contacts, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)". It seems to me that Outlook *thinks* Outlook.com knows about this contact, since it's claiming that that's the contact source. While I'm not also
 providing a screen shot of the Outlook.com People list, I can assure you that Sharon (and some others) is not there. (For the record, the contact "New Person" is the one I created for the new profile previously discussed. As you can see, it's in the very same
 contact list as Sharon.)<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8da69093-de30-4d46-84d3-f5dc2c1fbb1c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8da69093-de30-4d46-84d3-f5dc2c1fbb1c" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>When I go to type/start an email, there are email addresses available to me there that don't appear under People tab.&nbsp; These addresses have been added via right click&nbsp;and choosing "add to contacts" These same email addresses are available to me whatever
 email account I use - (any of the 4 - I am creating the email from, but they don't appear under any of the 4 folders under the People tab.&nbsp; Where are these contacts at?&nbsp; they are not in the address book.&nbsp; I can't find them anywhere.&nbsp; I can't edit anything
 about them and more importantly, I'm trying to figure out where this file is so that I can sync them with my icloud&nbsp;contact account with a third party software I purchased.&nbsp; I have tested this software with the Office 365 accounts and it works! but I need
 to find out where these contacts are that don't appear under People.</p>
<p>

<br />
I have done some checking and my suspicion is that the LD-3W is Bluetooth v2 and the Atom is v1.2. I have not confirmed this as the problem but like you I can pair the devices and I have tried TomTom, Oziexplorer and GPSTuner to no avail. I then tested with
 my laptop and connected OK with data transfer. My laptop is Bluetooth v2. So can someone confirm this to be the problem and let me know if there is a way to sort it out either by downgrading the LD-3W to Bluetooth v1.2 or updating the Atom to Bluetooth v2?<br />
<br />

            Hi Stephan,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your replay, according to the NOKIA support, this device “LD-3W” should work with O2 ATOM. I copied this from the support page:<br />
<br />
What products is the Nokia Wireless GPS Module compatible with?<br />
<br />
The Nokia Wireless GPS Module can be used with other compatible mobile phones, PDAs and PCs supporting Bluetooth specification 1.1. and Serial Port Profile and NMEA 0183 compatible software. Check the compatibility of your device with its manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Seems like some thing else went wrong here, I have a friend using Bluetek GPS receiver + Tomtom 5.21 + O2 ATOM WM5, and everything works perfectly. I might let him look at it, see if there is the setting problem case the failure. I will keep you informed if
 I work it out. <br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            Hi Stephan,<br />
<br />
Yesterday I have tried install “BlueGPS” (a free program download from the <a href="http://www.Zdnet.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.Zdnet.com</a>) on to my ATOM, after set up it correctly, I can see there are communication between the ATOM and LD-3W, I can see the Blue light on the LD-3W was keep flashing, but I couldn’t get any satellite connected to it. Maybe there were too many buildings
 in my area. Try if it work with yours, if it works then we know it’s the problem with the Tomtom software. Good luck!

I had some minor success with GPSTuner, downloadable from Handango, but it was unreliable and it is not TomTom.<br />

Dear Stephan,<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting O2 Asia Technical Support.<br />
With regards to your query below, kindly note that the GPS settings on the XDA Atom can be configured by tapping on Start =&gt; Settings =&gt; System =&gt; GPS.<br />
Under the GPS settings, users may have to select the GPS program port, GPS Hardware port and also the Baud rate. Users may also want to select option to "Manage GPS Automatically" (Under the "Access" tab).<br />
<br />
You may wish to contact the developer of the GPS hardware (In your case, this may be Nokia) for more information on the settings required and for more information on the compatibility of the hardware with the XDA Atom (WM<br />

Seems that the Bluetooth tools fixed the problem and I now have a working GPS. Thanks for that. I have sent a note to Atom support to ask them to fix it in the next ROM release (though I doubt they'll do it). Now I just have to test the device in the real world.<br />
<br />
Oh with bluetooth tools it did some strange things to my Bluetooth so in the end I enabled Bluetooth using it's button rather then the O2 today panel and after that it seemed to work.<br />
<br />
Let me know how you get on. <br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            Hi Stephan, <br />
<br />
Finally I got my ATOM working with LD-3W on a program called GPSproxy, It picks up 13 satellites signals in the open field and in car, it also picks up 3-5 satellites with weak signals inside of the building. However I still have no idea how to get this working
 with Tomtom 5.21, so it seems like the setting went wrong somewhere. Alternatively I am thinking to upgrade that to Tomtom 6, at least I know it’s the software problem not the hardware. Hopefully it helpful.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Jacky
