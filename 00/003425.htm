<h2>            Contacts not sycning from Outlook.com to Andriod Sony Xperia L</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Outlook.com for my email, contacts and calender to ensure everything is keep organised; however I have noticed that althought both my email and calender sync without issue to my phones the contacts don't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When setting up the account , everything including all my contacts download without issue but thats&nbsp;the&nbsp;end of sync for contact;&nbsp;I can make changes either on the phone or computer and these don't sync to or from the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tired removing the account, and reinstalling and I have checked the server details and everything seems right; like I say, email and callender work without and problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone did recieve a software update, upgrading the operating software; I am pretty sure that that the contact sync was working before so I am unsure if this is and Microsoft issue or Sony one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Device is a Sony Xperia L running Jelly Bean 4.1.2 (recently aweek ago)</p>
<p>I don't use the Outlook app, I use the standard email, contacts and calender which comes with the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be gratefull received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set myself a test account up with some contacts and cleared the other account off the phone and everything seem to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So switched back to my real account and it seemed to work; I made a couple of changes in outlook 2007 which showed in outlook.com and the appeared on the phone. But, I made a change on the phone, synced the device and the changes are not showing up in either
 outlook.com or outlook 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make: Sony</p>
<p>Model: Xperia L</p>
<p>Kernel: 3.4.0-g138bbe3-00026-gb931ad7-dirtycme@dc7900-la12</p>
<p>Build Number: 15.0.A.2.17</p>
<p>Android: 4.1.2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought the issue had been corrected, but it seems to be back even after the pain of resetting my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I make a change in Outlook 2007 on my PC, the contact updates to outlook.com and to my tablet without issue, but doesn't pull through to the phone. Same goes if I update a contact on the phone, it says it syncs but it doesn't show either online, the PC
 or the tablet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oddly, I added a new contact on Tuesday and it uploaded fine, but this morning I updated a contact on the phone and the changes haven't pulled through. So I set up a test contact&nbsp;on the phone&nbsp;and it hasn't pulled through, also I set up a test on the PC and
 it hasn't pulled through!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has to be said, its driving me nuts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The android Tablet isn't having any issues, but the phone is struggling and I can't work out if its a Microsoft issue or a problem with the phone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be grateful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            You don't need your product code. Once you install MS Office 365 / 2016 through Microsoft site and activate it, a digital signature corresponding to your computer gets stored in Microsoft servers. 
<br />
<br />Now whenever you login to Microsoft, it will check whether you are trying to install on the same computer or not. It won't ask for the product key again. If you want to install on another computer, you will have to first deactivate Office license which was installed on old computer otherwise it will be counted as a license. 
<br />Hence, deactivate first and then install and activate.
<br />
<br />1. Deactivate your existing installation - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deactivate-an-Office-365-install-767E3560-96ED-4B1C-806D-2FE01C529B1B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deacti...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Install Office again on a new computer - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-or-reinstall-Office-365-or-Office-2016-on-a-PC-or-Mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Downlo...</a>

<p>You can import if you go to FILE &gt; GET EXTERNAL DATA &gt; IMPORT and then you click the file type drop down in the bottom of the file dialog to use ODBC as the source and then you either select an existing DSN if you have one or you create a new one for connecting
 to SQL Server (best to use SQL Native Client 10 as the driver if you have it available).&nbsp; Then you should be able to get a list of the tables and select them and hit okay and they should import.</p>
<p>However, the data cannot be more than 2 Gb (which also includes the Access system table information) so I don't know how big your database tables are in SQL but just be aware of that limitation.</p>

<h2>            &#34;creator of a meeting&#34; field&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if there is a way to extract the original creator of a meeting in a scenario when there is a manager + two delegate secretaries who make meetings and get accept/reject messages for him.
</p>
<p>The problem is that when secretary A creates a meeting and secretary B, for example, receives and opens a accept/reject email from an attendee - the "Modified last by" field changes to Secretary B.</p>
<p>So there is no way to know who out of the two actually initiated that meeting for the manager.</p>
<p>I didn't find any field in the field chooser that could provide me that info of who is the originator of the meeting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will be very grateful for help on this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daniel.</p>

            Hello NinjaBurrito,
<br />
<br />Unfortunately this prefix shows the owner of the folder or the onedrive owner who is sharing that folder, and it isn't possible to be removed.
<br />
<br />Check the suggestion gave for Tisky Zheng MSFT in the link below, it can be helpfully <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/how-to-remove-owners-name-from-a-shared-folder-in/215a2d6a-7c1f-4e12-9191-3b9fb8eac7bb">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/fo...</a>

<h2>            Buying from the Nokia Site</h2>
                    I have had a Pay as You Go phone for the last 5 years. I'd like to keep the SIM &amp; number etc &amp; put it in a new phone. Two questions from a 'beginner';<br />
1. Can I buy a phone from Nokia on line &amp; use my existing SIM or do I have to buy through O2?<br />
2. Fancy a flippy type phone that opens out. Anyone recommend any in particular with £120 is budget?<br />
Thanks

            1. If you buy through the Nokia UK Shop then the handset will be SIM Free, this means it's not locked to any network, not messed about with, just clean from the factory.<br />
<br />
You can use any SIM card you wish in the phone except the 3 SIM Card for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
2.<br />
Look at this page for flip phones,<br />
<a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4221001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4221001</a><br />
<br />
Not many Flippy Nokias i'm afraid.<br />
<br />
The 6131 has some problems which i wouldn't recommend<br />
The N76 is not around your budget and the case peels off<br />
The 7390 is nowhere near £120 too.<br />
<br />
For that reason i don't think there could be any good flip phones except from the N93i which is amazing<br />
<br />
Do you like slider phones?<br />
<a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/link?cid=PLAIN_TEXT_49430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.co.uk/link?cid=PLAIN_TEXT_49430</a><br />
<br />
The Nokia 5300 is very good, Now it has a black version which is even better.<br />
<br />
It has a 1.3 Megapixel camera<br />
Memory card slot up to 2GB cards<br />
Dedicated music buttons on the side<br />
Very good music player<br />
Buttons are big<br />
Nice interface<br />
<br />
This is actually cheaper than your budget.<br />
But you'd have not buy it from Nokia to get it cheap.<br />
<br />
If you go to the O2 website and click on pay as you go, There is a Nokia 5300 Black there for an amazing £69.99 but at Nokia direct it's about £130.<br />
Also the O2 one will be unlocked because o2 don't lock their phones, It comes with a Free £40 music pack, Portable speakers for free!<br />
But this is not available from Nokia direct only O2<br />
<br />
But obviously the O2 one is not a scam as it's through O2 direct.<br />

            Yeah, I think i do.<br />
<br />
But the specifications are old on this phone, Is it even available any more?<br />
<br />
But i think newer phones are better for you.<br />
<br />
But if you are happy and don't need good features then you could go for the 6125.

            It's on Nokia website to buy. I've always had a Nokia &amp; think they're really reliable. This just looks a bit newer &amp; got more than my existing phone. Cheers for your advice

            I am assuming that you are talking about Internet Explorer?<br />
Internet Explorer can be started in a "no add-on" mode that will not enable addons no matter what you have enabled or disabled.&nbsp; This is to allow recovery in case you install an add-on that crashes IE.&nbsp; The usual way to start in this mode is to select:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; Internet Explorer (no add-ons)<br />
But if you copy this shortcut and use it to start IE, then you will start it in this mode.<br />
You don't say how you are starting Internet Explorer.&nbsp; That tid bit would help as well.<br />
<br />
Try the following and see if it will start with addons enabled:<br />
<br />
Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"<br />
<br />

                    <br />
Not getting build 14291 through Windows Update.<br />
<br />
I'm currently at build 14279.RS1_Release.160229_1700.<br />
<br />
I go to Settings, Update &amp; Security and select Check for Updates.<br />
<br />
Only updates I get are for Windows Defender, Get Started, Microsoft Photos, Store,<br />
&nbsp;Candy Crush, Solataire, One Note, Microsoft Phone, Get Office, Mail &amp; Calendar,<br />
&nbsp;and Sway.<br />
<br />
I had this same issue with build 10586 and had to start over by clean installing<br />
10565 and then updating to 14279 using a new MSA account.<br />
<br />
This morning I tried Windows Update again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;03:20 - Check for updates - no update to 14291<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;06:22 - Check for updates - no update for 14291<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;08:42 - still no upgrade to 14291.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've seen posts of fixes for this issue such as changing the registry key but the values<br />
that are being changed are not the same as the values in my registry.<br />
<br />
Why do I not get the latest builds?

<h3> nutmix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cant sync outlook contacts with iphone since &#34;upgrade&#34; to office 365 and windows 10</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">
I have been able to sync my contacts (but not calendar) between my iphone 5c and my outlook 2010 (64 bit) contacts held in my local data file via usb cable and itunes on win 8.1 for the last few years without issue (it has never worked via icloud).<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">
I switched to office 365 (i.e. outlook 2016) and Microsoft kindly automatically updated my machine from windows 8.1 to 10 without my consent.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">
The next time I synced through itunes and a usb cable, it wiped out all the contacts on my phone (but not in outlook thankfully).<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">
So I updated to the latest itunes (12.04.119) and ios (9.2.1) but this did not help.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">
The problem seems to be under "info" in iTunes, the drop down for "Sync contacts with" now only contains "Windows Contacts". &nbsp;Outlook contacts has disappeared. &nbsp;Anyone know how to get it back? .</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">
I am guessing I have no windows contacts - all my contacts are in an outlook data file.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">
Currently I have not a single contact on my phone, and cant find any way to get them out of outlook and onto the phone.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">
I dont know if its upgrading from outlook 2010 to outlook 2016 which has killed the ability to sync contacts, or if its the un-warranted "upgrade" from windows 8.1 to 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">
Windows 10 has caused many more issues and problems, and I can see that people like me who did not agree to upgrade would be upset. &nbsp;E.g. my machine is noticeably slower starting and shutting down, slower opening applications, I always now have to unplug and
 re-plug my usb keyboard after a restart or reboot, it frequently has problems with my Dell 30" DP monitor which windows 8 had no issues with etc. etc. &nbsp;The saving grace is that classic start menu still works with 10 - a necessity for power busienss desktop
 users, although I can see how the 10 start menu could be appealing for for social &nbsp;home users who don't need to be productive.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your issue description, I understand that your contacts are not syncing in Outlook and iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Outlook always plays a passive role when syncing with Calendar and contacts on phone and laptop, since it doesn’t include any feature to control sync settings. All sync settings need to be adjusted using the software which acts as an interface
 to connect the iPhone Calendars with Outlook application i.e. iCloud. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>For better suggestion on Calendar sync, you may contact the support team of the iCloud and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post to us if you need any future assistance with Office.</p>
<p>

            <p>I wonder why you need a static IP address.&nbsp; It seems problematic to me.&nbsp; You might want a particular IP address when your phone is connected to your WiFi network, but what happens when you carry your phone to Starbucks or any other WiFi hotspot you might
 wish to utilise.&nbsp; Your static IP address will likely be invalid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want a particular IP address for your phone when on a particular network, is it not better to configure the DHCP on that network to hold a reservation for your phone's mac address, thereby always allocating your phone the IP address you need on that
 network, but not precluding your phone from connecting to other networks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions. When I ticked the&nbsp;<span>"Open replies and forwards in a new window" it seems to have worked! Although I don't know why I should need to do that, so it's a workaround, rather than a fix.</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac Search Problems</h2>
                    <p>We have several Apple computers running Office 365 Enterprise subscriptions. It seems any version of Office 365 running on Mac OS 10.12 or above cannot search effectively for our business needs. Searches generally return results less than 3 hours and more
 than a week, leaving out all in the middle unless other search terms are presented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We search by recipient, keyword, and body text with the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>I received an Email with an attachment that called for my signature.</p>
<p>This enclosed attachment had my date of birth, social security number,</p>
<p>address along with&nbsp;some other personal information. All of this for a</p>
<p>'life insurance policy.' The sender didn't want to chance my personal</p>
<p>information being compromised, therefore they&nbsp;password protected</p>
<p>the&nbsp;attachment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I was supposed to open the packet... answer a few simple questions,</p>
<p>sign and date&nbsp;the document and fax it back to the sender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried to open this 'password sealed PDF file to no avail.' On an off</p>
<p>chance I open my XPS&nbsp;M1710&nbsp;laptop thinking to myself, 'what can</p>
<p>my eleven year old 'super PC' do that my maxed-out desk-top can't!?</p>
<p>'Lo and behold the attachment walls melted away like butter.' I printed</p>
<p>out the form and mailed it off yesterday. (my apologies for not returning</p>
<p>sooner with an update)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Easy fix,&nbsp;no? Confusing, yes?... I went back to my desktop scratching my</p>
<p>head... what the heck is going on. I'm in Outlook... right!? I'm in Internet</p>
<p>Explorer ... Right... wait a minute, that says Microsoft. I checked all my</p>
<p>browsers&nbsp;only to find out there was nary a Internet Explorer one... Every-</p>
<p>one of my browsers was a Microsoft.com... no explorer... </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;This was why my laptop readily open the locked file.&nbsp;My problem now</p>
<p>being,&nbsp;'I'm sitting here with a 'locked 70 year old brain trying&nbsp;to figure</p>
<p>how I am going to bring back Internet Explorer 10. I have already tried</p>
<p>downloading from the net, however as soon as I hit... 'download' that</p>
<p>is as far as I will get. I have gone about this multiple ways... Only the CD</p>

    <title>Upload Center recreates Office document cache files until all hard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathanlankford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upload Center recreates Office document cache files until all hard disk memory is used</h2>
                    <p>I use Upload Center with Office 365 and Onedrive on Windows 8.1. (I tried upgrading to Windows 10 but my laptop's video graphics driver is not compatible, so I had to revert back to Windows 8.1 blindly.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, the Office file cache in \appdata has been using up all of my free disk space, up to 16GB. I tried using the Upload Center's settings window to "delete files from the Office Document Cache when they are closed" and "delete cached files". When I
 click "Apply" or "OK", the window closes. But Upload center does not perform those actions. I go back to check, and the&nbsp;"delete files from the Office Document Cache when they are closed" is unchecked. So my settings are not being saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to stop using Upload Center and clear my cache manually. I stopped the Upload Center and Office Document Cache in Task Manager, confirmed that Upload Center is not in the list of startup items in my Selective Startup, renamed MSOSYNC.EXE to
 try and confuse the startup of the program, deleted the Upload Center folder in the registry, deleted the Office File Cache in Appdata. I went to Change the uninstall to try and see if I can uninstall Upload Center, but I can't. This program still returns,
 maybe not the first restart, but eventually it restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like Upload Center. But I don't like it using my hard disk 24/7 and all my free space. If I can't stop it from repeatedly doing this - if I have to delete my cache files every hour, and if it puts wear and tear on my hard disk - I want it gone permanently.</p>

            Hi Jonathan,<br />
<br />
Microsoft Office Upload Center gives you a way to see the state of the files you're uploading to a server or trying to delete Office cache files. Regarding your concern, it is possible that the cache file is corrupted that's why it's consuming your hard disk
 space. In this case, we would recommend that you contact our <strong><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/office/ts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Answer Desk Support</a></strong> team to further assist you
 with this concern so that they could find a way to delete the Office cache files in your computer.<br />
<br />

</p><p>I contacted the Answer Desk Support. They said this problem was not able to be fixed. I asked them when this problem could be fixed since it's been 3 years since customer began to bring this problem to Microsoft's attention. They said they would email when
 a fix was available. But seriously doubt they will, after it's been 3 years of waiting already. So every time I see Upload Center reappear in my notification area, I have to stop it, delete the .EXE files and empty my cache manually, just to stop it from abusing
 my hard disk. So annoying.</p>

            Hello 
<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am a Microsoft community advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll happy to help. 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, many users are unhappy with the new outlook and safe senders list is one of the many issues. 
<br />
<br />Please, read the below threads where already many have complained about the same behavior you are seeing. You can also vote for it and add your comments there. I believe this is a known issue and hopefully Microsoft will resolve it soon.

</p><p>My company is using Microsoft CRM and Sharepoint.&nbsp; We are now implementing Teams.&nbsp; We work with many different companies as a project; therefore, each company we work with will have a CRM page as well as a team.&nbsp; I want to create a template for the Team
 - files, checklist items (project tasks), and more.&nbsp; I'm finding that when I create a new team and copy from an existing my files and tab setup doesn't copy to the new project.&nbsp; Is this possible?&nbsp; I don't want to setup each team on every new project we implement.</p>

<p>Hi JasonBalma<span>，</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your description, first your files stored in one team can be copied to another team, for your reference
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/move-or-copy-files-in-teams-f83ed547-359b-4fc8-bf5a-60467f53dd60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Move or copy files in Teams</a>. And you can create a new team from an existing team, then copy the tabs into the new team. &nbsp;Please click create a team &gt; create from... &gt; Team &gt; Select an existing team &gt; Choose Tab. After that the tabs would be copied to the
 new created team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, concerned that you want to use some templates in Microsoft Teams, I did a lot of research about it, there are some general templates available in Microsoft Teams now, and as you said your company has many projects with other companies.&nbsp; So the
 available templates in the Official article may not suitable for you.&nbsp; For more details, please refer to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/get-started-with-teams-templates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get started with Teams templates</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/expand-teams-across-your-org/expand-teams-across-your-organization-landing-page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/expand-teams-across-your-org/expand-teams-across-your-organization-landing-page</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another hand, if the templates you wanted are not included in the Official article, this indicates they are not available now, Microsoft has stated that “
<strong>We'll be adding more template capabilities in future releases of Microsoft Teams, so check back for the most up-to-date information on supported properties</strong>” in the article above, so if you concerned about the templates in Microsoft Teams, it
 is recommended that please give a feedback to <a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public</a> and post your good ideas there. Microsoft will keep monitoring customers feedback there, some features would be added to the products based on the customers feedback in the future, and your good
 ideas will be very helpful for the dedicated engineers in Microsoft to improve the product, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your understanding and patience will be highly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            lost contacts</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone, I've got trouble with nokia suite - version 3.8.30. I synchronized my contats from nokia C5-03 to PC (OS Win 7). Unfortunately I didn't realize that I have to have all contacts save in phone memory. So I moved contacts from SIM card memory to
 phone memory and synchronized it again. During synchronization nokia wrote that I already did synchronization today and if I want to preserve contacts from last synchronization or delete them. I chose deletion. I thought it will delete just synchronized contacts
 but it deleted original too. I understood it badly. Now, contats from first synchronization are deleted. Is possible to save them? &nbsp;Where is standard location of contacts, which folder and which format are these files? I downloaded program which can files
 recovery (program Recuva). Where should I search for lost contacts? Excuse my english level. Thanks a lot for advices!</p>

            Yes, the alias must be in the same location. Aliases can break. If that happens, Outlook will open in a new blank Identity.<br />
