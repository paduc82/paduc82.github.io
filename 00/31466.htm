<h2>            major font problems or font corruption</h2>
                    
<p>I have run virus checks malware checks etc and nothing is found in the font folder. Yet for some reason when I started up my computer yesterday the fonts in firefox were all messed up. Everything was in bold. So i did checking and tried everything to fix
 that. When I decided to just switch to using all my fonts not letting the websites fonts thru it was ok, but i noticed that now IE and windows desktop fonts are all italics. I have checked and rechecked everywhere but cannot find what happened or how to fix.
 I changed the theme to windows vista and the fonts are ok now. I would like to know how to wipe all the fonts from my computer and reinstall them if possible? Also if anyone has any ideas as to what the heck I did please let me know.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p><span><span>Hello beckyrusher,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try to remove and reinstall the fonts. However, here are the steps you can follow:
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Windows have generic fonts for all the applications on your computer</span><span>. Your first step to fix
 this should be to restore the Default Fonts. Here are the steps to restore default fonts:
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Fonts by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Appearance and Personalization, and then clicking Fonts.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the left pane, click Font settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click Restore default font settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Remove and reinstall fonts:

<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 keeps disconnecting from internet</h2>
                    WMP 12 connects to the internet when it is started, and works fine, but after the first time I ID something, it refuses to connect, and says it is set to work offline (when it isn't).
<br />
<br />
I have to restart it to get any more media info. This is weird and only started happening about a month ago, and is getting annoying.<br />
<br />
Yes, I've checked that the 'work offline' button isn't on, I am connected to the internet the entire time, too.<br />

    <title>Windows 8.1 System Font Changes to Wingdings after ANY Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evansprater  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 System Font Changes to Wingdings after ANY Update</h2>
                    This started about two weeks ago after installing a windows update: upon restart, the entire system's fonts' are in an indecipherable "Wingdings-like" font, and I cannot read anything. I restored my computer to its state previous to the updates and the
 problem goes away: however, it reappears when I do ANY sort of update (like an Adobe update, not just Windows). I took it to my local computer shop and they wiped the hard drive and reinstalled Windows, which worked until I updated the system again. I am having
 to refresh my computer on a daily basis now, and re-download all my essential programs that I use at work. This is completely ridiculous and I cannot continue doing this for much longer.<br />

            Hi Evans,
<div>First of all I am really sorry to hear that you had such a hard time regarding the issue and you had to refresh your machine repeatedly to get the issue fixed.</div>
<div>The issue that you are facing right now might be caused due either of the two causes i.e. an application update that is trying to install a font and is corrupting the font layout or somehow the windows font cache is getting overwritten.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please try these steps and see if it helps:</div>
<div>Method 1: Delete Windows Font Cache:</div>
<div>a. Search for a file "fntcache.dat" using the Windows search and delete the file.</div>
<div>b. Reboot and check.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Rebuild the whole Windows Font System:</p>
<div>1.If you have a different machine with any version of Windows running on it, open the c drive and go to the windows folder.
<br />
2.Then find the fonts folder. If you cant read it the folder will have an "A" symbol that you can see.
<br />
3.Copy the fonts folder from the working computer and copy it into the fonts folder of the non working computer then restart.
<div>It will start to fix the words slowly but it is best to restart in when that happens.
<div>&nbsp;
<p>
Also&nbsp;could you please make a &nbsp;to a note of the updates that has got installed recently.
</p><div>
<p>And a screenshot of the issue would be really helpful.</p>
<p>Please refer to this link on how to upload a screenshot on the forum:</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Error 8007001F When Upgrading To Windows 10</h2>
                    Yesterday, after windows 10 was done downloading on windows update, a windows 10 installation wizard came up. (I thought I succeeded in the point where I was just halfway done installing windows 10) I accepted the upgrade agreements, and all that, then
 I chose to "Upgrade Now." After I click upgrade now, my computer restarted. On the next startup, I expected to see something that said, "Windows 10 upgrade: 15%" or something like that but it was just a normal startup. I did my normal startup routine. Once
 I got on my desktop screen. I started to think "why did not windows 10 upgrade?" so I went on windows update and on the left side, i clicked "view update history" and I double clicked the windows 10 update and it said it FAILED. I got a error 8007001F. I researched
 on the internet to find out ways to fix the windows 10 update error 8007001F. One way I tried is to run Microsoft Fix it, a second way I tried is to go to C:/Windows/SoftwareDistribution/Downloads(folder)/ and deleted everyth

            <p>August 8th.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No fix for this problem yet.</p>
<p>I have the following configuration: Core i7 8gb ram windows 7 , dual boot with ubuntu using grub, nvidia gtx 460M.</p>
<p>The installation procedure says that windows 10 its downloading, but when I click "view Download progress" and windows update is opened it says that windows 10 could not be installed because of error 8007001F .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried multiple things like, deleting the downloads folder on SoftwareDistribution, restarting windows multiple times, looking for problems with device drivers, and all of them seem to be fine, deleting software like itunes, and multiple things that
 start with windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far... I have no fix for this and need help to do the upgrade.</p>

            Yes, I had the same problem. I was running OpenSuse and Windows 7 with grub. Used recovery console and
<strong>bootrec /FixMbr </strong>to throw away grub and boot Windows 7 directly. Then the update worked without further problems. As I'm using Linux only now and then and not for any crititcal stuff it was no problem for me. I think it might still be possible
 to install grub again - I didn't change anything in Linux partitions.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>grub seemed to be the main issue. Bootrec.exe /FixMbr and&nbsp;&nbsp;Bootrec.exe /FixBoot didn't worked for me since the grub didn't uninstall.</p>
<p>Bootrec.exe /FixBoot gave also the message "bootrec fixboot element not found" (used the Win 7 installation CD to boot from)</p>
<p>(http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/32523/how-to-manually-repair-windows-7-boot-loader-problems/)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed some additional steps:</p>
<p>I used the Diskpart tool commands:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where I typed the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>DiskPart = starts partition manager<br />
List Disk = list all hard drives<br />
Select Disk # = usually 0 like Disk 0<br />
List Volume = lists all partitions<br />
Select Volume = &nbsp;usually select volume 2<br />
Active = marks partition as active&nbsp;</p>
<p>exit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here some additional info</p>
<p>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/Sharepoint/en-US/7791044e-db7f-4144-a96c-945299811f58/bootmgr-not-found-bootrec-rebuildbcd-and-fixboot-give-element-not-found-error?forum=w7itproinstall</p>
<p>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV84OabGB08)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I got the message "Bootmgr is missing Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart" and booted again from the Win 7 installation CD and then followed the repair option as described here:</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2622803</p>
<p>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmAbyGFSatg)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally the system booted from windows bootloader and the upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10 was done successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tips!</p>

<p>Hi Kanish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you show us a screenshot of your data usage? Notice that it displays your data usage from the last 30 days. So, if you change your connection to metered recently, the information you are looking at might not be accurate. Setting your data to metered
 greatly affects any app that rely on an Internet connection. These changes include:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows Update will only download priority updates.</li><li>Apps downloading from the Windows Store <em>might </em>be paused.</li><li>Start screen tiles <em>might </em>stop updating.</li><li>Offline files <em>might </em>not sync automatically.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>It will still depend if you allow some aspects to be working even while in metered connection environment. Also check that
<strong>Download over metered connections</strong> is set to <strong>Off</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise as necessary.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3&#58; Bumped charger cord shuts down all power - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seangeorge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3&#58; Bumped charger cord shuts down all power immediately</h2>
                    When my surface pro 3 is plugged in and charging, if I move the cord just right (or wrong I should say) the entire device shuts down all power immediately. Even if the device is technically fully charged, it's like there's a power surge or something that
 forces the device to lose all power. I have to wait a few minutes before the device will turn back on. Is this just a charger problem and I need to get a new charger?

<p>original title:Windows 7 Remove Profiles</p>
Hi, <br />
<br />
I run 5 computer labs at a University, recently we decided to give Windows 7 a try.&nbsp; I'm having a few problems with the way it manages the profiles.&nbsp;<br />
I need to remove every profile from the computer so that a new default profile will be used. So far I've tried deleting the directory from C:\Users but the results are my users getting a temporary profile when they logon.&nbsp; The only way to remove a profile that
 will work is from System Properties -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Users Profiles, but that window doesn't even have an option for multiple selection so I'm stuck removing 400+ profiles from 40 computers.&nbsp; Is there any easier way to remove multiple profiles from Windows 7??
<br />
<br />

            I am having the same problem with error code Ox803F7000. I'm unable to install apps from the app store. Now the end of October and 3 months since the first posting. We need a fix for this now.

            <p>Microsoft, Mr. Ali and concerned parties:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i am having the same problem: no matter what i am unable to update or download apps all of a sudden through the store and i get this error code. Of course, after trying a few different ways around it i came up empty handed so i went where i knew the answer
 to this major issue would be resolved... the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And all i see is all these people inquiring about the solution to this major issue - and then this rep simply copy and pastes the same response? Each time to different people? for three months?!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to observe a few things here and hopefully enlighten and educate whom ever the employees of Microsoft involved with this situation, and hopefully get everything moving and working. You know, positivism and productiveness over negative publicity:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Ticketing a minor issue for remedy versus elevation of major issue: All of us in the appdev community know how the post launch and fix ticketing ballgame works: issue is put forth, quality of severity of issue is rated with minor issues going into backlog,
 sever being transferred up for immediate dev team remedy. Being that this issue prevents a major component to operate, typically it should be heightened from the first post - as this one should have been. But, as others kept asking, that should have immediately
 raised it on up out of the backlog. As there is no remedy, let's do that Mr. Ali, if you wouldn't mind?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Explaining the circumstances so no one is in the dark is important. So, let's say for whatever reason the dev team has been working on this issue BUT whatever it is, the remedy is much much more complicated and time consuming, needs heavy research on
 it, etc. This happens from time to time; problems come up. However, problems whereas the person needed it fixed are left in the dark create major problems to brand image and product image...(Microsoft knows this from Windows 8... so now we have free 10's)
 thus, they are trying to remedy that problem. However... this is the circumstances that directly create those negative images for the company.... And then we just have a bad bad loss of investment and no bigger picture change - Which is lose-lose. So, be real
 and keep your parties in the know. Problem solved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Canned responses make you look uncaring and void of concern for your consumer, IE robotic customer service. No way around this one - Mr. Ali, that should be changed, for your own well-being, and the companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, there you go. Let's make some positive traction for everyone, and please let us know! (I say proper time for a response implementing these observations should happen in 24 hours or less for acceptability standards, myself.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you guys will take care of us on this! Much love!</p>
<p>

            My problem went away after I corrected the time zone and time on my computer. I also installed Net Framework 3.5 for something else so it could have been this that unlocked the app store. Either way it is now fixed.

            <p>I never had any problems like this with Google Play Android Apps. Maybe Microsoft would prefer Windows 10 Tablet customers to return to Android Appns.</p>
<p>It seems months since problem first arose and no reliable fix has yet been found. Google must enjoy Microsoft's incompetent embarrassment.</p>

<p>It shows Windows 10 in Progress but when I click on the : Check your Upgrade Status , it just shows that my Upgrade is reserved.
</p>
<p>Also,When I check for Updates through the Control panel, it shows Windows could not search for New Updates.</p>
<p>Error Found 80244019. This is strange, because till the 28th I was able to install the new Updates from Microsoft and everything was running fine.</p>
<p>

    <title>What happens when Windows Automatic Update misses scheduled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heyo_speaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            What happens when Windows Automatic Update misses scheduled installation time&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just have a really simple question:&nbsp; What happens if Windows Update is set to "Install new updates *Every day* at *3:00 AM*" but the computer is off at 3:00 AM?&nbsp; I can't seem to easily find an answer to this question.&nbsp; I am wondering if the computer should
 always be left <strong>on</strong> at the scheduled time -- I would prefer to leave the computer
<strong>off</strong> when I'm not using it.&nbsp; Or will the updates simply be installed the next time Windows is run
<em>following</em> the missed scheduled installation?&nbsp; (In other words, if the computer is off at 3 AM, will the updates be installed as soon as I turn it on at 10 AM?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is it possible to make it so that updates are always installed automatically
<strong>at shut down</strong> as soon as they are downloaded, rather than at a scheduled time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

    <title>Laptop reboots by itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miketinva  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop reboots by itself</h2>
                    <p>I recently "clean installed" Windows 10 Version 1703 on my Dell Inspiron 3552 laptop.&nbsp; Occasionally, it will die and reboot itself for no apparent reason.&nbsp; It happened twice today at about 7:20AM.&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to event viewer and I am not sure what this is telling
 me.&nbsp; Here are a few screenshots:</p>

            Hello,

            Sure it wasn't a power failure? :)
<br />Right-Click This PC&gt;Properties. 
<br />On the left, Click Advanced System Settings.
<br />Under startup and recovery, click Settings.
<br />Uncheck "Automatically restart" and press OK.
<br />What this will do is that before automatically restarting, it would show you a stop code that can identify the root cause of the issue.
<br />For previous ones, go to C:/Windows/Minidumps and see if there is a file. Share it on onedrive and drop a link. Please see for more details:

            Have you checked to make sure all the latest driver updates for your chipset, display driver, network adapters (Ethernet and Wireless) are all updated? I would also recommend you update your BIOS.

            Also, in the Event Logs can you double-click on a Kernel-Power Critical Error and then click "Details".
<br />
<br />Check what Scenario matches from the following article:

<p>Thanks to all for the guidance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked with the Dell/support website, and it claimed all my drivers were up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran SFC /scannow:&nbsp; No corruptions found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned off Auto Restart, so hopefully next time I will get a STOP CODE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not find minidumps or memory.dmp folders under C:/Windows.&nbsp; ("Write debugging info" is set to AUTOMATIC MEMORY DUMP.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop has a fully charged battery, so it seems that if AC power were somehow interrupted, the battery should be there to keep the laptop running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, here is another view of the event log:</p>

            From the Event Log info the problem seems to match Scenario 3 in the following article so possibly a hardware issue:

<p>I ran all the Dell hardware diagnostics:&nbsp; All OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned off all startup items in task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At 8:14 this morning (Nov 9) another unintended shutdown occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked again for the MEMORY.DMP file but could not find it...strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12b33c1a-126c-461e-8904-ca7a224ba2f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12b33c1a-126c-461e-8904-ca7a224ba2f7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I might mention that I do have this laptop "heavily" loaded: Running Outlook 365 with iCloud addins; running a STANDARD Microsoft account with a separate ADMIN local account.&nbsp; Also, the keyboard is sometimes "lethargic" ...&nbsp; does always not display
 immediately what I type.&nbsp; Also, of the last 4 unexpected shutdown&nbsp; events, 3 happened while I was using Chrome and this last one while I was using Outlook 365.&nbsp; And, this last event showed NO critical error like previous times:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/778487af-2261-496c-93ea-fa511b6d88e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/778487af-2261-496c-93ea-fa511b6d88e3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, Windows 10, version 1709 was just installed since I last communicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, anything come to mind given all this additional info?&nbsp; And, why can't I find my dump file?&nbsp; Seems like that should hold some good clues.</p>

<p>There will not be dump files created with no&nbsp;BugcheckCode in the event ID 41 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you provide the following information which may help determine&nbsp;any issue(s):

<h2>            Critical stop beep when shutting down windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running windows 10 pro upgraded from windows 7 ultimate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time i shut down the PC I am getting the <strong>Critical Stop </strong>
sound in the process. I went through windows sounds to double check. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like there&nbsp;might be a process or application running in the background on shutdown and this happens every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been down the <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Troubleshooting route in Control panel and the error still persists. Windows is up to date also.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After googling, others have the same issue but there is no solution I can see.

            <p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description, I understand that Windows shuts down with a sound without any visual notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the below recommended methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party applications to be causing the slow down.</li></ul>
<span><span>1.&nbsp; </span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p><span>Follow: <span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>2.&nbsp; </span>To disable any 3<sup><span>rd</span></sup> party unwanted startup programs in Windows 8 and above, follow:
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Try Autorun and disable any start-up programs you don't need.</li></ul>
<p><span><span><strong>Download Autorun: </strong></span></span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run the <strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter. and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type&nbsp;troubleshooting in the search bar.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select&nbsp;View all&nbsp;on the top left corner.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>System Maintenance</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope the above information was helpful. If you need further assistance, please do let us know and we would be happy to help you further.</span></p>

                    I have encountered the following error this morning- I have Windows 7 - Windows has encountered a problem communicating with a device connected to your computer. THis error can be caused by unplugging a removable device such as an external USB drive while
 the device is in use, or by faulty hardware such as a hard drive or CD-ROM drive that is failing. Make sure any removable storage is properly connected and then restart your computer. If you continue to receive this error message, contact the hardward manufacturer.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>If you had previously set up family features for a child account on another device, there are a few steps you need to take to turn on family settings again. Your child will need to sign in to&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><span>Windows&nbsp;10</span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;with

<p>Dear Kristoffer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, nothing of suggested helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to my Microsoft account there is possibility to "accept the invitation" (I sent to my daughter).</p>
<p>The problem is that she can't sign in her account - the constant replying message is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"There's a temporary problem</em></p>
<p><em>There's a temporary problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>and it seems that her account fell into some kind of loop - problem with signing into her account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no problem with any of other accounts except this one, and now it is fourth day with the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account is visible on the computer and she can log in with her password but there is no synchronization with her Microsoft account, XBox account etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help,</p>
<p>

<p>@parachute, yea there is very very little chance Im going to buy into it. But Im trying to remain reserved until full details are available. I know one thing for sure, if they are offering exclusive maps and weapons, I wont be buying any COD game associated
 with that in the future. And that will be a first for me as I have owned everyone regardless of my tastes towards the devs.

 the drivers again with no luck. It says<strong> Error: 0x00000bc8 - Unable to find core driver package that is required by the printer driver package.</strong></p>
<p>I have spoken to Kodak and they have remotely access my laptop and have confirmed there is nothing wrong with the printer its to do with Windows, so i really need some help please!!!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Windows anytime upgrade is not helpful to repair operating system files. Windows anytime upgrade will enable the features that are being required for the Higher version of Windows 7 . For example: Windows 7 professional to windows 7 Ultimate)<br />
You may refer the following link.<br />

</p>
<div>Instead of performing Windows anytime upgrade, you may try to perform an In place upgrade of the operating system using the Windows 7 Operating system disc.<br />
You may refer the following article.<br />
