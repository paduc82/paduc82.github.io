<h2>            Changing Windows XP Logon Language.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a machine that when you logon the initial logon screen is in French.&nbsp; The rest of the machine is in English.&nbsp; You can type your username &amp; password in English just fine.&nbsp; I am looking on how to change it from French to English without possibly reloading
 Windows.&nbsp; The things that are in French are <strong>Username</strong> |<strong>Password</strong> |
<strong>Logon</strong> <strong>to</strong>.&nbsp; Going into<strong>Control Panel </strong>
&gt; <strong>Regional and Language Options</strong> doesn't apply to this.&nbsp; I have done a lot of research on the Internet and most of the information points to going into the Control Panel.</p>
<p>If anyone has any insight on how to change this I greatly appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advanced.</p>

    <title>Halo 3 Language - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ph0b0z  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo 3 Language</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>IÂ´m Portuguese and IÂ´ve downloaded Halo 3. To my (bad) surprise the game itÂ´s in portuguese (brazilian portuguese). IÂ´ve tried all I could remember to try to solve this problem. Searched for any ingame option to change the audio language and found nothing.
 Then, went to the x360 setting and my language option was already set to english, and the region set to Portugal. So in the console I changed the region to UK but still the game is in brazilian portuguese. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So - and this is the part where I think I messed up - as IÂ´m moving to Cambridge UK in November/December - I decided to search for some more info and ended up doing the account migration on the xbox site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now, when I try to download Halo 3, the game keeps on resetting the download. Or, if the download apparently ends, I can not find it on my game library.</p>
<p>IÂ´ve know that I can only migrate my account in 3 months. But is there anyway to solve this? Or do I have to wait until I move to the UK? Will I be able to re-download the game again once IÂ´m there, since IÂ´ve already downloaded it as part of the games with
 gold thing? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(on a side note, if MS does this brazilian thing for X1, here in Portugal, without giving the option to choose between languages, they will lose this (small) market. I know itÂ´s difficult for someone not Portuguese to understand this, but imagine someone
 from the US buying a Japanese game only to find out that the games had been dubbed by Liberians.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You have a lot of stuff going on here so let's break this down one by one.<br />
<br />
1. The language you receive a game in from the Games on Demand marketplace is in the same language as the region where your account is set. If your account is set in Brazil you would by default get games that were available in your local region's language.
 This has been a large debate among people and unfortunately there hasn't been any large input in this. If a game developer doesn't make languages available in the game itself, then unfortunately you're stuck with the default language.<br />
<br />
2. Changing your locale doesn't change the language of the game's you're playing or downloaded.<br />
<br />
3. You decided to change your account region and are now unable to re-download the game. This is because the game is region locked, you need to be in the same country/region in order for you to be able to download a region locked game. Since you've changed
 your region to the United Kingdom, you will only be able to download this game from the United Kingdom physically. This is the reason why the game is failing to download properly or just re-starting over and over again.<br />
<br />
Now a couple of things I can't answer for you because it's unknown. You may or may not be able to download the game as there's some content that is geofenced where you may not be able to access it again after changing regions. There's unfortunately no way to
 know what content will or won't be geofenced. Information on this can be found <strong>
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/change-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;</strong>(Under Content you've already bought).<br />
<br />
As far as your side note, that information isn't available yet. I'd like to think that since these Xbox One games will be upwards of 20-70GB's in size, developers would be able to include language packs. You'll just have to wait and see on that point.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I've been able to answer most of your questions in regards to your inquiry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Got the same language probblem.</p>
<p>Brazilian is not the same as portuguese. Sure the language may be similar, but even that difference is greater than UK English than American English (not even counting the pronounciation, the usage of the words is different.</p>
<p>So I'm stuck playing the game with thiscrappy language? If it were subtitles, I would just turn them off. But no. The subtitles are in english. But everytime someone talks i just cringe and just feel like it's not even worth it.</p>

<p>I'm having this too and it's incredibly annoying. I'm in italy, so looks like i'm stuck with italian voices? What if i were only here temporarily and didn't speak italian? I've heard the italian voices for a few seconds, got horrified and closed the game.</p>

<p>I have had xbox since day1 and 360 but for last few years hardly used it for exactly this reason I am English/Italian living in Spain when my console is set to Spain I get free DL content but it is in Spanish and if I set it to UK I have dash in English
 but can't DL free content. I speak Spanish but it is not my native language so movies and games have to be in English for me to appreciate them fully. I recently restarted gold for GTA 5 and saw Halo 3 for free DL but couldn't get it as I had region set to
 UK so I changed to Spain only to find game I downloaded was completely in Spanish ...also now so is my dash ... and if I am to understand correctly I can't change back for 3 months ...which means I'll have to DL Spanish updates for my English version GTA 5
 (which probably wont work) and I have to say that though I've been a fan since launch day of the 1st xbox, I'll probably go PS4 next unless someone at MS comes up with a solution.</p>

<p>Hey there folks,<br />
<br />
I'm really sorry to hear people are having issues with the languages that are available in their region.&nbsp;I can definitely understand wanting to play the game in your native language.<br />
<br />
<br />
The language a game is offered in is dependent on the region the content is downloaded from.<br />
<br />
<br />
As Hassassinade has said, certain games are region locked and cannot be downloaded from the marketplace if it is a different region than your physical location.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It is not even just downloaded games. &nbsp;I have bought XBOX boxed games from the UK, but when I try to play them on my XBOX with the console set to: region Sweden, language English, it still forces Swedish language in the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If I migrate region to UK then the box/CD games will play in English, but of course many other things break because my IP is a Swedish IP and my bank cards are from Swedish banks.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have been working to learn Swedish the last several years, but am by no means fluent, so forcing me to play Swedish language games makes the games unplayable, and forcing me to use Swedish language in the dash makes it near impossible for me to navigate
 at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I know many, many other people living in Sweden who don't speak fluent Swedish. &nbsp;They don't use XBOX. &nbsp;I would strongly advise them to stay away from it if they were ever considering it, based on this terrible user experience. &nbsp;1/4 of the Swedish population
 are immigrants. &nbsp;It is very common for people not to speak fluent Swedish, and it is quite easy to get by in the country without speaking Swedish. &nbsp;Why does XBOX want to block huge populations of people like this from being able to use their systems in any
 meaningful way? &nbsp;Especially since all the games in question were originally created in English and Swedish localization came later.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If Microsoft can't find a way to fix this, this will be my last Microsoft game console. &nbsp;It's been largely unusable for me for the last several years as is. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Intel Management Engine Interface critical error on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I restart or shut down my pc weird stuff happens. When restarting it either hangs on the shut down screen, either crashes mid way the process, shutting down completely. Similar when it shuts down. I tracked the error to the Intel Management Engine
 Interface (IMEI) by deactivating it in Device Manager. I do know IMEI is very important but there is no other choice left (also it happens only on Win 10). Long story short, I had to make a clean install of Win 10 due to my HDD replacement. Of course the error
 persist (I tried before to reinstall it as means to get rid off the weird restart/shut down behavior but with no results), except that now if I deactivate IMEI next time when turning on it won't get past the welcoming screen and it turns completely black.
 Only the loading circle of the cursor and the cursor itself shows. I have the latest version of pretty much all my drivers including IMEI. Any thoughts on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p><span>Hi RoÅŸca,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p><span>To assist you better I would like to know, what is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Letâ€™s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to uninstall/reinstall the display driver and check. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>
Device manager</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Locate for <strong>display adapter</strong> and click on it to expand.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the <strong>device </strong>and click on <strong>
uninstall</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once you are done uninstalling the driver, restart the computer. It will automatically install the generic display driver.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If this doesnâ€™t help to fix the issue. I suggest you to update the display adapter driver. Skip step3 from the above steps and right click on the
<strong>device</strong> and click on <strong>update.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above method did not help to fix the issue, I would suggest you to<strong>
</strong>go to the computer manufacturer website and download the latest display adapter driver. If the display driver is not available for Windows 10, try installing the available driver in compatibility mode and check.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check Run this program in <strong>Compatibility mode</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>You can also visit the below link and try the steps.</span></p>

    <title>Folders keep resetting to read only - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Folders keep resetting to read only</h2>
                    I downloaded some photos from my iPhone using the cloud and kept finding that whatever programme I opened them in, the computer wouldn't save the changes as it said the file or folder was read only. &nbsp;I checked the file by going to Properties and making
 sure the read-only box was unchecked. &nbsp;I then checked the folder doing the same thing and found that the folder itself was set to read only. &nbsp;I then unchecked that, hit 'apply' and then went back into the folder to edit the photos, but the same thing happened.
 &nbsp;I then went back into the folder propeorties and found that it had reverted back to read only. &nbsp;I thought that the read only setting may be aplied at a higher level, i.e. to My Pictures, or My Documents, which it was, so I unchecked it and it simply reverted
 back again! &nbsp;I just wondered if there was a way of resolving this or if there is a higher level that I can uncheck the read only options for if this is what is causing every photo to be read only.

            <p>No. I was thinking maybe iCloud still had the file open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could check the permissions to make sure you have write access to the files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would use Process Monitor to obtain more information about exactly what is happenning. But this produces a lot a data and needs a degree of knowledge of how WIndows works.</p>

<h2>            0x80a30299 WHEN REMOVING ACCOUNT. HELP PLEASE.</h2>
                    <p>I have an xbox one s. When trying to get into hulu I receive and error code 0x80070490. When I looked up this code the first thing it wants me to do is remove my account from the Xbox and sign back in. When I sign out of my account and then go through the settings and select my account for deletion I get error code 0x80a30299. This is where the real problem starts because when looking up the first step to fixing that issue they want you to remove your xbox. Which is exactly what I was trying to do in the first place. Basically it's a big circle and I can't win. Please lend me some insight on this matter. I can't use any streaming services at all. Thanks</p>

            Dude same but it gave me error code 0x87DD0006. Iâ€™ve tried restarting my Xbox and it still isnâ€™t loading. It was working fine today, and I didnâ€™t do anything sketchy. I just played Minecraft for a little bit and turned it off for a few hours. Like Iâ€™m
 confused on what to do.

            The driver is updated already as I said in my intro. I wouldn't be on here if it was that simple. As I said, I have no card. It is onboard. And your links only reopen this same page. I don't mean to be rude. It's just frustrating. I think a new video card
 that supports direct x 9.0, and disabling the onboard adapter might solve this. Is there a easier way, or cheaper?

<h2>            everytime I do a net framework update I get bsod until I remove that update</h2>
                    Since May of this year I have had repeated problems after doing any kind of net framework updates. Such as the latest that was out yesterday
<br />
KB2836940 and KB2836939 immediatly after the installation I get the Blue Screen Of Death with an unpaged error
<br />
So I have to do a system restore to before I did the updates before the BSOD will cease.<br />
Last month there was other net framework updates and this is when the problem began. KB2804580&nbsp; KB2804576
<br />
The reason I know its the net framework updates is because I go back after the restore and install one update at a time wait to see if that<br />
update causes&nbsp; problems,it isn't until I do the net framework updates that the problem happens.<br />
I don't know what to do ,these are I'm assuming necessary security updates that I need ,yet am unable to install otherwise will cause a crash.<br />
<br />
I have Vista Ultimate 64bit<br />
Service Pack 2<br />
<br />
Processor Intel (R) Core (TM)2 Quad CPU&nbsp; Q6600 @ 2.40 GHz&nbsp; 2.39 GHz<br />

<p>What is the blue screen error code that you get? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#454545">Stop errors (also sometimes called blue screen or black screen errors) can occur if a serious problem causes

            The error I'm getting is the "page fault found in a non paged area"<br />
And when this occurs the blue screen stays on ,it doesn't restart or should I say recover from the crash..The pc is still on but is unable to reboot and the blue screen will stay there until I manually turn<br />
off the pc and restart.<br />
The error mentions also Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer,it<br />
also mentions disabling the caching and shadowing<br />
If there is a specific error code in this I failed to see it or write it down.<br />
It is also not listed in the event viewer,other then windows shut down unexpectedly<br />
The updates that triggered this all have the net framework in common.<br />
I was told last month to upload the dump files,but I have no understanding of the skydrive<br />
I just went to the site and tried to figure it out,I looked into my minidump file but seen no dump with the dates in question actually they are much older dumps.<br />
Shouldn't there be a current dump for the recent crashes<br />
I think I could upload the folder ok to the skydrive ,but am at a loss as to how to figure out<br />
how to share it and with whom.<br />
Thank you<br />

            Did everything relevant except a clean install of windows...<br />
I really do believe this is a problem with the updates.<br />
I even did a sfc ...<br />
Will just have to stay away from net framework updates until someone can <br />
come up with a solution because I'm at a total loss on what to do any longer.<br />
I have no problem with any of the other updates that should have told me that all the steps<br />
I have taken since the first crash was really not necessary except the system restores which<br />
I had to do to get my pc back before those troublesome updates.<br />
Thanks for the help ,if anyone comes up with something will be glad to hear.<br />

<blockquote><b>So basicly I get BSOD only when my PC left alone for 10-20 minutes with nothing to do, so I just started a game and switched back to the desktop.</b> The computer handels this well, no slow downs during regular things like browsing or such. If
 I plan to do something, that needs more resources, then I exit the game. Without restarting, just putting my PC in sleep mode, its not so annoying, since the game wont crash, and

            It should -- that's exactly where you activate items for that menu -- but Rotation Lock no longer appears on the list of items to display or not display. So odd.

            <p><span>Hi Bailey,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me assist you.
</span><span>Provide us with the below details for better clarity on the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Are you facing the issue on a wired or Wireless network?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>
</span></span></span><span>When exactly are you getting this error message?</span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand you are unable to connect to internet and getting an error message. This might be due to outdated or corrupted drivers on the computer. I suggest you to
 run the troubleshooter to check the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with Internet connection. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue with your internet.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Press <strong>
Windows key + X </strong>Key<strong>,</strong> select <strong>Control panel</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Change the <strong>
view by</strong> option on the top right to <strong>Large icons.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Click on <strong>
troubleshooting</strong> and click on the view all option on the left panel</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Run the <strong>
Internet Connection troubleshooter</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Further if the issue persists, try installing the latest Network adapter from the manufacturer website and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to update the Network driver from Device manager manually by uninstalling and reinstalling from the manufacturer website. Drivers may show an updated
 status but itâ€™s recommended to download all the drivers for Windows 10 from the manufacturer.
</span></p>
<p>

    <title>How to bookmark internet radio streams in WMP 12, Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erin b  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to bookmark internet radio streams in WMP 12, Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I really like the new WMP 12 found in Windows 7 (and 7 is also very good) and am happy that it now easily plays all of the normal video/audio formats (xvid, divx etc). Although I would prefer to use WMP exclusively for my all my audio-video needs :) and
 thus reduce the number of programs I have installed, I have one problem. How can I search (easily) for internet radio through WMPs main window and then bookmark favorite streams? ie Is there a library function assoc with radio urls? (vs typing in the address
 each time).

            Hi Erin B, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers!!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We had the option of saving the favorite Radio stations in Windows Media Player 11 as
<strong><span>Add to Stations</span></strong>,this feature&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;removed in
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Windows Media Player 12.However the songs once listened automatically gets saved in the playlist and you can always listen to them from the saved
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
playlist.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Visit the link below&nbsp; that tells you the features of WMP 12 :<br />

<h2>            0x80070002 - The system cannot find the file specified</h2>
                    <p>When attempting to install something (Python 3.6.4), I am being given this error. From some quick Googling, it seems that this is likely an issue with Windows and not the program installer, etc. Installing the program on a different user account seems to
 work, however it will only install on that account. I recently had issues with a similar error when attempting to updating Windows (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/error-0x800f081f-when-attempting-to-update-windows/a5c7b1a8-b67c-4f49-8bcd-7008a477a55d).
 I am very confused as to why this is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error: "0x80070002 - The system cannot find the file specified."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'm not really sure what topic to post this under, so I hope this is close enough.</p>

<p>Hi Tylor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you were able to install the program on a different account, it may be possible that the account doesn't have the right permission or is not an Administrator which is usually needed when installing apps. If you've already made sure that it has the right
 to install an app to the device, we recommend installing the app in a clean boot state. This way, we can be sure that there are no other software interfering with the installation that is causing the issue. Here's an
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for your guide on how to enter a clean boot state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With your issue with updating Windows, have you already tried manually updating just like the resolution given on the thread you've linked? Also, what is the KB number of the update you're trying to install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your updates.</p>

<p>The account has administrator privileges. Also, performing the clean book had no effect, I still received the error when attempting to install the program.</p>
<p>Also, I was simply pointing out that I almost never receive errors on Windows and that it was odd to receive 2 within a few days. The post that I linked to was my own post. I successfully managed to manually update Windows. However, it seems that the errors,
 in some ways, can have similar causes. In this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2734782/net-framework-3-5-installation-error-0x800f0906-0x800f081f-0x800f0907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>, it discussed the possible issues of installation associated with my previous error code 0x800f081f, which can be cause by issues finding files.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/910336/windows-update-error-0x80070002-or-0x80070003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>&nbsp;discusses my current error. The issue is, it talks about the error being associated with Windows updating.</p>

<p>Thank you for these information, Tylor. It's possible that this issue is caused by your .Net framework installation. Let's try repairing them. Follow

 Article</a></strong> on how to use these utility scans. We recommend doing them in this order,
<strong>SFC </strong>scan &gt; <strong>DISM </strong>scan &gt; <strong>SFC </strong>scan. Also, this would also repair any issues it finds with the Windows updates.</p>

    <title>BSOD error during Windows 10 reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mhkagg  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD error during Windows 10 reset</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Windows 10 installed on my PC and had become laggy lately so I decided to reset it. I reset it from Windows Recovery and did a complete reset (delete files from C drive as well). After the reset reached 100%, the reinstalling started during which at
 10% I get a BSOD error which is&nbsp; DRIVER_PNP_WATCHDOG. After that, the PC restarted automatically with recycle bin on the desktop, black background, unresponsive Windows Start button, and the time information. I also get a "C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop
 refers to a location that is unavailable" error as soon as the PC starts. I tried opening a folder using the Windows+E keyboard shortcut but get a similar error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have backed up all my files so a complete reinstall is not an issue. The reset took around 5 hours to complete after which the installation was interrupted at 10% due to BSOD error. I cannot restart my&nbsp;PC in recovery mode as the settings window doesn't
 open and F8 doesn't open recovery on boot.</p>
<p>What do I do to fix all this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance</p>
<p />

            Sounds like you have logged into a temporary profile. Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to  create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account. 
<br />
<br />Or
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />
<br />Type: explorer.exe
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Another option is to to kill the File Explorer process completely.
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />
<br />Type: CMD
<br />Hold down the the shift key
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Type: 
<br />taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Exit Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />
<br />Type: explorer.exe
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>Thank you for your reply but unfortunately, that didn't work. I had to reset again (I didn't erase the D drive earlier but did that now) and reinstalled my programs and all. It works better now, but thanks to the Windows 1803 update, it has become slow again.
 I tried blocking the update but it was too late and I can't find gpedit.msc on my PC. I changed the settings now so it won't update unless I manually do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any fix to make my PC faster? I have Intel Core i7 7th gen processor, 16GB RAM with NVidia discrete graphics. When I open the task manager, it says disk at 100% even after reset. It is only around 20% used and it is making all my programs slow (I
 am a web and android&nbsp;developer so I use Android studio which gets very laggy). Ran chkdsk&nbsp;but no errors found. Ran SFC which found and fixed some problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please recommend a fix for making my PC faster. Any help will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes in a way..... only some of the USB ports are powered so possibly the other USB ports were<br />
either not-powered, over loaded, or both. Using an external powered USB Hub is a good idea<br />
when using a lot of USB devices. Some USB devices really need to be hooked up to a powered<br />
USB Hub/port. A powered USB Hub has a cable that plugs into an outlet.<br />

    <title>black screen windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> javierb a  say:</h3>
<h2>            black screen windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my Asus s56cm ultrabook (purchased in Spain) to windows 10. The upgrade finished and I installed programs, moved data back and hit restart. Restart was taking about 15 minutes&nbsp;and hadn't turned off the pc. The restart was interrupted and when
 I tried to boot again it wouldn't boot. Never got past the asus screen. I retried about 10 times and got a menu saying that windows had failed to boot and I selected to reset without losing data. After that it would boot to the password screen. I put my password
 in and it would take a long time to load. After that I got a black screen and a popup saying asus touchpad loader had failed. I tried again and again and would just get the same. I connected the hdd to another laptop and remove the&nbsp;touchpad driver that was
 failing. Booted up again and I just got a black screen with the mouse cursor on it. I've tried ctrl alt delete and it works. Menu comes up I select task manager and get nothing. Black screen again.</p>

    <title>Changing language for each individual game - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonaben  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing language for each individual game</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I live in Germany and have my console on german region settings but I'd like to change the language for specific games without changing the system language.</p>
<p>Because that way I have to change the system language back and forth for each game I wanna change the language.</p>
<p>Isn't there a possibility to save the language for each game, so that you don't have to change the system language anymore to get a different language in the game.</p>
<p>Or maybe a software update.</p>
<p>That would be awesome because often times I like my games better in English than German.</p>

<p>I have two hard drives.&nbsp; My C: drive had three partitions.&nbsp; My other hard drive had only&nbsp;one volume.&nbsp; I wanted to delete two of the three partitions on my C: drive to consolidate available space.&nbsp; In deleting the partitions on C:, I accidentally deleted
 the one and only volume on my second hard drive.&nbsp; The second drive now does not appear as a drive in Start-Computer-Hard Drives.&nbsp; It does appear in device manager, but there is no option to reformat it because there is no volume present.&nbsp; How can I reformat
 the second hard drive so it is usable again?&nbsp; I do not need any data previously on the drive.</p>

            Thanks for the reply...&nbsp; I didn't try the partition software.&nbsp; I found another solution:&nbsp; I removed my Primary hard drive from my machine, then I placed the second drive in the primary drive slot.&nbsp; Next, I booted from my Microsoft operating system installation
 CD, then chose "Install Now".&nbsp; The operating system scans for drives onto which you can install the operating system.&nbsp; It presented me with the drive showing that there was no available space.&nbsp; I chose "Advanced" in the lower right hand corner which gave me
 the option to reformat the drive completely.&nbsp; I reformatted the drive, and was successful at recovering it.&nbsp; I then removed it from the primary drive bay, and placed it into the secondary drive bay, and replaced my primary drive into the primary drive bay.&nbsp;
 Next I rebooted normally.&nbsp; Windows started and recognized my secondary drive.&nbsp; I hope this trick helps someone else who reads this!!

            Only third party solutions are available for 2FA over RDP. This seems to be a popular one:
