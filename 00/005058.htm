            take a look at the PDF sales sheet, some might say the 2 megapixel camera is the downside, but since Nokia use such high compression ratio on their phones I think it doesn't matter what megapixel, the unit is loaded and the price is very good (at this
 time advertise $338 US from AIS Thailand)or php 14700. No GPS so it depends what feature you like but for me, this is exactly what I am waiting for.<br />
By the way Ryanismo I will be back at your place end of month, let me know if released there because I prefer the normal english keypad. I think in a week to 10 days this will be available somewhere (my speculation)<br />

            I will address these as best I can after 2 days of using this E51, and same as you I use N73 for 14 months before buying this, 1 important item to remember, though the LCD display is very clear and sharp, it is 2 inch as opposed to N73 2.4 inch. About
 the speakers you can forget it, this unit is very thin, half or less than half of N73, it has a single speaker on the back, which I noticed can leave sounds muffled unless it is being held or laying face down. The bluetooth seems extremely robust and in my
 case consistently exceeds the data transfer rate I was getting with my N73. CPU using ARM 11 at 369 MHZ, everything moves fast- menus, web browsing, the difference is shocking, also this using Symbian 9.2, may be a more efficient operating system combined
 with a faster processor? The camera- well you can forget that too, I wouldn't post any pics, very generic, doesn't do well in bright light, doesn't do well in low light. Has 3 settings for quality, and why anyone would choose the low quality se

            then to follow up, the wi-fi is great. I can compare with E60. It looks to me this unit is designed around 1 concept and that is to move information as quickly and efficiently as possible, all other features are just a sideline. For your very specific
 questions the E51 manual is available online, that is good reading before you buy, anyway that is what I do read the manual before deciding! Then I would note about the camera, it is nearly flush with the back housing (completely exposed) so very very difficult
 to keep it clean, maybe impossible. The last item I would add is there is a menu to change font size, however when I select to change font size, I don't see the fonts change in any application? I don't see the size change anywhere. If someone can give information
 about that I would appreciate it

 not critical but it's super annoying and what if I accidentally file an email in one (I haven't tried this yet)?&nbsp; Does anyone know how to get rid of these empty and deleted folders from here?&nbsp; Help appreciated, Cheers!&nbsp;

            Hello DynamixCommunity_Group, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are annoyed by the traces of the deleted folders even though they should not be there any more. Fret not, I am here to help you with this issue.
<br />
<br />
In order for me to properly assist you, I have a few clarifications to make. <br />
<br />
1. Can I confirm, are using <strong>Outlook.com</strong> or <strong>Microsoft Outlook</strong>?
<br />
2. How long has this been an issue? <br />
3. What are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far? <br />
<br />
It could be a browser-related issue. The browser caches the expired content, even though it is no longer there. A simple
<strong>F5 refresh</strong> should rectify the problem. <br />
<br />
If the issue persists, may I suggest you to delete your <strong>Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies</strong> and clear
<strong>browser caches</strong> then restart the browser? <br />
<br />
- selectively deleting browser cookies <br />

<br />
<br />
Alternatively, open in <strong>private mode</strong> ("incognito mode") or try with a
<strong>different browser</strong> <br />
<br />
Please ensure that you have a <strong>reliable Internet connection</strong> in the entire process.
<br />
<br />
Hope it works! <br />

<p>Hi - thanks for the response unfortunately it hasn't solved the issue.&nbsp; I'm using Outlook.com.&nbsp; The issue appears to have been recent (maybe since the look and feel was updated?)</p>
<p>It doesn't appear to be a browser cache issue as clearing these out didn't solve it. I am loath to try a different browser (using Chrome) on this machine, however the problem exists on other machines (using IE).</p>
<p>I have to say it looks like an issue within Outlook - I mean, if the folder disappears from the active folders view but still appears in the 'Move to' 'all folders' option it suggests that the 'all folders' code is looking at a different version of the folder
 list which didn't get amended by the delete.</p>
<p>Has anyone else seen this with their account or am I the only saddo who tidies their outlook folders??</p>
<p>thanks for trying....</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The issue is </span>when you delete a folder it goes to the 'Deleted Items' folder but when you clear out the 'Deleted items' folder using 'Delete All' it only clears down the deleted emails and NOT the deleted folders

<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How come I did see this before posting on the forum</span> - I'm just not as tech-savvy as I'd like to think!&nbsp; &nbsp;So if you, like me, never delete stuff from the 'Deleted items' folder (and why would you? It gets deleted
 anyway) then you won't know that your deleted folders go there in amongst the tons of old emails.&nbsp; And when you do decide to clear it down, you'd expect 'Delete All' to do just that - to delete everything in the folder!</p>

</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Why do Deleted folders show up in 'Move To'?</span>&nbsp; Beats me why anyone would want to move an email to a deleted folder but someone must have thought, 'hey, that's a great idea!' and programmed it in. Boo.</p>

<p>Hi Erick,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for that information. The Mac user is using the default mail app. If I understand that reference correctly, it says that we can solve the problem by making sure our email is sent in HTML or plain text format. However, we already had that setting
 in place, and the problem occurred anyway. Am I misunderstanding the reference?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will have to <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">strongly</span></strong> disagree with that statement.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a very old issue that affects a number of emails clients, not just Mail or Mac users actually. It has to do with how the email is being sent by Outlook for windows: Instead og using the regular rich text/HTML format, Outlook on your computer is likely
 to be configured to use a version of rich formatting that‚Äôs only supported in Outlook for Windows. Some outgoing Exchange servers also sometimes convert to that format. This has to be turned off to correct the issue for all recipients not using Outlook for
 Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since other clients cannot read the proprietary format, they display the plain text version of the email (that‚Äôs also embedded in the message) and the formatted version (and sometimes attachments) appears as winmail.dat</p>

            So just to be clear you are trying to UNGROUP the smart art?? GROUP will of course not be enabled if only one item is selected (the Smart Art)<br />
<br />
The Ungroup Item should be enabled even if the SA is in a placeholder. IIRC this was introduced with service pack 2, before that you couldn't ungroup smart art.<br />

<p>Your device is running "Windows Mobile 2003."&nbsp;Unfortunately&nbsp;this device does not meet the minimum requirements for having the upgraded version of Office Mobile installed. If you want to be able to work with office documents you will have to be diligent to
 save your documents using one of the older Office formats so that they are compatible with your device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to copy files to and from your device you will need to ensure that you have the Windows Mobile Device Center installed if you are using Vista or Windows 7 (use ActiveSync if you are using Windows XP). Once this is installed when you connect your
 device to your computer it will show up under the "My Computer" icon in the Windows file explorer on your desktop.Once it shows up you can navigate the devices files and copy files to and from it.&nbsp;</p>

            <div>I gave up using the Envelope wizard and use templates for the 3 standard envelopes that&nbsp;I use regularly. Colleague Graham Mayor has some information on changing envelope layouts and some downloadable templates. I believe that you will find that using a
 template will print OK.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Personally, I use a slightly different approach than Graham. I simply set my envelope layout to be centred vertically with an appropriate paragraph left indent and completely disregard Microsoft's use of a Frame.</div>

            <p>Hi Patrik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Upgrade Advisor will look up if your phone can be upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Device Recovery Tool on the other hand, is commonly used when you do want to reset the phone to factory settings and Windows Device Recovery Tool will select which current build suits best for the phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can upgrade to Windows 10 without really needing to use Windows Device Recovery Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, going back to your question "If there's a software for a PC for upgrades so you can simultaneously upgrade multiple phones all at the same time", unfortunately, there isn't any. You can either update "Over the Air" thru WiFi connection or your phone
 is connected to the PC individually.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Car with USB input - but music plays from phone speaker, not car....</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week I got a new Nokia Lumia 520. I've had iPhones for years, but since getting an iPad, though I'd have a change of phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Nissan Quasquai has a usb input which connects straigh to the head unit. I can plug my iPad straight into that usb port and it plays music through the car speakers, with the added bonus of being able to change tracks on the steering wheel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, an iPad is a chunky beast and when family are in the car its not practicle. So I thought I'd put some music on my Nokia and see if the same functionality is available. Unfortunatly when I connect it to the car through the usb stick, it plays from
 the phone speaker, not the car speakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a setting I need to change within the phone, or is what I want to do just not possible? My next option is to play with a usb memory stick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks is advance for any help and guidence.</p>

            there isnt a setting that will allow that to happen.<br />
<br />
the phone cannot play audio/video through the usb. it is for data transfer and charging only.<br />
<br />
your cars radio integrates and controls your iStuff because it has the software integrated to allow for it.<br />
<br />
if you have bluetooth, just connect your device to your car through bluetooth and play it that way.<br />
<br />
my pioneer still allows me to pause, play, fwd, etc on my nokia that way. i just cannot go through the menu system.

            In W7 type msconfig.exe in command prompt go to boot and delete WTP 10<br />
<br />
OR open Disk Management (Control Panel/Administrative Tools/ Computer Management/Disk Management) if you want to remove it altogether, and select the correct drive - right click and select delete the partition you have WTP installed on - not recommended if
 you want to do some further testing - a new and improved build will be out about the 21 st of January.

</p><p>Hi Walter</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, if you have any files in the Windows 10 Technical Preview installation, that you want to save, save these files to external media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <strong>Boot to Windows 7</strong>. Make sure you are using an <strong>Administrator account</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Click <strong>Start </strong>and type&nbsp; <strong>msconfig</strong> &nbsp;In the results click
<strong>msconfig.exe</strong>. In the Configuration editor, click the <strong>Boot</strong> tab. Make sure the
<strong>Windows 7</strong> is set as the <strong>Default OS</strong>. If it is <strong>
not the Default</strong>, select <strong>Windows 7</strong> and click the <strong>
Set as default</strong> button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Click the <strong>Windows Technical Preview</strong> entry and select the <strong>
Delete</strong> button. <strong>Exit&nbsp; msconfig</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Click <strong>Start</strong> and type&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Computer Management</strong>,&nbsp;In the results click
<strong>Computer Management</strong>. On the left side menu, click <strong>Disk Management</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Locate the hard drive partition where the <strong>Windows Technical Preview is installed</strong>.
<strong>Right click</strong> that partition and select the&nbsp; <strong>Delete Volume</strong>&nbsp; option.
<strong>Confirm</strong> the deletion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. <strong>Exit Disk Management</strong> and <strong>reboot the computer</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will effectively remove the Windows Technical Preview and the dual boot configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have more questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Having it on a separate hard drive makes it easier to remove and also easier to keep to test out the final version. That would be my choice. I would make windows 7 the default OS and keep win 10 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should know that windows 7 has been removed from <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2452702/dont-panic-yes-windows-7-is-leaving-mainstream-support-but-it-isnt-being-abandoned.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mainstream Support by Microsoft</a> as of Jan 13, 2015. That doesn't mean too much since you will get all the security updates for 5 years. You would probably buy a new computer by then. That is why windows 10 might be worth keeping at least until you know
 what it will cost to upgrade. MS might have special upgrade pricing as it did with win 8 or special upgrade privileges for testers of the preview. There have been rumors about that.</p>

            <p>Thank you all.&nbsp; I have tried each of these before posting to no avail.&nbsp; It seems that the operating systems do not show up in the boot tab of MSCONFIG.&nbsp; Other solutions have also proved unsuccessful.&nbsp; A intensive internet search provided the following solution
 at this web site</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>This worked on a test drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; I intend to do this as time allows and at worst I will have to&nbsp;restore my hard drive from my backup image.&nbsp; I will&nbsp;eventually rebuild it from scratch.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The difficulty which appears to be causing this problem is that the system files are contained in a 100 MB system reserved partition on the C drive instead &nbsp;of on the main&nbsp;C drive partition itself.&nbsp; Hope this helps someone
 else out.</span></p>

            <strong>Answer to your question:</strong><br />
No, it is not possible. <br />
<br />
However, at a later date Microsoft will allow developers to issue vouchers so that some one can
<em>purchase</em> a paid application from the Marketplace for free. In theory if a developer wanted to allow some one that had previously purchased an application outside of the Marketplace to receive the updates to the application from within the Marketplace
 these vouchers could be used as a mechanism for that. <br />
<br />
<strong>My Thoughts on the Matter:<br />
</strong>In order for something like this to work there needs to be some method of authenticating whether or not a user has rights to an application and there's no reliable way to evaluate the authenticity of one's license for a Windows Mobile title. Some applications
 used no protection or licensing which makes copies of the application acquired both in compliance with the developer's requires and those required outside of compliance (such as pirating) indistinguishable. Possession of a license number may also be unreliable
 since key generators could be used to create new keys and circumvent authentication.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Ultimately the developer of an application will need to be able to control the <em>
gateway</em> for some one transfering their license to the Windows Marketplace for Mobile.
<br />
<br />
I posted an expanded version of my thoughts here:<br />

<h3> rrgrimm  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Power Query&#34; parameterized queries</h2>
                    <p>I am using SQL Server 2012. My goal is to find the correct syntax in Power Query that dynamically populates a parameter list in a SQL IN clause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a SQL Statement with a WHERE clause that looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHERE foo IN(&lt;list of N values&gt;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The full query is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT foo, bar</p>
<p>FROM foobar</p>
<p>WHERE foo IN(&lt;list of N values&gt;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The N values are the query parameters kept&nbsp;in a range of Excel cells. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the correct syntax I use for the SQL in Power Query's Query Editor that will work automatically?</p>

            <p>As for the input, in Excel I might have a range of cells that I want to use as input parameters to a SQL Query:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/501c811e-86f7-4b26-b28b-15b131c1bee1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The SQL query might be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT *</p>
<p>FROM Customers</p>
<p>WHERE Region IN(&lt;WhatSyntaxDoIUseHereToGrabParametersFromExcel&gt;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The query would return something like:</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f89f3bbd-1345-4ec8-9987-e62d3b6dc4ac" /></p>

</p><p>OK, so your resultant table should show only those line items from your base data where the Region column has only those regions listed elsewhere in your worksheet.</p>

            so is there a means for using parameters within the SQL query?&nbsp; I have seen the demonstrations on how to use filter parameters, but a 'where x = parameter' ability would be much more useful.

    <title>Why slide show is stuck on a slide until clicked&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colorgrey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why slide show is stuck on a slide until clicked&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>The project is converted from PP2007 to 2010. It seems to get stuck on random slides while the background music (starting in the first slide) plays on. Strangely, if I play the slide show starting from 1 slide before it get stuck, it doesn't get stuck anymore.
 But then the background music doesn't play this way; perhaps it has some influence on this behavior (bg music is set to play across slides).</p>

            I have not experienced this particular problem, however I have had similar problems when converting ppt files to pptx. The problem turned out to be in animation, for some reason powerpoint decided to animate objects that didn't exist. Try looking in the
 animation pane for this. Hope this helps<br />

    <title>Define next SlideLayout in SlideMaster - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> berttobe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Define next SlideLayout in SlideMaster</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have a presentation, I can insert new slides using [Crtl] + [M]</p>
<p>Starting in a default blank presentation on the First Slide (= Title layout) the next slide will be a new 'Title and object' slide (the second layout in the SlideMaster layouts).</p>
<p>How can I alter the SlideMaster in such a way that by default the next slide inserted by using [Ctrl] + [M] is a specific slide? e.g. following a Section Header layout, by default a Compatison layout should follow, or after a Blank layout by default a Picture
 with caption layout should follow?</p>
<p>Is there a way to define the 'Next Layout' of a CustomLayout? Might be through vba or otherwise code manipulation? Or changing the XML?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetz,</p>
<p>Bert</p>

            <p>Except for the initial action of inserting a Content slide after the first Title slide, when you select any slide in PowerPoint, then press Ctrl + M, PowerPoint duplicates the layout of the selected slide. If the selected slide was based on the Comparison
 layout, so will the new one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be possible to create a macro that inserts a slide based on a particular layout, then add that to the Quick Access Toolbar. QAT icons are automatically assigned a keyboard shortcut. If your macro is the sixth item on the QAT, Alt + 6 will run it
 and insert a slide based on your layout. Please post again if you need help with creating the macro.</p>

<p>When i got my windows phone i found out that Whatsapp is not compatible with my phone.</p>
<p>So i ask you to, either make whatsapp compatible with&nbsp;windows phone (what would be ideal) OR create an application that&nbsp;is similar to whatsapp&nbsp;and would be compatible with whatsapp, meaning that we would be able to talk with whatsapp users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Auriothe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updated information.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you described, you would like to count the Promised Date in April, I would like to suggest you use this formula to achieve it: =COUNTIFS(A2:A21,"&gt;=4/1/2018",A2:A21,"&lt;=4/30/2018")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, the COUNTIFS function syntax is that COUNTIFS(criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2, criteria2]‚Ä¶), which cannot be compared one column with another. As for your requirement of counting
 Shipped Date in April is less than or equal to the Promised Date, I would like to suggest you use SUMPRODUCT formula to achieve it easily: =SUMPRODUCT((B2:B21&lt;=A2:A21)*(MONTH(B2:B21)=4))</p>

<p>Hi Javier, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using a personal account, you must renew your Office 365 subscription. To renew your subscription, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If you see <strong>RENEW YOUR SUBSCRIPTION </strong>in the yellow warning bar, select
<strong>Buy</strong> and follow the steps to renew your subscription.<br />
</li><li>If you see <strong>SUBSCRIPTION EXPIRED</strong> in the yellow warning bar, select
<strong>Reactivate</strong> and follow the steps to renew your subscription .</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After you renew your subscription, close all Office applications to remove the renewal message. If you need help renewing your subscription, see
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Renew-Office-365-for-home-58f3d0f8-15c4-4ad8-8c5f-16d682e8b545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Renew Office 365 for home</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information helps.</p>

<p>Thanks. But still I am not able to use Office. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The message I see is in fact "Subscription expired", but I can't reactivate because the account was created while I was associated with an education institution and I was using a .edu account. Is there a way to get the system to send me to the "renew your
 subscription" page so I can renew (to keep my settings) and buy an Office package?
</p>
<p>

<h2>            cannot access office</h2>
                    <p>Reference to be made to office 365 which I had installed on my computer for about two months. I used Word 2013 &nbsp;yesterday &nbsp;and it worked just fine however when I tried to access my file from it today I couldn't open the program. I tried safe mode opening
 word but I &nbsp;was redirected to Word 2010 (which is luckily still in my pc!) I thought about conflicts between them but all this time I was using 2013 and office 2010 was idle. I also tried to uninstall office 365 (from the webpage) but I couldn't complete the
 procedure. Plus I cannot uninstall the program from my control panel. The last few days I purchased Tune Up but I have currently disabled it although I don't think that is the one to blame.</p>

<h3> lauren-gomez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel - Date Calculation - Weekend End Date needs to be a Monday</h2>
                    <p>I have recently figured out how to add calendar days to a specific date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When calculating dates in the legal field we use all calendar days - M-Sun, but if the end date falls on Saturday or Sunday the deadline falls to the next workday, Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there a formula I can use to do the following:</strong></p>
<p>Subtract/Add 30, 45, 60, any number of days to a date certain where the result automatically pushes to the Monday instead of Saturday or Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong> - Date certain is 11/13/17, if I subtract 30 days the result is Saturday 10/14/17 when it needs to be Monday 10/16/17.</p>
<p>
