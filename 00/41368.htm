<h2>            Hacked all network adapters disabled</h2>
                    <p>Hacker has disabled all network internal devices in 3 computers, Win 7 and Vista...disabled Windows System Protection, deleted all Restore points, plus disabled my android tablet. &nbsp;I only have a MAC to use, and am having difficulty moving downloaded files
 to a flash drive, to move to my laptops and desktop. &nbsp;if anyone has fixes for this situation, this is the third time in a month I have been hacked. &nbsp;I have Norton Security, Malwarebytes, and am still getting hacked, &nbsp;I also feel hackers have placed key tracing
 program into my computers, including the MAC.</p>
<p>He got into my Router and set up a guest account and made password changes. &nbsp;I've been on the phone with Linksys all day, think that is fixed, now...need network cards on Windows computers enabled...I've tried everything, can't do anything. &nbsp;Please help,
 if you can.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are facing the issue on network adaptor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to restart the computer in safe mode with networking:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Method 2:</strong> After restarting the computer in safe mode with networking, try to perform clean boot and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows
 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

<h2>            How do I upgrade my Windows 7 Home Basic 32-bit to 64-bit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a genuine OEM key of my Windows 7 Home Basic 32-bit which my pc is currently running on. &nbsp;I wish to upgrade to a 64-bit version, maybe even a Win7 Ultimate 64-bit version.</p>
<p>I know that my system is 64-bit ready. &nbsp;I just need the installer to upgrade my os.</p>
<p>Are there .ISO file(s) I can download online legally? If possible for free</p>
<p>If yes, How do I install it?</p>
<p>Will my OEM key be used for it? Will the key work for it?</p>
<p>Will upgrading wipe my data in the storage? (Though this is not a problem, I just want to know)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks.</p>
<p />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The article is very easy to understand and follow. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You said you wanted to upgrade to Windows 7 64 bit. </p>
<p>In this case, Windows 7 Home Basic 64 bit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The article provides how you can get the appropriate image to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Option 1, </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a retail Windows 7 Home Basic license, use the software recovery page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ie. If the Windows 7 Home Basic license came preinstalled on your system, the answer is no, you can't use that option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Option 2,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Borrow a Windows 7 Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate DVD and use it to create the desired edition you want to install. Of course, you need to have the 64 bit disc for this to be possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Option 3,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Request recovery media by contacting Microsoft directly and let them ship it to you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what you wrote:</p>
<p>I have a genuine OEM key of my <strong>Windows 7 Home Basic 32-bit </strong>which my pc is currently running on. &nbsp;I wish to
<strong>upgrade to a 64-bit version</strong>, maybe even a <strong>Win7 Ultimate 64-bit version</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then you wrote:</p>
<p>I know that my system is 64-bit ready. &nbsp;I just need the installer to upgrade my os.</p>
<p><strong>Are there .ISO file</strong>(s) I can download online legally? If possible for free</p>
<p>-------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, based on your information, do you have a license for Windows 7 Ultimate? Because you can't use a Windows 7 Home Basic product key to activate Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, where did you obtain the Windows 7 Ultimate license? Because when you bought it, you should have gotten reinstall media with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably the best solution for you is to wait until Windows 10 is released and download the 64 bit .ISO for that which will be provided as a&nbsp;free upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How much will Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has not revealed all the details about pricing for Windows 10 yet, but they did announce that Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c532956-1570-45d6-a00e-a2c48d5aafc2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</em></span><span><em>–</em></span><span><em>at no additional charge. </em></span></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What are the official upgrade paths to Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft revealed in a Channel 9 Video the official upgrade paths to Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/addbb110-1350-48d2-894f-63c042b27f66" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows XP and Windows Vista users will have to do a clean install from a .ISO, so will Windows 8.0 users.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>If you absolutely need Windows 7 64 bit, then you probably need to buy it if you can find it.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Also take into account, not because your hardware is 64 bit capable means it is sufficient to run it.</strong></p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers. Also, if
 you decide to move to Windows 7 64 bit in the future, there is no upgrade path from 32 bit Windows, clean install only.

<h2>            the dependency service or group failed to start problem on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I faced this problem on my windows 10. I was using the Words and then the system stopped working and then I forced to restart the PC. After that, I found I could not access to the internet and no wifi icon showed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried different method online, but none of them work out. Then I check out this method:</p>
<p>Start &gt; Run &gt; Type in services.msc &gt; Hit the Enter key.</p>
<p>Now check these services are up and running:</p>
<p>• COM+ Event System <br />
• Computer Browser <br />
• DHCP Client <br />
• DNS Client <br />
• Network Connections <br />
• Network Location Awareness <br />
• Remote Procedure Call (RPC) <br />
• Server <br />
• TCP/IP Netbios helper&nbsp;<br />
• WLAN <br />
• Workstation</p>
<p>
</p><p>While some of them are indicating running under status. but some are no display under it, like Workstation, Network Connetctions, Network location awareness, server, DNS client that are stopped</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am not able to start the service, and in the dependencies tap, all the system components files are missing.
</p>
<p>Wind32: The specified service does not exit as an installed service</p>
<p>How should I fix this problem</p>

<h2>            Blocked Canon Camera Raw Files in Windows 10</h2>
                    Hello, I am a professional photographer.&nbsp; I shoot landscape and nature photos.&nbsp; I shoot both jpeg and CR2 (Canon Raw) files.&nbsp; At the end of the day I transfer my files to a laptop so I can organize and review what I have taken that day.&nbsp; When I return
 home after being in the field I transfer the files from my laptop to my desktop so I can process the raw files.&nbsp; This has worked well for me for years, until now.&nbsp; Recently I returned from several days of shooting and transferred my photo files (raw and jpeg)
 to my desktop computer.&nbsp; When I tried to open a raw file in Photoshop it told me "Could not complete your request because it is not the right kind of document".&nbsp; When I right-click on the raw file it gives me the message "This file came from another computer
 and might be blocked to help protect this computer".&nbsp; I click on the "unblock" option but it doesn't help.&nbsp;&nbsp;The jpeg files&nbsp;open but Photoshop will&nbsp;not recognize the

    <title>Automatically re-establishing letter drive mappings&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul domaskis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatically re-establishing letter drive mappings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I’ve recently started using VPN to log in to a corporate network.&nbsp; When I’m on the network, either by connecting on-site or VPNing in, I access files using
\\server\share_volume[\absoluteFilePath].&nbsp; I have some network file shares/volumes mapped to letter drives.&nbsp; When VPNing in, however, after establishing the tunnel (which is a manual process), the
 letter drives aren’t recognized.&nbsp; It’s not until I open a DOS shell and ping the server that Windows Explorer actually allows me to access the network files via the mapped letter drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like a klugy way to re-establish the drive mappings.&nbsp; VPNing is not new, though using it with letter drives mapped to network file paths is new to me.&nbsp; Surely there must be a hands-free way to get the letter drive mappings to automatically re-establish
 themselves when the tunnel is established?&nbsp; Sometimes, the tunnel times out, or maybe the WiFi connection gets temporarily interrupted on the remote laptop end, and I have to re-establish the tunnel, then the letter drives.&nbsp; I basically keep a DOS window open
 so that I can quickly recall the ping command, but it clutters up the task bar and makes it that much harder to keep track of all the windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, what’s the difference between a share and a volume anyway?</p>

<p><em>It’s not until I open a DOS shell and ping the server that Windows Explorer actually allows me to access the network files via the mapped letter drives.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; DOS died some 18 years ago with Windows ME. You are probably thinking of the Command Prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>This seems like a kludgy way to re-establish the drive mappings.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Windows will reconnect to previous drive letters at logon time, provided the remote shares are available. If they are not then you can easily automate the reconnection process by creating and running this batch file:</p>
<p>@echo off</p>
<p>net use /persistent:no </p>
<p>net use P:&nbsp;&nbsp;\\server\Folder1[\Subfolder1</p>
<p>net use Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;\\server\Folder2\Subfolder1</p>

<h2>            Is my drive actually encrypted &#63;</h2>
                    <p>1Hi everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to an MS store today to try to get this officially answered - but all I was offered was a new Surface....</p>
<p>Here is my situation / question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Bought a Surface 3. OOBE included several crashed firmware updates. After numerous system resets the thing was finally working well. I actually love this thing compared to my previous iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have a local user account - didn't create with my MS account. Was NEVER offered the opportunity to create BitLocker password or recovery key etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I wondered about encryption. When I check I find the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Settings / System / About tells me: "Device encryption is temporarily suspended. Encryption will resume automatically the next time you restart this device." Needless to say, it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Disk Manager tells me that C:\ is NTFS (BitLocker Encrypted)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- manage-bde -status tells me this:</p>
BitLocker Drive Encryption: Configuration Tool version 10.0.10011
<p>Copyright (C) 2013 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk volumes that can be protected with</p>
<p>BitLocker Drive Encryption:</p>
<p>Volume C: [System]</p>
<p>[OS Volume]</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 115.73 GB</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BitLocker Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversion Status:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Used Space Only Encrypted</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Percentage Encrypted: 100.0%</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encryption Method:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AES 128</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection Status:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection Off</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lock Status:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlocked</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identification Field: Unknown</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key Protectors:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None Found</p>
<p>
</p><p>- So I'm not certain. Is my drive encrypted ? Is the TPM protecting my data with my windows login ? I don't really care about recovery keys - I have all my data elsewhere, I just care that my ost files etc can't be accessed by whoever steals my Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Windows 10 - Different primary button for two mice - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kchandu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Different primary button for two mice</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Currently I use a Windows 10 x64 laptop. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For ergonomic reasons, I use an external mouse (as left-handed) with an external keyboard when docked, and use trackpad as right handed with laptop keyboard when undocked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to Windows 10, operating system's "Mouse and Trackpad" settings allow to configure external mouse with right button as primary button and trackpad as righ handed i.e., left button as primary button. This allowed my usage based on docked vs. undocked
 to suite my needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But with Windows 10, there is no such option. i.e., cannot configure different mouse having its own primary button. One option though is, go to "Mouse and Trackpad" settings and change primary button to "Left" or "Right". Though this is an option, but during
 any given work days, switch to dock vs. undocked usage multiple times and it is a pain every time go to settings and change this setting, very inconvenient and a painful user experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way, in Windows 10 to have different primary button respective to different mouse?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even in case of two external mice are connected, there is no option to configure them as one left-handed and the other as right-handed. So issue isn't just related to Mouse+Trackpad combination but also visible with Mouse+Mouse combination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here the snapshots of windows 7 and windows 10 Mouse settings UI:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 Mouse Properties: It has a "Device" drop down list, and user can set as right-handed or left-handed for
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">each device </span>as needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/142bf4ab-d21a-4b6f-b0e3-c36fd7757cab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/142bf4ab-d21a-4b6f-b0e3-c36fd7757cab" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10:&nbsp;There is no "Device" drop down list to select device. Instead it has a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">system level single mouse setting</span> not ergonomic for multi-mouse users.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/829997bf-847c-4a42-a8d8-2b31835d709f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/829997bf-847c-4a42-a8d8-2b31835d709f" /></a></p>
<p>By the way, windows 10 has two ways to control Mouse settings, Windows 7 style (which is above image), or from Windows 10 Settings. Either way, results are same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information and screenshot that you provided, there should still be a TouchPad option on the
<strong>Settings</strong> menu. This could be caused by corrupted/missing Windows system files. Since you are using Windows 10 Enterprise which is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the IT Pro
 audience on <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?brandIgnore=True&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;searchTerm=Windows+10+Enterprise+settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>TechNet</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>please post your question in the TechNet Windows 10 Enterprise forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further help with other concerns in the future, you're always welcome to post back.</p>

<p>I like Skyrim very much. &nbsp;Which makes me think... I still haven't finished it in nearly the year that I've had it (darn those several game breaking bugs). &nbsp;Nonetheless it is a great game (for me anyway) and I must get back to it one day when I can put aside

<p>I wouldn't take other people's reviews into account much, just give it a rent and see what happens. If you get addicted, you know you like it!</p>
<p>If you play it after one night and aren't addicted, you probably won't like it ha.</p>
<p>Don't worry too much about following games in the series, each game is independent of each other with ties back to the previous games, but you really don't have to worry about it unless you are really really interested.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it, but there are people who don't like games where it honestly takes a long time to beat (especially if you try to play it with no fast travel ;-) )</p>

<h2>            SrtTrail.txt error again&#33;</h2>
                    I had got a SrtTrail.txt error on my Toshiba laptop running Windows 10, and after trying all the ideas, I could find didn't work.&nbsp; I have to wait for OEM media to install some version of Windows 10 on it.&nbsp; I also have a brand new desktop and have encountered
 the same deal.&nbsp; Windows will boot or recover with any of the ideas put forth in any forum anywhere.&nbsp; I have tried the fixboot&nbsp;- bcd-recovery from USB media and all the rest.&nbsp; The only option I have for that system is version&nbsp;1803 which appears to be the only
 cause.&nbsp; How do I&nbsp; get a previous stable version if my new install is 1803?&nbsp; Please do not reply with the same "fixes" already posted unless it&nbsp;has not posted, because I have tried all the ones I can find; get "
<div>'Accessed denied" stops at every attempt and there has been an answer&nbsp;for that which works.&nbsp; So now I am afraid to put anything of value to my&nbsp;new desktop without getting a solution for the latest clean install.&nbsp; I have just one system left in the house
 that works to get an answer.&nbsp; Tried to use my phone but Virtual Agent is incompatible with Android.&nbsp; I would be very grateful if someone who understands the problem can give a solution to the problem instead of throwing things out there which do not solve
 the problem.&nbsp; There are so many open threads&nbsp;for the similar or same issue with 0 solutions already&nbsp;posted&nbsp;that solve my problem</div>

<p>Hello Ercmo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The<span>&nbsp;error you're getting usually occurs if the startup files are corrupted. Based on the information you've shared, it's clear that you've tried all the possible solutions posted in this forum. However, we still want
 to know if you were able to use <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Media Creation Tool</a></strong>&nbsp;</span><span>to create bootable installation media
 using USB flash drive. This ensures us that you have the latest version of installation media. In case you still haven't, we recommend trying that suggestion and see if it makes any difference.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>This pain in the backside,&nbsp;SrtTrail.txt file is resulting file from a bad Boot as discussed over and over but it is just a symptom of a problem with the boot and is difficult to fix the more you try different things like the chances of having a usable boot
 info goes away.&nbsp; It explains why some could solve with a BCD Okie&nbsp;Doke and I could not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so glad I didn't follow this the advise I was getting on here, some had parts I could use and some others had none I could use.&nbsp; The answer may have been buried somewhere but I missed it.&nbsp; I only knew that I got a blue screen (got me a cool BSOD decoder
 now) when I tried to restart and then a bunch of RAW file types,&nbsp; &nbsp;The advice for about doing this and that with partitions and creating or recreating bootrec&nbsp;did not help me at all. The last and final option was to boot with media made with the Media Creation
 tool and reinstall everything.&nbsp; This was not an option as I knew better but did not have a complete backup and there was data I was unwilling to lose.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I found out (or think I did).&nbsp; The boot record may have been irreparably damaged it was too late to know but the efi&nbsp;file was toast (so CMOS handoff to Windows efi&nbsp;/mbr file is missing in action )&nbsp; or perhaps not, the point being the filesystem
 was perverted&nbsp;and shows up with filetype (RAW) in the directories- or lost files including the reserved partitions.&nbsp; The bootrec&nbsp;is a symptom the real problem is the RAW files and missing data files.&nbsp; And even though Fdisk reported 4 partitions, there were
 7 showing&nbsp;up in other utilities and it went as high as 37 in another.&nbsp; Holy crap, right?&nbsp; I bought or acquired utility programs&nbsp; (including my really cool BSOD (blue screen of death) decoder, and spent too much time reading. I learned the files are smarter
 than they look.&nbsp; The FAT(s) lost its mind and playing drunk uncle and while the partitions&nbsp;appeared to be intact it was just gossip.&nbsp; &nbsp;In my case there is no way a boot record would boot and put&nbsp;another wasn't going to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I did.&nbsp; I took the drive out and hooked up as an external drive.&nbsp; It could have a done with bootable media with all of Dos or Cmd accessible but I could not&nbsp;figure out how to get the Media Creation Tool media to include cmd.&nbsp; This was discussed
 by several people (including myself) who were getting memory errors. Having connected the drive to a functioning system, I ran dir and data recovery on it and confirmed the FAT and Partition table were useless.&nbsp; And right before I pushed the format to the
 surface option, I ran across a tidbit in a freeware utility enticing me to buy the full version.&nbsp; It was just dressing up chkdsk&nbsp;with a GUI, so even though I ran chkdsk&nbsp;before to no avail, why not.&nbsp; All, every one of my files, was there and with the correct
 file type.&nbsp; The tidbit was the files are smarter than they appear or dumb, either way, they knew they were not lost and knew right where they were supposed to be so when chkdsk&nbsp;came through to take attendance, the FAT(s) were corrected and data files could
 be saved...backed up for sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have to reinstall the operating system and wait for the OEM windows which came on the system.&nbsp; I am not sure there works on all systems or if doing that in the first place would have rebuilt the boot files or what the exact cause for the corruption

<h2>            Picking a State for a phone number, but where is ALASKA&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to sign up for skype for my business and my personal phone lines. yet am hesitant to do so because there is no option to select an Alaska area code.&nbsp; You can get a number in another country, yet you cannot get one with an Alaska area code.&nbsp; They are
 digital I don't understand how you haven't hired some one to set that up yet. there is a severely untapped market up here that you can obtain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>why do you not have numbers for Alaskans?</p>

                    i was trying to do a windows defender update when this happened. i tried to get to the control panel to check and see if defender was turned off but i couldn't access it at that time. the update was interrupted, that seems to be happening more frequently
 lately. i think i may have screwed something up. a week or so ago i ran ccleaner and during the registry analysis (which i know nothing about so i shouldn't have even been there) there were 2 or 3 files on invalid firewall rules and i opted to fix them even
 though i knew nothing about what these were. a time or two it came up that defender wasn't protecting my computer but when i checked in the action center it said that windows defender was on and also the firewall was on. after i got the message in the title
 of the question windows defender says it is protecting my computer but the green bar that is usually on top of the defender box is black, making me wonder if it is really working at all. is this all related to that message i received while trying to use windows
 defender this evening? will i have to do anything about that message because i hardly know anythig. thanking you in advance for any help you can offer me.<br />

    <title>Very loud Xbox 360 fan&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moosekiller146  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very loud Xbox 360 fan&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have an old Xbox 360 Pro which is a replacement for one that broke due to the RROD. From what I noticed since I've gotten it is that the fans are extremely loud, even when I'm not playing a game.</p>
<p>I have ALL my games installed to the hard drive and the fans are still loud. The speed of the fans gradually increase even when I'm at the dashboard and when I exit a game, the fan stays at the same speed as if I were still in-game. The Xbox is not even
 hot nor is it in a poor location. Warranty void in my case.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to reduce the sound from the fans (other than moving it, turning up the volume or getting headsets etc.)? It's THAT bad that it deters me from using it anymore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only thing i can think off is that maybe there is a lot of dust or something inside the xbox which is causing the fans to work overtime, I am not positive about this, but it could either be time for a new console or it may just be a matter of sending
 it in for a repair and have xbox have a look at it, i have the same problem with my other xbox(old style) but I honestly believe it is old, I have bought a slim now but it is sad to see the old one starting to give out</p>
<p>Hope you get it sorted</p>

            Hi! Usually the games language settings depend on your consoles settings, so if you set your consoles language to English it should be the same ingame. For some games you might have to download them again depending on how the developer packed the different
 language files.

<h2>            Locked out of all accounts in Win7 Pro 64-bit</h2>
                    All accounts became locked out. &nbsp;Welcome screen is disabled, you must hit Ctrl-Alt-Del to login. &nbsp;When I tried to open in Safe mode with command prompt, it goes to Windows&nbsp;Ctrl-Alt-Del screen and I still can't login. &nbsp;The lockout count is set to 3, but
 all accounts were locked out without even any failed attempts. &nbsp;They were simply all locked at once.

            Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;I'm sure that it's not related to any malware or virus. &nbsp;This is a standalone computer, not on the internet or any network. &nbsp;Nothing was introduced into the computer. &nbsp;I had just added a new user account and after the user logged
 in and then logged out, no other account , including the newly created account, would work. &nbsp;The computer reports that each account we try to log into is locked out. &nbsp;We have a lockout count of 3 and only an administrator can unlock the accounts. &nbsp;Unfortunately,
 no administrator accounts can log in. &nbsp;So we are dead in the water.

            This hard drive had considerable security configuration applied to it to make it conform to the Windows 7 Baseline Standard issued by the Army's ODAA.&nbsp; I was reluctant to "Repair or Rebuild"&nbsp;Windows if I didn't have to for fear of having to redo all the
 configuration work already put into the drive.&nbsp; We have a device that can clone a drive from another or be able to act as a drive dock to use the drive as an external data drive.&nbsp; I connected the dock to another computer classified at the same security level
 and was able to burn a CD-ROM with the data that had been put on the drive.&nbsp; Once that was completed, I simply re-cloned the drive from our master drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;So once I recreated the user accounts on the drive, it was back in business.&nbsp; Thanks for replying.

<h2>            My computer gets really hot, lags then freezes.</h2>
                    The computer runs ok in the morning when I first turn it on.<br />
It gets hot really fast.<br />
It freezes. <br />
I have to turn it off to cool down.<br />
I turn it off after each use.<br />
I keep the computer plugged in all the time like I (think) I'm supposed to. <br />
I switched batteries from my 9 to a 6...same problem.

            Hi jeffsomersett,<br />
<br />
If it is getting really hot quickly then there may be a problem with the internal fan. As you mention 'batteries' I take it that we are talking abouyt a lapto rather than a desktop? When you switch the computer on can you hear a fan running? You are not by
 any chance blocking any of the ventilation holes which allow hot air to escape?<br />
<br />
If you can hear the fan running then the fan may have stopped working, either way you will probably need a PC repair shop to take a look at it. If it is still under warratny then contact the shop you purcahsed it from or the PC manufacturer's support desk.
 Without actually looking inside it is difficut to be specific on what is causing the problem.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Xbox One Media Remote Not Working</h2>
                    
<p>Wondering if anyone can help me.</p>
<p>My Media Remote all of a sudden stopped working. I contacted Xbox and they collected the old one and issued me with a new one. The new one worked for a day then stopped working and hasn't worked since.</p>
<p>I've tried an Ir emitter but that has done absolutely nothing. I've tried changing the batteries but nothing.</p>
<p>Has anyone had similar issues or any advice as this is doing my nut in.</p>

            If it's only for the visual, you can edit your background image to make it seem like there's a big icon and make so the graphic of the real icon fit the background. It won't make the hitbox any bigger, but it will still have the wanted look.
