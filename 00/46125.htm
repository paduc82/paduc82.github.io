<h2>            Wordpad document to Open Office&#63;</h2>
                    How do I open a Wordpad document file on Open Office? &nbsp;I have my documents saved on an external hard drive. &nbsp;They were originally created on Word Perfect (version 7 I believe), I'm trying to open them on my new computer that is currently running Windows
 7 with Open Office, however they have a Wordpad (WPD) extension on them. &nbsp;What can I do to rectify this and get them opened? &nbsp;I found a how to on this and am trying to follow it however, the drop down menu on the Open windows doesn't contain Wordpad, at least
 that I can see. &nbsp;Thank you for all your help!

<p>If that is the case, you should be looking for a wordperfect import not a wordpad one.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Open Office 4 will read a large variety of document types, and can save in it's default form, ODF, or you can set it to save in MS Office formats by going to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Load/Save &gt; General and selecting whatever format you want to save in..

            In the new game pass for pc (beta) app, there is no installer for individual games. The app\windows store app is the installer. I have mine set to install to my D: drive, and it installs it to my C: drive for some reason. I have the same issue.&nbsp;

<h2>            Help PC Online. Are they bone fide or is it a scam&#63;</h2>
                    A couple of weeks ago, I had a call from a man with an Indian accent saying he represented a company called Help PC online. He said Microsoft had informed them ( and yes, an automatic error message had been sent, apparently to Microsoft, when I'd had a
 problem a hour or so earlier) that I was having problems with&nbsp; slow operating. He said his company is in partnership with Microsft for tech help.<br />
<br />
I paid the required £99 (for one year of tech support cover) and their tech person remotely accessed my laptop and supposedly cleaned it up! And it has speeded up noticeably since!&nbsp; He also replaced my AVG free anti-virus software with an Avira free download.
<br />
<br />
I have three questions- 1. Have I been scammed? 2. Is there now a security implication, e.g. has my online banking data been compromised? 3. Can my laptop be remotely accesssed again, even if I now wouldn't authorise that?<br />

            <p>To answer your questions in turn:</p>
<p>1. Yes, you have been scammed.</p>
<p>2. Yes, if the person had remote access to your PC you should consider all data (banking,&nbsp;etc.)&nbsp;on your PC at the time and since to have been
<u>potentially</u> compromised.</p>
<p>3. Yes, its <u>possible</u>. They may be using malware to monitor your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you know what they may <u>potentially</u> may have done, you need to tell your bank and take other similar steps. You should also change all passwords, but do so on another PC until yours is clean.</p>
<p>As for your PC, physically disconnect it from the internet. Personally, I would do a reformat of all hard drives and a clean (custom) reinstall of Windows. You may be satisifed with something less drastic, but I wouldn't be.</p>

<p><br />
Yes, you've been scammed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a scam, and one that's becoming more and more common lately. But worse, if you let them into your computer, who knows what damage they did there or what confidential information they stole.</p>
<p>So I highly recommend that you do both of the following immediately:</p>
<p>1. Do a clean reinstallation of Windows.</p>
<p>2. Change all of your passwords, especially any for banks or other financial sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's odd, though, is your machine running faster, and their having replaced AVG with Avira; Avira is much better than AVG.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if you paid by credit card, call your credit card company and see if they can get your money back.</p>

<h3> tamannak5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unlink Skype account</h2>
                    I have two Skype accounts. I want to delete one. However, if I try to delete it, it says my Microsoft Id will also be deleted. Is there any way to delink my skype account with my Microsoft ID and then delete it?

            Hi
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm Maggie, an Independent Advisor from thr user community. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />I am sorry to say that merging two Skype accounts isn’t possible. 
<br />
<br />However you can transfer contacts and credit from one account to the another and, after you leave of of the accounts "empty" you can close that one.
<br />
<br />- To transfer contacts please follow the steps describe here: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa12158/how-do-i-transfer-contacts-from-one-skype-account-to-another" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa12158/how-do...</a>
<br />
<br />- To transfer credit please follow the steps describe here:
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA345/how-do-i-transfer-skype-credit-from-one-skype-account-to-another-skype-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA345/how-do-i...</a> 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />I wish you a great day/night :)! 
<br />Maggie

            Hi TamannaK5 
<br />
<br />I am sorry, that is not possible, the way Microsoft have set things up, every service, like Skype, Outlook . . etc. is linked to a Microsoft account and you cannot delete one of those services, without deleting the underlying Microsoft Account
<br />
<br />This is not an ideal situation since we all at some point need to change/delete accounts, can you please post this to the Feedback Hub (Windows Key + F), where the developers will see this, and hopefully make the necessary changes - the more people that ask for this feature the better . . .

    <title>Can&#8217;t figure out infrequent slow start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rafisher1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#8217;t figure out infrequent slow start</h2>
                    <p><span>System</span></p>

<p><span>Win 7 Pro SP1 64-bit – fresh install</span></p>

<p><span>ASUS Z87C</span></p>

<p><span>Intel i5 4670K with HD 4600 Graphics</span></p>

<p><span>No discrete graphics card</span></p>

<p><span>Intel 530 Series 120 GB SSD for OS and Applications</span></p>

<p><span>Data is on HDD</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>When I get a fast boot, or a slow boot the timings for shutdown, to black windows screen, to Please wait screen, to Welcome screen are all the same. When it slow boots the Welcome screen
 stays on a lot longer and then changes to a black screen with only the mouse pointer on it for for a long time, maybe 2 minutes. Then it goes to desktop and the rest of the boot finishes normally.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>So it is the Welcome and long black screen hang. All other timings stay the same.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I have Boot Time and Boot Degradation in Event Viewer Custom Views</span></p>

<p><span>I use msconfig at Run to alter startup.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I disabled everything in Startup and all services except Microsoft services</span></p>

<p><span>I boots fast, so I added services back a few at a time looking for the slow start to appear.</span></p>

<p><span>All good, so I added Startup items until I got the slow start.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I spent hours yesterday testing and at the end found the following:</span></p>

<p><span>Once it slow starts, I have to disable all in Startup, but not services to get fast boot times.</span></p>

<p><span>I can then enable all but Skype in Startup and it still boots fast.</span></p>

<p><span>When I added Skype, I got a mix of fast and slow boots.</span></p>

<p><span>So I disabled Skype in Startup and decided to start Skype manually after computer was booted.</span></p>

<p><span>I thought I had it, but no, this morning with Skype disabled in Startup I had a slow boot.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Another oddity is there is almost a pattern having to do with the system being off for a longer time for the slow boot to happen and then if I restart, it is fast.</span></p>

<p><span>Error – Event ID 108, PreShellInit on the 12th and 13th in addition to the one yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span>In other words, there isn’t much showing up in Boot Degradation compared to Boot Time</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In Boot Time, going back through all of the Critical entries I consistently see</span></p>

<p><span>BootUserProfileProcessingTime from 132168 to 154590 going back to 13 Oct</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>After writing most of this I restarted and it was fast, I reviewed this and made some more notes, and then restarted again and it was slow with BootUserProfileProcessingTime being the
 culprit. Then I restarted again and it was fast.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Argh!</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the issue description, I understand your computer is slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Did you make any changes prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if <span>dozen programs, load it with antispyware and antivirus tools, and download untold amounts of junk from the Internet. The slowdown might happen so gradually that you hardly notice it, until one day you're trying to open a program
 or file and wonder, "What happened to my poor PC?"</span>you installed a dozen programs, load it with antispyware and antivirus tools, and download untold amounts of junk from the Internet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running any antivirus or security software on your PC, I request you to disable it and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you
 have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can also follow the troubleshooting steps below and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method1: Try updating chipset drivers for Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Chipsets are groups of integrated circuits. In other words, a chipset is a series of computer circuits designed to work together. Every motherboard has a chipset, and certain gaming graphics cards or other pieces of complex hardware feature self-contained
 chipsets for advanced operations. If the chipset drivers are out of date, a computer's hardware may not function properly.<br />
<br />
I suggest you to update the chipset drivers from manufacturing site.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method2:</strong> <strong>Run Chkdsk for Windows 7</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If method 1 didn’t work then proceed with Method 2</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7's "Check Disk" utility (otherwise known as "Error-Checking") inspects your hard disk(s) for corrupted sectors as well as damaged data. It attempts to make a full system recovery if such sectors and files are not heavily corrupted, or presents you
 with a detailed report in the event they are. Running the "Chkdsk" applet for Windows 7 may be accomplished through various efficient steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong><span> </span><span>Click on&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Type&nbsp;</span><strong>cmd</strong><span>&nbsp;in search bar.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>3.</strong> Right click on&nbsp;</span><strong>cmd</strong><span>&nbsp;and select Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>4.</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Chkdsk</strong><span>&nbsp;/f/r</span></p>
<p><span><strong>5</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hit Enter.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important:&nbsp; Data available on bad sectors might be lost when chkdsk tries to repair your hard disc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)"><br />
</span><strong>Method3: BIOS update.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If Method 2 didn’t work then proceed with Method 3</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)">Go to manufacturing website and update the bios.</span>Procedures vary depending on the BIOS manufacturer. Please check the information that came with your computer or go to the computer manufacturer's website. Updating BIOS should

<h2>            access denied to flash drive</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 and backup files to a flash drive. For the last week or so I get a message saying I don't have permission to access these files. How do I get to them?

<br />
<br />Regarding your question, as a first troubleshooting option, did you try to take ownership of the flash drive with the below procedure?

            Hi Becky.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you having any other permissioning problems than with the flash stick?
<br />
<br />If not run the Take Ownership shortcut on the flash stick in File Explorer.  You can install it to the right click Mouse Menu so you have it in your toolbox if you have any other permissioning issues. <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />If there are more permission or Administrator errors or issues, type netplwiz in Start Search, right click Run Command to Run as Administrator, highlight your account, then Properties, then Group Membership tab.  Make sure Administrator is selected, Apply and OK.

                    I have had an on-line casino installed for years, I recently installed bigpond anti virus and now the vcore.dll file cannot be found so I cannot run the programme. Even if I try to re-install I have the same problem, any ideas?

<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What
 is the online casino game you have installed on your computer?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Do
 you get the dll missing error when trying to open any other online applications or just this game?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Have
 you tried to reinstall the game or the antivirus program?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It could be possible that this dll file is not installed when you install the Bigpond Antivirus. Try to turn off Bigpond security and check if you
 have the same issue. Here is an article you can check out that I found: </span></span></p>

                    <p>First, let me start by saying that I am aware GFWL isn't fully supported anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>However, my friends have told me that you can redownload purchases and some games like GTA IV require it to activate.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Heres my problem:&nbsp;</p><p>I own several games (GTA IV, Fallout 3, Etc) on GFWL and I simply cannot redownload them. At all. I download the GFWL app. It installs fine on Windows 10. Logs in just fine. No problem.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>But, I am greeted with "There was an error retrieving your purchase history. Please try again later".&nbsp;</p><p>This has been the same for a couple weeks. I've tried reinstalling a few times, clearing cache on Windows 10, etc. No luck. I do not want to rebuy these games again so I am hoping someone at Xbox could assist. lol</p>

                    <div>My newly purchased PC (received July 2018) has been bricked again by a forced automatic update (even with updates switched off).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The first time happened within 2 months of receiving the new product - it was eventually sent off for repairs under warranty, the motherboard was bricked. It bricked in September, received it from repairs with replaced motherboard in January.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>New update, 2019 April 13, bricked this morning after update started in the evening.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Same symptoms, same result. Computer loaded fine, finished up the remaining updates, rebooted, stuck at motherboard screen perpetually.</div>

</div>
<div>Two times, in 6 months?&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Daniel.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />Windows Updates are software, which cannot harm hardware.  Software can also always be repaired or else reinstalled.  I'll give you all steps to do one or the other.
<br />
<br /> Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start or function: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  The bootable media is also the only method that doesn't require the password if you're stuck on that.
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1809 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>

<p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your step-by-step troubleshooting guide - I will diligently attempt these solutions.<br />
<br />
The previous time, the motherboard was replaced because the technician couldn't get the system to work again after last autumn's update - so, in that case, the hardware was irrecoverable.<br />
<br />
I hope these suggestions will have better success. I will update this thread with the progress/result.<br />

<p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p><br />
I have attempted the 3 restart and force shutdown multiple times with no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some work, I've prepared a bootable media USB for Win 10, however, this doesn't really do anything when inserted because the screen is fixed at the boot up screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did discover, however, that TAB key will bring me to a new screen that says:&nbsp;"Press &lt;DEL&gt; or &lt;ESC&gt; to enter setup."&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Upon which after pressing DEL or ESC, it will say "Entering setup..." and then do nothing beyond that forever.<br />
<br />
PC is responding to usb keyboard (can restart with ctrl+alt+del) and the usb external dvd drive whirls the disc.<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>Giving us some info on your system may help.&nbsp; The more info regarding components and configuration, the better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a system requests you enter the Bios setup, usually means something there needs to be adjusted.&nbsp; If you were to have a bad drive it could lock up your system even if you were not using it to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you ever checked the Event Viewer on your system when it was running normally to see if any errors show up consistently?</p>

            It's concerning that it will Enter Setup but not actually get there.  That may require resetting the BIOS by another means if it can't be accessed via the Boot menu which is what you need to trigger to boot into the media by interrupting Windows failed attempt to boot.
<br />
<br />So go back and follow the steps I gave exactly to trigger the boot menu key for your PC which is shown in the chart or on the BIOS splash screen.  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Again this is different from the BIOS Setup key also shown in that chart which enters the BIOS/UEFI firmware settings.  With a UEFI BIOS though we don't want to change the Boot Order there to your flash media, because Windows Boot Manager must always remain first to boot.   Hence the BIOS Boot Menu key, aka BIOS Interrupt key.  
<br />
<br />Here's how to reset the BIOS by other means as a last resort if none of these functions will work:  <a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/how-to-reset-cmos-and-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.maketecheasier.com/how-to-reset-cmo...</a>

            As far as errors go, the event viewer did not show any errors other than once last week the external CD drive malfunctioned because the usb connector was not in firmly in place. Also there is no beeping from the motherboard when the PC loads up to logo
 screen.

            See if unplugging the hard drives stops interference with being able to boot into Boot media and UEFI Setup.  
<br />
<br />Be sure to guard against static shock when reaching into case, by not working on carpet and touching the metal case before each time you reach in.

<p>The hard drive is a rather small SSD card - a little more than about half the length of my index finger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wearing an anti-static guard clipped to the casing, I am working on a wooden table and a floor with no carpeting.<br />
<br />
I removed the ssd card, the same thing occurs when pressing TAB and then DEL or ESC. "Entering setup..." yet nothing occurs. Ctrl+alt+del does not reset the computer at this point, only hard reboot.<br />
<br />
I've tried many key pressings at boot up including all F keys, Del, Esc, and combinations of ctrl+shft+alt+fkey but only TAB has any effect.<br />
<br />
I've attempted a CMOS reset with the little thingy that covers the prongs at the cmos reset area. But that did not effect any change. I'm not certain how to remove the wire connection of the cmos battery itself - it is rather tiny (but I do have some tiny tools
 at my disposal).</p>

<h2>            Laptop Theft - Queries relate to data recovery&#47;removal</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have recently lost my HP ENVY 15-k010tx laptop. It had a windows 10 on it with 'Find my device' enable. I know i cannot recover the laptop at any rate. What i was wondering how can I remotely wipe my data ftom that laptop so i can salvage some of my loss.
 It logs on with microsoft account. Anyone has any idea how to do it. I didn't install any third party softwares for anti theft so that door is a no-go for me</p>

            <p>Hello Muhammad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may not be possible from our end to erase or format data remotely. Again, it also depends on what version of Windows are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best course of action would be turning the stolen property report to police under Theft and Robbery cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the location setting on your device is turned on,&nbsp;you can use Find My Device service to find your device on a map.
</p>
<p>Note: Your device only sends its location if it’s connected to Wi-Fi and has enough battery power.
</p>
<p>This free service on <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=615845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">To find your device</span></p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=615845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose the device you want to find, and then click <span>Find My Device</span>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>You'll see a map with your device's location.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope the above information related to stolen device using Windows operating systems was helpful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

    <title>HDMI Handshake Issue&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skab1e  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI Handshake Issue&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>OK, basically the HDMI on my 360 doesn't seem to work with my TV any more. No sound or video. I've tried 2 different HDMI cables and neither make a difference, my TV says either "Not Support" or "No Signal".</p>
<p>I've tried the hold Y and LT to reset the display settings, the console restarts, but still no signal.</p>
<p>I've also tried blindly adjusting the display settings, but with no luck (kinda hard to do if you can't see or hear anything.)</p>
<p>The problem started the day after I added a 60GB HDD, but that could just be a coincidence. I had used a Seagate 500GB USB HDD prior to that. I've troubleshooted with both HDDs connected, just one connected and with none connected, but still no luck.</p>
<p>However, I've tried my 360 on a friend's TV and it works fine. His 360 also happens to work fine on my TV with no problems.</p>
<p>My TV is a Kenmark 19" HDTV 50/60Hz 1080P. It doesn't have YPbPr connectivity.</p>
<p>My 360 is pre-owned from Cex, presumably a Pro. Wasn't supplied with a HDD so it's hard to tell.</p>

<p>Yeah I've tried that. Just realised I typed LT instead of RT in the OP. I did mean RT.</p>
<p>Seems strange that it's doing this. The HDMI port on both my TV and 360 work perfectly fine, they just don't seem to work together any more.</p>
<p>I'll keep trying to find out a possible fix for it.</p>

<p>Hey there Macinkui! I think your post may not be coming across properly, as it reads like you connected two TVs together with an HDMI cable. Can you please try explaining your issue a little more so we can assist you? Thanks!

<h2>            My printer is not communicating with my computer</h2>
                    I have an older Lexmark all in one inkjet printer. It has been working fine, until it stopped communicating with my computer. It is a Lenova. I have done everything, it says it needs the cable to be checked, the same cable that has worked fine forever.
 There is no + by my universal serial bus controller. I installed a new driver, Nada! It is driving me crazy. I can't find any help. Anyone have any answers?&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Remove power from your modem and router for 3 or 4 minutes and then power them back up. And<br />
the reboot the computer.<br />
<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible solution? And I would<br />
update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are you positioned from the router? Are there
<br />
obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write
<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then<br />
Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />

How to Install a Device Driver in Vista Device Manager<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions. (The<br />
ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Vista loves<br />
updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests one just HIDE it as they<br />
are almost alway old and you can look for drivers manually as needed.<br />

<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Right Side click Customize - Set Network Locations page -<br />
on lower left click Merge or delete networks&nbsp;locations&nbsp;- DELETE ALL instances of your network&nbsp;(and any&nbsp;<br />
others you no longer use) - REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect To to logon on to Network.<br />

<h2>            Windows won&#39;t boot after I deleted windows.old. What should I do &#63; please help me.</h2>
                    <p>I was using CCleaner to free up some space so &nbsp;i deleted windows.old folder along with some other unnecessary files but I found that CCleaner couldn't delete windows.old folder completely. All it deleted was somewhere between 40 to 50 MB of nearly 1 GB of
 that folder. When I tried to restart the laptop, it got past the manufacturer logo and then showed a blank dark screen and nothing else then. I tried using startup repair by &nbsp;option but didn't help. From there I reset my PC keeping my files safe(the option
 was there) and that too didn't help. After resetting I can reach to sign in screen but as I enter the password and hit enter , the same black screen appears. I have lot of important file that I can't risk losing them at any cost. I googled and found that I
 need Windows Installation media in a DVD or usb drive to help me out. I downloaded the 64 bit iso file of windows 10 according to my system. I have that file in USB now but i don't know what to do next. I seriously messed. Please help me. I have written my
 pc specifications below.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I have to agree with your last statement. </p>
<p>Your first priority must be to retrieve your important files. You can do it like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get yourself a 2.5" hard disk in a USB case. They cost very little. Connect it to your PC.</li><li>Ask a friend to run the command RecoveryDrive.exe on his Windows 10 machine in order to create a bootable Windows 10 USB flash disk.</li><li>Boot your machine with this flash disk.</li><li>Use robocopy.exe to copy your important files to the new hard disk.</li></ol>
<p>Post again if you need detailed instructions for Step 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After fixing or reloading your machine, remember this basic rule of data processing:
<em>Important files must at all times be stored on two independent media.</em> No exceptions. Lots of people flout this rule. They invariably change their minds after suffering a major disaster.</p>

<p>I appreciate your help and it's the other option I might choose in case the trick I've come up with fails (backing up files). That is so : I reached startup repair options by powering off and on my laptop 3 times. From there I selected advanced repair option&gt;Troubleshooting&gt;Advanced
 options&gt;Command prompt</p>
<p>
</p><p>It launched command prompt and therein I typed notepad and hit enter. It opened notepad an then &nbsp;I clicked "open" followed by "file". It launched a small Windows Explorer window. Notepad is supposed to open txt files but I changed file type to "All Files".
 Now finally I can browse all the files and I can copy them to external drive connected. All I need is an external drive with enough space to copy all of my data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry to say so but your method, while quite inventive, is not only extremely time consuming (one file at a time!) but it will generate many files that contain errors. Why? Because notepad.exe is not a binary editor. It was made for ASCII text files only.
 The "All files" option only refers to the file name. It does not extend to the file type.</p>

<p>I just purchased Far Cry 3 for €9,99 from XBL via PayPal and after receiving the payment confirmation the price of the game is stated as €29,99. The site showed €9,99 and I payed €29,99. What is this and how can I refund the game? This is not what I want,
 just misleading information, should not be possible.</p>

<h3> thatguy38  say:</h3>
<h2>            atikmdag.sys, Windows 7 x64, ATI Radeon 4850, Crossfire</h2>
                    I am on my 3rd install of Windows 7. Having a really bad time with the video drivers. And from what I have read, others are too. I shut it off for now and will leave it off till better drivers are released. The funny this is, is that the drivers
<em>from windows update</em> are just as bad as the drivers from ATI. If you install the video drivers from windows update you are looking at BSOD. You can reboot into safe mode and remove everything ATI however if you continue to try to boot normally you will
 ruin the OS and you will have to reinstall. Specifically it is atikmdag.sys. This was also an issue with Vista from what I have seen researching this issue. The supposed work around is to just install the driver but even if you download just the driver it
 wants to install the Catalyst Control Center which atikmdag.sys is a part of. So you are stuck between wanting to install the drivers for your video card or using the generic video driver that is stable and won't crash your system. The annoying thing is is
 that with the generic driver the video on the monitor is scaled. So you have a black border all the way around the screen. The maximum resolution of my monitor is 1920x1080. The best I can get with the generic driver is 1440x1080.<br />
<br />
I would say that it was a hardware conflict somewhere however this is hardware that worked just fine in Windows XP.<br />
<br />
Is there a fix for this yet or is it more of a "be patient" thing? <br />
<br />
My system is as follows, <br />
<br />
Asus P5K-E Motherboard<br />
4 gigs of DDR2 1066 RAM<br />
3 10,000 drives RAID 0<br />
ATI Radeon 4850 cards in Crossfire. Monitor hooked up via HDMI. <br />
<br />
Not that any of that matters since it seems everyone across many different configurations is having the very same issue as I am.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, its a very expensive case full of hardware that is unusable. I know that I am going to asked for information that I haven't included in this post but I am at work at the moment and can't provide it.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Alright everybody.. Same situation for me. Two HD 4850's in crossfire mode.. I updated some drivers and started to get the BSOD with the atikmdag.sys error. I actually came up with a fix for this 4 hours later that doesn't require you to reformat your computer.
 In my case, here is exactly what I did:</p>
<p>1. Start computer in safe mode with networking</p>
<p>2. Download and install Driver Sweeper which can be obtained <a href="http://downloads.guru3d.com/Guru3D---Driver-Sweeper-%28Setup%29-download-1655.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a></p>
<p>3. Start the Driver Sweeper program, check the ATI - Display box and click on the Clean button. This will delete ALL ATI drivers from your system.</p>
<p>4. Reboot computer again, it should start normally now if everything worked right... Now you're gonna remove any CCC program via add/remove programs.</p>
<p>5. Now all you have to do is find the original driver you had before you tried to upgrade. I would recommend using the disk that came with your video card. You can also go to the ATI website and search for your exact model and download the drivers... Keep
 in mind, I would stay away from the newest versions of drivers as they all seem pretty buggy...</p>
<p>The current CCC software I am running stable is: Catalyst™ Control Center Version&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2010.0406.2133.36843&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current driver I have installed for my HD 4850's in crossfire mode is atikmpag.sys (8.14.1.6113)</p>
<p>This driver with that version of CCC hasn't failed me yet. Try not updating graphics drivers if you don't have to. If it isn't broke, don't fix it.</p>
<p>I really hope this helps everybody out... I got mine working again... Oh and for all of you with the black borders issue the post above mine is 100% accurate and will fix the issue.</p>
<p>Also this is the system I am currently running:</p>

            I had the black border as well but its actually an easy fix and hopefully it'll work for you. &nbsp;Go to your CCC Panel, then go to Graphics, then to Desktops and Displays, then in the bottom left corner, you will see your monitor or monitors. &nbsp;When your mouse
 is over the icon an arrow pointing downward will appear that will represent a drop down menu. &nbsp;Click that arrow then click Configure. &nbsp;You should see more then several tabs on this screen. &nbsp;Click the tab called Scaling Options, then slide the bar to Overscan
 (0%) and click apply then ok. &nbsp;You should be good to go. :)

<p>Their site does not indicate that Printmaster 7.0 is compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p>They are up to 17 or 18&nbsp;now, I believe.</p>
<p>You could try installing it in XP compatibilty mode but no guarantees.</p>

<h2>            networking Windows 10 home computers</h2>
                    I have 2 Windows 10 desktops LAN wire connected to a Comcast gateway/router. I cannot get these 2 computers reliably to be visible to each other; that is, folders shared on one do not often or predictably appear in the Network portion of File Explorer
 on the other.&nbsp; In fact, the shared folders on either computer itself often cannot be displayed since the name of that local computer does not even show up under Network, which seems very odd. Also, I notice on one computer that when I right-click on a file
 or folder, there is a "share with" option that can be selected; on the other computer, that option is not there and rather the option "give access to" appears in the dropdown menu and this seems to serve a similar function as "share with" judging from the
 lock icons that appear when you select either option. Again, also seems odd -- this difference. When I try to check the network status on either computer, I get a message that the computer appears to be configured correctly but tha

<p>Hello Albert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd like to get more information regarding this so we could better check and provide a more established resolution. Please provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this your first time to encounter this issue? If so, did you make any changes to your computer's configuration prior to the issue?</li><li>What exact error message that you're getting when checking the network status?</li><li>Can you also please confirm the current build of your Windows 10?<br />
&nbsp; (Type <strong>winver </strong>into the Cortana search box, then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can create a homegroup on your Windows 10. A homegroup is a group of PCs on a home network that can share files and printers. Using a homegroup makes sharing easier. You can share pictures, music, videos, documents, and printers with
 other people in your homegroup. You may check this article: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17145/windows-homegroup-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HomeGroup from start to finish</a></strong><br />
for more information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response. </p>

<p>Actually I can't create an effective homegroup. The laptop on which I am making this reply was locked out of joining the homegroup that existed on my home network. That is the reason I became interested in network file sharing in the first place. I contacted
 Support and we were not able to resolve this laptop's inability to join my homegroup, so I dissolved it and tried to go the network sharing route. Besides the 2 desktops and this laptop, my wife also has a laptop and so does my son. In general, I observe that
 the 3 wifi devices seem more reliably to establish communications than the 2 LAN connected computers. My son rarely if ever is interested in sharing files on our home network, so I am not going to run winver on his laptop. Here are the Windows 10 winver results
 for the other 4 computers:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>This ASUS laptop: Version 1703 Build15063.67 (this laptop blue screened about a month ago and I had to contact Support to figure out how to reinstall Windows, lost all programs and settings of course.) NOTE: In the course of writing this reply, the laptop
 has wifi disconnected and refuses to find a network so I will have to plug in the LAN line from the Dell desktop even to send this reply. It obviously shows nothing on the Network now. After connecting the LAN cable, only this laptop itself is shown on the
 Network.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>HP desktop: Version 1703 Build 15063. 674 (this is the main computer on which our Homegroup was originally created). This shows only the Dell laptop on the Network. After plugging in the LAN cable on the ASUS laptop, it also appeared on the Network here
 and also on the Dell laptop.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Dell desktop: Version 1709 Build 16299.19 (this desktop reported that its failing hard drive had to be replaced and I did that and of course had to reinstall Windows and start from scratch).&nbsp;This shows the HP desktop, the Dell laptop, and itself on the Network.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Dell laptop: Version 1703 15063.674 Build (this is my wife's new laptop that she just got a month and a half ago at Best Buy when her Dell desktop became inaccessible due to failing hard drive). This shows only itself on the Network.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>All 4 computers have been able to access the internet.</div>
<div>
<p>I am now going to send this and shut down this laptop and replace the LAN cable to the Dell desktop. When it restarts, I hope (against hope) that this laptop will be able to make Wifi connection the way it was connected when I started this lengthy and convoluted
 reply.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Frustrating having all these problems.</div>

<p>I didn't pay attention to network shares much when I was running Homegroup on my 3 computer. It wasn't until Homegroup stopped working on my laptop and after I had to do the Windows 10 reinstall to remedy my fatal blue screen that I was forced to look for
 a different way to try to share files. And I have been looking since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't do anything to my HP desktop other than make sure had had networking enabled and a couple of folders shared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Dell Desktop, I had to replace the failing hard drive that Windows 10 kept alerting me to. That meant I had to reinstall Windows and start from scratch with networking and everything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife's Dell laptop was just bought new and all I did was enable networking and make sure 1 folder was shared on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes this is my first disappointing encounter with the difficulties inherent in getting a getting a network of Windows 10 home computers operational.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message I get when attempting to diagnose and repair the local are network connection on both my LAN wired desktops is this: "Your computer appears to be correctly configured but the device or resource (DNS server) is not responding."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Dell desktop lists both my Asus laptop and my wife's Dell laptop on its network contents and expands to the proper shared contents.&nbsp; The HP desktop lists only my ASUS laptop on it network contents, but when I try to select it, it says there's a problem
 with my network. When I click the Diagnose button, diags run but it comes back and says "Could not identify the problem."&nbsp; There's an error code 0x80070037 -- "The network path was not found."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither desktop lists itself among the network members, so I can't readily identify which files I have shared on the computers although I know I went through the process of sharing at least a couple of folders on each.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really am getting absolutely nowhere with this. I guess I should just be happy that they all boot up and connect to the internet even if they won't network with each other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that you have local IPv6 connectivity through that.&nbsp; If it doesn't it would explain your problem with the Homegroup because neither it nor its troubleshooter pay any attention to that requirement.&nbsp; You can use&nbsp; PowerShell&nbsp; Get-NetConnectionProfile&nbsp;
 to check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A related problem is that before W10 e.g. in W8 I think ISATAP was working but I don't think that any more.&nbsp; So, if you don't have IPv6 connectivity through your router you may need to diagnose that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A related issue is that I think when I have IPv6 it helps to disable IPv4. &nbsp; E.g. that may help avoid some DHCP problem symptoms. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These aren't things that the troubleshooters are much help with; however, the troubleshooters are useful for pointing out omissions that you may not have thought of such as whether File and Printer sharing is really enabled or whether there is sufficient
 authentication to permit a connection to be used to share files.&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find other diagnostics and workarounds for local Networking issues caused by W10 CU on TechNet forums.&nbsp; Here is a current example</p>

<p>IPv6 through router has been enabled, as has IPv4. Network is currently operable although I do not have high confidence it will remain so indefinitely --we'll see. I currently have 4 computers networked: 2 LAN wired desktops and 2 wireless laptop . Each
 can access the other 3 at present; however, I am periodically require to provide credentials even though I specified a save of credentials when I last accessed network share. I had to enter Credential Manager through Control Panel and inspect Windows Credentials
 on each computer. There were some inconsistencies in the computer names appearing that I had to address by changing names on the computers. Changed names were a result of changes I made sort of inadvertently when I had to replace a hard drive on one desktop,
 reinstall Windows 10 on one laptop, and add my wife's&nbsp; laptop to the network. I don't know why I thought Windows would find and adjust to the devices on the network. Obviously, on each computer it goes to a file or database saved on that computer and tries
 to establish connections based on what it has previously been seeing. It does not dynamically on-the-fly connect. I had to access my router and find the IP addresses for all the computers. Then for the 2 LAN connected desktops, I had to manually enter IP addresses
 in their network setup. I also had to reset the network on the computers and do some renaming on the computers so that the Credential Manager (Windows Credentials) on each would reflect the actual current computer names for which the correct user names and
 passwords were properly entered. There are still some curious anomalies I don't understand.&nbsp; For example, a computer icon appears on my laptop which is really just a memory card installed in a shared network printer. On other computers, this appears under
 Other Devices as the shared resource it is. Also, on the 1709 desktop, sharing works and manifests itself differently. All the 1703 computers have A Share With option in dropdowns when a file is selected for sharing. It's different on the 1709 computer and
 when you go in and try to specify the share information, the process is somewhat different. You just have to fly through it by the seat of your pants and trust your gut based on what options you have available as you are in there working to tweak the settings
 toward the same result as on the 1703s -- shared files. This</p>
<p>may not make a great deal of sense. I felt like I just had to immerse myself in the mysteries of the configuration and feel my way to a solution, which apparently I have sort of done. It helped to be able to look at posts and info online that pointed me
 toward Credential Manager and the need to reset the network. The Windows 10 network troubleshooter were of no use and only pointed me with cryptic messages toward non-solutions. I hope this whole confusing mess of mine helps someone else out there.</p>
