<h2>            Lost email in Outlook on my laptop, but not tablet or phone, or my office computer</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>For the past week I have been unable to receive email in my laptop from any of my three Hotmail.com accounts. At the same time, I AM able to receive that mail on my tablet, my smart phone and on
 my office desktop. So, obviously something became corrupted in my laptop, (a Dell Inspiron 15)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Can it be due to the November update of Windows 10?</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>I have tried the procedure outlined in an earlier email from Microsoft, but the result has been that Outlook will not recognize my passwords…no matter what I try it just keeps sending up a dialog
 box asking for my password…over and over.</span></p>
<p>Additionally, it not allow me to add a new email account, Whenever I try to do so, the result is as I noted above with regard to my current email accounts</p>
<p><span>HELP!</span></p>
<p>PS: I will only be able to read responses on my phone, tablet or in my office.</p>

            <p>Please understand that my Hotmail accounts (4 in total) are affected only on my laptop.
</p>
<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. I use Outlook 2010</p>
<p>2. I tried all I could find</p>
<p>3. I tried deleting the account, but Outlook would not accept my password, so now I cannot reinstall the account...on my laptop</p>
<p>The other three Hotmail accounts are still shown on my laptop Outlook, however,&nbsp;for all intents &amp; purposes they are dead as they cannot retrieve or send email.</p>
<p>Please note that I am replying on my Fire tablet. Also I can retrieve and send email for all.of my Hotmail accounts on my tablet, cell, via the Mail app in Windows 10, and via Outlook on my business office computer...but all hotmail accounts on my laptop
 ( 3 others) are affected.</p>

            <p>Update to the above:</p>
<p>Using the option of manually re-setting up the affected&nbsp;email accounts, I did retrieve some messages and begin to receive new messages (I had been using the Windows 10 Mail App to keep up). However, there is a new glitch.</p>
<p>1. I cannot delete messages from any of the the accounts, </p>
<p>2. nor can I empty the Deleted or Junk mail boxes. </p>
<p>Instead I get a message telling me that the Deleted box is unavailable, and to restart&nbsp;Outlook to remedy it. However, restarteing Outlook did not solve the problem. Fortunately I am able to handle deletion&nbsp;and emptying by using Outlook on&nbsp;the computer in
 my business office (at least on Monday through Friday). But, it is certainlyinconvenient.</p>
<p>How can I remedy this situation which is now souring me on Outlook altogether?</p>

    <title>Why can&#180;t I save .msg as .msg in IE 11&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why can&#180;t I save .msg as .msg in IE 11&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>Hello all,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have a following issue with IE 11. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In our company we use a web based help desk system where I occasionally need to download .msg created in outlook (containing attachments as well).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In IE 11, when I "left-click" the link with .msg, a new tab opens containing encrypted text. If I "right-click" and choose "safe as" I only have the option to save as html.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So my question is: Is there an easy way to enable saving the .msg as ".msg"? And not to only save it as html?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(I know of a workaround as I have a possibility to change file extensions, so while saving, I change html to msg and the file gets opened properly in outlook, but other employees don´t and can´t have the option to change extensions)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>E.g. in Chrome "left-click" prompts download dialog to save file as .msg and "right-click! &gt; "save as" there is a .msg option. So I would like to see the same behavior in IE.</span></p>

<p>Hello Clark Ari,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Windows 10 Pro x64, so no enterprise edition. I have done some research, and from what I understand, IE and Edge as well both handle a .msg as HMTL (after left click I get decrypted page with original text wrapped in sort of random letters and numbers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, when I left click in Chrome or Firefox, I get prompted to download the .msg file as "Outlook item (.msg)".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have read that .msg is considered "unsafe" by IE in general... So I wonder, whether there is some customizable security option in IE settings? Or is it "hardcoded" security policy and thus there is nothing to be done?</p>
<p>

<p>The .msg file is identified by Internet Explorer settings as unsafe and it's created by design for security and privacy. Also, the default viewer of emails should be Outlook application and .msg files is not recommended by Internet Explorer security settings.

<p>Hi Clark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook is set as default app to open emails. </p>
<p>As I have stated before, the problem is, that I can´t download .msg file (via link on website) with IE or Edge as .msg file. I can only download it as HTML file. (Firefox and Chrome work fine)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there any setting in IE that would allow me to download .msg as .msg (and not as HTML)?</p>

            Did you check in both the gmail settings and in outlook.com settings for Rules or Forwarding? 
<br />
<br />Outlook.com: go to Settings &gt; View all Settings &gt; Rules (this link should get you there <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/rules</a>)  - also check in the Forwarding section.
<br />
<br />Check Gmail to make sure you aren't pulling in in one that side: <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwda...</a>

<p>Hello,</p>

            Ran the full repair.&nbsp; Instead of repairing, it ended up uninstalling the entire Office suite.&nbsp; So after I redownloaded Office, I ran the updates, but still no HTML previewer in Outlook.&nbsp; Next suggestion?<br />

<p>I read through that article and followed the instructions.&nbsp; Basically what this does is tell you how to modify the value for the Excel previewer registry key.&nbsp; But this article assumes that you have the key in your registry in the first place and that you
 need to either change the type or the value.&nbsp; My problem is that I don't even have an HTML previewer registry key, so this article doesn't do me much good, since I have no registry key to modify.&nbsp; So how do I add the HTMP previewer registry key in the first
 place?<br />

<h2>            Uninstalling Office 365, and installing Office 2016...what to do first</h2>
                    <p>My Office 365 subscription will run out in two days (April 5th, 2017).&nbsp; I have purchased a product key card for Office 2016 to replace the subscription.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Will the "uninstall" option in the "apps" system settings work for thoroughly uninstalling Office 365.

<p>
</p><p>Also, do I need to "cancel" the&nbsp;current&nbsp;subscription on my account, or does it automatically get canceled?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your inquiry, if your subscription is not on auto-renew, you can just wait for the subscription to expire. At the same time, it would be best that you uninstall the Office 365 and install Office 2016 to avoid any conflict. To learn more, please
 refer to these articles:</p>

<h3> daniel a. galant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Groove Playlist File</h2>
                    <p>Why is this such a mystery? Nobody seems to know, or is willing to share, where Groove stores its Playlist Files. I still use a Zune player. yes, i said Zune. It holds all my music so i can take it with me. It's compact and it WORKS. However, when finally
 giving in and starting to use Groove, I noticed that my playlists all showed up twice. Well, I removed a copy from the Groove application, but it turns out those were some of the ones my Zune used, so now those playlists are gone from my Zune. A search of
 my system does not find the playlist files and nobody seems to be able to tell me where these files are located so that I can copy them to where my Zune can use them. Why is this such a closely guarded secret?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file has to be somewhere? Where?</p>

            The frustrating thing is with Windows 8.1 with the Xbox music app you could swipe the charm bar in from the right and tell it to share the playlist with a phone or whatever.&nbsp; That functionality is gone -- it seems they are trying to box people into subscribing
 to the Groove music pass in order to "take their playlists on the go."&nbsp; Unfortunately they are giving us few Windows Phone users a penalty for choosing their platform by restricting some basic functionality that other phone platforms enjoy.&nbsp;

            Frankly... I cancelled my Groove subscription and moved to Spotify. I gave up on the Windows phone a while back and went back to an iPhone. I really wanted to like the Windows phone and integration, but there is simply no support for the platform and the
 apps are not there.

<p>
</p><p>At my work we have a user with a Nokia Lumia running 8.1 that we setup with a live account for work, this user also has a personal onedrive account. They have taken photos on thier work phone that they want to upload to onedrive so they can access them as
 they like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user is signing into the onedrive app (which in 8.1 you can't sign out of) and telling the phone to share photos on the device with his personal onedrive account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These photos are however being uploaded to the work onedrive account that has obvioulsy been linked when we setup the phone originally, is there a way to specifiy where his photos get uploaded to? I cant understand why if he is logged into his personal onedrive
 accounts its uploading them to his work one?</p>

            <p>Hello edwardmallet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think, one reason is, that the one drive account was linked/setup to the one drive work account first when you set up the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you can specify or change it, if you do a reset on the phone and then just change the setup to the private one drive&nbsp;account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindregards</p>

<h3> xudan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Sign in to Skype Using Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>First of all, sorry as I don't know where exactly this topic should go to...But I'm really annoyed by the problem with my Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>BACKGROUND INFO:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Operating System: Windows 10 x64, without any third-party antivirus software.</li><li>Skype version is 7.7.0.103 and Help-&gt;Check for Update tells me it's the latest version.</li><li>My Microsoft account (which is an @outlook.com email address) is working well: now I can still sign into any other Microsoft services (including my Windows 10 operating system) and websites without any problem.</li><li>Two Step Verification is turned on for my Microsoft account.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I was able to sign in at Skype using the same Microsoft account just minutes ago.</li><li>After upgrading Skype software, I tried to sign in as usual. But after entering password and verification code (for two-step verification), Skype (or the Microsoft login interface) told me "Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again".</li><li>I tried again, again and again, but got the same result.</li><li>I tried to 1) change my password; 2) turn off two-step verification, but neither works for me.</li><li>I tried to 1) uninstall/reinstall Skype; 2) Remove Skype configurations on my computer; 3) login to Skype using my Microsoft account on another computer, but got the same result--so this is probably not computer-specific.</li><li>I tried to change to another wifi hotspot but still no good.</li><li>I tried to login on my computer using my friend's Microsoft account, and YES the account can log in.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I need to login to my Skype as I've got hundreds of contacts there...Is there any ways to resolve the issue? Anyone can help? If needed I can provide you my MSFT account via private message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>THANKS IN ADVANCE!!</p>

            <p>Thank You GW~I just read through hundreds of search results and found a way to resolve the issue, and it's simple:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just logged into my MSFT account and changed my name and got able to log into Skype! I changed the name back to original and can still login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a strange solution... Thank you again for your help, and I'll remember Web Skype and that inside Outlook.com as backup options.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get Cortana Notebook to open</h2>
                    When I first got my phone Cortana worked fine. &nbsp;But for some reason I can longer open the Notebook. &nbsp;When I click on it, I am returned to the start screen. &nbsp;I can no longer get Quiet hours to work or adjust my inner circle. &nbsp;What can I do? &nbsp;Will this be
 fixed when windows 10 is installed? &nbsp;Any help will be appreciated.

<p>I tried all that by still can't open notebook.Whenever I tap the icon it just sends me back to last place I was. Can't turn on quiet hours although all conditions are met - Cortana is on, battery saver is off and driver mode is off (at least button is on
 off even though it says automatic). I don't know what else to do. Is it possible to disinstall and reinstall? Where do I get the program?</p>

<p>My sons Nokia 6300 is playing up.&nbsp; He can hear it when it rings, play music on it, sms etc.&nbsp; People can hear him talking when they ring, but he can't hear them at all, he can only hear them on loud speaker but not on his ear.&nbsp; Most peculiar.&nbsp; Just wondering
 if there is something wrong with his settings, although we have tried just about everything.&nbsp; One minute it was fine and the next he can't hear anyone who calls him.&nbsp; Thanks in advance if anyone can help. :-)</p>

<h2>            Modern apps don&#39;t &#39;resume&#39; after extended period in connected standby</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 Build 9926 on a Surface Pro 3 i7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that after the computer has been asleep for a little bit (maybe an hour or so) none of the modern apps that were opened at the time of&nbsp;sleep&nbsp;resume correctly.&nbsp; Instead you just see their default splash screen and they need to be closed an reopened
 before they are functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else noticed this behaviour?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for&nbsp;posting your query in Windows 10 Technical Preview forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue you are facing could occur if the drivers need to&nbsp;be updated.</p>

</p><p>To fix the issue, Please&nbsp;update the chipset and graphic driver of your surface pro 3 and check if that helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press <strong>Windows key + R key </strong>and type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and click
<strong>Ok.</strong></p>
<p>b) <strong>Expand</strong> the <strong>graphic driver </strong>and <strong>right click
</strong>and select <strong>update driver software.</strong></p>
<p>c) Restart the system after installing the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install the chipset&nbsp;driver in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi Komal</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried that but the Intel HD Graphics 5000 were already up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this might be more a problem with power management or a bug in windows 10 technical preview.&nbsp; Just wanted to see if any other users have experienced this or experienced everything working correctly on surface pro 3.&nbsp; That way&nbsp;I know if I need to
 log it as a bug via windows 10 feedback app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with surface pro 3 getting results either day (Ie apps not opening after standby or perhaps all apps always working after standby and sleep)?</p>

<h2>            Transferring Auto Complete Between Two Different User Accounts in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be impossible, but I'm not certain. I am trying to get user A's auto complete entries to populate in user B's new emails. Both users are on the same Windows 7 64-bit computer and are using Office 365 accounts which are configured on Microsoft Outlook
 2016.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've tried navigating to C:\Users\UserA\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\RoamCache and transferring the Stream_Autocomplete_0_###.dat file (the most current version) to user B's RoamCache directory but after doing so and starting Outlook, it appears to overwrite
 this list or completely ignore it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do any of you out there have any suggestions? Thank you for your time and attention.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Ovi Store App&#58; Conflicting applications. Show items&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I'm an user of Nokia 7210 Supernova (S40) phone from India. I bought my phone in September 2010. I used to use the Ovi Store app on my phone, it was working fine. But, for some reasons, I made a factory restore and all my apps were deleted. I downloaded all
 my other apps again. But, when I tried to download Ovi Store from <a href="http://store.ovi.mobi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://store.ovi.mobi</a> (using both Opera &amp; my phone's default browser) and also using the DOWNLOAD! app in my phone. A message displayed: "Conflicting applications. Show items?" Whenever I click YES, the entire screen goes white and the phone restarts automatically.
 If I click NO, nothing happens, it quits.. I tried many times to install the OVI STORE APP. Even, I restored my phone, made hard reset, re-installed my firmware, formatted my phone and the memory card.. Tried everything. But, the same problem is occuring.
 I'm totally confused. I searched the internet for a solution, but no use. There's nothing. I even searched on the NOKIA DISCUSSIONS, but got nothing. I asked the NOKIA HELPS on twitter for a remedy, they told me that they would reply to me as soon as they
 get a solution. It's been three days, but no reply from them. I'm not the only person facing this problem. But, it seems Nokia has no interest in solving this issue. Nokia is a reputed handset manufacturer, but if they don't take care of their customers, then
 what's the point of being reputed? I'm really sorry for being rude, but what can I do if I don't get a solution to a problem that is affecting about thousands of Nokia handset users! I hope to see a remedy from Nokia soon. I'm ready to help them if they required
 any help in solving this issue. But, please, please reply to this post and look into this matter quickly.. Please..

            Got the same problem here in the Philippines. Mine is Nokia Asha 303. Conflicting application notification came after doing an update. I do not know what the hell is wrong with the update system? Everything is fine prior to the update procedure. Browsing
 the web for answers, it turned out that many users are having the same problem but remained unresolved to date. I just hope Nokia pay closer attention to this matter.

<p>This is a very serious issue that nokia should adress why would one try to update a browser and after that conflicting apps stops you from using all your apps. nokia should work quick on this or leave us with no choice than warning friends of the risk of
 being cut off from their various social apps if they purchase nokia</p>

<p>By "after an update" do you mean update from OneNote 2010 or 2013 to the free(!) OneNote 2016?</p>
<p>Because that is a "trap": Only the full versions of OneNote can open locally stored OneNote files. All others (including the free OneNote 2016) need them to be transferred to OneDrive first. And this can also only be done with the "full" OneNote from MS
 Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The correct error message would be "...requires a full featured MS Office including OneNote", not "...an eglible Office 365 subscription", but that does not help very much.</p>

</p><p>That's very interesting, because we have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use Office 2016 ProPlus in a provisioned Citrix environment. In our test environment, OneNote (the same bits were used) works properly. This error now occurs during the transfer to production. In both cases, Office was successfully activated via KMS.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we proceed with the troubleshooting I need more details:</p>
<p>What are the steps that you have tried so far to add the calendar from iPhone to Outlook 365?</p>
<p>Which operating system is installed on the machine?</p>
<p>What happens when you tried to add the calendar, do you get any error message?</p>
<p>Does the calendar multiply on Outlook or the iPhone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may backup the calendar, delete the contents on the calendar and then re-sync it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide us more details to assist you better.</p>

    <title>Changing Fist Pointer back to Hand or Arrow Pointer in IE7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oldtiger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing Fist Pointer back to Hand or Arrow Pointer in IE7</h2>
                    I have one computer running Windows XP Pro SP3 that persists in displaying a "fist" pointer when moving around on a web page. I have 2 other comuters with XP Pro that do not exhibit this pointer. The problem started when I upgraded to IE 8 and persists
 after removing IE 8 and restoring IE 7. <br />
<br />
It is about to drive me crazy as I cannot mark text for deletion or printing and it is very difficult to exactly position the "fist" over a button to execute a command.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me how I can return the pointer to either the arrow or pointing finger cursor? Changing the mouse pointer in the control panel has no effect when using IE.<br />

 the drop down list to my table. I have used the criteria in my table [forms]![form name]![combo box] run my query. WHen I select the item from teh drop down I get no results. but if I close out the form and run the query and type in the data it dispays properly.
 It is almost as if the form is not passing the information to the query. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            A form does not <em>pass </em>a value to a query, the query <em>references </em>
the control in the form as a parameter; it's pull not push.&nbsp; The form must be open with a value selected in the combo box before the query is opened.&nbsp; Usually the query, or more commonly a form or report bound to the query, will be opened by means of a command
 button in the dialogue form, with the code in the button's Click event procedure first checking that a value has been selected, e.g.<br />
<br />
Const MESSAGETEXT = "Please select a value from the list."<br />
<br />
If Not IsNull(Me.YourComboBox) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "YourFormName"<br />

The combo box's BoundColumn must equate to the column in the query to which the parameter is applied, e.g. if the BoundColumn is a hidden numeric key such as CustomerID, and the visible column a text column such as CustomerName, then the parameter must be applied
 to the CustomerID column in the query, not the CustomerName column.<br />

            <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what I have done. Basically I have a table with two columns which are short text. I have created a form with a combo box that uses one of the columns in the table to populate the dropdown list. I have added a command button to run a query. That query
 I have added a criteria of <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
[forms]![form name]![combo box] in the same column I pull the drop down from. With the form open and an entry selected in the drop down menu, clicking the command button yields no results. It is an empty datasheet. The same thing happens if I select an item
 in the dropdown menu and run the query manually. It's like it is pulling null instead of what I select. I have also tried using the criteria Like "*" &amp;&nbsp;</span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">[forms]![form name]![combo box]
 &amp; "*" which yields some results but it is not what I am selecting in the drop down list and the results make no sense. If I use a parameter [text] and type in the information it works. If I try running the query with the form closed I get a&nbsp;prompt&nbsp;and if I
 type in what I am looking for it works. I am confused on why the data I select&nbsp;from the dropdown in the form is not being pulled to the query. Everything I have read about this indicates I am doing everything right and it should be working. Any suggested on
 where to go from here would be greatly appreciated.</span></span></p>

            <p><span>My guess is that the combo box's BoundColumn property is not the column which equates with that to which you have applied
 a parameter in the query.<span>&nbsp; </span>The most likely explanation is that the BoundColumn is a hidden surrogate key.
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is quite normal, and is essential where the visible text column is not a candidate key of the table in question.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What are the following properties of the combo box:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>RowSource</span></p>
<p><span>BoundColumn</span></p>
<p><span>ColumnCount</span></p>
<p><span>ColumnWidths</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the RowSource property is the name of a query, what is the query's SQL statement?</span></p>

<h2>            Messaging</h2>
                    I want to save nearly a year of daily Skype messaging with a past partner in which we shared and he shared some valuable information I may as reference in future. How do ensure that he does not delete his side of the conversation which is the part I need?
 Can I Save the conversation somewhere or protect it.&nbsp;

            Hi WarrenErickson.
<br />
<br />Settings are managed from both sides.
<br />
<br />You can delete your Chat history, the other person could delete this as well. You can not control this.
<br />
<br />If some data needs be saved you should do it manually via screenshot, copy paste option etc.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, the interface doesn't have any proper tools to do this 
<br />
