<h2>            I have been temporarily suspended for a year and a half for the worst reason&#58; Horrible customer service</h2>
                    <p>As the title says, I have been temporarily suspended for a year and a half. The reason being the people who are supposed to reinstate my account think its permanently banned, despite:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.)When I try and login, it says I'm temporarily suspended</p>
<p>2.) Multiple support agents ive contacted in live chats say its temporarily suspended due to a security scare</p>
<p>3.) My account is still visible to my friends</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite all of that, the team thats supposed to reinstate my account have sent me this copypaste email for nearly two YEARS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>

<p>For any subscriptions associated with the account, Microsoft will immediately cease charging the credit card on file for recurring charges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem with this is, all I did was send my boyfriend a bunch of pictures on Skype, and the automated system thought it was spam, despite him WANTING the photos. Theres also the fact that i still
 have Xbox Live Gold, I still have all my games, I still have my card info on my xbox. Theyre lying about what theyre doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I reply to their email they send me, they nearly immediately send me this email:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hi</span><span>&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We evaluated your appeal and verified your account was properly closed for a serious violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/default.aspx#3_codeOfConduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pursuant to our terms, we cannot reactivate your account, nor provide details as to why it was closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This represents Microsoft’s final communication regarding this account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are so many things wrong about this</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) My account isnt closed, because as I said, its still there.</p>
<p>2.) Yes, it CAN be reactivated. The fact it says "Your Account Has Been Temporarily Suspended" in massive letters show it can be</p>
<p>3.) Why cant I know what my alleged violation is? How can I appeal if I dont know what I did?&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.) It says this represents final communication regarding this account. Except it isnt. I got this email nearly a year ago. Ive communicated with Microsoft regarding my account over 15 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do? The only options I have left is keep trying or suing.</p>

            If you are not allowed to reactive your old account, all you can do is create a new one. Any violation you or someone else performed on the account essentially blacklisted it from being used again. If you do not agree with the actions taken all you can
 do is <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW5yzg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
file a notice of dispute</a>/<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/arbitration/demandskype.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">arbitration</a> or take other legal action to attempt to resolve whatever issues you need resolved. Even taking those
 actions, does not guarantee any account will be reactivated.

Support from UK said that even that they can refund money, but starting from that they ignore me.<br />

<h2>            Nokia cellphone battery explosion&#58; ISOLATED INCIDENT</h2>
                    Indian woman hurt by Nokia cellphone battery explosion<br />
<br />
`ISOLATED INCIDENT': The Finnish company will compensate 30-year-old Kishori Saha if it finds the charger and battery she used were the originals<br />
<br />
AFP, KOLKATA, INDIA<br />
Sunday, Sep 02, 2007, Page 11<br />
A pregnant woman suffered burns in eastern India after the battery of her Nokia mobile phone exploded minutes after she put the handset on charge, police said yesterday.<br />
<br />
The Finnish phone maker warned last month in front-page advertisements in leading Indian dailies that some of its batteries were overheating after around 100 such incidents were reported globally.<br />
<br />
The battery that exploded was, however from the firm's BL-D3 series, and not from BL-5C that Nokia recalled a month ago, police said.<br />
<br />
"The injuries were not serious. She was discharged from the hospital after first aid," police official Ananda Sarkar said in eastern Kolkata city.<br />
<br />
The battery -- purchased with the handset in 2004 -- blew up about 10 minutes after it was put on charge.<br />
<br />
"I became nervous for a few seconds when the handset blew up triggering a ball of fire. Then I ran out of the flat," 30-year-old Kishori Saha said.<br />
<br />
Nokia said the woman might be compensated.<br />
<br />
"It was an isolated incident. I guess the battery was obsolete," said Sanjoy Jaiswal, floor manager at a Nokia care center.<br />
<br />
"If we find that the handset, battery and charger are original, she would be compensated," Jaiswal said.<br />
<br />
The Bl-5C batteries were manufactured by Japan's Matsushita Battery Industrial Co.<br />
<br />
The product advisory issued by Nokia in August applied only to 46 million batteries manufactured by Matsushita between December 2005 and last November.

            I would still advise anyone to check if their batteries need to be replaced - not that it's going to blow up but for safety anyway.

<br />
The battery in my Nokia N70 was confirmed as safe more than a year ago, but last night I was woken in a pretty unique way. (By the way, Nokia states the battery doesn't explode, it only expands and pops out of the phone. BULL)<br />
This happened at 02h30 with the phone charging on a table next to my bed.<br />
I woke up to the sound of a bang followed by the high pitched whistling of gas escaping under extremely high pressure. Only once I switched on the light and found my phone in pieces on the floor, I realised the cause.<br />
Melted pieces of the external coating of the battery was stuck all over the wall, with the battery having burnt a hole through the carpet and whatever else until it reached the concrete. I am talking about extreme heat here, this hole was burnt in a matter
 of less than 10 seconds.<br />
Luckily the battery flew away from me towards the wall, otherwise I would definitely have had to make a trip to hospital.

<br />Chances are that you inserted inline with text. If so, you can also right-click on it and change the wrapping. I would select tight or top and bottom. Then you can click on it and drag it.
<br />
<br />You may not be able to easily select it if you put it behind text.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards

<p>I would suggest that you do NOT change the text wrapping from In-line-with text as changing it as suggested in the other responses and then moving the image is a very common cause of mismatched xml tag errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much better to just select the picture and use CTRL+x to cut it from the document and then move the selection to the location where you want the picture and press CTRL+v to paste it in that location.</p>

<h2>            Adding a Confirmation Message</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the VBS code below to append a daily file from a form control, how can I add a message confirming that&nbsp;the file named "Sterling" was appended to a table named &nbsp;"SterlingTBL" (and the number of&nbsp;records)&nbsp;--- OR --- a message confirming that NO data
 was appended?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note: I set the warnings to False to suppress the MS messages.&nbsp; I would prefer to build "friendlier" messages.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p><div><strong>Private Sub Text249_Click()</strong></div>

<div><strong>DoCmd.SetWarnings False</strong><br />
<strong>If MsgBox("Update Sterling data file?&nbsp; Click YES to continue or NO to exit.", vbYesNo, "Sterling Data") = vbYes Then</strong><br />
<strong>DoCmd.OpenQuery "Sterling_Append"</strong><br />
<strong>DoCmd.GoToControl ("START")</strong><br />
<strong>End If</strong></div>

<div><strong>End Sub</strong></div>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!&nbsp; Ken</p>

<p>Hello leon945,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is only I suggestion. I am from the US and I am not clear on dialing out from Mexico. Can you try 0115281 and add the rest of your phone number? Please let me know if this works for you or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p><span><font><font>To dial a cell/mobile phone in Mexico you must now dial as follows:</font></font></span><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span><span><font><font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><font>Dialing a land line will remain the same, 011-52-10 digit number.</font></span></p>

<p><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font>i tried 521 plus my 10 digit number.. and it didnt work</font></span></p>

<p><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span>I also found this:</span></p>
<p><span>Calling a Mexico cell phone is just a little trickier than calling a land line. Mexican cellular phones now operate on the Calling Party Pays (CPP) system; whoever initiates a call pays for it. When dialed within its local area,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">mobile phone</a> numbers use the designated prefix 044. e.g. If calling within area code 33, a Guadalajara mobile phone would be dialed as: 044-33-xxxx xxxx. If you are calling a cell phone
 in a Mexican area code different from your own, you need to include the prefix 045. e.g. For a call from Guadalajara to a Mexico City mobile phone, dial 045-55-xxxx-xxxx.<br />
International calls to Mexican cell phones are dialed like regular international calls. e.g. To call a Mexico City mobile phone from the U.S., dial 011-52-55-xxxx-xxxx.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm trying with several ways to make that Ovi Store send me the messages to download apps, but I have the same problem... my company is Telcel, BTW :-(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>+52181...cell phone number (8 digits)</p>
<p>+01152181... cell phone number (8 digits)</p>
<p>+0115281... cell phone number (8 digits)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those configs should appears like the only options, I try to find more Googling... but unsuccessfully...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe the problem is my carrier (Telcel) I think...</p>

<p>If someone else are following this posting and have more comments for this, please let us know...</p>

<p>I think the problem is not on the number or dial codes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the problem is within the nokia site, as there are so many nokia pages with lots of errors as their phones (at least mine :( mine is N97 and i hate it ). i have seen errors sharing photos, sharing videos, also on my nokia, and also this discussed
 in here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the best we can do is email or call their support number, i have email'm, :( but they don't answers that email, i haven't give'm a call yet but i will do it.</p>

            I believe that if you go into to default apps, you can click on "Groove" and a dropdown will appear with Windows Media Player being one of the choices.&nbsp; Select that and then open up Outlook and you should be set.

    <title>2720 fold - music download - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> southjersey---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            2720 fold - music download</h2>
                    
<p>When I bought the phone, listening to music wasn't my priority, but, what the heck? &nbsp;Seems a good idea and the facility is there. &nbsp;Or is it?</p>
<p>I've just spent about 45 minutes trawling through the Nokia site trying to work out how to download music to my phone.</p>
<p>I have an iMac G5 Power PC and I do not run Windows.</p>
<p>I think that says it all. &nbsp;From what I have finally been able to discover, it looks like Windows or nothing for the software that
<u>might</u>&nbsp;permit me to download, the Ovi Suite. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The music Learn How does mention another piece of software, but not for my phone.</p>
<p>Anybody know anything about downloading my iTunes files to my phone?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Today I went back to where I bought the phone and we decided that if I turn Blue-tooth on both on the phone and the PC magic would happen. &nbsp;Well my iMac sees the phone and offers me the address book as the only synch. &nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I move the music from iTunes to the phone using Blue-tooth, please?</p>

<h2>            Osetup.dll cannot be loaded</h2>
                    I've been having some problems with my Microsoft Office 2010 and decided to uninstall and reinstall it off the internet (using a license key).<br />
<br />
When the files are extracting I get the error message: <br />
<br />
A required C:\Users\Toini\AppData\Local\Temp\OWPC9A6.tmp\Updates\OSETUP.DLL cannot be loaded. This may indicate that the file is missing or damaged.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have gone throught several steps to try and fix the problem, including registry cleaning, system scan, Windows 7 system repair etc.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on how this can be resolved?<br />
<br />
Regards, Toini<br />

For any web page having some dynamic file inclusion in the header [like css], if there is some authentication 0r restriction, then the header file so far included in the header &lt;HEAD&gt; tag, the web page , when you trying to save as [File--&gt;Save As.]. the web

</p><p>Hi Baron, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But, the 10 Chart is an example one, I have multiple charts which it would be around 30+, it time consuming job if I'll copy one by one. It would be great if you give me some best solution .</p>

<h3> rumeetwadhwa  say:</h3>
<h2>            INTERNET EXPLORER 10 WON&#39;T UNINSTALL&#33;</h2>
                    I was using Internet Explorer 10 for a couple days and everything was fine. I saw that I had the 32 bit version and not the 64 bit so I uninstalled the 32 bit. I did this not realising the consequences.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Once I installed Internet Explorer, my laptop told me to restart so I did. However my laptop shut down during the screen where it says</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>'Configuring Updates 30% Do not turn off your computer.'</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I plugged in the battery and turned the laptop back on to see that Internet Explorer 10 had installed. But the problem is that the Internet Explorer 10 file exists but Internet Explorer does not exist as a program. Therefore Internet Explorer 10 is not
 in the start menu or in the installed updates section of Windows Update. Internet Explorer 10 has been successfully updated according to the Windows Update update history but when I go to the installed updates all I see is Windows Internet Explorer 9.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want to be able to uninstall IE 10 completely because right now I can't do it!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried uninstalling from Windows Update's, View Installed Updates and also have tried to uninstall using the 'Turn Windows features on or off.' Everytime I uncheck the Internet Explorer 10 option it says 'Error. Not all the features were successfully
 installed.'</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just want to be able to uninstall Internet Explorer 10 so I can reinstall it properly.</div>
                </div>

            Hi Graham!
<div><br />
<div>To resolve the situation, do a System Restore. Your computer automatically creates a restore point every few hours. By restoring your computer to a point a few hours or days earlier, all programs, updates and drivers after that point will be uninstalled
 but your personal data and files will be untouched. So in terms your computer will be near exactly the same before this all happened.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All you need to do is press the Start Button and search System Restore.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope that helped!</div>
<div><br />

<p>
</p><p>We've checked your account and saw that your subscription was already refunded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why you were not able to place a call is because your current subscription has not expired yet, but you have used up all the remaining minutes of it. Take note that subscriptions renew 3 days before the expiration of the
 current subscription but your minutes will recharge on the same date when you originally ordered it, which means you won't be able to use the&nbsp;newly purchased&nbsp;subscription yet until your current one expires.</p>

                    I am using Office for Mac 2011, PowerPoint version 14.4.8, on a OS X 10.8.5 MacBook Pro. I used to be able to go into View and turn on Dynamic and/or static guides. Now, even though they are checked, neither of them ever show up. What is going on? This
 is extremely annoying.<br />

            <p>Hi Heidi,</p>
<p>I can't replicate that problem on my system. You obviously know that the Dynamic guides only display when you drag one object close to another object. On my system they are rather hard to see, particularly if I'm dragging blue shapes. The guides are also
 blue so I have to look closely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Static guides should display, but again on my system they are pretty light in color so I'm wondering...</p>
<ol>
<li>Could it be a contrast problem with the theme you are using?</li><li>The brightness (or not) of your current screen setting?</li><li>Has PowerPoint suffered a temporary loss of memory and a simple full shutdown might restore the functionality.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>Ok, so I see now, the issue is that I'm not using the proper name. </p>
<p>Everything is working now, my Dynamic AND my Static guides. I was meaning the "static" guides (even though I personally think "static" is the wrong word, since I can move them around, but I get it.....)</p>

            The symbols look like the "top half integral" character at Unicode (hex) 2320.
<br />
<br />
I've never heard of Word putting anything like that into a document automatically. Do I understand correctly that this text has never been outside a Word document before the symbols show up?<br />

            Exactly. I can open up a new Word document, type in some text, copy and paste it as Unformatted Text, and those weird characters appear. It's really strange.

            Yes, it is really strange, and I don't have an explanation.<br />
<br />
Here's a troubleshooting technique that may help to eliminate some possibilities. Hold down the Ctrl key while you start Word, and say yes to the prompt, to get it running in safe mode. That causes Word to run without loading Normal.dotm, any add-ins, or any
 non-default registry entries.<br />
<br />
Now try your copy/paste cycle. Do the characters still appear?<br />
<br />
If not, then suspicion falls first on add-ins. If there are any templates in the folder %appdata%\Microsoft\Word\Startup, move them to some other folder and restart Word. If the characters haven't returned, you can move the templates back one at a time, restarting
 Word and retesting after each one.<br />
<br />
If it isn't an add-in, then it could be something odd in Normal.dotm. Try renaming that file, restarting Word, and retesting.<br />

<div>Thanks for your reply.</div>
<div>I've read the thread you suggested and found that is not the issue I met.</div>
<div>WORD2010/EXCEL2010 always warn a "Document Recovery" in the left pane when opening them after an abnormal crash.</div>
<div>I tried to disable it but all my attempts failed.</div>
<div>Is it possible to disable?</div>

Is it in Quarantine or History or both?

<div>In History just ignore it. &nbsp;History is exactly that - a history (a list) of previously detected items. &nbsp;MSE may have already handled it.</div>

<p>I Have a Problem With My Reader Rabbit's Get Reading for Reading. I Have installed it On My Windows 98 Virtual Machine. But It Wouldn't Run On Windows 7 64 bit. It Says it's not Compatible for 64 bit version of Windows. How Can I Sort This Problem Out When
 the Game Crashes. I Played it and Then It Froze on me. And When I Came Back to Play It Worked Again. And When I Was Playing for a While. It Refused to Work Again! It Was Working and Not Working for&nbsp;a Couple of Times. i can no longer play the game if it froze.
 So Can You All Sort The Problem Out If You Can That Would Be Great!</p>

    <title>Pivot table question&#58; showing multiple choice responses the right - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pivot table question&#58; showing multiple choice responses the right way in a pivot table.</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have a large dataset with survey responses. Among them are multiple choice responses. I need to display them in graphs with
 a pivot table (and slicers). Currently I have <strong>this</strong>:<br />
<br />
</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fovBwSXe.png" /></p>
<p>However, what I need is to display it as
<strong>this</strong>:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fwuPkKdp.png" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>This last image is modified so it shows what I want.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, I need the fruits to be seen as categories, so that I can show the values as 'percentage of grand total' in my table and chart.<br />
<br />
Is there any way I can do this with a pivot, with the data I have as shown in the first image?<br />

            Images are not visible in your post. A quick and effective solution can be provided if we can have a look at your workbook. Could you please prepare and upload a sample / dummy workbook sans confidential data to Onedrive / Googledrive / Box / Dropbox or any other file host and share the link? It will help us to give prompt and high quality solution.
<br />
<br />Another way to share the file with me is to go to my website, pick up my mail address and mail me (Ask a Question / About Me &amp; Contacts).

    <title>can&#39;t save file &#34;invalid formula&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angela_g  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t save file &#34;invalid formula&#34;</h2>
                    Excel 2007 running on windows 7.<br />
I have a spreadsheet with NO Formulas that I've been using a long time but when I tried to save it tonite after adding some data (just text and numerical data, no formulas, there are no formulas in the sheet) I get this msg<br />
"a formula in the worksheet contains one or more invalid references <br />
verify that your formulas contain a valid path, work book, cell name, and reference"
<br />
It does NOT identify where this supposed problem formula is. I've tried saving to other paths and file names and no luck. Why am I getting this msg when there are no formulas??? And what do I need to do to save my file? I even tried deleting the content I added
 tonite but no luck. <br />
<br />
Since it doesn't point out where the supposed problem is and since it says there's a formula problem in a sheet with no formulas, this has got to be one of the most absurd error messages I've run into, nearly 30 years of using computers.
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. <br />

            10 hours later, I try saving the worksheet, both the version with old name and version with new, and both works. I don't know if the problem saving was something going on in my&nbsp; pc, like the path (tho I was saving other files to the same folder) or what,
 but problem has gone away. Thanks!<br />
