<p>Hi Larry Muck,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the account type of your new email account? Exchange (Office 365 for Business or Outlook.com), IMAP or POP ( accounts from third party providers)? As I said before, if this is a different account from the Office 365 for Business account you want
 to sync, you need to add both your accounts in Outlook and drag the contacts to make copies.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, to better help you, could you please capture some screenshots of 1) how it shows in your Outlook for Mac and 2)how the contacts show in the web version of your Office 365 account. To protect your privacy, I will send you a
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
PM (Private Message)</a> to collect these screenshots. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<p>I just found the answer for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the calendar, if you hold control and left click on the meeting or appointment you can drag it to a date or location, and the original will remain in its previously scheduled place</p>

<h2>            Zoning in Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi, the company in which i work for is moving stores and i have to completely zone our current store before we move so we can keep product together, then i need a way to easily change key figures in those zones to other key figures to make the new zones
 flow smoothly as the layout isn't the same</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example of a Zone right now is; " CE1A " and i will need to change it to " GC1A"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know i could do a filter and manually change the letters after doing text to columns to individualize each part, but then ill have merge them all back and that will take a painstaking long time as i have over 4000 part numbers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated,</p>

    <title>Emails changing from Bold &#40;Un-read&#41; to Pain Text &#40;Marked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ray2-1248  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails changing from Bold &#40;Un-read&#41; to Pain Text &#40;Marked as Read&#41; BEFORE I view them</h2>
                    <p><strong><span>I'm using Windows Office 365 with Outlook 2016 in Windows 10.&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Now
 that the initial panic of my Outlook 2016 problem has settled down a bit</span><span>, I'll try to explain this issue the best way that I can.&nbsp; I’ve been noticing that new emails come
 into Outlook and only remain <strong>Blue &amp; Bold</strong> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
until</span> the next time the program goes out and gets another batch of emails. (maybe 3 or 4 minutes later).</span></p>
<p><span>Then the new email comes in as Blue &amp; Bold and the other emails,
<strong>that are still unread,</strong> turn to Black &amp; Plain text before I even read them.&nbsp; So it doesn’t seem like
<strong>reading the email even matters</strong>.&nbsp; Only the fact that another batch of
<strong>newer emails</strong> has taken over the "spotlight".&nbsp; That’s what seems to be causing the older emails to go into “plain text” mode.&nbsp; This makes it very hard to keep up with what's new and what's already been read.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when I turn on my computer each morning</span>, all of the emails come in as plain text since the Outlook server has been pulling in emails all night, putting the newer batches in the spotlight each time it searches.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It seems to have started around the time of the October 2018 Windows update.&nbsp; I'm only on build version 1803.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any Suggestions for a fix?</span></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Sutharsan,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I'm pretty new to this forum.&nbsp; I'm not sure how to "edit the thread" to move my question in the Office&gt;Outlook section.</span></p>
<p>I've answered your questions below in<strong> Bold.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. What is the&nbsp;</span><span>account type</span><span>&nbsp;did you set up as? (IMAP, POP3, Exchange)&nbsp;
<strong>Set up as</strong><strong>&nbsp;an IMAP account.</strong></span><br />
<span>2. Do you have that affected email account set up on any other email clients/devices?
<strong>Y</strong><strong>es,&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><span>I also have Windows Live Mail on the same computer with this account (it's working fine)&nbsp; And&nbsp;</span></strong><span><strong>it's on
 my cell phone (works fine).&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. Does it happen with e-mails from&nbsp;</span><span>other accounts</span><span>?
<strong>No other accounts using the Outlook client.&nbsp; I have a Gmail account, (but not on Outlook) it works fine.</strong></span><br />
<span>4. Does it happen with&nbsp;</span><span>other Outlook profiles</span><span>?
<strong>I only have one profile set up.</strong></span><br />
<span>5. What are the troubleshooting steps have you done thus far?&nbsp;
<strong>I've only verified that all of my settings are correct.&nbsp; I have not changed any settings.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>I already had my Reading Pane set to view for 60 seconds before turning to Mark as Read.</strong></span></p>

            Hello Ray2-1248, <br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply. The information you have provided is very helpful towards finding a resolve for this issue.
<br />
<br />
So does starting Microsoft Outlook in <strong>safe mode</strong> rectify this issue?
<br />
<br />
Since you have also setup your email account on other email clients and devices, we need to narrow down the cause of this issue. It could be the doing of those email clients/devices, not Microsoft Outlook. Please bear with me while we will try to troubleshoot
 this issue together. <br />
<br />
Just to confirm, those e-mails marked as read in Microsoft Outlook are also <strong>
marked as read on the server too right?</strong> (as in, it is marked as read in web version, Windows Live Mail and cellphone too)
<br />
<br />
Please try to <strong>add your Gmail account to Microsoft Outlook</strong> and see if the issue persists. If it does not, please
<strong>remove and re-add your affected email account</strong>. <br />
<br />

https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-an...</a> <br />
<br />
Otherwise, try to create a <strong>new Outlook profile</strong> and work in that profile, see if it is an issue with corrupted Outlook profile.
<br />
<br />

<h3> gayle clark  say:</h3>
<h2>            inserting color emoticons in outlook</h2>
                    <p>Just two days ago, my husband and I, who share this computer that has outlook installed, were able to select color emoticons from a choice of over 60.</p>
<p>We sent emails to our children using them.&nbsp; Now we can not seem to be able to find the colored animated emoticons&nbsp;any more.&nbsp; What sequence of commands do I need to enter at this point?&nbsp; Do I still have the ability?&nbsp; On searches conducted yesterday, there
 were some disturbing "answers" that mentioned etiquette in regards to the use of these colored animated emoticons.&nbsp; Would the act of putting four or five color animated emoticons on an email constitute a breach of etiquette?&nbsp; I did not feel that it was at
 the time.&nbsp; Please enlighten us.&nbsp; We still have access to static black and white emoticons.</p>

            <p>The difficulty seems to have been resolved in steps.&nbsp; Difficulties described by other users regarding their impaired access to "People" seems to be interrelated to inserting/selecting color emoticons.&nbsp; When I compose an email by selecting from my People
 menu first (if I can access People), I have complete selectivity.&nbsp; I did&nbsp;have limited (black-and-white)&nbsp;selectivity using the New command to compose emails, but the complete selectivity has been restored (magically?) the last time we tried!</p>
<p>I still seemed to have to open a saved email that has a box "Contact List" to click on.&nbsp; I trust there will be a simpler more direct way to select the People menu soon, in light of all the other users' reports!</p>
<p>Thank you for answering and being patient!</p>

    <title>Can no longer access my shared calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerry_d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can no longer access my shared calendar</h2>
                    <p>I have been sharing my work calendar for a long time, accessed it from multiple computers and email account&nbsp;and it worked with no problems. As of recently, the calendar was no longer visible in my home Outlook (Win 8.1 and Office 2013). I then repeated the
 sharing process by un-sharing and re-sharing at work, and sending the invitation from work Outlook (Windows 7 and Outlook 2010 on Exchange Server)&nbsp;to my home email address which I also use to log into my home computer (Win 8.1 and Office 2013) and to live.com
 and to outlook.com. Same home address is on SkyDrive at both work and home.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I click on the Subscribe button in the email, the Contacting Web Server dialog appears for a while then goes away and nothing happens. If I try to add the calendar explicitly using File/Account Settings/Internet Calendars/New..and pasting the webcals
 URL, &nbsp;I get the error message: "Cannot verify or add the Internet Calendar in Outlook. Verify the link is a valid calendar lnk.". I tried replacing webcals:// with http:// - same result.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Trying to connect to the shared calendar in Google Mail also produces an error. Error text: "Could not fetch the url."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Finally I typed the URL replacing webcals:// with http:// into Internet Explorer's address bar and got a white page stating "Page moved here." where the word "here" is a link pointing to the very same page.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried logging into my Outlook.com account (same home email address mentioned above). Got an error message: "This account can't be used to access Outlook.com. You are currently signed with an Office365 account..."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please help! What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

            Thank you. Will do so. However, there's more than Exchange server involved, I think. In fact, the&nbsp;publishing part (the only part involving Exchange) works fine. It is the subscribing from a non-Exchange client that fails. Also,&nbsp;I am no longer able to log
 in to my Outlook.com account and again, that is not Exchange.&nbsp;

            Please try one by one. (First try step 2)
<br />
<br />1. Start with repairing  your installation (Quick repair is good enough)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Please check if File &gt; Options &gt; General, both Enable Services under Office Intelligent Services and Automatically show me design ideas under Powerpoint Designer are checked.
<br />
<br />3. Please check out following troubleshooting steps and let us know the feedback 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Troubleshoot-PowerPoint-Designer-83789fcb-f1ae-4703-b1b4-9c97259f592b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Troubl...</a>
<br />
<br />4. Try logging into the Windows with a new profile
<br />
<br />5. Right click on Powerpoint icon and Run As Administrator
<br />
<br />6. Clear all IE cache / cookies / Temp Internet Folder etc..
<br />
<br />7. Disable Anti-virus temporarily.
<br />
<br />8. There is a possibility that some Add-in is causing the problem. To rule this out, start Powerpoint in safe mode. Hold CTRL key and click on Powerpoint icon. Don't leave CTRL key, till it asks for the confirmation about safe mode. 
<br />
<br />9. You can also try registry change
<br />

<br />
<br />9. if nothing works, then I am suspecting this is caused by a recent update to MS Office. You should revert to previous build

<p>Hi, I just started to have the issue.&nbsp; Everything was working fine in my laptop and suddenly the designer was not there.&nbsp; I tried all the suggestions in this thread but nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also notice the following versions:&nbsp; (Are they Ok?)</p>
<ol>
<li>If I go (PowerPoint &gt; File &gt; Account) in the (About PowerPoint) section the version listed is version 1712 (Build 8827.2148) Monthly Channel</li><li>If go (Windowx+X &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Microsoft Office 365 Business - en - us) it says 16.0.8827.2148</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Desktop computer with the same versioning and it is working just fine.&nbsp; The difference is that the desktop PC has installed the 32-bits version and my laptop (where the problem is happening) is running the 64-bits version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the support</p>

<h2>            Password for microsoft account fails and fails and fails</h2>
                    <p>I am able to sign into my account daily (no issues) but when I try to manage the account that I am already signed into I get a confirmation number.&nbsp; I enter the number then the automated system asks me to verify (because they are over protective) with an
 old email account I have not used in over 15 years.&nbsp; My current business account (trying to modify) cannot be managed as the personal account for over 15 years does not show as an option.&nbsp; Cannot verify account soooooo I follow the lost account string to a
 point.&nbsp; I refuse to go any further because if all these changes that the MS account states cannot use that password you have used in the past (wait a minute, that password is the one the log in software says is incorrect).&nbsp; So the tech creates a new account
 that I did not want and did nothing to help me manage the current one that I need to have and synch with my android tablets and phones.</p>

    <title>internet explorer and split tunel vpn - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teddcadd  say:</h3>
<h2>            internet explorer and split tunel vpn</h2>
                    We're using a Cisco split tunnel VPN to connect to the servers necessary to do our work. On one of our new computers, the Cisco VPN will allow Firefox to connect while the VPN connection is running but IE8 will not work. We get an error page saying that
 IE cannot display that page.<br />
<br />
When I close the VPN connection, IE is able to connect. But that means that I have to exit the software on the server, close the connection, do the work in IE8, reconnect the VPN and restart the server software.<br />
<br />
With the split tunnel VPN, the idea is that communication should be able to continue on one of the tunnels while the VPN locks out all traffic on the other. Firefox is able to handle that but not IE.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We were just starting to use Staff hub for our team.&nbsp; Will all the schedule configuration and requests for time off be transferred to Shifts automatically when it will be removed or we will have to re-configure everything ?&nbsp; If we lose everything in the
 process, we won't continue using for now.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Josée Poulin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your clarification. Microsoft Teams will offer all of the functionality currently offered in Microsoft StaffHub. In the link you provided, it is possible to transfer your data from Staffhub to Teams in the future. Currently, we're still building
 StaffHub capabilities, including schedule and task management, into Microsoft Teams.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly let us know if you need further assistance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>

<h3> cosmo1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 Local Security Groups</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two questions for you to answer for my Win10 Beta version 9926.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) How can I access the standard Windows <strong>Security Group console</strong>? I can access
<em>'Users accounts'</em> from the '<em>Settings'</em> System Tray icon, but it contains no
<strong>'Groups</strong>' option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) How can I load <strong>MMC.msc</strong>, as it doesn't load from the <em>'Search'
</em>box, but does from the <em>'System32' </em>folder, but most of the Add-ons can't be loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Cosmo1</p>

            Group Policy Editor and Local Security Policy is available only in the Pro and Enterprise editions of Windows.&nbsp; Your screen shot indicates you do NOT have the Pro version.&nbsp; Since I have the Pro version through no effort or selection of mine, I assumed
 everyone did who had Build 10049. Someone at MS will have to explain why most people with Win 10 Build 10049 seem to have the Pro version but some do not.

            <p>Thanks for that, now I know the reason.... which could be due to it being a x86 (32bit) version, as my home PC is a few years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Hello MS:</span> Are you able to confirm for me (us) that the Win10 x64bit version is the 'Pro' and the x32bit version is the home version? If not, why can't I see these above mentioned Admin Utilities?</p>
<p>

    <title>Excel 2003 footers causing problems in Excel 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cwskopec  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2003 footers causing problems in Excel 2007</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>We've recently upgraded a number of people in the office to Vista PCs with Excel 2007 and a couple are having trouble using existing Excel documents with footers in their new version of Excel.</p>
<p>The files are saved as Excel 97-2003 Worksheets with a footer that includes text in one cell and an image of a signature in another. When opened in 2007 this footer in not editable. Clicking on Insert&gt;Header &amp; Footer allows me to add a header (the file didn't
 have one originally), but Navigation button for Go To Footer is grayed out and unclickable.</p>
<p>I uploaded the file to Google Documents and downloaded it as an Open Document Spreadsheet and was then able to change the footer as needed however for 200+ documents this would be a tremendous strain on deadlines because a number of text formatting issues
 popped up in the conversions.</p>
<p>Has anyone else seen this problem and/or developed a suitable solution for it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Is the German grammar check is completely useless&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s.robert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is the German grammar check is completely useless&#63;</h2>
                    The German grammar check is not working at all. The only error it finds is a space behind a comma. The grammar check in the Windows-Version works much better. What is the reason for that? When will this bug be fixed?

            I can't speak directly on the caliber of the German Grammar checking, but in general... Have you looked to make sure that the Language formatting of the text actually is German? Select the text in question then go to
<br />
Also - once you've confirmed that the text is formatted as German - go to Word&gt; Preferences - Spelling &amp; Grammar to see which Writing Style is being used. You can also click the Settings button to adjust from there.<br />
<br />
I'm not certain, but my understanding is that the main difference is that PC Word provides a wider variety of proofing tools for more languages than what is included with Mac Word. AFAIK, though, the tools provided for any specific language are pretty much
 the same, PC or Mac.<br />

    <title>Multiple seperate and distinct email accounts in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple seperate and distinct email accounts in Outlook &#40;Mac&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many years ago I used to log into Outlook for Windows with multiple email accounts, and each could be used in isolation from the other.&nbsp; As I logged into Outlook I would be prompted to select one of my account profiles, and once into Outlook all I would
 see would be the emails and contacts for that account.&nbsp; Switching was an easy matter of logging out and logging in again, selecting a different profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook for Mac does not seem to offer any such capabilities as all emails seem to be stored in the same location without the concept of the individual .pst file (or equivalent) to enable seperation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to be able to use Outlook to manage emails for two distinct businesses, viewing them seperately&nbsp;and&nbsp;without any crossover between the two, or any risk of confusion as to who sent what to who.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anybody think of any creative way in which Outlook for Mac could be configured to enable this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or can the browser pane on the left be configured to show complete separation between the two accounts (i.e two sets of inbox, sent, contacts, etc)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dave.</p>

            Glad this worked for you. What you're seeing is Outlook specific and it's only for the current Mac OS X user account.
<div><br />
<div>The similar option, which Microsoft recommends using instead of identities, is to use Apple's
<b>Users &amp; Groups</b> System Preferences (Mountain Lion) or <b>Accounts</b> (Lion and earlier) to create multiple Mac OS X accounts.</div>

<h2>            Windows Defender keep asking to send Chrome SecurePreferences file.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting today I keep getting message that Windows Defender wants to send Chrome SecurePreferences file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There 2 problems here:</p>
<p>1. Windows Defender is keep asking, even though I already click Don't Send several times. Why?</p>
<p>2. The file is SecurePreferences. Why do you want it? Do you want to have my login info or something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you do not understand point #1, that means when Windows started, Windows Defender prompts me to send the file, I clicked Don't Send. Then in several minutes, Windows Defender prompts me again to send the file.&nbsp; Then I clicked Don't Send. Then after
 working for several minutes, Windows Defender prompts me again to send the file. Then I clicked Don't Send.&nbsp;Then after working for several minutes, Windows Defender prompts me again to send the file. Then I clicked Don't Send.&nbsp;Then after working for several
 minutes, Windows Defender prompts me again to send the file. Then I clicked Don't Send.&nbsp;Then after working for several minutes, Windows Defender prompts me again to send the file. Then I clicked Don't Send.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then after working for several minutes, Windows
 Defender prompts me again to send the file. Then I clicked Don't Send.&nbsp;Get it now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that this issue was discussed back in 2018 with no answer and the discussion was closed abruptly.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows Defender is designed to detect and remove the malicious stuff on the PC. It delivers comprehensive, ongoing and real time protection against threats like viruses, malware and spyware across email, apps, the cloud and the web.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows Defender has cloud-delivered protection that provides faster and richer protection functionality with its access to the Windows Defender Antivirus protection data in the cloud.</span></p>

            <p>Flat panel monitors have a specific number of pixels, so you only get a non-blurry display at exactly one and only one resolution.&nbsp; So tweaking it is not necessary, even for serious tweakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to customize it, use DPI settings.</p>

            Unfortunately, there is no such switch. You cannot make a reference to a paragraph number include the trailing punctuation.<br />
<br />
After you insert the REF field with the \n or \r (or \w), click in the text (the Cross-Reference dialog box will remain open), manually type a period and a space, and then insert the REF field for the paragraph text.<br />
