            Yes, I did go back and enabled Active Scripting again.&nbsp; I don't want the original/classic yahoo mail.&nbsp; I want to get back to att.net new mail, which is what I had before I screwed this up!!&nbsp; I've been working with AT&amp;T but they show my account has the
 new att.net mail.&nbsp; Think it is something in my computer. Can access att.net on any other computer when I sign into my account, just not my computer.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp;&nbsp; All help will be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.

<h2>            Specific Microsoft word attachment not appearing in recipient mailbox</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a client who is unable to send a specific word document as an attachment. So when the email is sent to any recipient the email is received however that attachment is not appearing in the inbox. I have tried a message trace from ECP and it appears
 as delivered, doesn't have anything in spam diagnostics either. I have also scanned the file with ESET antivirus however nothing suspicious has been detected. It doesn't have any special characters in the name and there are no links in the file either. Please
 can you advise on this specific issue?</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. There are several factors why your client is having issues receiving the Word attachment. We will list the factors below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Not enough storage space - If the email box is full of other email messages and your storage space is limited to only a few megabytes, it's possible that the attachment being sent cannot be received. Email programs and email service providers will automatically
 reject incoming e-mails if there is not enough space available to store the e-mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Attachment is too big - Not all email providers allow their users to send and receive emails with large attachments. If the file attachment is too big (over 25 MB), it is possible that either the file has been stripped from the email by the ISP or that
 the version of Outlook you are using does not support the size of attachment being sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Antivirus protection blocking the attachment - If you have an antivirus protection program installed on your computer and are having problems opening or viewing attachments make sure it is not causing the problem by temporarily disabling your antivirus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Disable any add-ins installed - It is possible that the add-ins can cause problems with attachments. Disable all add-Ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Attachment contains a virus - Make sure to scan the attachment you're attempting to receive or send for viruses. If the file is infected with a virus, trojan, or other malware, many e-mail servers will automatically reject it to prevent their users from
 becoming infected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Email provider does not allow attachments - Some companies and email providers will not allow email with file attachments to be sent or received by their users as a security precaution. Today, most email providers allow attachments in emails, but you
 may want to verify with your email provider that attachments are allowed with their email service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. If your client is accessing his email via Outlook.com, you can ask him to clear the cache and cookies of his browser. After that, he can try to access his email using a different web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done reviewing the list, please check if your client will be able to receive the attachments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if there will be any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>how to fix. . .Windows&#47;networking crashes during streaming Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paminoz  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to fix. . .Windows&#47;networking crashes during streaming Skype or some YouTube</h2>
                    How to fix this? I finally realized this problem is not only during Skype sessions w/ my family. Rather it can also happen if I have a webpage open&nbsp;with embedded YouTube videos.<br />
<br />
Sequence of events<br />
- Skype or video stops working<br />
- wifi network SAYS it is not available; however, the wifi never goes down during these episodes because a separate computer plays the radio via the internet. thus, I can always "hear" when the wifi is down.<br />
- when I attempt to Diagnose and Repair, it says it can't find the network (yet the internet radio is still playing)<br />
- when I attempt to disconnect and re-connect, the Vista shows me the "waiting" circle and hangs<br />
- then everything Windows says "(not responding)"<br />
<br />
I bought the system in Dec 2007. I noticed the issue when I started Skyping regularly starting June 2008 when I moved to Australia from the US.<br />
<br />
Please help. Thanks.

<br />
Solution--I've switched to Firefox and stopped using IE.<br />
<br />
Problem--Stackoverflow error: 873 recurrent on NYTimes site with IE which ends up crashing Windows and/or Skype. Firefox doesn't have this error w/ NYTimes. Thus, my apps aren't crashing anymore. :)<br />

<h2>            No account associated for verification</h2>
                    I have been using my Office 365 university edition for the past 3 years. Today all of a sudden my Macbook decided to crash for reasons unknown. Upon reboot of my computer MS WORD or any of the MS office products was asking me to verify my account. I tried
 using my product key to no avail. I used the only 3 email accounts I have and none of them worked. I even chatted with a Microsoft support tech. I gave him the only 3 email accounts I ever use. He said NONE of those accounts are associated with any microsoft
 product. So by some miraculous power my microsoft account has been deleted. How else would I have been able to use MS word to type up my homework if I did not have an account. I am extremely frustrated because apparently there is no evidence of me signing
 up for a microsoft account with any of my emails. This does not make sense because you can't active it without creating an account so how have I been able to use it for the past 3 years? I still have the verification email I recei

            The address the email was sent to should be the valid one. Is it one of the 3 you remember? Are you still attending the same university? I've read of school accounts lapsing after graduation and the software then stops working. If this is the case, you
 will probably have to uninstall and then reinstall with your own account.

            Yes, it was the first email I gave to tech support and they said it is not associated with any microsoft product. Yes I still an attending the same university. The university edition is good for 4 years which means I still have 1 year left of subscription.
 I have not graduated yet.

            <p>If you have Office 365, you've been renting it for a monthly fee. If you had bought Office 2011 outright, you would have a 25-character product key to activate it and it never expires. So MS isn't gouging you, you just need to keep on paying monthly to go
 on using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try signing in to your Microsoft account here:&nbsp;<a href="https://login.live.com/login.srf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign In</a>&nbsp;Use the address you originally used to sign up. I imagine you'll have to add a payment method, that's probably
 why it stopped working. If you can reactivate your account, your software may start working again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If can't reactivate, you may have to create a new account. In that case you'll likely have to completely uninstall, then reinstall the software. Let us know if you need the steps to do that.</p>

</p><p>Ringtones and sounds can help you decide when to pay attention to your Windows Phone and when to ignore it. Assign unique ringtones to the people who matter most to you. Use different sounds for different kinds of alerts, such as alarms, new text or instant
 messages, voicemails, emails, reminders, and other notifications. </p>

            <p>The sound will go away if you turn the ringer + notification sound level down below level 1 of 10 using the button on the RH side.&nbsp; The sceen will indicate "vibrate" if you are using that setting.</p>

            <p>Hi Sebastian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please save&nbsp;all "System" event logs (Event Viewer -&gt; Windows Logs -&gt; System), and share the file in the original evtx format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, do you by any chance&nbsp;have "Hyper-V" feature installed on your VM running 9860? If yes, it is a known issue. You can work around by temporarily uninstalling the "Hyper-V" feature before upgrading.</p>
<p>

<p>As much time as we could spend troubleshooting, you could actually re-install the OS from scratch faster! I know, it sounds like blasphemy but it's true. And it will work right. The issues begin with 3rd party application architectures. They simply haven't
 had enough time to make up for everything.</p>
<p>And honestly, if you can just be patient with the graphics during install, it's actually kind of fun. Which is likely why you are beta testing =)</p>

<p>Having said that, 9879 is not out to the slow ring yet so I couldn't install a fresh copy of it even if I wanted :)</p>

    <title>Unknow process running in task manager. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unknow process running in task manager.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have windows 10 and I don't not believe this is a problem with windows 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>but I still need some help. Recently, whenever I start up some apps or programs</p>
<p>I get minimized out of them and I check my task manager to make sure there are</p>
<p>no malware in the backround so I check the section with the backround processes</p>
<p>and there is a process running called Rochen 32 Bit, This was not there before hand.</p>
<p>My question simplified what the **** is this? (Sorry for usage of bad language)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the minimization linked to something else?</p>
<p>Is Rochen okay?</p>
<p>Is my pc at risk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also one time when rochen opened it started a strange installation that I could not exit</p>
<p>so I had use task manager to end the installation I have tried various malware/virus</p>
<p>removal tools e.g Windows Defender, Microsoft security scan but they have not seemed&nbsp;</p>
<p>to remove Rochen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are facing the issue on unknown process in task manager.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to see any program related Rochen in programs and features?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run Disk Cleanup<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run a disk cleanup follow the steps provided in the link below:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk cleanup in Windows 10 <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-my/windows-10/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-my/windows-10/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Check disk<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press Windows key + X and click on Command Prompt (Admin) to open the Elevated Command Prompt. (If prompted for a password, type the password and click Allow)<br />
2. Type the following command: <br />
•&nbsp;chkdsk /r and click Enter.<br />
•&nbsp;chkdsk&nbsp; /f and click Enter.<br />
3. If you see this message:&nbsp; <br />
Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N). Then press 'Y' and click Enter.<br />
4. Restart your system and let the check disk run. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Try to perform clean boot:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

<h2>            How to subscribe all members to office 365 group after creating the group&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I have created a group for my school team, but while creating I forgot to tick the option that says "subscribe new members so they receive group conversations in their inbox". Now I want to do this so that whenever I send a group mail, the mail actually shows
 up in everyone's inbox. How do I do that? I know I can subscribe myself to that particular group, but how do I make sure that all the members that are "presently" there also get subscribed directly. Is there a way or do I have to recreate the group from scratch?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
P.S. I am the owner of the group, so there should be a way for me to do that.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Thanks</p>

            <p><span>Hi RohitKrishna,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you forgot to select the setting “subscribe new members so they receive group conversations in their inbox” when creating the group, it is not feasible to subscribe all the current members to
 receive the group conversation in their inbox. </span></p>
<p><span>As a workaround, I suggest you remove all the members from the group, then select the setting “subscribe…”, add the members back at last.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the detailed steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Remove members from the group.</span></p>
<p><span>Go to<strong> Outlook Web App</strong> (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa</a>) with your Office 365 account, select the group and click<strong> …</strong>
 on the upper right corner of the page, select <strong>Members </strong>and click<strong> …
</strong>near the user to <strong>Remove from group</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Select the setting “subscribe new members…”.</span></p>
<p><span>In <strong>Outlook Web App</strong>, click
<strong>…</strong> like step one and select <strong>Edit group</strong>, then tick “subscribe new members…”, click
<strong>Save</strong> at last.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Add members back.</span></p>
<p><span>Click <strong>…</strong> like step one and select
<strong>Members</strong>, then click <strong>Add members</strong> icon.</span></p>
<p><span>Please let me know if you need further assistance.</span></p>

</p><p>Hello Sir or Madame,</p>
<p>I received a little laptop with a Windows&nbsp;I had not chosen and that I do not&nbsp;want to use,&nbsp;a so I decided to&nbsp;try this actual preview before a final solution, but&nbsp;I can use no app and send no feedback via the related app because of my resolution 1024x600.
 It will not be revised to a lower level of compatibility, or where to send comments alternatively? And what is also essential, how could I definitively uninstall and delete that previous version of Windows which has been located entirely into "Windows.old"
 directory, please? I will buy this Windows, if I will have liked it finally, or I will delete it.&nbsp;For that, how to&nbsp;remove also all the 2 versions of Windows from the computer, please? Thank you very much.</p>

    <title>Excel IFS Formula for Data Tables in 2 Worksheets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randallslaughter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel IFS Formula for Data Tables in 2 Worksheets</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue trying to put together an IFS formula to pull data from my "Breakdown" sheet over to my "Data Summary Analysis" sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I created a simple formula, but I'm trying to extrapolate it to cover the entire "I" column on Data Summary Analysis, compare it against the entire "4" row on Breakdown, and pull the value from associated "117" row on Breakdown if the values of
 I column match H row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IFS(I27=Breakdown!G4,Breakdown!G117)*J27</p>
<p>
</p><p>That formula works for one cell at a time, but obviously dragging it will confuse excel and move down along the H and G columns instead of across the rows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also can not figure out how to have that equation apply to a range instead of just a specific cell. The data range on Breakdown sheet is a unique filter from the Data Summary Analysis, transposed to row 4 instead of through columns, so the value ranges
 are not equal?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise on how I can get =IFS ([Data Range Col. I] =Breakdown![Data Range Row 4],Breakdown![Data range row 117])&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can build the breakdown sheet to pull from column lines instead of rows if that makes it easier. Please help, thank you!</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Move Emails From Inbox To Sub-Folders</h2>
                    <p>Since Sunday, l can't move any e-mails from my inbox to any sub-folders except the deleted folder. When l swipe a message and touch the move icon, the move 1 message box and screen freezes! This also occurs when l click on the three dots at the top of the
 e-mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only happens on my tablet. I use Chrome as my browser. I clear the cache but this didn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can move e-mails from inbox to sub-folders on my mobile without any trouble so l guess that the problem is with my tablet of which is android.</p>
<p>

            My situation is markedly similar with some differences. &nbsp;I cannot move email from any folder (inbox, confirmations, receipts etc) to any other folder but this only happens on my ipad. &nbsp;My iphone will allow me to move emails or drafts and my PCs (work and
 home) will allow me to move items between folders but not my ipad. &nbsp;The same situation occurs as mentioned here. &nbsp;I can swipe or use the 3 dots. The move option allows me to (click or touch) it and opens the available folders window or box but it is greyed
 out or frozen. The screen freezes in a way that only by refreshing the window can I access anything in hotmail. &nbsp;

<h2>            Publisher 2016&#58; Mouse is jumping when trying to move elements</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already performed all pending updates on my MS Office suite but the following issue persists:</p>
<p>When I try to move an element in MS Publisher 2016, the mouse will jump to a corner of the document making it impossible to work with the program. When I uncheck the "align to" options everything works fine again but then making proper alignments is almost
 impossible. I couldn't find any solution so far, any help would be very appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

<h3> wellconnected electrical  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing colors of &#39;Visted and Unvisited&#34; links</h2>
                    <p>I am using IE 11.</p>
<p>In the internet preferences, there is an option to change the colours of Visited and Unvisited sites. This option just doesn't work and I have scoured the internet to find why, with little success. It seems crazy to me to have an option that just doesn't
 work!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not alone with my quest to change these colours. Nearly 10% of the male population is colour blind, particularly in the red spectrum. Current protocol changes unvisited to visited as blue to purple. This makes it impossible for colour blind people to
 trace where they have been.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously used Firefox and they have an add-on which does this perfectly. I wouldn't have changed from Firefox until a current progam I need and use for work is more efficient on IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone PLEASE explain to me why this feature in a modern big branded product doesn't work. Or, if it does, what can I do to make it change colours???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

<p>Hi Jian, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 Home subscription can be shared with up to four other people. If you already have 5 devices added on your Office subscription licenses and you want to add a new Office Home subscription using the same Microsoft account you've used to purchased
 your recent subscription, the Office subscription will only get stack. Meaning, it will only add the months or years you subscribe to Office.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Purchasing of additional subscription to add another 5 device license is yet to be determined. Our developers are collating suggestions for the improvement of your experience in using Office 365 Home. Since this feature is not yet available, we encourage
 that you submit this as a request through the <a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 UserVoice</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your kind understanding. Feel free to post back should you need further assistance.<br />

            <p>I've found that when I "pop out" a reply (regardless of doing it per-reply or by changing the default) Outlook 2013 fails to mark the message as Replied to. The icon does not appear and opening the message does not have the bar that tells you that you replied
 to the message.</p>
<p>This is a huge failure as that is my main indicator of what work I have left to do.</p>
<p>Is there a fix for this?</p>

<h2>            Dragon Dictate 4 with Microsoft Word 2011 &#40;14.5.1&#41; freezes with menu access</h2>
                    My husband is a ventilator dependent quadriplegic trying to transition to a Mac. We work with books making them print accessible for people with disabilities. Because of the missing Visual Basic framework, basically the office beta is nonfunctional. In
 trying to work within Microsoft Word 2011 with Dragon Dictate 4, any time he tries to access the menus, everything freezes. Does anyone have suggestions? Any help is greatly appreciated; many thanks!

            Unfortunately Doug needs a totally hands-free solution that accesses everything on the computer, and the Apple interface from dictation and speakable items is not comprehensive enough. Unfortunately the update did not solve the problem either. I am a very
 advanced user, and it was only when I thought that Dragon Dictate had come far enough that I've tried to help him migrate to a Mac. Unfortunately we are both having problems now. :-(

            <p>How much memory? &nbsp;Which CPU?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My very limited experience with Dragon Dictate is that it needs a serious amount of free RAM and a healthy CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours is the first report we have had of trouble with Dragon Dictate, so answer those questions then we can try a few things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure your system is otherwise exactly standard! &nbsp;Any attempt to move bits of software to different folders, or use applications that offer to "clean"or "tune" your Mac is bound to give trouble.</p>

<h2>            Subforms and Queries</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble using the recordset function in Access 2002 (XP). I have a query running in a subform. I can refer to a simple text box in the subform but I am having trouble referring to the data array. I have tried various examples from forum, but
 to no avail. The error, cannot find table or form comes up. I am wondering do I need to create a form which uses the query and then use that new form as a subform. I hope that I am clear!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find below a picture of the form I am trying to automate. Presently I have a query as a subform. The column of interest holds a series of mobile telephone numbers. I want to take these numbers and join them for the purposes of an bulk text messaging.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b44a4b2-b6bd-4635-aaa6-d2603b46c7b0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b44a4b2-b6bd-4635-aaa6-d2603b46c7b0" /></a></p>
<p>I have no problem referring to a simple control within the subform, but I want to use the recordset type control to join the mobile numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most recent thing I have tried is;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim rs As Recordset<br />
Set rs = CurrentDb.OpenRecordset("Recall Query![Mobile No]")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a run time error '3078' with this line of code when I execute it. The message following the error says the microsoft jet database engine cannot find the table or query. The names are correct, but no matter what syntax I try i keep getting the same
 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if I the problem lies with the fact that the subform is a query and not a table or form?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gavin</p>

            <p>Guys thanks for your interest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I am trying to concantenate / join the mobile numbers for the purpose of bulk text messaging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have successfully referred to a simple control in a subform in my database, but I am having real trouble referencing the array in my query. I have tried all sorts of variations in the syntax, but none work for me. I am presently trying to refer directly
 to the query, but I am wondering if that is where the problem lies. Maybe different syntax is required or maybe referring to the query directly is not allowed in this version of Access?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can forward a copy of the database if that was helpful.</p>

            <p>Ok the term is concatenate, not join. There are a number of functions that will concatenate values in a set of records into one variable. Here is one of them&nbsp;<a href="http://thedbguy.blog.com/2013/08/simplecsv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Simple CSV</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forget about referencing a control on the subform, that's not necessary. What you want is to create a recordset that returns the same records shown in the subform. You don't need to address the subform at all. I'm assuming that the subform is linked to the
 mainform on a single key field. So all you need to do is used that value in the recordset.</p>

            <p>Scott, thanks for the grammer lesson. I'm used to using the 'JOIN' command in Visual Basic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you may have stumbled upon my problem. When creating the form I simply inserted the query into the form and added a send button. I did not do any referencing to the subform/query, unless Access did it automatically. It strikes me that this might
 be where my problem lies. It has been 4 years since I did any work on databases and so I'm quite rusty on this detail.</p>

            <p>it wasn't a grammar lesson, but Access has some very precise terms which have precise meanings. If you don't use the correct terms, it can cause confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you place a query within a form, Access does, indeed, create some stuff for you in the background. But that's not really the problem here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forms don't contain data. they just display data. so the data you want resides in a table. If you want to concatenate values in a specific field across multiple records, then you do so against the table or a filtered recordset pulled from the table. you
 focused on getting the data from the subform, not the underlying data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The function I linked you to will do that.&nbsp;</p>
