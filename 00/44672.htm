<p>Here are four ways:</p>
<p>1. Go to a command prompt and issue the command</p>
<p>dir [drive:folder] &gt; c:\tempfilename (you can use any name and put it<br />
in any folder you want)</p>
<p>Then open notepad, open tempfilename, and print it from there.</p>
<p>2. Write (for example in Notepad) a 1-line text file:<br />
DIR %1 /O &gt;LPT1:</p>
<p>Save it as "printdir.bat" in the "Send To" folder.</p>
<p>Then, to print list of files in any folder, right-click that folder<br />
and select Send to | printdir.bat</p>
<p>To include subfolders, change the command to DIR %1 /O/S &gt;LPT1:</p>
<p>3. Go to<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb</a>;EN-US;Q321379 and<br />
follow the instructions there.</p>
<p>4. Download and use any of the several freeware/shareware utilities<br />
that can do this, such as the popular<br />

    <title>Skype 8.34.0.78 regression bug - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype 8.34.0.78 regression bug</h2>
                    <div>Hi, I just got forced to upgrade from v7 to 8.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been using Skype for years and have 5+ years old conversations with multiple daily messages and media.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The following functions stopped working with the upgrade:</div>
<div>1 - The small menu to jump back to previous years in the conversation doesn't show up. Scrolling to the end only loads day by day, basically making it impossible to reach messages from previous years.</div>
<div>2 - Find doesn't find anything older than a few months. In v7 I could jump to previous results back to the beginning of years old conversations.</div>
<div>3 - I can't open multiple conversations in different windows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Problem with new feature:</div>
<div>4 - The gallery doesn't show media older than 6 months or so.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Number 1 and 2 are blocking. Is there a way to get these functions back? </p>
<p>Even rolling back to v7 would be fine for me. I would have to look for an alternative software and ask for a copy of my personal data as permitted by the European law if no solution gets provided soon.</p>

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />1) At the top of the IMs with the individual, there should be a 'Find'  button with a magnifying glass. It searches throughout your whole conversation, nevermind the date. 
<br />
<br />2) If it is not able to find what you are looking for, it is possible that some of your conversation history was lost when updating to the new version of Skype. If this is the case, I will suggest that you speak to a live chat agent, for which I will leave a link for down below.
<br />
<br />3) This function is limited to the Skype for Windows 10 App. If you are using Windows 10, I'd suggest you make the switch so that you can ues this feature.
<br />
<br />4) This may be related to my comments in point 2.
<br />
<br />I do apologise for the inconvenience that the upgrade may have caused you, but please do pursue this issue with a live chat agent, who may be able to offer assistance on how to get the old conversations back.
<br />
<br />Not all issues allow you to speak to a chat agent, so please select one of the following issues to be able to talk with the agent:-
<br />
<br />'Payments and Purchases'
<br />'Account, profile and sign-in'
<br />'Privacy and security'

<p>Skype 8.34 is utterly useless compared to Ver 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) It can't search my outlook contacts and call them I have to copy and paste. This is a major fail</p>
<p>2.) Touch tones do not work i.e. if I have to press 1 or 2 ect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.) if I search contact from my Win 10 people it calls them from the Windows 10 Skype app not Skype 8.34.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.) if I click call on Skype from Win 10 people the app opens over the top of Skype app and the proceeds to insert 20 between the country code and 20 after the area co and of course can connect the call. Totally f..in stupid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.) no option in 8.34 to search on contacts local to my computer. i.e People or outlook contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.) after making a call some times I repeatedly click on the hang up and it takes 2 to 6 sec's to respond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who is in charge of Skype? How could you do this to the many millions of loyal paying customers who were happy as hell to pay you and use version 7? This is the latest example of all of the products MS has purchased and Killed. Shame on MS for not listening
 to customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>1) Forget "Find" - use Search out in the main window. <em>Much</em> faster, fewer limitations, results presented in a far better way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) It's <em>possible</em>?!&nbsp; He mentioned having 5+ years of conversations. As you know, Skype 8 imports around a year into the cloud (maybe less), and maxes out at two years eventually (as in later this year for many). What on earth is a live agent going
 to do about that design flaw beyond suggesting rebooting the computer and maybe running chkdsk, helpful things like that?&nbsp; Why ask that someone go through the torment of a chat for no reason?</p>

Microsoft had better hope that this feature is coming to other desktop versions or they're going to find that the hot water they're in is only going to get hotter.

<h2>            How to obtain a digital ID in Windows Mail</h2>
                    I have windows mail on a laptop computer and Windows Vista as the operating system. I want to obtain a digital ID and when I follow the pathway described in Help I encounter a roadblock. When I get to Secure Help under Tools and click on Digital ID I get
 a window with four tabs, and the Personal tab is highlighted. When I click on Import I get the set up Wizard and arrive at a request to nominate a file from my system. Questions: Is Personal the tab I should be selecting? If so what does the request in the
 sign up Wizard for a file mean and how should I nominate one? Is it the file where my Digital ID should be stored? If the Personal tab is not the correct one which tab dhould I select? Can anyone help?

 and I haven't dealt with that yet.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>I have Problems with this update as well. I made a clean install of Windows 8.1 x64 this morning and installed all available updates one by one to find the update that is causing the problem. After installing this update the following happens. When you turn
 on the PC you see the BIOS Screen as normal, then&nbsp;the&nbsp;screens turn black. At that point the Windows 8 logo should apear, but instead my monitors go into standby and the PC is reset and starts again but now everything is normal and Windows starts as usual.
 From now on, when you turn the PC on, it will allways behave like this. Just to make clear, before everything was fine and I ONLY installed that update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is of help somehow, I will now try to uninstall this update, to see whether everything turns back to normal. If this is not the case, any suggestions?</p>
<p>

<p>Well, just tried it again, with a complete format of my system (not re-installing it out of Windows). Same problem. Just to confirm, there is no problem installing the update, so I have it on my maschine now. The boot time now increased by about&nbsp;15 seconds
 (because trying to start once and then abort and then start again). I will leave it like that for now, maybe the upcoming update will fix this. Everything else works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not installed any graphics cards driver manually, Windows did this for me.</p>

            That is a great question, I believe when you close out this thread you'll be given that opportunity (I think?) - I've only ever seen my side of the portal, which is just a flood of questions :) 
<br />
<br />No worries either way, it's been a pleasure!

    <title>Wifi keeps disconnecting after a few minutes and requires laptop reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> walshd59  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi keeps disconnecting after a few minutes and requires laptop reset</h2>
                    <p>My Wifi keeps disconnecting after a few minutes and will not reconnect until I restart my computer. I have reinstalled drivers, reset my laptop to factory settings and adjusted the power options so that my laptop cannot turn my devices off to save power.
 I ran a wlan report and the error "device disconnected while associating" keeps occurring. Here is a transcript of the report. Any help would be much appreciated. My laptop is an Asus 550X series and I'm currently operating on windows 10 (which I feel may
 be the issue) but I cannot go back to previous windows version as the date for roll back has expired.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows restore failed and PC won&#39;t boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mat.cn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows restore failed and PC won&#39;t boot</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just come back from a two week holiday and booted up my PC at which point it downloaded a new Windows update, so naturally I rebooted to complete the update installation. Upon rebooting and completed installation, a lot of my programs stopped working,
 wouldn't open and would not let me uninstall any of them as they just crashed during the process or told me that something was already being installed and to wait until it finished (there was nothing installing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I would just like to take a moment to address that I am consistently having issues with Windows 10 in regards to updates. Ever single time I receive a Windows update, something stops working or goes wrong afterwards and I have to fix it. Its getting
 very frustrating, but this time is definitely the worst.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, after trying to resolve the issues there was no success, so I instead resorted to a system restore point that I had created two weeks ago before leaving for my vacation. After waiting for a few hours seeing a screen saying the restore was complete and
 to please wait, it finally produced an error in which it said it had failed. Now, my Windows will not boot up and goes to automatic repair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next option was to try my system image file on my other drive, however, after trying all of the advanced repair options, none work. System restore now tells me that apparently I do not have any system restore points on my PC and system image tells me
 there are no image files. Reverting to previous version fails and even trying to reset PC whilst keeping my files says that it could not complete the action and fails. I tried using command prompt to check my disks and they are showing still as listed and
 connected, however my OS drive C:\ says it is nearly full, when in reality, it only had 130GB storage used out of 500GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried inserting my Windows 10 disk and repairing Windows, and this fails also. I also tried using command prompt to copy my C:\ drive to an external hard drive, but it tells me that 0 files were found. At this point it looks like my C:\ drive has
 been wiped completely and my only option is to reinstall Windows 10 completely, however I do not want to lose the files on my C:\ drive if they are still there, seen as command prompt tells me that 480GB space is used and I also am concerned regarding the
 files on my D:\ as the system image file is not there, so it concerns me that it too may now be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated in regards to any options I have to recover my data as I am desperate to not lose it and do not want to attempt reimaging until I have exhausted all other options - especially as this will be the third
 time since I built this PC in December that Windows updates have caused me to have to reinstall Windows. And furthermore, any advice on why I keep having these issues each time I receive Windows updates would be great to - after all, the updates are supposed
 to be to protect our system, yet all it seems to do each time is cause more issues to the point I consider turning them off completely in future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this will be helpful, but my PC specifications are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- X299 Gaming Pro Carbon (MS-7A95) motherboard</p>
<p>- Intel Core i7-9800X CPU</p>
<p>- 2x 16GB DDR4 Corsair Vengeance LPX 3200mhz RAM</p>
<p>- Samsung SSD 850 EVO 500GB</p>
<p>- 1TB Seagate Barracuda HDD</p>
<p>- 2TB Seagate external HDD</p>
<p>- Corsair H150i All in One CPU liquid cooler</p>
<p>- 2x Asus Rog Strix GTX 1080 graphics cards in SLI</p>
<p>- Corsair HX1000i PSU</p>
<p>- Windows 10 Professional 64bit OS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,&nbsp;</p>

            Mat, you won't be able to install WIndows to the external.  I do sometimes shrink C (using bootable partition manager) to install a rescue install which creates a dual boot and may start booting the old WIndows install again; if so you only need to delete the rescue install in Disk Mgmt and extend C back over the space.  If not set up the new install and move into it.  
<br />
<br />But you don't even need to do that to rescue files.  Just use the booted Command Prompt to access an explorer to copy your files out to the same USB as you're booting from,  as shown in this tutorial:

            Hi Matthew.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It may be necessary to create bootable media to access Repair Mode or do the Clean install since it relies on it's own files and drivers and not those onboard WIndows that may already be corrupted.  
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.

<h2>            Can&#39;t install an app that I deleted previously.</h2>
                    <p>I can't seem to re-install an app I previously deleted (I deleted it because it wasn't opening anymore, so I thought to give it a fresh start). I see it in the Microsoft Store under My Library. If I hit the download button it doesn't do anything, in fact
 Windows Store just hangs. I have left it there for over 4 hours and it does nothing whatsoever. Other programs seem to work properly during that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also searched for the folder to make sure it was deleted completely on the Windows folder, and it is gone. I just can't install it again. I don't know if it is a problem with Windows Store or what.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? I'm not sure if I should delete the Windows Store and try to install it again, and anyway I don't really know how to do that.<br />

            Hi Dan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try it again after each one of these steps that progressively reset and reinstall the Store app:
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails then Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />  
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.

            Hi Rbarnes54, try the options in the Windows Recovery Environment, hopefully one of those will work for you:
<br />
<br />Start PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset

<p>Thank you for the feedback and process to follow. I followed as directed. I found that for whatever reason, i could not gain access to network settings even through safe mode. I was not able to resolve the issue, however i learned alot today. I did end up
 taking it in for service. The initial assestment is that windows maybe corrupted. I was not able to do any backups as well. I should have it back on Sunday, and I will update on what the problem turns out to be.</p>

<p>Non c'è un limite prefissato, certo che se noti un eccessivo calore potrebbe dipendere da tanti fattori e non solo la console.</p>
<p>1. Dove hai posizionato la console</p>
<p>2. La tieni in verticale o orizzontale</p>
<p>3. La presa&nbsp;è sovraccarica</p>
<p>4. Fa particolarmente caldo</p>
<p>5. Resta esposta al sole</p>
<p>6. Scollega e ricollega tutti i cavi</p>
<p>7. Quanto calda, si è fuso qualche disco?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Io&nbsp; la tengo accesa abbastanza a lungo, non ho mai fatto caso al calore della console. Sono più preoccupa per l'alimentatore, che deve fare tutto quello sforzo
<em>disumano. </em>&nbsp;Finché&nbsp;non si riscalda&nbsp;"lui" allora va tutto bene. :)</p>

            Io ho una xbox one x e la tengo accesa anche tutto il giorno e in stand-by la notte è non da nessun tipo di problema vista anche la notizia che xbox one può restare accesa 10 anni. Comunque non preoccuparti non c'è bisogno di farla raffreddare ovviamente
 non sono un esperto Microsoft ma penso sia così.&nbsp;

<h2>            Access denied 80070005 when trying to back up files on Windows Vista home premium</h2>
                    I've always backed up my files every month with no problem. Then last month, I got the Access Denied code 80070005 when trying to backup, and I'm still getting it every time I try to backup my computer. I'm running Windows Vista Home premium.

<p><span><span>Hi countrygirl1972,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Were you able to fix the issue after following Ajay’s steps?</span></span></p>

<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Services</strong> in Start Search. When the Services page is open, check for
<strong>Volume Shadow Copy service</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Right click on

</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> You can also try to run a
<strong>Checkdisk</strong> and check whether this fixes the issue. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: When you run the checkdisk, there are chances of losing data so you may take a backup of important data before running checkdisk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To Run CheckDisk to repair the bad sectors in the harddrive</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>cmd</strong> in the Start Search box, <strong>
right-click cmd</strong>.exe in the Programs list, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. At a command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<strong>chkdsk /f /r X: (drive letter of the harddrive)</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.
<strong>Press Y</strong> when you are prompted to check the disk the next time that the system restarts.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Close all applications, and then

                    Have tried removing and reinstalling, set as an administrator. Went through the security anti-virus set-up and allowed all itunes related files I could find. I can still get itunes to run on my old computer. I'm not real saavy on some of this, so need
 specific answers. I also can't get wild-tangent games to work, which may be related. They suggested windows7&nbsp;spyware may be an issue, but can't figure that one out...

                    <p>I just bought a Nextbook Flexx10 2in1 Quad-Core Windows 8.1 Tablet, and I was wondering how compatible this 2in1 is if I were to upgrade it to windows 10.&nbsp; I have the Get Windows 10 app but I don't know how to see how compatible my device would be with it.
 I read some things online that said windows 10 isn't as great on 2in1 devices as it is with real PC laptops. Is that true, and how so? Also, if I we&nbsp;to upgrade it and find out that I don't like it, can I change back to my previous windows 8.1. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Windows Explorer Search Tips or Filters for Case-Sensitive Search</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 7 Explorer and trying to use the Search box to display only files that have TEMPL in all-caps vs. templ in lowercase. I'm typing TEMPL in the search box and it's including definitely the TEMPL filenames, but also the templ file names.
 I've tried "TEMPL" in the search box, but that actually eliminates several of the files I want. If anyone knows a site or a book with tips on this, I would love to hear about them. thanks in advance.
