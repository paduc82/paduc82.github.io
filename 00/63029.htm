<h2>            temp files over 100GB</h2>
                    For the second straight week I've had to go into Windows Temp folders and manually delete files ... there are over 8000 and somewhere in that morass are few that pop my temp folder to over 100GB. &nbsp;I've run SpyBot and AdAware and Avast! doesn't find anything
 but I'm concerned that I might actually be SpamZombie or something. &nbsp;Is there a reason other than malware that might account for such a huge balloon in Temp files?

<div>It's worth noting that I'm also now suffering from some performance issues in Diablo III and Minecraft (went from 200+fps to 15fps) around the same time.</div>

<p><br />
Personally, I stopped using Spybot and AdAware years back.</p>
<p>I don't dislike Avast!... Or Avira or AVG.&nbsp; Great free products.&nbsp; You might consider uninstalling it, paying 60 USD every two years and getting something like eSet NOD32 (antivirus only, not the suite.)&nbsp; I have found it to be very efficient and effective.</p>
<p>Go through this, see if you can clear up your issue and up your performance.</p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a></li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</a></li></ul>
<p><br />
Removing everything they find. Rebooting when needed. (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSet Online Scanner</a>.</p>
<p><strong><u>The less you have running all the time, the better the things you want to run will perform:</u></strong></p>

<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google</a> (and/or ask here.) You can hopefully figure out if there are things starting when you computer does (or you logon) that you do not need and then configure them (via their
 own built-in mechanisms is the preferred method) so they do not start up - using your resources without reason.</p>
<p>You can download and utilize <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>You may wish to free up some disk space (will also aid in getting rid of things you do not utilize) by going through these steps:</p>
<p>Windows XP should take between 4.5 and 20GB *with* an Office suite, Photo Editing software, alternative Internet browser(s), various Internet plugins and a host of other things installed.&nbsp; YOu may have other installs taking up additional space, but probably
 not much.&nbsp; Everything else is *your* data.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with the stability of your system, you can delete the uninstall files for the patches that Windows XP has installed...<br />

<p>You can run Disk Cleanup - built into Windows XP - to erase all but your latest restore point and cleanup even more "loose files"..</p>

<p>You can turn off hibernation if it is on and you don't use it..</p>
<p>When you hibernate your computer, Windows saves the contents of the system's memory to the hiberfil.sys file. As a result, the size of the hiberfil.sys file will always equal the amount of physical memory in your system. If you don't use the hibernate feature
 and want to recapture the space that Windows uses for the hiberfil.sys file, perform the following steps:</p>
<p>- Start the Control Panel Power Options applet (go to Start, Settings, Control Panel, and click Power Options).<br />
- Select the Hibernate tab, clear the "Enable hibernation" check box, then click OK; although you might think otherwise, selecting Never under the "System hibernates" option on the Power Schemes tab doesn't delete the hiberfil.sys file.<br />
- Windows will remove the "System hibernates" option from the Power Schemes tab and delete the hiberfil.sys file.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your System Restore can use...</p>
<p>1. Click Start, right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.<br />
2. Click the System Restore tab.<br />
3. Highlight one of your drives (or C: if you only have one) and click on the "Settings" button.<br />
4. Change the percentage of disk space you wish to allow.. I suggest moving the slider until you have just about 1GB (1024MB or close to that...)<br />
5. Click OK.. Then Click OK again.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your Temporary Internet Files can utilize...</p>
<p>Empty your Temporary Internet Files and shrink the size it stores to a size between 64MB and 128MB..</p>
<p>- Open ONE copy of Internet Explorer.<br />
- Select TOOLS - Internet Options.<br />
- Under the General tab in the "Temporary Internet Files" section, do the following:<br />
- Click on "Delete Cookies" (click OK)<br />
- Click on "Settings" and change the "Amount of disk space to use:" to something between 64MB and 128MB. (It may be MUCH larger right now.)<br />
- Click OK.<br />
- Click on "Delete Files" and select to "Delete all offline contents" (the checkbox) and click OK. (If you had a LOT, this could take 2-10 minutes or more.)<br />
- Once it is done, click OK, close Internet Explorer, re-open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>You can use an application that scans your system for log files and temporary files and use that to get rid of those:</p>
<p>Ccleaner (Free!)<br />
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a><br />
( just the disk cleanup - don't play with the registry part for now )</p>

<p>Those can help you visually discover where all the space is being used. Then you can determine what to do.</p>
<p>After that - you will want to check for any physical errors and arrange everything for efficient access"</p>

<p><strong><u>Cleanup the Update Components on your Windows XP machine</u></strong></p>
<p>While likely not 100% necessary - it is probably a good idea at this time to make sure you continue getting the updates you need. This will help you make sure your update system is ready to do this for you.</p>
<p>Download and run the MSRT manually:<br />

(Skip the details and download the tool, download and save to your desktop, run it.)</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Download/Install the latest Windows Installer (for your OS):<br />
( Windows XP 32-bit : <span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloadS/details.aspx?familyid=5A58B56F-60B6-4412-95B9-54D056D6F9F4&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">WindowsXP-KB942288-v3-x86.exe</a></span> )<br />
(Download and save it to your desktop, run it.)</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>and...</p>
<p>Download the latest version of the Windows Update agent from here (x86):<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91237</a><br />
.... and save it to the<strong> root of your C:\ drive</strong>. After saving it to the<em>root of the C:\ drive</em>, do the following:</p>
<p>Close all Internet Explorer windows and other applications.</p>
<p>Start button --&gt; RUN and type in:<br />
%SystemDrive%\windowsupdateagent30-x86.exe /WUFORCE<br />
--&gt; Click OK.</p>
<p>(If asked, select "Run".) --&gt; Click on NEXT --&gt; Select "I agree" and click on NEXT --&gt; When it finishes installing, click on "Finish"...</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Now reset your Windows Update Components with this FixIt (you will <strong><em>*NOT*</em></strong> use the aggressive version, if asked):<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I reset Windows Update components?</a></p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Now that your system is generally free of malware (assuming you have an AntiVirus application), you have cleaned up the 'extra applications' that might be running and taking up your valuable memory and processor, you have cleared out some valuable drive
 space and made sure there are no issues with the drive itself and your Windows Update components are updated and should be working in top shape - there is only one other thing you<em>may</em> wish to do:</p>
<p>Obtain and install the latest hardware device drivers for your system from the system/hardware manufacturers' support and/or download web site.</p>
<p>If you wish, come back and let us know a little more information about your system - in particular the Make/Model of the system you have - and perhaps someone here can point you to the right place(s) to go to accomplish this. This is not 100% necessary -
 but I would bet that you would gain some performance and features by doing this part.</p>

            Wow, it has taken me a while to get through all of these steps ... here's what I've managed to do so far ...
<div><br />
<div>First off the FPS issue was solved just by removing my graphics card, cleaning off contacts and replacing :)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Secondly, &nbsp;I have run Malware Bytes (clean). &nbsp;ccleaner (found quite a few things and rebooted several times and reran -- clean now) along with the Adaware Spybot and Avast previously mentioned. &nbsp;Everything is now coming back clean.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have updated my Mobo and Vid Card firmware and drivers to the latest and they are running stable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't need more hard drive space so I didn't bother removing the XP files that I don't need (and it's only taking up the normal 20GB other than the temp file issue).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have run defrag several times and disk cleanup (which again, didn't find much to clean).</div>
<div><br />
<div>This morning I got at low disk warning on the C Drive and discovered my Windows Temp folder back to 90 GB with 6000+ files. &nbsp;I am now manually removing the files once a week (which takes 20 minutes to run), but it's driving me crazy.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any more ideas?</div>

    <title>Persistent advrcntr5.dll call - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meimeiriver2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Persistent advrcntr5.dll call</h2>
                    <p>I removed Nero a while back (including using their cleanup tool), yet I keep getting error saying advrcntr5.dll isn't found on the system, while opening certain files (like .mp4 video).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran their cleanup tool, and there are no Nero update services or anything running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's more, regedit can't find any keywords of 'advrcntr5' (my guess is this is because the dll name probably gets formed, live, from advrcntr + a number).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do I find where advrcntr5.dll is being invoked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Run msconfig.exe, then untick blocks of items under the Startup tab until you find the culprit. This will not prevent Windows from booting up.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I realized I had a few very old NeAudio.ax file registered (for eac3to), back in the day. Those were being queried upon playing audio for certain video files (like .mp4). and they, in return, kept asking for&nbsp;the&nbsp;advrcntr5.dll file. Unregistering the old
 .ax files made the errors go away.</p>

    <title>Rebuild and eliminate Dual Boot at same time with clean install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Rebuild  and eliminate Dual Boot at same time with clean install</h2>
                    <p>I have a computer that is a few years old and in need of a rebuild, by which I mean reformat the disk and reinstall everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that this computer is currently a dual boot arrangement with Windows 7 first in Drive C:, then Creators Upgrade of Windows 10 in Drive D:. I believe that the Windows 10 uses the Windows 7 MBR. I want the end result to be Windows 10 only, with
 two partitions, one for the OS and one for Data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I accomplish this by doing a clean boot using Windows 10 Media Creation Tool on the Windows 10 partition, formatting that partition in the process, and then after completion, format the Windows 7 partition and use it for a data partition for Windows
 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think my question is very clear but hopefully, someone can understand what I want to &nbsp;achieve here and help me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

            <p>Well, you don't have to format Windows 10 if all you want to do is make the current Windows 7 partition for data only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot into Windows 10, press Windows key + X</p>
<p>Click Disk Management</p>
<p>Right click the partition containing the Windows 7 installation, then click Format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want Windows 10 to default when booting up, you can do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Windows key + R</p>
<p>Type: <strong>msconfig</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the boot tab then select the Windows 7 entry then click Delete</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the count down to 0, click Apply then OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you could just right peform an entirely new install.</p>

            <p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My choice is to do the complete new install. One of the reasons is that this is a five year old machine that I think really can benefit from a reformatted drive and clean re-installation of the OS. I understand that there are numerous ways to handle the
 Windows 7 partition and maybe the best, provided that the ISO software allows me to completely format the disk, will to do just that and then install Windows 10 there and later, create new partitions for data, etc. I have installed with the ISO a couple of
 times but I don't think I ever did a format in the procedure. I think this is possible. Can you confirm that? I am going to follow the link you suggested and see if that gives me some insight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to you and the others who responded to my question. Much appreciated.</p>

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article referred to in Step 1 of your response is dated July 2015 and contains some updates that concern me. Are there any issues to worry about with today's ISO files provided by Microsoft? I am about to begin the tasks that I wrote about recently,
 starting with a rebuild of a 32 bit laptop that I will return from a dual boot system to a single boot, windows 10 Pro and then do the same with a 64 bit dual boot system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your continuing support. I am enjoying the education.</p>

<h2>            DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE 0x0000009f</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings, I hope I am doing this all okay.</p>
<p>I have a new (February 2010) eMachines ET1831-07 duo core x64 computer with Windows 7 factory installed. Windows 7 crashes but only when the computer is in sleep mode (AFAIK it crashes&nbsp;only in sleep mode). I have attempted to read the minidump files without
 success.</p>
<p>In Event Viewer I see: Critical [date and time stamp] Kernal Power 41 [event id] (63) [task category] for these crashes</p>
<p>I have seen some references in my searches to Zone Alarm being a possible culprit, which I am running (the free version), but the very first crash occured before I uninstalled the trial version of Norton Internet Security which came from the factory on my
 machine and installed (Free) Zone Alarm.</p>
<p>I have zipped the last three minidumps and made them available on Skydrive here . . .</p>
<p><a href="http://cid-48c331d6360d2052.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Zipped%20.dmp%20files%20for%20Windows%207%20crash%20during%20sleep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-48c331d6360d2052.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Zipped%20.dmp%20files%20for%20Windows%207%20crash%20during%20sleep</a></p>
<p>I thank you kindly in advance for any help you can give me. Note: I did download new drivers for my video processor (the standard one installed at the factory for this computer).</p>

<p>Also, looking at the minidump files with WinDbg of the Debugging Tools for Windows, shows that&nbsp;the driver that is being blamed for the DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE error&nbsp;is the&nbsp;Rt64win7.sys which&nbsp;is a driver for the Realtek NIC.</p>
<p>Try updating the driver for the Realtek NIC:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=7&amp;PFid=10&amp;Level=3&amp;Conn=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=7&amp;PFid=10&amp;Level=3&amp;Conn=2</a></p>
<p>However, if problems persist, as you have ZoneAlarm installed, consider that ZoneAlarm drivers may be at the root of the issue as reported in the following thread:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7hardware/thread/d10e3bcd-6a57-42f5-b0e0-7ad11c267c90" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7hardware/thread/d10e3bcd-6a57-42f5-b0e0-7ad11c267c90</span></a></p>
<p>Consider uninstalling ZoneAlarm and see if the BSODs resolve.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
Updating drivers, BIOS, and control software (if any) is a good idea.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each
<br />
installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is
<br />
preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

                    I keep getting a window that says my ATT account needs updating.&nbsp; When I go to setting for email, it says attention required.&nbsp; Using the "fix" box, I try changing the password and nothing happens - it reverts back to the "attention required."&nbsp; This is

            You can see my reply online. &nbsp;Basically, I found out that the was an att email outage in my area. &nbsp;It generated the notice on my computer that my att account needed updating, which was incorrect. &nbsp;ATT/Microsoft need to a better way of handling this. &nbsp;Thanks,
 anyway, for your responding

            <p>I was not aware that Windows 10 could do this. Seeing as no one has replied yet, I thought I would have an input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 10 is capable of doing this I would make sure you are using the same Microsoft Account to sign in to each device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't imagine that programs will be copied over (like office or chrome browser) but other apps from the MS Store may copy over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps and let me know what you find out!<br />

    <title>Account Continually Hacked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karensanders3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account Continually Hacked</h2>
                    <p>I am now understanding that I am not the only one this is happening to.&nbsp; My account is constantly being hacked by unknown people who are stealing my funds and buying V Bucks.&nbsp; This has been going on for 6 months and I have been in touch with Microsoft multiple
 times.&nbsp; When this started happening, MS refunded my money and showed me how to protect my account.&nbsp; Then after setting up a 2 step authentication, it was hacked again.&nbsp; This time they said I had to go to my bank and settle the matter.&nbsp; My bank then filed several
 claims against MS and some of the money was refunded.&nbsp; They issued me a pre paid visa card, which at the time, MS would not accept for payment option.&nbsp; So, I set up a link to my paypal account only when I had a monthly fee due.&nbsp; As soon as the paypal was linked,
 another $24.99. $24.99, $9.99 charges flowed through (not from me).&nbsp; I tried to unassociated my MS account from paypal, and it would not let me do it.&nbsp; I set up another security measure with paypal to notify me when a charge from MS comes through, and someone
 the hackers have found a way to bypass this security measure.&nbsp; Now I am out of pocket, some $200.&nbsp; I just filed a complaint with MS....we will see how they respond.&nbsp; This is outright criminal activity.&nbsp; I spoke to some friends just yesterday who said they
 have had the exact same issue.&nbsp; It's rampant, and MICROSOFT needs to step up and get this criminal hacking issue fixed NOW.&nbsp; All of this money is going to FORTNITE company whose profits were 1.2 Billion dollars last year!!! Please let me know if anyone else
 is experiencing this and there IS power in numbers.&nbsp; Let' make MS stop this nonsense.</p>

<p>This sounds like someone has access to your email and is resetting your password or someone who knows your password even when you change it. For example, there may be a Remote Access Trojan on your PC that is letting people see what you're typing or even
 see your screen remotely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would change the password on your email and account from another machine (maybe mobile phone if you don't have another PC) and do a virus scan with Malwarebytes (free) on your PC that you usually use. Also check your proofs to make sure there's no backup

<p>
</p><p>Another cause could be people on your console are actually buying these charges without your knowledge. Please set a passkey to prevent purchases from happening on your console if you think this could be the case:

<p>Hey Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since some has unauthorized access to your account, you will need to take immediate action and change the details of your account. Things such as:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The Email you use to log in</li><li>Your password</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally,&nbsp; for more protection, you should enable&nbsp;2-Step verification. This adds a layer of protection by requiring a secondary means of confirmation for login in such as a code sent by phone or email or the authenticator app. Feel free to contact&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox
 Support</a>&nbsp;and let them know about your situation, they will gladly&nbsp;help you secure&nbsp;your account!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about that issue but if you changed all passwords, put&nbsp;<span>2 step authentication and you are still hacked, it sound like that a hacker get your new infos (maybe trojan / virus on the computer or your mobile so it will be a nice idea to make
 a big checkup with an up to date anti virus).</span></p>
<p><span><span>Then re-do a change for your all passwords and security (Epic side and Microsoft side), dont use any bithday / pet's name / parent's name or any easy passwords to find by someone else than you.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Regards,</span></span></span></p>

<p>Are the purchases actually being made on your MS account/xbox profile? You can check here account.microsoft.com and go to order history.</p>

            hey it looks like Someone has been using your account to buy online goods from the Microsoft store or has your banking information and is using it to buy stuff on the Microsoft store and you are getting emails about being charged about it you should probably
 be able to work something out with your bank and also try to remove any payment method on your xbox relating to your credit card&nbsp;

            I second the advice to set up two factor log in, it's a good security blanket to have in order to protect any online account.

<p>If it is showing as a charge on your bank statement but nothing is showing up on your paypal or MS account that sounds like someone has put your bank information whether it be your credit/debit card or checking account information on their own paypal account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sounds like fraudulent charges and you would need to talk to your bank about these and let them know what is going on so they can issue you either a new credit/debit card or checking account information.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Acer R7 572 - Tablet Feature Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer Aspire R7 572.&nbsp; This is a laptop with an HDD and an SDD that functions like a regular computer and a tablet.&nbsp; With Windows 8.1, I could press the "Windows Icon Start Screen" and access the tablet mode desktop.&nbsp; This was basically an entire
 screen with app icons that I could press and launch.&nbsp; Since updating to Windows 10, everything works like a regular computer.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with the touch screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this?</p>
<p>

    <title>Xbox Music Pass Videos No Longer Play on 360 Display 0&#58;00 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Music Pass Videos No Longer Play on 360 Display 0&#58;00 Time&#59; DO Play on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>I have two Xbox 360 and one Xbox ONE and use the same account/gamertag on all three. This has worked flawlessly up until last week when I launched the Xbox ONE Xbox Music app for the first time on the Xbox ONE.</p>
<p>Since then I can no longer watch music *VIDEOS* via Xbox Music on my 360's but can still watch them via Xbox Music on my Xbox ONE. Regular streaming music / radio (not videos) works on either console.</p>
<p>The music videos display 0:00 for their time. I have come across various articles about troubleshooting 0:00 from (1) adding additional security proofs to my profile, (2) manually removing the Xbox Music App and re-installing, (3) deleting my gamertag profile
 from all my consoles and re-downloading.</p>
<p>None of these have worked.</p>
<p>To me, it appears as if I have been blocked from watching videos once I used the Xbox ONE Music Pass app. This is not ideal for my usage as the 360's are set up for music / video / entertaining.</p>
<p>Assistance is required as I'm out of options.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just like you, I have a similar number of computers in the house (funny how the pesky things add up), and when you add in all the others I'll probably be asked to 'advise' on the final total could be interesting...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a plan, and I'd just like to check if others think it is feasible:</p>
<p>I have bought 4 x 16Gb USB drives, and intend to download iso copies of Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro, in 32 and 64 bit giving me a solution that should fit all (most) situations.</p>
<p>Will I be able to carry out all these download operations on the same machine? - By which I mean will be able to prepare a USB key for a Win10 Home 32bit installation, on a Win 8.1 Pro 64bit computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if I want to go from 32 to 64 bit on a machine, will I be able to do this, and will the procedure be first the upgrade install, then clear the drive and do a second install of the same edition in 64bit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, with previous updates I have chosen to install to a new drive, leaving the previous installs available to boot into if needed (especially useful on some peoples computers where I don't want to use up my life clearing it out). Am I right in my understanding
 that this route is now being closed off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any replies, and my apologies if I have hijacked this thread.</p>

Windows 10 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. In fact, Windows 10 64 bit supports up to 512 GBs of RAM, while Windows 10 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 10 64 bit is more secure too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 10."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108,

<h3> mike.kay.mail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Protection&#47;Encryption - how to remove in W10</h2>
                    <p>I bought in June 2015 a Dell E6440 latitude originally intended for a corporate client. &nbsp;It was brand new, never used machine, and had a lot of Dell security features for corporates installed- although it was never particularly obvious - so I just ignored
 it. &nbsp;And forgot about it. &nbsp;Nothing was encrypted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I updated to W10, the update process said that the encryption s'ware needed to be removed before the W10 upgrade could proceed. &nbsp;So I said yes and the process did spend some time doing something that looked like software removal. &nbsp;W10 up and running
 fine - but on boot and about every 1 time in 5 when you access the filing system a standard windows install message box pops up that says "Dell Data Protection | Encryption &nbsp; Please wait while Windows configures Dell Data Protection | Encryption" &nbsp;There is
 a cancel button, and after a few seconds another box pops up "Dell Data Protection | Encryption &nbsp; An entitlement for Personal Edition as not found. Aborting install" and an OK button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I can cancel/OK these boxes no problem and the machine runs just fine... but it's very irritating. &nbsp;Any ideas how I can get rid of it for ever? &nbsp;I've never had any help, or even response, from the Dell website....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your question about power settings for your Surface Pro 3. I'll do what I can to help you achieve your aim with these settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read through the links you have attached. The first provides a workaround for disabling connected standby through a registry change. We do not support registry changes, so we are unable to provide any troubleshooting for that. Furthermore, that change
 is for another line of laptops, and it is uncertain to us whether it will work for your Pro 3. However, the second article differs in that it discusses disabled connected standby on the Surface Pro 3 with the use of Hyper-V. With Hyper-V, as the article mentions,
 you will no longer have connected standby as an option at all (i.e. there will be nothing to disable), and your Pro 3 will go into hibernation instead. As you stated, there is a known issue of WiFi connection problems after coming out of hibernation from Hyper-V.
 However, I'm trying to point out that your suggested workaround with the first does not seem connected to your second article, as these are two completely separate ways of disabling connected standby. Whether the first causes the same problems with WiFi connections
 would remain to be seen, although it is possible that the same issue could occur.&nbsp; To be clear, we do not recommend a change in the registry as a workaround for your issue, as we cannot predict what problems may arise from such a change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if we have correctly understood your issue, and thank you for participating in the Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Wishes,</p>
<p>Zack_T</p>

</p><p>Open the power settings and edit your power plan.&nbsp; You should see to timers for when the computer will sleep.&nbsp; One for battery power and one for AC power.&nbsp; Set the sleep timers to never and display off timers (advanced settings) to some non-zero number.&nbsp;
 The sleep timers and display off timers always match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, using the registry entry, disable connected standby and reboot the computer.&nbsp; Then edit the power settings.&nbsp; You should now see timers to turn off the display.&nbsp; The&nbsp;power settings now&nbsp;work exactly as I would expect.&nbsp; However, connected standby is disabled
 so the WiFi problem shows up and the work around setting the hypervisorlaunchtype fails.</p>

            Apparently the connected standby bug is fixed in Windows 10.&nbsp; I just have to hope the power plan setting bug is fixed too (or the registry hack continue to work).

<h2>            Operation Flashpoint wont sucessfuly install on my PC</h2>
                    I have Operation Flashpoint game of the year edition, not red dragon rising but the older game for windows xp. every time I finish installing the game it says "setup encountered an error. Application may not work properly." and then the game doesnt work.
 I tried installing this game on two different PC's with windows xp. What's the problem.&nbsp;

            I found the answer. for anyone having this problem you create a new folder in programs files called codemasters and create a file in that file called operation Flashpoint. you then take the third disc and drag its contents into the operation flashpoint
 file.&nbsp;&nbsp;you then start installing with the first disc and then the second. after this do on insert the third disc. unplug your PC and start it up again the game should work.

            I was able to fix it after hours of messing around. <br />
<br />
The key here is to look at C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther\setuperr.log there are multiple things that can cause you to get a 0x800700004 error. You can find out exactly why you got it here.
<br />
<br />
My specific error was:<br />
2013-10-22 02:03:00, Error &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[0x08039d] MIG &nbsp; &nbsp;Cannot add mapping for user profile C:\Users\Nick. Error: 1009: Win32Exception: The configuration registry database is corrupt. [0x000003F1] __cdecl Mig::CIndirectKeyMapper::CIndirectKeyMapper(class UnBCL::String
 *,struct HKEY__ *,class UnBCL::String *,class UnBCL::String *,int,int,const Mig::HiveLoadRetryOptions *)[gle=0x000000cb]<br />
<br />
Yours may not be the same, but you can Google the sub error codes found here and look for a solution based on that, for example 0x08039d or 0x000003F1. I didn't find a whole lot but using these may get you more info than 0x800700004 alone.
<br />
<br />
I had already tried using a new profile with admin rights but it didn't work, I still got the above error. The installer checks all the profiles, if one is corrupt it won't work no matter what profile you try to upgrade from. So, I just deleted the corrupt
 profile, it gives you an option to save all your files, and will save them to the desktop of the profile you are working from. Once I deleted the corrupt profile it worked just fine.
<br />
<br />
You may need to run <span><font><font><font color="#000000"><strong>WSReset.exe</strong>&nbsp; to clear the Store, but you don't have to do any of those other silly generic Microsoft fixes</font></font></font></span> if you have the same issue as me.

            Hello,
<div><br />
What is the model number of the Asus Computer? </div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1 :</strong> Before Performing a Reset to factory settings, you need to take the backup of all the data, as the data would be lost in this process.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-and-restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-and-restore-frequently-asked-questions</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2 </strong>: In order to perform a reset to factory settings , you can check if there is a recovery partition installed on the computer. If the recovery partition is not installed,then you need to contact the computer manufacturer for better
 assistance.<br />
