<h2>            Word 2011 version turned by document into an all asterisk doc.</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, while I was working on very large outline for a class, Word 2011 decided to mess up and convert all my text into asterisk. I have tried everything. I first creating a backup copy after it happened, because I had not saved it in awhile and exited out
 of my original. However, when I went back to my original, even though I had not saved it, I had auto save every 10 min on, but when I went to recover my last saved copy there was nothing there. So now I am stuck with 13 pages out of my original 30, and nothing
 but asterisks. I lost hours upon hours of word and no way to recover my document. Does anyone have any idea how to recover my doc or solve this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Apologies for the very late reply everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope to help anyone who has had any of the same issues... Unfortunately, there was absolutely nothing I could have done to recover my folder. Although I had autosave on I had not saved the file since I had started it about a few days before my document
 turned into a asterisk doc. There was absolutely no was to recover the document. I had to cut my losses and restart all over. Unfortunately for me, it was a very important one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case I was running on a very old version of Word. Words of advice, update your Word asap everyone...&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            ACCESS 365 INCOME&#47;EXPENDITURE REPORT</h2>
                    I have the above on my computer. The blank form may have derived from access 2007 but converted into access 365 in February 2017. I have printed 20 pages of transactions off from this report but when I open document in 'income by category or expenditure
 by category' the report prints the title &nbsp;but the rest of the sheets are blank. Anyone rectify this please as I have been on to support for 2 days and not one agent knows how to rectify this problem

            There is no way anyone can rectify this problem without knowing how this app is designed. Access is a database development platform. The report (not document) you refer to is based on data, if the data isn't right the report reflects no data. But to analyze the problem we need to get into the design of the report and the database. 
<br />
<br />If you can't put a copy somewhere for us to look at, then you will probably need to hire someone to look at the database for you.

<p>Hi Scottgem</p>
<p>I paid microsoft good money for this cram. &nbsp;If somebody from microsoft does not resolve the problem or have &nbsp;a good reason why it does not work &nbsp;shall require a refund never mind hiring somebody. I have had no problem using this account while running 2007
 office so why have &nbsp;I got a problem as soon as I change to 365 office. They making things worse at microsoft one minute they say the software will run along side each other (ie 2007/365) then they decide they can't. All I know is they are the cause of the
 problems forever changing things.</p>

<p>Hi Jason</p>
<p>I don't know if I should because it' not a business and I am retired but I have done our bowling club account in access. I started doing them in office 2007 access with no problems at all. Soon as I have gone to 365 I have a lot of problems. Wish I never
 changed.</p>
<p>I do not mind microsoft coming on computer as they have done without success I need an access agent at access higher level to tell me whats going off. Is there a more private way?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi Jason</p>
<p>I think I have found out what the cause is. I changed to 365 in Feb 2017 and because Microsft Agent told me both 2007 and 2016 would run alongside each other I kept both on my computer. Last month I took an update and I could no longer get 2007 on computer
 so got an Agent to sort my computer out because I wanted to make sure everything was ok. Because accounts went into 365 ok I did not check they would print. I have just created a new personal account ledger for 2018 and entered a few things then categorised
 them and they have printed out just now. I bet it was cause the form I used for this year (2017) was a 2007 database product and not 365 if you understand what I mean. Thanks for your offer of help. I will make sure its printing as I enter transactions next
 year hopefully it will be ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have another problem if you can help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft agents told me they could not find my office account and I was not signed in. I have never signed in to office. When I have tried to sign in just now it will not recognise me even though I am signed in to Microsoft Account. I don't get it. Have
 you any idea why this is?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            You paid Microsoft for their Office product. You did not pay them for a turnkey Access application. Microsoft doesn't sell such. They do provide free templates for people to use a guidelines for applications they need to develop. Those templates are not warranted to work as turnkey apps. So your expectations for Microsoft to help you with this are not realistic.
<br />
<br />It is really not clear what you are working with. It sounds like you are working with a template that you downloaded. As I said previously, Access is a development platform. We don 't know how that report is designed to work so we can't tell you what's wrong without seeing it. The people answering questions here are mostly volunteers who give their time and experience to help others. We want to help you, but we can't without more info.

<p>I may have found the problem. I changed to 365 in Feb 2017. The agent who installed it me said it would be ok to leave office 2007 on. Last month I took an update and 2007 was no longer there to use!. The personal account ledger I use was running in 365
 ok until I have come to end of year when I need to print the report it printed the transaction list but would not print income or expenses by category out. I have had 2.5 days of agents trying to rectify this. Today I opened a new ledger entered a transaction
 categorised it and it printed out. So I will enter more transactions in the new year and keep an eye on the printing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reckon that using the personal account ledger template from 2007 could have been the issue here but I am not clever enough to prove it. I am approaching 70yrs old and find it hard to figure things out now and need a little bit of help now and then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a nice Christmas and stay sober I may need your help next year if I am still around. Thanks anyway</p>

            I'm glad to hear that. The agent that installed 365 was incorrect. Having multiple versions of Office on the same machine can result in problems. Applications developed in Access 2007 should work  OK in 2016, but there could be issues. Or it could be understand how the template was supposed to work.

<p>Hi PaulHux,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your problem, I suggest you try to uncheck the ‚ÄúSave call logs in my email Conversation History folder‚Äù option in Skype for business and see if it helps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Skype for business desktop client&gt; Options&gt; Tools &gt; Options&gt; Personal&gt; Exchange and Outlook integration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn‚Äôt work for you, I suggest you check if you can still receive the voice mail notifications after disabling the "Send an email message to my Inbox when I miss a phone call" option in Outlook web app.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks, but I've done that multiple times.&nbsp; As you will see in my original question, I've set TABS to open both pop-ups and links as a new tab in the curent window.&nbsp; I used the procedure you described.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still get some links to open as new tabs in the same window and some will open new windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, when I opened the email w/ your suggestion and clicked on the link to "<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/acd57b2a-a117-44e1-a9b4-e5a843e6dccb"><span>Click here to go to the thread</span></a>&nbsp;" I got a new window instead
 of a new tab.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This may be happening because you're navigating from Internet Zone to Trusted Sites (or vice versa.) Starting with IE7, Internet Explorer won't open sites in different security zones in the same window.</p>
<p>Multiple windows open when you start Windows Internet Explorer 7 after you upgrade from Windows XP to Windows Vista:

<p>1. There are not add-ons to IE on my computer</p>
<p>2. I already run MS Security Essentials and it is up to date</p>
<p>3. I created a new temp user account and went to the pages w/ links that opened in new windows with my 'real' user account. The temp account resulted in all links opening in new tabs in the same window. I'm now going to follow "b)" of your Method 3 and will
 update this reply.</p>

<p>Surely it should be down to Microsoft to find a solution to their crap programming that is causing this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi Steve, as you have mentioned you have little knowledge of how to fix the computer, I am just going to assume you are referring to the public release of windows. As Cal54 has mentioned, the release version 16299 Fall Creator Update works just fine and
 I have it running on several computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be something else that you have installed lately that could be causing your issue. Have you run complete virus checks lately. Without more information, we cannot really help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just hoping that you have not joined the Insider Program if you do not even understand what the windows.old folder is for and about. Please go to Settings\System and scroll down to the bottom to About and let us know what OS build you are running.</p>

<h2>            How to transfer photos from Lumia 950 to iMac</h2>
                    <p>I cannot figure out how to transfer photos from my Lumia 950 to iMac. Of course there is a slow way - uploading the files to OneDrive or transfering it via Bluetooth. I would rather prefer the fast way - connecting the phone to iMac with data cable and copying
 the files. However the Nokia Photo Transfer does not work for my Nlumia 950. It work only with my older Lumia 640 which is still running on 8.1</p>
<p>Could anybody please help me with this issue? Thank you!</p>

            Do you have the Apple Photos app? I plugged my Lumia 950XL into my iMac and it came up automatically and imported photos with no problems. What model iMac are you using, and what version of OS X?

            <p>I just got a lumia 950 and noticed the same thing, &nbsp;"Photos" app pops up and sees the phone but no photos or videos. &nbsp;it tried the old nokia lumia photo transfer program but that doesn't appear to work with the 950, as no device is detected by it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there is a way to plug it in via the cable and transfer photos and videos. &nbsp;(its possible to save to just and sd card but opening the phone case, taking off the back overtime isn't really a viable solution. &nbsp;) &nbsp;For large amounts of photos or large
 videos, uploading to the cloud really doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there is a tool somewhere to do this?? &nbsp;(windows phone software that was on the app store no longer exists since it doesn't work with el capitan).</p>

            for now i'm using the app <strong>Feem</strong>. &nbsp;its free for the iphone. &nbsp;as long as you transfer over a fast network, like over a 5ghz N network or better it transfers files really quickly without needing to plug in a cable. &nbsp;Feel also is supported
 on windows mac even linux i believe. &nbsp;can also send entire folders from your sd card if you want to transfer something else besides your photos and videos.

<p>Purchase commander one pro.... it will enable you to see all your files on your lumia (incl SD card) and copy them to your mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to do the same with your iPhone purchase it from their website, otherwise buy it from iTunes.</p>

    <title>Office 2010 &#40;Excel&#41; deletes buttons linked to macros - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 2010 &#40;Excel&#41; deletes buttons linked to macros</h2>
                    <p>Dear community</p>
<p>
</p><p>At our school, a colleague has written a rather comprehensive solution for storing and managing student's grades, which is completely relying on Excel and macros. This Excel file (.xlsm format) contains macros which perform certain tasks (like sorting students
 in alphabetical order, adapting the grading scheme to a certain type of class, creating printable lists for end-of-the-year reports etc.). Those macros are called by users using buttons integrated into the Excel file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, a problem is constantly occuring. On some of our computers, whenever you open that .xlsm file with Excel 2010, all the buttons disappear. The macros themselves stay in the file, but the buttons linked to them are just gone. What's worse, if you save
 the file on one of those computers, the buttons are gone for good, they are not there even on computers which normally do not show this problem.</p>
<p>It's quite hard for me to pinpoint the problem, as our IT network is rather homogenous, we don't have too many types of computers. All workstations have Excel 2010 (32 bits), and there's only three types of operating systems: WinXP (32bit), Win7 (32bit)
 and Win7 (64bit). The problem only occurs on computers running Win7 (64bit), which, by the way, are the latest models we have. However, Win7 64 alone can't be the problem, as we also have computers with Win7 64 bits where the problem never occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit at loss here on where to start looking for the problem, as I don't know too much about Excel, macros and buttons (for instance, how exactly are macros and the corresponding buttons stored within an Excel file? Compressed? Encrypted?; when an Excel
 file with macros is opened, how are they loaded into memory? all of them at once, or just the bit which is needed etc.?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if somebody reads this who knows quite a deal about macros, it would be nice if I could get some advice on what might be causing the problem, even vague assumptions would be helpful, just to get me started finding out what's causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peter Sicklinger</p>

CommandButton9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommandButton<br />
CommandButton10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommandButton<br />
CommandButton5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommandButton</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the controls that have been lost from ExampleClass2 between (working) and (broken) are:</p>
<p>CommandButton10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommandButton<br />
CommandButton11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommandButton<br />
CommandButton12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommandButton<br />
CommandButton13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommandButton<br />
CommandButton14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommandButton<br />
CommandButton15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommandButton<br />
L√∂schButton&nbsp;&nbsp; CommandButton<br />
ToggleButton1 ToggleButton<br />
ComboBox4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ComboBox<br />
CommandButton16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommandButton</p>
<p>
</p><p>The numbering would suggest they were added more recently but I can't see any clues as to why they should have been lost and not others.&nbsp; For example, the properties of the "Tag" buttons in columns Q to U (which have been deleted) are the same as those of
 the Tag buttons in C to H which have not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My original guess about 0 height objects can be discounted, by the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the moment I am running out of time to look further at this. <br />
If I had this problem I guess I would next be trying to make more checks into what differs between the machines on which buttons are lost and those on which they are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does using Excel in safe mode on the bad machines solve the problem? (Hold down Ctrl while opening Excel)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck, and do let us know if you make any useful discoveries.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5800 - Can&#39;t access internet</h2>
                    My daughter recently bought a Nokia 5800 and when she tries to access the internet, either through 3G connect or LAN, she gets a Memory full error.&nbsp; Checking the internal memory and memory card, there is plenty of memory available.&nbsp; Has any else had this
 problem?

<p>The memory the phone is referring to isn't the storage memory, but the RAM. If it happens every single time she tries to use the internet then there is more than likely a problem with the phone - try checking for the latest firmware by going to
<strong>menu &gt; settings &gt; phone &gt; phone mgmt. &gt; device updates &gt; options &gt; check for updates</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She could also try closing some applications if she has a lot running. Applications that are running have a little swirl symbol at the top right hand corner of their icons. To close most applications, you need to go to options and then close/exit from within
 the application.</p>

<h2>            QAT &#8211; &#8220;New&#8221; or ctrl-N with template</h2>
                    <p>When I use the ‚ÄúNew‚Äù button on the QAT or keyboard shortcut ctrl-N to create a new workbook I would like Excel to pick-up a default template which contains all my settings and
 standard VBA (as I had it in previous Excel versions by placing a template called ‚Äúbook.xlt‚Äù in the ‚ÄúDocuments and Settings\userID\Application Data\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART‚Äù folder)</p>
<p>The thing I want to avoid is, having to go through a template-selection dialogue when using the Office button / New / Templates.</p>
<p>I have already experimented with creating a macro and assigning that to a QAT button but if the workbook containing that macro is not open, the macro won‚Äôt work.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my knowledge, Office 2007 and earlier aren't compatible with Windows 10. It will not work properly with Office 2016 applications from Office 365 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your Visio 2003 product, I suggest you can install the latest version Visio product to work with Windows 10 and Office 2016.&nbsp;Additionally, if you are using Office 2016 with Click-to-run version, please note that we can't install Office with Click-to-Run
 and Windows Installer on same computer:</p>

    <title>Editing Points and Snapping &#40;to grid or to other objects&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ged sparrowhawk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Editing Points and Snapping &#40;to grid or to other objects&#41;</h2>
                    In PowerPoint I am trying to draw custom shapes.&nbsp; I can create other shapes as guides and get these to snap together, then I try and draw around them to get my custom shape.&nbsp; Unfortunately, either when adding a new shape or when "editing points" I cannot
 get the points I add to snap to the grid or to other objects.&nbsp; This makes my custom shapes look messy, particularly since they do not have lines that are exactly vertical or horizontal, and it is also difficult to create shapes that "jigsaw" together.&nbsp; In
 older versions, I used to be able to get the points to snap to grid on creation, even though I never managed to get them to snap if I were adjusting them later, so would often draw a new shape over an old one to ensure all the points were correctly snapped
 to grid points to ensure it looked good.

            OK, I see what you mean now. When you drag a point the movement is continuous as if snap to grid were not turned on. &nbsp;I'm not sure if it is a bug or by design, but you can let Microsoft know you would like the behavior changed by telling them at this URL:

            Hi samirhmada,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Check whether the contact is blocked by you by mistake
<br />v8 - Right Click on the contact / Chat &gt; View profile &gt; Scroll down and at the end you have Block Contact
<br />
<br />2. Check whether your caller ID is set up or not - <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is...</a>?
<br />
<br />3. If the problem still exists,  You should chat with a live agent from Skype Support on this issue.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Not all options will allow you to chat with a live agent. Select following one from the categories dropdown to get the option for chat.
<br />
<br />Payments &amp; purchases
<br />Account, profile &amp; sign-in
<br />Privacy &amp; security
<br />
<br />On the next screen, you get the Chat link which you can click.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da3e2103-6595-4e4a-ab8d-d8aef95c460b?upload=true" />

            Login using your Microsoft account on microsoftstore.com.&nbsp; Click your name on the top portion of the page then select digital content.&nbsp; You should find a button that says manage install, click that then it will direct you to myaccount page, under install
 you should find other devices, select ipad, then select the option to download on apps tore, it will open app store that will give you the option to get Word, get Excel, etc.&nbsp; you have to download each apps separately.&nbsp;

Hope these work, Cheers!

<h2>            Can&#39;t copy and paste text on Mobile 6.5</h2>
                    Just got an AT&amp;T HTC Pure with Windows Mobile 6.5 OS and can't copy and paste like I use to do with previous phone running under previous versions of Windows Mobile OS.&nbsp; Before, I could be in email, text messages, basically anywhere with selectable text
 - select the text, or other items like&nbsp;calenders appointments (anything selectable), then hold the stylist atop the selection and have the edit menu appear.&nbsp; Now I can't get a menu to appear ANYWHERE!&nbsp; How am I suppose to be able to select and copy text in
 a text message and paste it in an interent&nbsp;browser text box when the security procedure for a website is to text you a security code (among any number of over a trillion applications that copy and paste is applicable on a computering device)?&nbsp; Am I missing
 something here?&nbsp; Is there a setting or something?

            This is how it works on my WM6.5 IPAQ and my WM6.5 HTC Touch Diamond2:<br />
<br />
I press &amp; hold the stylus on the screen where I want to select text until a popup menu appears,<br />
I choose "Make Selection" from the popup menu.<br />
Then I drag my stylus down the page and highlight the text I want to copy.&nbsp; <br />
After I've highlighted everything I want to copy, I press &amp; hold my stylus again on the screen and choose "Copy" from the popup menu.

<h2>            Sync calendar on Windows 8 phone with Outlook 2013 on my PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lumia 625 phone and Windows 8 PC with Office 365 Small Business.&nbsp; I use POP for email&nbsp; - I have 3 URLs and&nbsp; websites with 1and1 and I retrieve the associated emails using Outlook 2013 on my laptop..</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Office 365 account email ends in onmicrosoft.com and I know there are instructions to replace with with a pre-existing email but when I requested the IP address I got a very offputting reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use Windows Live or Outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there a way of syncing the calendar on my phone with the one on my PC or not?&nbsp; I hoped I could use Outlook on my phone the same as on my PC but have ended up in desperation adding the email accounts separately again</p>
<p>
</p><p>However until my phone and PC calendars sync, my PAPER Filofax remains my single main content source which is silly in 2014</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are so many threads with advice that I am losing the will to live</p>
<p>

            <p>Windows Phone only syncs directly to an online calendar.&nbsp; The online calendar can be a part of an Outlook.com, Live.com, Hotmail.com account or it can be related to a 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you also use Outlook 2013 on a computer to manage your calendar, you need to sync that calendar to an online calendar that can be accessed synced to a Windows Phone.&nbsp; Calendars that are stored in the personal folder within Outlook 2013 do not sync any
 where and will never be syncable to an online Calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use a 365 account, you can set it up to sync to Outlook 2013 and to a windows phone.&nbsp; In both cases, you'll set up an account (in both Outlook 2013 and on Windows Phone) that uses the same user name and password that you use when you log into the
 365 account via a computer browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you set up the 365 account within Outlook 2013, a folder gets created in the software that includes Calendar, Contacts, etc.&nbsp; Add any new calendar entries to the Calendar in that folder. Copy any calendar entries that are currently stored in the Calendar
 in your personal folder to the 365 Calendar.&nbsp; Any calendar entries that are stored in the Calendar in the 365 folder&nbsp; will sync online to your 365 account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When you set up the 365 account on the phone, again, using the same user name &amp; password that you used when you set it up in Outlook 2013 and that you use when you log into it from a computer browser, any Calendar entries that have been synced from Outlook
 2013 to the online 365 calendar will be synced to the phone.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The software does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it has denied me facilities which I used before the "Compulsory Upgrade", Microsoft needs to fix or replace my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried restoring it to the previous version, but that was ineffectual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can"t even use Facebook properly any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However as mentioned, I will not be a "test pilot" for Microsoft products. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Nor am I going to spend more time at my own expense to resolve problems caused by incompetent software developers relying on "the community" to test and correct their products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pay an annual License Fee to Microsoft for products that are proven to operate as promised in my contract with Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want me to me more specific about the issues confronting me, my fee is $US150.00 per hour or part thereof.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem about the limited use of my PC since this upgrade was installed. Restore my PC: refund my 2018 Subscription, and give a credit for 2019, and I will let the matter rest there.</p>

<p>365 is a subscription licence type and updates are rolled out when they are made available, and when the next office version is made available your version will upgrade to the new one, assuming the subscription is still current.</p>
<p>You applied for/purchased a subscription licence no one forced you.</p>
<p>Its still not entirely clear what problem you have, I cannot say that I have any problems with 365 on multiple PC's&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for describing my disappointment with the Compulsory Upgrade for Windows 10 as as "Rant with no clear context".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate such feedback, and therefore will try to explain to you in non IT terms, why I believe the terms and conditions of my annual subscription to MS Office, (which comes under under the heading of "Windows 10" that I purchased with the computer and
 registered with Microsoft),&nbsp; are no longer being met by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently my computer was updated by Microsoft's compulsory update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then my computer does not operate to the standards it did before the update. Why - I don't know, and would need to engage someone to research the reasons for this. Hence my fee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have researched the matter through the MS community and YOUTUBE and found many tales of such disappointment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pay an annual fee for my MS products to ensure that my home business is able to rely on up to date and reliable software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This recent upgrade has now limited my capacity to use my PC as it was before the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has cost me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to restore that PC to the previous version but that was ineffectual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want three things to resolve the matter:</p>
<ul>
<li>my computer restored to the condition it was in before the compulsory upgrade</li><li>a refund of my 2018 subscription because the software no longer works as it should; and</li><li>a credit for my 2019 subscription to compensate for the problems this "Compulsory Upgrade" has caused.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that as a Volunteer Moderator, you should also temper you language.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>After a long search, I eventually found the AutoFormat As You Type dialogue box, where I had the facility checked.&nbsp; When I unchecked it, yes it removed the problem.&nbsp; However, I regularly use bulleted lists and I don't want to keep toggling this facility
 on and off.&nbsp; I tried the Help page connected to this option (the little "?" at the top right of the dialogue box) but this no longer appears to work in Word 2010.&nbsp; In Word 2003, the "?" brings up a dedicated commentary on each option, so I can find out more
 about how this is supposed to be used.&nbsp; No such help available in Word 2010, unfortunately, it seems.</p>
<p>The Ctrl+Z option does appear to do the trick however.&nbsp; I thought Undo was just to undo the last action, but it seems to kill the AutoFormat function altogether.&nbsp; I haveonly tried it once, so I may be wrong (and will practise it more, now I know about it),
 but this appears to solve the need for "toggling" referred to above without having to click through a long path to find the Proofing dialogue box.</p>
<p>So this is the best solution for me.&nbsp; I am grateful for your time and trouble.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
The Help in Word 2010 is extensive but, as always it may be difficult to get the answer you want. Pressing F1 will also bring up Help. The question mark at top right of the Ribbon should work. (I missed it the first five months or so of using the program, too.)<br />
<br />
I never use these AutoFormat as you type conversions. The ones for lists do not get you lists linked to styles, which is still the only way to get stable numbering in Word. (This goes for multi-level bullets as well.)<br />

                    <p>Last week our organization has been plagued with people constantly being prompted for Windows Security Microsoft Outlook credentials.&nbsp; We found that if you removed the stored credentials in the credential manager and then open Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft
 Office 365 ProPlus, it will prompt for your credentials once and once for the Microsoft Windows Search Protocol Host credentials and then it works fine but it is intermittent.&nbsp; It may last an hour or a day.&nbsp; Any idea why this is happening?&nbsp; Please let me know.</p>

<p>Hi Elvis,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, Outlook keeps asking credentials, you can use SaRA tool to check whether it can be fixed:

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists after run SaRA tool, I‚Äôd like to confirm the following information to better understand your situation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Issue happens to all users in your organization, or just happens to specific users?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What is the full version numbers of Outlook you use? And the client is Office 365 Business or Office 365 ProPlus? Have you tried updating Outlook client, issue persists?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Please provide a full screenshot of that prompt Outlook credential windows.</p>

 middle of updating everyone's version to 1809.10827.20181 but I don't have the steps to complete this as we are using a server path and not Microsoft online.&nbsp; I have everyone's registry path setup now but I don't have the steps to download the cab files to
 the update path.&nbsp; Would you happen to know how I would go about getting these instructions?&nbsp; Sorry we don't have SCCM in our environment :(</p>

<p>Coldwell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to implement these steps only if the upgrade to the latest version of Office doesn't work.&nbsp; I have upgraded several workstations so far and they haven't reported the issue since.&nbsp; So now I am looking for the step to download the latest version
 of MS Office 365 ProPlus for a server path.&nbsp; If you have the step or know where to get them it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>stop keyboard from showing in Excel for iPad when using barcode - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            stop keyboard from showing in Excel for iPad when using barcode reader&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I'm using Excel for ipad, entering inventory items using a bluetooth barcode reader. Everything was going great, but now every time I scan a barcode, the keyboard inside excel pops up, and causes extra characters to be added to the barcode input (for example,
 the part number is CH48110-1... but if i scan it 5 consecutive times, they start doing this</p>
<p>CH48110-1</p>
<p>CH48110-1</p>
<p>CH48110-1-1</p>
<p>CH48110-1-1</p>
<p>CH48110-1-1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to prevent the keyboard from popping up when i'm using a bluetooth barcode scanner and excel for ipad?</p>
