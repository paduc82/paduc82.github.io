<h2>            Windows Update Error&#58; Code 80070426</h2>
                    Windows wont let me update anything unless it is a security definition update for Windows Defender. I have Windows Vista Home Basic.<br />
I have checked my services to see if Software Licensing was running and it is. Please help!! I have ran Check Disk and that did nothing. PLEASE HELP! I am unable to install ANY updates unless its updates for Windows Defender's Definitions.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>Hello Wes,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums. <br />
<br />
This problem occurs if the Software Licensing service (Slsvc.exe) is not running while updating windows.</p>
<p><br />

services.msc</strong> in the search box and then click on <strong>Services</strong> under Programs section of the search results on top pane.</p>
<p>2. If User Account Control asks your permission to continue, click <strong>Continue</strong>. If UAC asks for administratorâ€™s password, enter a valid password.</p>
<p>3. Scroll down the list to the service <strong>Software Licensing</strong> and double-click it.</p>
<p>4. In the properties window of the Software Licensing service, set <strong>Startup type</strong> to
<strong>Automatic</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Start</strong> to start the service. If the status is already running, click the
<strong>Stop</strong> button and confirm with <strong>Yes</strong> to stop the service. Restart the service by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button.</p>
<p>6. Click OK to exit from Software Licensingâ€™s Properties window and close the Services window.</p>

<h2>            All data in downloads folder has been moved&#47;deleted not by me</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned on my desktop today to notice all my files in my downloads folder were missing. This folder is on my external drive. I had very important files on there for work. I have learned I should not have left them in the downloads folder. However, these
 files were all deleted and not by me. Was this my system? Was I hacked somehow? Is there any way to check to see how these were deleted? This is actually scaring me... ran a virus search and nothing. However, when I attempt to locate the missing files, the
 key word 'STOLEN' appears pre-typed into the search bar. Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: As well, when I try "open containing folder", it kicks me to This PC &gt; Documents, which obviously is not where they are, and never were.</p>

<h3> -cookie-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Bad System Config</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>yesterday I upgraded to windows 10 and kept all my files from the previous version of windows (7) and then today when i was in my game of Counter Strike I was in full screen mode. Normally in windows 7 in this case by hitting the windows button you would
 be able to get out of the game to check your internet or desktop etc. But in windows 10 you have to hit ctrl alt delete and then open up the task manager to get yourself back to the desktop then close down task manager. While I was in my game I decided to
 check my emails. But when hitting ctrl alt delete nothing happend for 20 seconds and you could tell windows wasn't responding or something as normally when you hit ctrl alt delete it might have taken 5 seconds and then it would have finally come up. I thought
 this was very weird but I just restarted the computer as that was all I could do. But upon restarting the computer i got the sad face and the "bad system config" error and then of course i was lept into the automatic repair which is absolutely hopeless. I
 have tried every option including reseting windows and keeping my files and other various options. Everything doesn't do anything and says it has a problem where then i'm just left with an end less loop through the windows repair. I would love some answers
 to this problem or at least some suggestions would be helpfull</p>
<p>thankyou</p>

    <title>Xbox App On Windows 10&#58; Party Chat is Always Blocked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raspberry tech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox App On Windows 10&#58; Party Chat is Always Blocked</h2>
                    Hi. I just recently got a pc and I was always playing with my friends on Xbox One before. So thankfully I could keep talking to them over the Xbox app on my pc while they were still on Xbox. It worked fine for about a week, and then suddenly every time
 I tried to join a party it would say I was connecting for about 15 seconds and then it would say I'm disconnected along with text saying "Your network settings are blocking party chat." and [0x89234013]. I've been on the Microsoft support site for that specific
 problem and tried all the possible solutions. Nothing worked. Also I tried connecting to parties on the Xbox app on my phone and it worked perfectly, so I'm pretty sure it isn't my router or anything, even though my connection isn't amazing (10Mbps download,
 0.8Mbps upload). I'm thinking it could be caused by something I downloaded like a vpn service (which is never on when I try to join parties) or something like that. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

            Hi briandarcy,
<br />
<br />If by the RE partition you mean the Windows 10 Recovery Partition:
<br />
<br />If you have deleted everything except for the RE partition, you have wiped your Windows System from your PC and it will need to be re-installed.
<br />
<br />The RE partition is for repairing Windows 10, it cannot be used to install Windows, if the Windows installation does not exist on the system partition . .. 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<p>Step 1:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the Windows 10 ISO in Ubuntu Linux, see steps how to do that:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/24-how-to-download-the-latest-windows-10-iso-files-directly-using-your-web-browser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Windows 10 ISO Files Directly Using Your Web Browser</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After downloading the ISO file for Windows 10 in Ubuntu Linux, you need to make a bootable copy:</p>
<p>Create Bootable Windows 10 Install Media Using Unetbootin </p>
<p>Unetbootin can be downloaded from the Software Center in Ubuntu. Once you have it up and running, launch it. Make sure you are using a thumb drive with at least 8 GBs of free space.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.groovypost.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f10%2fStep-1-Unetbootin-640x135.png" height="135" width="640" /></p>
<p>Select the <strong>Disk Image</strong> radio box, click the browse button (represented by an ellipsis â€¦), browse to the ISO file then click
<strong>Open</strong>. Chose the medium from the <em>Type</em> list boxâ€”in this case, your USB drive. Click in the drive list box then select your USB thumb drive.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.groovypost.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f10%2fStep-2-Unetbootin.png" height="390" width="526" /></p>
<div>
<div style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note: If you are not offered the option to select your thumb drive, you need to format it using the FAT32 file system. Open the file manager, right-click the thumb drive then click Format.</div>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>, then wait while the bootable copy is created.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.groovypost.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f10%2fStep-3-Unetbootin.png" height="390" width="526" /></p>
<p>When complete, click <strong>Exit</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.groovypost.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f10%2fStep-4-Unetbootin.png" height="390" width="526" /></p>
Create Bootable Windows 10 Install Media Using Brasero
<p>If you already made a bootable USB with Unetbootin, you can skip this part. If you are still using an old school system with a DVD drive, you can use the Brasero DVD Burning software, which you can download from the Software Center also. Please keep in mind,
 Windows 10 ISO files are getting larger beyond the standard 4.7 GB DVDs. So, in some cases, itâ€™s best you use 8.5 GB dual-layer DVDs if supported by your drive. If you canâ€™t, then itâ€™s best you use a USB thumb drive.</p>
<p>In Brasero, click <strong>Burn Image</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.groovypost.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f10%2fStep-5-Brasero-640x378.png" height="378" width="640" /></p>
<p>Select your disc image, make sure a blank DVD disc is inserted then click <strong>
Burn</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.groovypost.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f10%2fStep-6-Brasero.png" height="219" width="455" /></p>
<p>After preparing your install media, insert it or connect it. Reboot your computer, then
<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
configure your BIOS</a> to boot from the drive. Windows 10 will boot into setup as it normally does.</p>

<p>Thanks man, your info worked with a<strong> few minor tweeks...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't get <strong>unetbootin</strong> to work from Ubuntu 18s(the most recent) software center(don't remember what it said). I downloaded unetbootin using the command line as described here http://unetbootin.github.io/linux_download.html .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had to use<strong> gparted</strong> in order to partition the USB flash-drive to fat32 because the disks utility in Ubuntu would't create a recognizable USB for unetbootin. Once i used gparted on linuxmint, I went back to Ubuntu and retried unetbootin,
 flash-drive was recognized and all went beautifully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for the proper direction..much appreciated.</p>

            First make sure that your system is clean:<br />
<p>perform scan using</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a>
</p>
<p>Make sure ur system is clean first. use ccleaner to get rid of junkfiles <a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download</a></p>
<p>also check for viruses i.e. using Avast free <a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</a>&nbsp; (I recommand)or if you have anti virus make sure it is uptodate! For better and uptodate recommendation please go to my antiviruses page in my blog!<br />
</p>
<p>and spyware i.e. using superantispyware <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a> try using portable version so you don't have to install</p>
<p>you could also use this one <a href="http://www.emsisoft.com/en/software/eek/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><br />
</p>
<p>If above solved your problem then you do not need to continue.. if it did not then<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now, The Catalyst Control Center is the host application software for your graphic driver by AMD.</p>
<p>Consider re-installing or Updating your Graphic driver through either Device Manager or software provided by your PC manufacturer OR download the latest version from your PC manufacturer support website or AMD website and install it again manually.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If above did not help then...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>go to msconfig (type in searchbox in startmenu or run in xp then press enter) then prepare your pc for clean boot by disabling all startup items and NONE windows services then restart your computer. See if it make a difference? if it did then you have to
 find out which ones caused the problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Tip: Do not disable the Catalyst Control Center from startup item .... but disable others and see if the problem solved? if it did then you have to find the conflicting program or service that has caused the problem....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

    <title>Cannot remove folders from the user folder after changing the location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> corneloues  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot remove folders from the user folder after changing the location using the correct method in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I have followed the required process of moving a users files by right-clicking on the icon, selecting the Location tab and selecting the new folder (move from C: to E:).<br />
<br />
However on completion of the process the folders <strong>Music</strong>, <strong>
Pictures</strong> and <strong>Videos</strong> remain in the original user folder on the system drive.<br />
<br />
Any attempt to move the folders results in an "Access Denied" error. Checking the security settings on the folders reveal that Windows is "Unable to display current owner." Any attempt to reset the owner to the&nbsp;single user account, or the administrators group,&nbsp;on
 the PC results in a further access denied error claiming "Unable to set new owner on &lt;Folder&gt;".<br />
<br />
These folders also still appear in the users personal folder window resulting in two possible locations where files could be stored.<br />
<br />
This is a fresh install of Windows 7 64-Bit (only 2 hours ago). No files have been restored on the PC, the only additional programs installed are:<br />
<br />
AVG Free 9.0<br />
Smart Defrag (IOBit)<br />
<br />

            Smart Defrag.. it sound like it would be responsible for disk defragmentation, am I right? Have you tried disable it and then change location?<br />
<br />

<br />
I disabled Smart Defrag, but it had no effect - pretty much as I expected as it appears to be a permissions issue.<br />
<br />
That's right, when you seelct the &lt;username&gt; from the start menu an explorer windows open with all the shortcuts to "My Documents", "My Music", "Favourites", etc, etc. And even though I have moved them all, the three fodlers that I can't remove still appear
 in this view.<br />
<br />
Although they are now just called "Music" instead of "My Music", for example, and only have a folder icon as opposed to the "Music" icon.<br />
<br />
I tried restarting after I moved the folders to see if it was a residual permissions issue from the re-location. However that didn't work either.<br />
<br />
I think the clue is in the fact that Windows reports that is "Unable to display current owner."<br />
<br />

            I guess you were unable to move AppData (Local, LocalRow, Roaming). As far as I know you can't move these folders. These are system folders of your user, it contains most personal data of your application.<br />
<br />
When you open your personal folder through Start &gt; UserName it doesn't mean that you found doubled files. It's just some kind of 'shortcuts' which point out to it's real location at C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%<br />
<br />
<blockquote>However on completion of the process the folders <strong>Music</strong> ,
<strong>Pictures</strong> and <strong>Videos</strong> remain in the original user folder on the system drive.</blockquote>
You said that they remain in original user folder. It means where? Were they still visible at C:\Users\%USERPROFILE% ? Or maybe only through Start &gt; UserName? What have you seen after completion of the process in mentioned Location tab? Also.. where were you
 trying to move them - another hard drive or maybe external usb drive?<br />

<p>Maybe this will make things clearer. I was not attempting to move the AppData folder (although a wholesale move of a users data would be nice -&nbsp;I digress).</p>

<p>This screenshot shows the folders that remain in the c:\users\&lt;username&gt; folder
<strong>AFTER</strong> the re-location. Note the <em>Tracing</em> folder appeared after installing Windows Live Messenger and this folder
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.corneloues.co.uk%2fwin7%2fE+Brian.bmp" />
<p>This screenshot shows the folders that have been relocated. All are in the root of E: as this drive will be dedicated to this user.</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.corneloues.co.uk%2fwin7%2fUser+Brian.bmp" />
<p>This screenshot shows the explorer window that appears when you click the &lt;username&gt; on the Start Menu. Notice the "Music" and "My Music" folders. The same for Pictures and Videos.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

            These folders "Music", "Pictures", "Videos" must have something common with Libraries. I'm confused because they shouldn't be displayed directly in your user folder. I will try to find out what might be the reason.<br />
<br />
or maybe I was wrong.. nothing common with Libraries... that names made me confused.<br />
<br />
Have you noticed that these folders are shared? They are folders for Default user. They should be located only here C:\Users\Default

            I've just double checked the libraries, only the new re-located folders and the public folders are included in the appropriate libraries.<br />
<br />
The folders on the c: are not included in any library.<br />
<br />
Thanks for looking in to this.<br />

            OK... at this topic you should find a solution: <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/music-pictures-video/23467-default-user-locations-duplicate-folders.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 7 - Default User Locations - Duplicate Folders</a> <br />
<br />
and it looks like that the only thing you need to do is to open Properties of these folders &gt; uncheck Read Only, and you will be able to delete these folders ("C:\Users\username was read only, that's why it wouldn't delete"). But I think you may look here first
<strong>C:\Users\Default</strong> because I have strange impression that they were moved from there to your user personal folder... or maybe doubled because folders for Default User are shared, and these one which appeared in your folder are shared too.

            OK. Looked at that and did the following:<br />
<br />
Went to c:\users<br />
Right-clicked on user (Brian) folder<br />
Unchecked "read only"<br />
Answered "yes" to the request to apply to all sub-folders and files<br />
<br />
A status popup showed the progress through these changes including all the filess in the AppData folder.<br />
<br />
As soon as it hit the "Music" folder an Access Denied popup appeared. Retry did nothing. On Ignore I go the same error for Pictures and Videos.<br />
<br />
I still think it has something to do with Windows&nbsp;being "Unable to display current owner." which is the message on the Properties-&gt;Security-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Owner tab.<br />
<br />
Back to square one...<br />

<h2>            Black bar appears in the external monitor when connected to a laptop.</h2>
                    <p>original title: Display problems connecting to monitor</p>
<p>When I connect to an external monitor, black bars appear on my laptop screen. The desktop etc&nbsp;resolution is&nbsp;to scale, but if you reduce the size of windows, they hide behind the black bars.</p>
<p>I've tried changing the screen resolution, and following the guides on this site for people that have trouble playing games, but nothing has worked so far. Is it possible to change the projection settings? Specifically to duplicate the screen.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

The reason why the Apps are not shown on the Start Screen is because; they are not pinned to the Start Screen of the computer. Usually when an App is installed on the computer, they are by default pinned to the Start Screen. But, once they are unpinned, they
 will be never shown on the Start Screen and then they will be accessible from the â€œAll App Menuâ€. To pin an App to the Start Menu, I would suggest you to refer to the article:<strong><span> â€œWhat happened to the apps
 on my PC?â€ </span></strong>from this link:<br />

            Is it listed under All Apps? to get there, right click on a blank area in the Start Screen and click All Apps. scroll until you see a category called Microsoft Office. from there you can pin them.

            Hi Thomas,
<div>Did you select the option to save your settings, personal files and apps while upgrading to Windows8?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you did custom installation of Windows 8, you will have to reinstall Office. Office programs have to be
<div>installed on the operating system thatâ€™s currently running on the computer, so that it can function correctly.<br />
<div>If you had purchased a retail copy of Office and have the product key you may download the setup file for Office 2010 from the below link to install the program.<br />
<div><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-office-2010-backup-FX101853122.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-office-2010-backup-FX101853122.aspx</a><br />
<br />
If you do not have the disc or lost the product key then you may refer the below link to know to 'How to get a replacement for the lost Product key':<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check the screenshot attached, which shows the Integrated webcam drivers are upto date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that I don't have any issues with Webcam as I use the same for different apps such as Skype, Facebook Messenger Video calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just the problem with Window Hello Setup.</p>

<p>The reason why you're recommending you to update the webcam driver is because the driver can be the reason why Windows Hello cannot access the webcam. By visiting the manufacturer's website of your computer, you will be able to check if there is an updated
 driver for the webcam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the webcam is working working with other apps, there may be an issue with your current user profile. For us to verify if the issue is with your user account or not, we recommend

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Primary reason is outdated drivers, so we suggest that not just update your camera driver but visit your manufacturers website or forum for more information. Also, please try following the steps provided by Argel Obm regarding creating a new administrator
 account.</p>

</p><p>If that doesn't do it, you may conduct a system restore see if the issue still persists. I suggest that you update the drivers again before conducting a Windows update. You can follow steps for system restore on this article:

<p>The reason why you're recommending you to update the webcam driver is because the driver can be the reason why Windows Hello cannot access the webcam. By visiting the manufacturer's website of your computer, you will be able to check if there is an updated
 driver for the webcam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the webcam is working working with other apps, there may be an issue with your current user profile. For us to verify if the issue is with your user account or not, we recommend

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per my previous response [with Screenshot], the webcam driver is upto date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now tried uninstalling the Integrated Webcam driver, restarted my PC. Windows 10 has automatically detected and installed the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Hello is now working fine and I have setup the same on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it doesn't cause any further problems . I will check the consistency of the solution and come back to you if there are any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Making video full screen in Edge &#40;projected to TV&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My setup: 950XL is connected to Display Dock for keyboard and mouse, but I have the display connected wirelessly to an HDMI dongle.&nbsp; There is already a little hiccup with that (the desktop hangs off all 4 edges of the screen, so I can't see everything) but
 generally it looks good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can run Edge and go to youtube, and watch videos no problem EXCEPT if I try to make the video fullscreen, it will cover the top left quarter of the screen and the rest is blank.&nbsp; I can see the mouse in the blank parts of the screen, so nothing hugely weird
 is happening; it just declines to use the whole screen.&nbsp; Has anyone else seen this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello EEPotter, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I tried to respond via Continuum but it crashed the webpage. No worries as we know this feature is being developed. Switched to PC to make this post.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too had the same issue and this is what I did to resolve it. The good&nbsp;team&nbsp;at Microsoft should still look at this issue. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>YouTube</p>
<p>Press Full Screen within the YouTube video</p>
<p>See Below: </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82abc2f4-0d67-4976-bae2-3f7c7d5be0e0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82abc2f4-0d67-4976-bae2-3f7c7d5be0e0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if you have YouTube in <strong>Theater mode </strong>then press <strong>Full Screen
</strong>then thevideo responds as it should. May the Force be with you. Thanks for all your hard Work Microsoft.
</p>
<p>See Below:</p>

            <p>Thanks Todd. This worked, though interestingly only if I go to Theater Mode first, then Full Screen. If I do it the other way around, it will expand from a quarter of the screen to about half, but no more. Odd.</p>

here</a> with a bonehead question) - if I&nbsp;tap Full Screen first and then Theater Mode, not only does it only expand to about half of the screen, but the Full Screen and Theater Mode buttons quit doing anything useful, so I can't get out of that mode without
 just hitting the â† button on the taskbar.&nbsp; Eh.</p>

<p>Only 7 hours? I'm guessing you only did the bare minimum exploration, farming, crew recruitment etc right? Not saying it's bad or anything, just curious as the shortest it's taken me to finish ME2 is about 20 hours or so (have the habit of always doing extra

<p>21 Hours with Level 30 Soldier on 2nd playthrough. I did the bear minimum, no side missions, just main storyline and loyalty missions, no DLCs. &nbsp;Only mined resources when needed. &nbsp;The toughest spots were the Praetorian on Horizon, the platform battle on
 the collector ship, the Praetorian on the Collector ship, and the Clan Guld Clan Speaker on Tuchanka (the Vorcha and Krogan coming down the stairs had nothing but good angles on me and the team). &nbsp;But seriously, after the platform battle on the Collector Ship,
 everything after that wasn't that bad.</p>

<p>insanity really forced me to use cover and focus on keeping my distance from almost every enemy type. i hate the collector base platforms and the praetors too: difficulty spikes are something bioware needs to keep an eye on for ME3</p>
<p>on a lighter note i chewed thru mass effect on insanity for the first time in 2 years, not sure how long it took tho. imma start an insanity run today and see if i can chew thru the game in less than 8hrs, sounds like.. wel, not like fun</p>

<p>You can get through Mass Effect in under 8 hours if you skip conversations and take the shortcuts in quests. Such as in Noveria, simply turn in Olaplod to the Administrator and you cn get a garage pass straight away.</p>

<h2>            Xtecnologies Grip&#62;Explorer Gamepad, Driver needed.</h2>

                    <span>
<p><strong>I have bought Grip&gt;Explorer gamepad manufactured by Xtecnologies of Italy. The drivers for this gamepad is in a floppy disk and I accidently damaged it. Now I need drivers for the said gamepad for windows 7. Now when I connect it through USB, it
 shows "USB device Not Recognised" message and when I go to the Device Manager, there it shows an Unknown Device in the Tree. I cannot find the driver online. Please help me to sort this out. If you have any link for an appropriate driver software, please place
 it here. Thanks</strong></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I tried searching for the drivers for the game pad, but was not able to find anything related to that. I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer i.e Xtechnologies
 for further support.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have the manual that came along with the game pad, you can find the contact number of Xtechnologies in that manual. Contact them for support.</span></span></p>

<br />Can't find a reference to a model 1661. Do you have a link to this item? Is it <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/accessories/surface-dock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/accesso...</a> ? 
<br />
<br />Sounds like the dock is defective. You should return it to the seller for a full refund and repurchase. Don't EXCHANGE it. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Please DO mark as Answer if this was of assistance.

<br />
<br />
<br />If your Surface isn't charging while connected to Surface Dock
<br />
<br />Here are a few things to check:
<br />â€¢Check your power supply. Make sure that all the cords are securely connected and the LED indicator light on the Surface Dock is lit. Check your power strip if youâ€™re using one. Try plugging something else into your power outlet to make sure itâ€™s working properly.
<br />â€¢Remove the Surface Connector from your Surface, turn the connector over 180 degrees, and plug it in again. Make sure that the connection is secure and the indicator light is on.
<br />â€¢If you have accessories that draw power from your Surface Dock or Surface, remove them and see if your Surface charges.
<br />â€¢If youâ€™re still having problems, try resetting the power by unplugging your Surface Dock from the power outlet and plugging it back in.

                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an android phone and i want to import photos on my phone to my windows 10 pc.</p>
<p>On "My computer" i right click to my device and click to "import photos and videos". But its importing whole folders including app icons and system image files etc. Can i choose specific folder to import? I want to import only camera folder, not the entire
 device.</p>
<p>I know i can manually copy paste camera folder to my pc but i prefer doing this within "import photos and videos" because its creates folders day by day which is makes my job very easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can i import from specific folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks...</p>

<p>Hi Sinan,</p>
<p>

<h2>            I need help because I can not solve this problem</h2>
                    <pre>Hi. I have problems with the payment of my subscription to xbox live. I paid the same with a debit card that expired on 09/30/2017 and on 09/22/2017 they did not charge me the same and I canceled the subscription. To this date I have already updated the expiration date and I have not yet been able to qualify for the subscription. Please, I need a solution. Thank you</pre>

<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably<em> without</em> quoting my post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the computer?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. Did Win7 64-bit come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7,
<em>or did you upgrade from Vista to Win7? </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. How long has McAfee Security Center been installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Has any other&nbsp;McAfee application <em>or a Norton application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did a McAfee free-trial <em>or a Norton free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the (Vista?) computer
<em>when you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

</b></div>
<div>1a. December 2008 (approx)</div>
<div>1b. Upgraded from Vista. I am running 7 <i>Ultimate, </i>not Pro</div>
<div>1c. Yes, that's me--Dan in NJ. I tried starting this thread using Dan in NJ, but I could not log in so I created another pseudonym and account. Yes, it is the same computer. And to try to keep you from having to ask another question, that issue turned
 out to be due to a bad video memory card slot--the computer could not pass its own startup checks. I removed the card--problem solved.</div>
<div>2. McAfee Security Center has been installed/running since I got the computer.&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. No</div>
<div>4. Yes, the system came with (6 months?) of McAfee free from Dell. Since it did the job I just kept re-enlisting. I have never seen, installed, or used anything Norton on this machine.</div>

            <p>Fact:&nbsp;McAfee (and Norton) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not upgrading (or uninstalling) cleanly. Chances are the years' worth of McAfee leftovers is your troublemaker. Let's see if we can ease my esteemed&nbsp;colleague Susan's burden&nbsp;here and keep
 you&nbsp;out of&nbsp;Microsoft's outsourced, third-party&nbsp;tech support's evil clutches. &lt;wink&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roll up your sleeves, cross your fingers &amp; try the following multi-step fix I've cooked-up just for your computer...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACTIONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions for offline reference. IMPORTANT =&gt; DON'T SKIP ANY STEP
</strong>[other than #8 &amp; #9]<strong>&nbsp;&amp; perform all Steps in one, uninterrupted session! If a Step says to reboot,
<em>reboot!</em> ] </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Uninstall <strong>McAfee Security Center</strong> via <strong>Start | Control Panel | Programs |</strong><strong> Programs and Features</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. <strong>IMPORTANT! =&gt; Make sure the Windows Firewall is enabled <em>immediately</em> after rebooting!</strong> [Should happen automatically but I want you to doublecheck.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING <em>else</em> online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed Step #7 below!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Do a clean install of <strong>McAfee Security Center</strong> (using your Product ID, if need be) &amp; reboot. If you purchased your software directly from McAfee, go to
<a href="https://home.mcafee.com/Secure/Protected/Login.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">https://home.mcafee.com/Secure/Protected/Login.aspx</font></a> to log in and download your software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Manually and repeatedly update the McAfee application until you get a "no more updates" or similar prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. <em>Only if Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser is installed =&gt; </em>
Re-assert Internet Explorer as the default <strong>Browser</strong> in the CUSTOM (<strong>&lt;=important!</strong>) section of
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-default-programs-using-Set-Program-Access-and-Computer-Defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><font color="#0072c6">Set Program Access and Computer Defaults</font></span></a>. [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9a. <em>Only if Google Chrome is installed =&gt;&nbsp;</em>Right-click on the following link and SAVE the download to your desktop:
<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/problems/reg/chromehtml.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.slipstick.com/problems/reg/chromehtml.reg</font></a> [2]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9b. Double-click on the file you saved in #9a above &amp; accept the prompt to MERGE the data with the Registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Open Internet Explorer (<em>only!</em>) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</font></a> [ignore any DOES NOT APPLY warnings as well as the APPLIES TO section] &amp; run the Fix It.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note=&gt; For optimal results, check the <strong>Delete personal settings</strong> option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11a. Open Internet Explorer (<em>only!</em>) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910336</font></a> [ignore the title &amp; Symptoms].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11b. <em><strong>IMPORTANT! =&gt; Dismiss/close the Windows Update troubleshooter pop-up!</strong></em> - then...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11c. Ignoring any "Not recommended" or similar warnings, run Fix It 50202 in DEFAULT
<em>and then AGGRESSIVE modes</em>. [3]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. <em>Reboot again </em>&amp; test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13. Reply to this post with a status report.&nbsp; Even if all is well, I'll have a few more questions for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<div>Before I embark on this path of self-discovery, let me complicate matters some more:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>I'll try this, but ever since this whole thing started I have been <i>unable </i>
to download anything at all; downloads are "blocked" because of "missing .dll files." So I doubt that I will be able to download the uninstaller</li><li>Remember, Chrome is my ONLY currently-functioning browser</li><li>The IE issue has gotten all the attention, but my Office suite has been affected as well. Each time I try to launch an Office app, it reports that "(APPLICATION)EXE.cannot start because api-ms-win-downlevel-ole32-I1-1-0.dll is missing." I dismiss this message,
 and the app starts right up. Go figure</li><li>I have an old machine running XP at my disposal (I am in fact using it now), so I do have another Stargate available if things go terribly, terribly wrong and we need to communicate.</li></ul>
I won't do anything until I see a reply to this post. If your advice is "go for it, anyway," I will. What do I have to lose?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your patience. I will merely cower in the corner until I hear back on this post.</div>

    <title>Windows Went Recovery mode after uninstalling a program - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Went Recovery mode after uninstalling a program</h2>
                    <p>As I was cleaning my Laptop (Acer Aspire ES 14) I thought that uninstalling programs that i never use would boost the system and save some space. So I uninstalled some of them and there was no problem untill I tried uninstalling HP Shop For Supplies Program
 that came with the package for my printer at home. I don't actually need it so I just simply click UNINSTALL. Then it told me to restart my Laptop so the Uninstallation would take effect and yes I did. Then after the shutdown, Recovery mode went up saying
 at the boot load "Please wait" then it asks for "Choose your keyboard layout. Then I have two options on a blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Troubleshoot</p>
<p>-Turn off your PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>NONE OF THE OPTIONS WORK</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the cmd with tutorial commands online and no luck.</p>
<p>I tried to restore the previous versions, nope only errors.</p>
<p>Start up repair doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated my windows 10 version last 3 days and i dunno the version right now but I'm sure it's the latest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the problem occured&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently had two blue screen of death incidents within the week but i managed to deal with it.</p>
<p>While I am uninstalling the HP Shop For Supplies Program my 1TB Hard drive was intact and I forgot to remove it before I hit "Finish and Restart" at the Uninstall prompt. After the shutdown, the Acer logo appeared then a message: "Please Wait" then enters
 recovery mode with limited options that doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me fix this it would really help.</p>

            Hi&nbsp; <span>salblaster</span>,
<div><br />
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Based on the description provided, it looks like you are not able to install updates.</div>
<div>The probable cause for this is Windows XP SP3 should be installed on the computer for the updates to work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However we need some more information about this issue to assist you better. Please help me answer this question.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; What service pack is installed?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a couple of troubleshooting steps, I believe should help you to fix this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may try to download SP2 from this link:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28</a>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>You may try to download SP3 from this link:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24</a>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Additionally visit this link to know more about</div>
<div>Steps to take before you install Windows XP Service Pack 3 </div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717</a>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>If your computer is an HP Pavilion, Presario or Media Center and has an AMD processor (see above) you need to install this patch&nbsp;<b><i>before</i></b>&nbsp;installing SP3â€¦</p>
<p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;softwareitem=pv-60484-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?</a></p>
