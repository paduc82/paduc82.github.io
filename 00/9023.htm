<h2>            Duplicate task and get those task updated if the original task updates.</h2>
                    Hi All, In Microsoft project is there a way to duplicate task and get those task updated if the original task updates. The reason I am trying is do is i have 1000s of task in a project i just need to get 15 task for my reporting. I want to add those 15
 task in a group and just linked them to the original tasks, once those original task get updated % wise, i will just copy the grouped 15 task and use them for my reporting. Otherwise i have to dig and search all those task then copy them for my reporting

            <p>Sounds like the hardest possible way to do it.</p>
<p>Why don't you just make a new custom filter which extracts just the 15 tasks that you want out of the several thousand? That's what filters are for.</p>
<p>Any help?</p>

            <p>Centicon,</p>
<p>I agree with Trevor in that you are making this a lot more difficult than it needs to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Task descriptions in Project should explain, in action verb format, what the task is, so it sounds like you're on track with that. What I don't understand is the "reporting text". What exactly is that? Is there some kind of formal report format in Excel
 that you are required to use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project has no functionality to duplicate the Percent Complete field of one task directly into the Percent Complete field of another task, at least not without some VBA. What is often done is to create a series of reporting milestones, usually near the top
 of the file, and link via predecessors those milestone to relevant performance tasks within the body of the plan. Updating the performance task won't automatically update the milestone, but it will give a dynamic link to start or completion dates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have some formal reporting process that you need to use, then give us some examples and we'll help you get what you need. Personally I prefer to use VBA to export Project data to Excel for report generation simply because Excel has more flexibility
 and the reports from Excel can be easily shared electronically.</p>

<h3> scharlotte storey  say:</h3>
<h2>            New and Unread Incoming Email Background&#47;Font Color Change</h2>
                    <p>The light blue font of the new and unread Outlook 2017 emails is counter intuitive. &nbsp;Is there a way to change new emails to bold face black or some other selected color? &nbsp;Is there a way to change the background and font color of the incoming new and unread
 emails to make them appear more apparent? &nbsp;Is there also a way to change the "categorize" font color and/or background color? &nbsp;The little colored rectangle to the right of each "categorized" email is not noticeable enough to be helpful.</p>

            Are you referencing being able to sync via activesync.&nbsp; If so, you cannot sync with Outlook Express, you need to use Outlook.<br />
<br />
If you are referencing just using Windows Live Mail and Outlook express on your PC, this forum is for Windows Mobile Devices.&nbsp;

    <title>VLOOKUP displays formula, not result - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grinspoeker  say:</h3>
<h2>            VLOOKUP displays formula, not result</h2>
                    <p>I am using Excel 2010.&nbsp; When I enter the correct formula, e.g., =VLOOKUP(D1,PROJ!$A$1:$C$82,2,FALSE) Excel displays the formula in the cell, rather than the result of the formula.&nbsp; I have the lookup array in a second tab (PROJ) with the project codes in
 the first column and the project names in the second.&nbsp; On the main worksheet the project codes are in column D.&nbsp; I've tried putting the lookup array in the same worksheet and it makes no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I put the cursor back in the formula bar and hit F9 (or Calculate Now), Excel converts the formula to the correct result, but completely wipes out the formula!&nbsp; The result is then displayed in the formula bar and the formula is completely gone.&nbsp; I do
 have Excel set to automatic calculation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, when copying and pasting the formula to the other cells in column D, Excel is treating cell D1 as a "locked" reference (as if it had the dollar signs) rather than a relative reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems to be some BIG problems with VLOOKUP in Excel 2010.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>1.&nbsp;Check that the sheet has not been set to display formulas: activate the Formulas tab of the ribbon and look at the Show Formulas button in the Formula Auditing group. If this button is highlighted, click it to turn it off.</p>
<p>(You can also press Ctrl+` to toggle Show Formulas on and off)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Make sure that the cells with the formulas have not been formatted as Text. If you enter a formula in a cell formatted as Text, the formula will become the cell value.</p>

            Solved the problem. The folders uploaded to the ISP server and were not being deleted when I deleted them on my PC. I accessed my account on the ISP server and deleted them there - QED.

<h2>            IE8 and Windows 7 Home Premium - AutoComplete isn&#39;t giving my name, phone number, etc. as an option when filling in forms</h2>
                    Back when I was running Windows 7 RC1 - IE8 had set up a profile for me that had my name, phone number, address, etc. Whenever I filled out a form, etc all I would have to do is type the first letter of my name and a lttle box would appear with the word
 ME in it. Then I would click that box and it would fill out the rest of the form.<br />
<br />
Since upgrading to Windows 7 Home Premium - IE8 no longer does that for me anymore and I do not see anything where I could set up a profile,etc in it.<br />
<br />
Is this a limitation built into the retail version of WIndows 7/IE8?

<div>In regards to your first comments - IE8 under Windows 7RC1 used to complete the forms I am referring to. As I previously stated - it used to be that when I would start to complete the form - specifically - the moment I would type the first letter of my
 first name into the&nbsp;appropriate&nbsp;box in the form - a small box in IE8 would appear with the word "Me" in it. All I would have to do was to select that box with the mouse and IE8 would finish completing the rest of the form - ie street address, city, etc.</div>

<br />
If you're certain that AutoComplete was working on a specific site in Win7 RC1&nbsp;but it's not in Win7 Final, see if AutoComplete works on that specific site in another or a new User Account.<br />
<br />
Also make certain that Cookies are enabled for the site<br />

<h2>            Activesync Window not working</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, I have a T-mobile Dash using Mobile 6.0 and using outlook 2002 with activesync 4.5.&nbsp; I was working for months without problems.&nbsp; I turned my computer on one day and poof its stopped working.&nbsp; I have the active sync icon on the taskbar, when i connect
 my Dash it goes green and the arrows spin.&nbsp; That is the end of it, no window comes up, no sync happens at all.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have contacted T-mobile and they had me try uninstalling active sync and outlook. Ive done it many times. Nothing worked.&nbsp; I even tried using the system restore point, i went back to a date 2 weeks prior that i knew AS was working.&nbsp; I then
 reinstalled both outlook and as 4.5.&nbsp; Once i restarted it worked, for a day.&nbsp; I turned it on the next day and poof it stopped working again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interesting thing is i installed nothing.&nbsp; I changed nothing.&nbsp; I decided to uninstall and reinstall again.&nbsp; This time it didnt work.&nbsp; I decided to check something, I installed AS4.2 and connected the Dash it worked the window came up and
 started to sync and then gave me error that i needed to use AS 4.5.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then installed AS 4.5 and the same thing happened, i connect the Dash the icon turns green, the arrows move and nothing happens.&nbsp; Even when nothing is connected i cant even bring the AS window up.&nbsp; The only thing i can get to is the
</p>
<p>connection setting window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im at a loss and luckily i have a laptop that i was able to get them both working on but i need then working on my desktop to keep my kids appointments and contacts up to date.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to call microsoft as per T-mobile and was told i would have to pay them $75 before they would even discuss the problem with me. So here i sit with another faulty copy of a microsoft program they wont help with.&nbsp; Has anyone found a solution
 to this problem.&nbsp; I've seen other problems like it and tried their fixes and nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be great.</p>

<p>I have done that numerous times.&nbsp; It tells me there is a new device, asks to pair.&nbsp; Once its finished it stops, no window comes up and no sync happens.&nbsp; And the activesync window still doesnt come up even during or

<p>Yes the icon on the taskbar is the activesync icon.&nbsp; Also the page links you posted ive gone through already.&nbsp; Some come close the the problem, but none have the exact problem i have.&nbsp; Im wondering if there is a registry key that becomes unstable at some
 point with the activesync settings.&nbsp; Ive found other people discribing a problem like mine, that the window does not appear when to try to open activesync, but the solution did not work for me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that helps.&nbsp; Ive done most everything besides formatting my harddrive and reinstalling everything. which i really dont want to do.</p>

<p>When receiving a call just hold the banner at the bottom of the screen and slide it up slightly to reveal the options to answer or ignore the call. You can't slide the screen up during an incoming call.</p>

have you checked that you have installed the latest 1308 firmware for your device by going into Settings &gt; Phone Update? also check that you are up to date with all the latest Nokia system app updates from the Store. failing that, try performing a soft reset.

</p><p>You're welcome.&nbsp; I meant to add the following, which shows the exact decimal approximation of the other values with decimal fractions.</p>

</p><p>Note, for example, that 100.2 rounds to 100.20000000000000, which is why it is simply 100.2 in the XML file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The surprises are 100.4 and 100.9, which we might expect to&nbsp;round to 100.40000000000001 and 100.90000000000001 in the XML file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the reason they do not has to do with "banker's rounding" (round half to even) v. "normal" rounding (round half away from zero).&nbsp; But that is only an educated guess at this point.&nbsp; And probably TMI.</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">Actually, the number is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

</p><p class="contentStandard">And there is <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">nothing wrong</span></em>.&nbsp; That is actually the decimal approximation of the binary value that&nbsp;is stored internally in Excel.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The extra decimal places are unexpected, albeit correct,&nbsp;for several reasons.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">First, Excel format (displays) only up to the first 15 significant digits (rounded).&nbsp; So the constant 68.4 appears to be 68.400000000000000 even when formatted to display&nbsp;15 decimal places (17 significant digits).</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">But numerical values are stored internally using 64-bit binary floating-point, and it requires
</p><p class="contentStandard">So Excel formats up to the first 17 significant digits (rounded) in the XML file, in part because (compressed) XML is used to repesent saved "xlsx" and "xlsm" Excel files.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The 64-bit binary floating-point representation of numerical values&nbsp;is the sum of 53 powers of 2 ("bits") times an exponential factor. Consequently, most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly.&nbsp; Moveover (although not relevant
 for this question), the approximation of the same decimal fraction varies, depending on the magnitude of the integer part.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">For example, the decimal approximation of the constant 68.4 is exactly 68.4000000000000,<strong>056</strong>84341886080801486968994140625, which is 68.4000000000000<strong>06</strong> when rounded to 17 significant digits.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 720 - Photos from camera roll to computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I connect my Nokia Lumia 720, the computer has no issues recognizing it. Yet when I enter the folder "camera roll" in pictures, I can't see any of the photos I have taken. I don't remember there ever being a time when I could access these files directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way that I can directly download/transfer the camera roll photos to the computer? It would be much quicker and easier than first uploading to Skydrive then downloading from there. Take out the middle man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            Help with formula, trying to do VLOOKUP in a QUERY in importHTML</h2>
                    <p>I have a formula to pull in some data from a table on a website. &nbsp;The formula is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>=</span><span>QUERY</span><span>(</span><span>importHTML</span><span>(</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">"http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GurlTo01/gamelog/2015/"</span><span>,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">"table"</span><span>,</span><span style="color: rgba(17, 85, 204, 1)">1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">"select
 Col10, Col12, Col14, Col15, Col17 Limit 1 OFFSET 12"</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to search in that table for one value to
 define the row to pull data from rather than using OFFSET so that I can apply this formula to tables of different sizes with similar data. Is it possible to add a VLOOKUP function to this formula to search for that one field?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, is it possible to have the data pull into my spreadsheet
 without the column headings pulling in as well? </span></p>
<p>

            <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Where do you pull your data from?</span></p>
<p>Sports.Yahoo.Com - Like pro-football-reference.com, Yahoo doesn't provide "Week" number in each player's stat table. &nbsp;It provides date. &nbsp;Unlike pro-football-reference.com, Yahoo lists the most recent game in the table's first row. &nbsp;So when we select
<strong>Load/Refresh Team</strong>&nbsp;from the <strong>BXL </strong>ribbon tab, it opens Internet Explorer, navigates to each player's stat table in Yahoo Sports, and loads the first row. &nbsp;That may or may not be the most recent week (week 16).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Determining Week</span></p>
<p>Click <strong>Display Score</strong>. Any players on my team that did not play in the most recent week are highlighted in red using conditional formatting. The conditional formatting relies on a named formula
<strong>Ineligible</strong>. If we open the <strong>Name Manager</strong> and examine
<strong>Ineligible </strong>we find this formula:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>=INDIRECT("tblScore[@[Game Date]]") &lt;=MAX(INDIRECT("tblScore[[Game Date]]"))-6</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In English that is saying: If the value in the Game Date column of the current row is less than the maximum value in the entire Game Date column minus 6 days then the player's stats came from a prior week and is thus, ineligible for this week's scoring.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Impact on Scoring:</span></p>
<p>If we click on any of the scores in the <strong>Score</strong> table, we see this formula:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>=IF(Ineligible,0,Stats*Points)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In English that says, if the player is Ineligible, give them 0 points, otherwise, give then a score equal to the value in the players Stat table multiplied by the Points awarded for that stat. &nbsp;So not only are we highlighting the player's stats in red, but
 we are also excluding him from any scoring. &nbsp;BTW <strong>Stats</strong> and <strong>
Points </strong>are also named formulas so to see their actual formula we have to open
<strong>Name Manager</strong> and examine them there.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">pro-football-reference.com</span></p>
<p>Your source puts the most recent game at the bottom of the table. &nbsp;If I were using your source, I would scrape the last row instead of the first row which is more difficult and one reason I use Yahoo Sports. But after scraping the last row, we would still
 have to apply similar logic which is to compare the value in the date column to the maximum value for all other players on our team. &nbsp;If it is within a week, they are all in the same week. &nbsp;Of course, this means I must download my team on the day after the
 last day of the week.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Finding the last row:</span></p>
<p>Assuming we downloaded the entire table for Todd Gurley, to find the most recent game we need to determine the maximum value for the RK column then we could use VLOOKUP to get stats based on that value. &nbsp;We would still need to test the date to make sure
 the date value is within the week we want. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Example</span>:</p>
<p>If we used POWER QUERY, it would download this data into a QueryTable and given that table the default name Table_0. &nbsp;So our formula to find the most recent game's rushing yards would be</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>=VLOOKUP(MAX(Table_0[Rk]),Table_0,10,FALSE)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Determining the Week date range</span><br />
It would probably make sense to create a table with three columns: <strong>Week #</strong>,
<strong>Start Date</strong>, and <strong>End Date</strong>. &nbsp;With this table we could use
<strong>VLOOKUP </strong>to find week 16's start and end dates and then test the <strong>
Date</strong> value Todd Gurley's last stat row to see if it is within that date range.<br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Finding a Better Source</span><br />
A large part of web scraping is finding the best source. &nbsp;For what you have described, I would recommend something like:&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/stats/byposition?pos=RB&amp;conference=NFL&amp;year=season_2015&amp;timeframe=Week16&amp;sort=49</p>
<p>
</p><p>This web page allows us to set the week number and position in the URL (timeframe=Week16, pos=RB) &nbsp;so we ONLY get the week we want. &nbsp;From there, I'm assuming you would use VLOOKUP to find&nbsp;<a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/players/28398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Todd Gurley</a>&nbsp;and
 retrieve his stats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BTW - The POWER QUERY source is:&nbsp;</p>
let<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Source = Web.Page(Web.Contents("http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/stats/byposition?pos=RB&amp;conference=NFL&amp;year=season_2015&amp;timeframe=Week16")),<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Data0 = Source{0}[Data],<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Data0,{{"", type text}, {"2", type text}, {"3", type text}, {"4", type text}, {"5", type text}, {"Rushing", type text}, {"Rushing2", type text}, {"Rushing3", type text}, {"Rushing4", type text}, {"Rushing5",
 type text}, {"Rushing6", type text}, {"6", type text}, {"Receiving", type text}, {"Receiving2", type text}, {"Receiving3", type text}, {"Receiving4", type text}, {"Receiving5", type text}, {"Receiving6", type text}, {"Receiving7", type text}, {"7", type text},
 {"Fumbles", type text}, {"Fumbles2", type text}, {"Fumbles3", type text}})<br />
in<br />

<h2>            How to convert Access DB to Web DB</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Is there a way that I can make my access form into a web form that looks and performs like how it should in access?&nbsp; I tried to do the export to html method, but it looks totally different and buttons aren't showing up.&nbsp; Also, text boxes are not functional
 as they should be.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Sure. And you find in this answer why I consider this a different task then validation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To convert some text you enter into a column as lower case, you open up the table, click on table on the ribbon tab. You then click on the before change event</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;SetField<br />
&nbsp; Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LastName<br />
Value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LCase([LastName])</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I try this one in which the first character is forced to upper case, and the rest lower case.</p>
<p>SetField<br />
Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LastName<br />
Value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UCase(Left([LastName],1)) &amp; LCase(Mid([LastName],2,99))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So above would set first letter to upper case, and the rest to lower case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, such type of code would not be placed in validation, but in the before change event. The validation setting is to give an error message when input is wrong, but the above is code that runs to change things automatic.</p>

            Hi ST
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />First, ensure that your order has been Delivered. Sign in to your account (<a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/account/</a>) and click Show purchase history. You can see the order number and the status (e.g. Pending, Delivered).
<br />
<br />Next, check that your Skype Credit balance is positive. You may need to sign out of Skype for the balance to refresh. Select your profile picture &gt; Sign Out, and then sign in again.
<br />
<br />Note that simply closing the Skype application and restarting again is not the same as signing out. That won't actually refresh your balance.
<br />
<br />Finally, attempt to place a call. In some cases where a balance has not updated after a purchase, making a call can force the update. If your order has been delivered, the call will connect and your balance will then update.
<br />
<br />Important: If you have bought a subscription to call one or more countries, this will not show up on your Skype Credit balance. It will be displayed as a delivered order in your account.
<br />
<br />If you still can't make any calls, try contacting our chat support (<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA1170/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/faq/FA1170/</a>).<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4423cfc2-26f3-4f8e-bef4-603038c5b2a0?upload=true" />
