    <title>Suggestion&#58; Give us WASAPI in WMP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ninji  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suggestion&#58; Give us WASAPI in WMP</h2>
                    
<p>Only thing that is truly missing from it since all DSP's can be disabled.&nbsp; Would basically make WMP like other media players such as Foobar in terms of transparency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My sound card only supports ASIO via analog, but I am using it as a mere Transport to an external DAC unit and as such am using the digital output. Considering WASAPI is Microsofts answer to ASIO it is suprising to not see it as an option in WMP12.</p>

<h2>            Why does Microsoft keep closing my daughter&#39;s account&#63;</h2>
                    I have received, on two separate occasions now, a text message saying that my daughter's microsoft account has been closed.&nbsp; I had created another after her first was deleted and about a week later had the same thing happen.&nbsp; Why does this keep happening?&nbsp;
 No further explanation is given as to why, just the text message stating the fact.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that if a Microsoft Account has been created, and it was <strong>NEVER
</strong>used ever since it was created, the account is automatically deleted after
<strong>10 days</strong>. This is to prevent account spammers from creating multiple accounts, and reserving usernames that others that would legitimately like to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent this from happening, it's best that after creating the account, log it in at
<strong>https://account.microsoft.com</strong> just a few days after. This just means that the account is active and is in-use. You may also want to login the account at
<strong>https://mail.live.com</strong> which is basically Outlook.com. You can do this within a week, so that the account won't be marked as a spammer and will exist for a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extra: With the new Services Agreement, Microsoft accounts are now deleted automatically if it's not been used for
<strong>5 years</strong>(It was only 365 days before). So, it's best that the account is logged in online once in a while as proof that the account is active.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this answers all your inquiries.</p>

<h2>            Accidentally closed Microsoft account. How do I reopen it&#63;</h2>
                    I accidentally closed the Microsoft account. And now when I go in control panel it says that I'm signed in as a
<b>guest </b>and not as a <b>Administrator</b>. Now I cannot download anything on my laptop. When I tried to sign in, it says "<b>this account does not exist</b>" and when I tried to sign-up with the same user I.D, it says "<b>this user I.D already exists</b>".
 What should I do now?<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I was able to verify that the account you provided does not exist in our database. Please check that it was not mistyped. If you are sure of the Windows Live
 ID then it is also possible that your account is already inactive.<br />
</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
Your account will be inactive if you do not sign in for 270 days or within the first 10 days after registration. The account will then be removed if it has been inactive for 365 days.&nbsp; When the account is deleted, the user name is immediately available for
 registration. <br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are willing to change the OS version from Korean to English. Sorry to inform you that if you are willing to&nbsp;so the same it&nbsp;can only be done by installing OS again using installation media and selecting the language English
 at the time of installation. However, you may try to add the language pack of English and can use it.</p>

<h2>            I cant install ROBLOX error code 6</h2>
                    <p>My ROBLOX will not install for some reason, the error I get is</p>
<p>
</p><p>An error occured while starting ROBLOX</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details: HttpOpenRequest failed for GET</p>
<p>http://setup.roblox.com/version?guid4883, Error Code: 6</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried just about everything I could think of, but maybe there is more. I've tried allowing access through my firewall, port forwarding every port ROBLOX could use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

            That's a function of the printer driver, not Windows. Open Control Panel and go to Devices and Printers. Right click on your printer and choose Printer Properties or Printing Preferences.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find out which particular driver is causing this issue, we need to check the dump files. You can find more details about how to check for dump files in this Wiki:</p>

<h2>            Filezilla and any FTP software having slow upload and download windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 10 pro latest updated at 20 Feb 2019. I have 100 MBPS optical fibre. When i download through normal browser (Firefox or IE) download do not go beyond 150 to 200 Kbps rate. I daily use Filezilla FTP and over there rate is 200 to 250 Kbps. I
 have already tried different FTP software but same issue. Same i use it in office give proper speed. Basically it should give me 7 to 8 Mbps download rate. which i get in the office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any setting in Windows i have to tweak?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Rahul, I am Dexter, an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />Refer to your description, I suggest you check your connection's properties and see if it's at a proper speed fist. It should be 100M or 1G for the wired connection. 
<br />
<br />If you're using a wireless network at home, check the strength of wifi signal and both the speed of the wireless connection.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9d69a83-b5ef-47fc-bed1-dbadef108d5e?upload=true" />

            Hi Rahul
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience this is causing. 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type: 
<br />
<br />netsh int ip reset
<br />
<br />Hit Enter 
<br />Exit the prompt then restart
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down
<br />Click Network adapters
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />If not, press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />
<br />Right click your adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager, restart. Windows 10 should detect the network adapter then reinstall it. Check if you can connect and browse.
<br />
<br />also try:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status
<br />
<br />
<br />Scroll to the bottom then click Network reset.
<br />
<br />Disable Energy Efficient Ethernet in "Client for Microsoft Networks"
<br />Press Windows key + X

<br />
<br />If the network connection is slow or lagging, check if Windows 10 is downloading Windows Update or the Microsoft Store is downloading updates. These can sometimes affect the performance your network connection.
<br />
<br />If you have a VPN enabled, disable it.
<br />
<br />Disable the Windows Firewall then try connecting.
<br />
<br />If the connection is slow, remove any special bundled software that came with the motherboard.

<br />The expected speed test result will match your bandwidth for 100M ( could be a little smaller in fact ) if the result is bad, you'd better contact with the network service provider for a troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, check your connection's properties for the setting of DNS server address. Reset the preferred DNS server to 8.8.8.8 ( Google's DNS server ), and see if this works.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I see some updated drivers for your model. 
<br />
<br />Chipset January 2019

<br />
<br />LAN drivers January 2019:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/04LAN/Intel_I211_12.15.184.1_RS5.zip?_ga=2.94653081.460182538.1550542701-1952379852.1545524274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/04LAN/Int...</a>
<br />
<br />See if these updates help. If not, I would recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1803 to see if performance improves.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can do any of the following:</p>
<p>1 Open Reader first, then navigate to the PDF you wish to open</p>
<p>2 Set Reader back to the default program for opening PDFs - Control Panel&gt; Default Programs&gt; Set Default Programs, Reader, set this program as default</p>
<p>3 Uninstall the other app</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It all depends on how you want to proceed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is a new build where hardware is identical to previous build - the only difference is I changed the SSD. One other difference is I updated my graphics driver to the latest. Using GeForce 399.24 where I was using 388 version before.</p>

            <p>Thank you for trying. No that did not help. Ran diagnosis app 3 times, found &amp; fixed errors each time but Edge still can't connect online. Strange thing is I ran the same diagnosis app to try to fix Windows Store App &amp; XBox connection on old Windows 10 system.
 Never worked &amp; found online that Windows App store seemed to have problems with any connection of less than 20 Mpbs while I have slow 3.1 Mbps connection. Wondering if Anniversery Update also updated Edge browser &amp; MS apps to need faster connection to internet
 since Edge connected online fast on original Win 10 version while Chrome browser was very slow to connect. After updating to Anniversery Win 10, the Windows store &amp; Xbox app still cant go online + now Edge &amp; Windows Solitaire wont even connect online while
 Google Chrome is only working browser. My computer never had Windows Explorer on it - came with Win 10 &amp; Edge &amp; Edge no longer works.</p>

            <p>I agree that Edge is a superior browser &amp; worked much faster than Chrome on the previous version of Windows 10. My problem is not how to make Edge work better but how to get it to work at all. Something in the Anniversery Update of Windows 10 Version fit
 x64-based System (KB3176936) broke Edge browser &amp; now both it &amp; Microsoft Solitaire Collection are no longer able to access the internet. I have never been able to get Windows Store app to connect online from 1st day I turned computer on but was able to go
 online with Edge &amp; play Solitaire Collection as a guest user since couldnt get gamertag for XBox with Windows Store broke. Even had Windows Rep ghost my computer 1 night to try to fix problem during the first 30 days I owned computer. Rep made my computer
 able to download faster &amp; work better, reloaded Windows Store cache multiple times but admitted she was unable to fix Windows Store app so it would connect online. Tried going to online store on Edge &amp; Chrome browsers back then but Windows Store App must work
 in order to download any product regardless of browser. So far MS Anniversary Update is major fail for me but cant decline any updates so turning back just means I'd end up paying twice for same update... I get 4GB data per mo.</p>

<h2>            Install Greek Character Sets on Windows XP</h2>
                    Hi, i don't know if this is the right section for asking this.<br />
Well. I Have Windows XP Professional SP3 on my Laptop Acer Aspire 3003LM<br />
<br />
My Current Language is ENGLISH and there is not Greek in my Language Options because the CD was American English....<br />
<br />
Anyway, i tried to see a movie with greek Subtitles but.... they are like Symbols or something... take a look on the image......<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg130.imageshack.us%2fimg130%2f9961%2fgreeksucks.png" />
<br />
<br />
I just want the subtitles to appear greek.<br />
if you can't on my pc try on media player classic! <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>Hey guys, seems like this Isn't an issue with just the store. Some people have been having this happen with The dashboard, keyboard and friends as well. I myself have had this happen with any of the aforementioned and even while playing a game. It starts
 just getting slow, and then you can't select anything or move, yeah? It all seems to be happening within the last couple weeks and has gotten worse.
</p>
<p>It may be an OS glitch or error that came with the recent update. I hope they find a fix and release a patch soon.

<p>I see from an earlier life that this was a big issue with Windows 8.1 in 2013.</p>
<p>There was evidently no solution back then, and like you, many of us are still having the same problems today...yes, six years later.</p>
<p>Gmail just sent through items received on my phone over 30 minutes before!</p>

<h2>            Pro 4 pen cursor keeps getting stuck on right side of page</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the surface pro 4 with the single side button. No matter what program I am in (even on the desktop), my cursor for the pen gets stuck on the right side of the screen. I can move it up and down, but it is completely constrained to the right side scroll
 bar location. I first noticed this when taking notes in OneNote and realized that when I wrote too far to the right side of the page, my cursor would get stuck there. After some investigating, I found it does this in all applications even the desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To free the cursor again, I hold the eraser button to open sticky notes and then must close all the notes before the cursor is freed. Also, I can do a complete reboot to free it up again. This keeps happening every single time I move the pen over the right
 side of the screen. At first I thought this was a random event until I noticed the pattern of writing too far to the right caused to to lock up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, the surface pen is basically useless. Is there a simple fix for this? I tried changing batteries and the problem still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jared</p>

            <p>Ok, so I ended up calling Microsoft and they had me uninstall any drivers related to the pen and touch device under the Device Manager. These devices were specifically located under the HID and Firmware tabs of Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this I did a reboot from the start menu and let the drivers reinstall automatically. I tried the pen and now it works fine. I can move the pen cursor over the right side edge of the screen and bring it back without it becoming stuck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000 not working after update</h2>
                    
<p>Windows updated yesterday.&nbsp; After my next restart, the mouse wouldn't work.&nbsp; The cursor is in the middle of the screen and won't move.&nbsp; I tried rebooting, and that didn't fix it.</p>
<p>I tried uninstalling the driver, rebooting and reinstalling.&nbsp; That didn't work, either.&nbsp; When I check the mouse properties in the control panel, it says, "Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware.&nbsp; The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code
 39)"</p>
<p>I tried unplugging the USB Bluetooth and reconnecting an old, wired mouse.&nbsp; It is saying the same thing with that.</p>

<p>Looking through the update log, it appears that it broke the first time I restarted after Intellipoint 8.0 was installed.&nbsp; I've tried downloading it manually from the Microsoft site and installing it.&nbsp; That made no difference.&nbsp; I've trying to do a System
 Restore to before that update, and that didn't make a difference.&nbsp; Intellipoint 7.x did not get restored.</p>
<p>All I want to do at this point is just put the old software back in, because that worked.&nbsp; However, it doesn't seem to be available for download any longer.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Gunner 217,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to the speakers icon on the system tray? If so, you just need to right click on the speaker icon &gt; click on Volume Mixer &gt; then, unmute Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may check as well your Skype settings &gt; Click on the 3 dots &gt; Settings &gt; Audio/Video &gt; check if your microphone is being detected. If yes, click on test audio to check if it is perfectly working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you also provide the below information?</p>
<ul>
<li>What Skype version are you using?</li><li>What is the operating system of your device?</li><li>Send us a screen shot of the muted speaker that you see on your end.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and I look forward to your reply!</p>
        </p>

<p><span><span>If so, then in Skype click on the 3 dots ("...") button and select Audio &amp; Video.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Look for settings for your Speakers and make sure that the slider is not at zero (the left end of the volume scale).</span></span></p>
