    <title>Cannot turn on Firewall in guest accont - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davex4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot turn on Firewall in guest accont</h2>
                    <p>I have full administrator rights and own my windows 7 64 bit laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just set up a guest account. Everything is fine except it is showing that Windows firewall is turned off in that account. I also have anti vir installed and this is also showing no firewall. When I try to turn on the firewall through anti vir it asks
 me to enter the administrators password. I do this, and then go to their turn on firewall button, but the same msg appears sending me round in circles and no firewall turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try through the guest account to go into firewall through windows control panel, I get error firewall is off, see administrator!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the firewall is actually on, as its ok if I go back to the administrator account and log in that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My concern is a guest surfing the net and their being no firewall protection. Can someone please clarify what,s going on for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            The firewall status is not affected by user accounts. Please use snippingtool.exe to take a snapshot of the screen that makes you believe that the firewall is off. Now save the file, then include it in your reply by clicking the "mountain" symbol in the
 tool bar.<br />

            <p>snippingtool.exe would have been a far better tool to take a snapshot. Highly recommended!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message does not say that the firewall is off. It only says that the guest account is not authorised to activate/deactivate the firewall. This is entirely expected.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Frederik and yes, I should have used snipping tool, I have now. Still have 2 questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If the firewall is on, then why does the windows message say otherwise and report an error. Why does it not say for eg, 'The firewall is on, but as a guest you do not have admin rights to change it.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Here is a shot of the Anti vir message. It gives me the opportunity to turn on the firewall, asks for the admin password , which of course I enter, but nothings happens and it still shows that the firewall is off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still very wary of a guest surfing the net under these conditions, and if the firewall is actually on when someone is using a guest account then why these conflicting message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate your take on things.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3deb419270-58e6-40f8-9ee1-deeab387f876" /></p>

<p>-&gt; This is a question that only Microsoft can answer.</p>
<p>

<p>-&gt; Avira would need to answer this question. I rely on the firewall report generated by the Windows Control Panel. It is visible under any account and looks like so:</p>

            <p>Microsoft have asked me if this question has been resolved for me. No it has not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last reply was when I showed that antivir is showing there is no firewall on in guest account then I should go to antivir and ask them as its not microsofts problems! For gods sake I know that. I was using this example to show you that a program I have
 is showing me that in guest account Windows firewall is not on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then in guest account I look at the windows firewall and it tells me you do not have admin rights to enter and look. Fine, I know that too! But why hasn't windows developed a 'to proceed enter admin password here' which I could do as I am, the administrator.
 I could then check the firewall in guest account and if it looked all ok (as it is in admin account still) then this thread would not exist!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been told it is on, you just cant see it, dont worry. But I do! as other programs tell me different. Also I run Adwcleaner regularly to scan my windows machine. And yes I use the developers real prog and not a downloaded look a like that some crook
 has developed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now please don't tell me this is Adwcleaner problem - go to them, because; Their scans often show on my Microsoft machine there are no problems. Sometimes maybe it finds a few cookies watching my browsing history and then it deletes them. I have used guest
 account only once on line to set up a guest email account so all i did was use I.E. to do this, nothing else. I did not browse onto Madam Fi Fi glamour site or anything like that. The other day I ran Adwcleaner and this time it found several problems. Yes,
 there were two bad guys in Dave\admin, but these were just uninvited marketing things watching what I look at. But there were loads of dave\guest..... etc. Some of them looked real bad.Three were planted directly in the registry too. Of course I deleted everything
 and then ran a full windows defender scan etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have been told, Dave its OK, the firewall is on in guest account you just cant see it. Is it? And why can't I as admin check that in guest account?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do microsoft have a tool I can download to check guest account? I do love windows and windows 7 particularly. I have an iphone and its operating system for kids often does my head in with what i call it pop up kiddy bubbles. My friends often laugh when in
 frustration at my 'itoy' phone I say "Give me a phone with windows 7 operating system for geezers any day!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I met by chance a college and asked him about guest accounts on his windows 7 machine. He laughed and said that he tried to set up one for his daughter but had problems. Then he told me those problems were to do with the firewall!! He said 'oh
 I just called my techy guy in to sort stuff like that.'</p>
<p>But I cannot afford to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going on a 75% bet that I still have a firewall problem in guest account. What do Microsoft think?</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If you have a firewall set for the Admin Account then it is on for ALL accounts. You cannot<br />
access the firewall settings from a Guest Account however the firewall will still be on.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>There is no problem as you would not want anyone with Guest Access to be able to alter<br />
the firewall and/or any security settings.<br />
<br />

<br />
=========================<br />
<br />
Low cost 3rd party software firewalls are pretty much problems waiting to happen. They all have<br />
compatibility issues and offer only a few enhanced controls. In fact their issues often actually lower<br />
the overall security instead of raising it. The Windows Firewall has no compatibility issues and is<br />
extremely secure if you know enough to bypass most of the hype. Quality software firewalls cost<br />
thousands. Most routers have&nbsp;hardware firewalls built in and those are considerably better additions<br />
for the buck than any cheap/low cost software firewall.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            <p>Many thanks. I will do that as soon as I can, am off out soon and well busy so it may be tomorrow. Anyway, I take it that if I do what you say logged in as admin you will be able to see things you want to to check. I usually hibernate my m/c and fresh boot
 say once a week. But before I do as you say, I will shut it down and re - boot and it will be in regular mode NOT safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above is ok by you, then no need to reply, I will just do it. If you want me to modify anything I say above then I know you will reply to this. Thankyou, feel better now.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The keyboard has no manufacturers driver but loads the HID Keyboard Device driver of Microsoft.&nbsp; There is no way I can find to select compatibility mode for this.&nbsp; I have tried your suggestions 1 and 2 several times before and again now.&nbsp; there is still
 no repeat key function.&nbsp; When in USB 3.0 port the trouble shooter says it is an old USB device (13 months old!) and to run it through a USB 2.0 port.&nbsp; The device has a USB connector.&nbsp; I have tried some of the USB 2.0 ports and it is still the same. It worked
 fine until a few days ago.</p>

            Have solved the problem by trial and error.&nbsp; In Win 10 control panel "ease of access" switch off "filter keys".&nbsp; It appears that it was switched on by an automatic update!&nbsp; Now key repeat works.&nbsp; However, it will take time to see If the problem of the
 keyboard intermittently stopping still occurs.<br />

                    <p>so I've neglected a lot of messages on Xbox mostly because the from little turds who like to spam message and troll and I have about 96 unread messages, I don't want to one by one click through them because that forces me to see the filth and garbage toxicity these kids like to spread.

            <p>Hey there KINGxRey.<br /><br />I'm afraid there isn't an option to mass delete messages. Generally if they've been sitting there for more than 30 days they'll automatically be deleted, but if you want to remove them you'll need to go through and manually delete each one.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi <b>Senthilkumar</b>,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Method 1: </b>Run System File Check (SFC) scans and checks if it helps.</p>
<span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> System File Checker gives an administrator the ability to scan all protected files to verify their versions. If System File Checker discovers that a protected file has been overwritten, it retrieves
 the correct version of the file from the cache folder (%Systemroot%\System32\Dllcache) or the Windows installation source files, and then replaces the incorrect file. System File Checker also checks and repopulates the cache folder. You must be logged on as
 an administrator or as a member of the Administrators group to run System File Checker. If the cache folder becomes damaged or unusable, you can use the
<b>sfc /scannow</b>, the <b>sfc /scanonce</b>, or the <b>sfc /scanboot</b> commands to repair its contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: </b>You may also try to create a new user and then check if it helps.</p>

<p>If it works fine in new account, then your current account might be corrupted.<br />

<b>To fix a corrupt account</b>, please follow the steps in the link and then check if it helps.<br />

            Maybe this is too late..But anyone having same problem <strong>try installing netframe version 4.5</strong>.I was having same problem,kaspersky wanted to install netframe version 4.0 but couldn't do it because of same issue.Then &nbsp;I tried version 4.5 for
 installation manually,I don't know, how? but it actually installed and worked.Although I don't use netframe for any purpose(I don't even know how to use it),just wanted for my antivirus.Now my antivirus is running like a charm.Then again it is just a suggestion,give
 it a try!

<h2>            localhost is online but isn&#39;t responding to connection attempts</h2>
                    <p>This is my Windows Home Server 2011 and I can no longer get my home webpage, or any page on my server, to display.&nbsp; I get the error message #404 and everything I've tried gives me the same results.&nbsp; I have tried directly from the servers desktop, from other
 computers in my local network and through the internet from my work.&nbsp; The only other indication I've seen of a problem is that when I click on the "Fix connection problem" I get the message "website (<a href="http://www.rkwco.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.rkwco.com</a>)
 is online but isn't responding to connection attempts." message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not somebody else's system, this is mine.&nbsp; It was working before and I'm not sure what I've done to cause it to stop.&nbsp; If I can figure out what's causing the problem, I know I can figure out what to do to fix it.&nbsp; So far all my searching for troubleshooting
 help keeps pointing to the browser for fixes but I'm pretty sure I've eliminated that as a possibility with the different client locations and access methods.&nbsp; One last piece of info is if I try to TELNET using port 80, I just get the message that it can't
 open port 80.&nbsp; That's been making me look in the direction of the firewall settings but I'm not sure what to look for in there.&nbsp; Suggestions on what/how to test this server web access?</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like Latitude E6410 does not support Windows 8.1 operating system. Windows 8/8.1 is not listed as supporting operating system. I would suggest you to download and install the graphics driver in Windows 7 compatibility mode.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/555/Product/latitude-e6410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/555/Product/latitude-e6410</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode.<br />
</p>
<p>a. <strong>Download</strong> the drivers from the <strong>manufacturer’s</strong> website.<br />
b. Right-click on the <strong>driver</strong> and click on <strong>properties</strong>.<br />
c. Click on the ‘<strong>compatibility</strong>’ tab and check the box "<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>” and select
<strong>Windows&nbsp;7 operating system</strong> from the drop down.<br />
d. Click on ‘<strong>Apply’</strong> and click ‘<strong>OK’</strong> and run the file to install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, you may contact Dell support for more information.
</p>

            <p>I am getting same issue for Windows 8.1 + Dell E6410 combination.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I found on this thread: <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/19528971.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/19528971.aspx</a></p>
<p>that reverting back to older drivers for NVS 3100 video card is resolving this issue.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried the steps mentioned on the above mentioned thread to install older driver in Windows7 compatibility mode and it definitely resolved the issue for me..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, after every few days the drivers are getting updated to latest version and the problem starts cropping up again. And I have to do a rollback of driver to get back to the old state. I have event marked respective update as hidden in WIndows Update
 settings, still don't know why it keeps getting updated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1) Press WIn+X</p>
<p>2) Select "Device Manager"</p>
<p>3) Expand "Display Drivers"</p>
<p>4) Double click on NVidia NVS 3100M</p>
<p>5) Go to "Driver" tab.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If "Driver Date" says year 2013, then you will see this problem.</p>
<p>Reverting back to drivers of date 7/31/2010 resolves the issue.</p>

            <p>It took a few tries before I found the right drivers, but I can more or less definitively confirm that the 326.19 drivers direct from NVIDIA work well. Unlike the older 2010 drivers others might recommend, this driver doesn't cause any graphical glitches
 in Windows 8.1. I've been able to go in and out of sleep multiple times without the machine crashing once. These are the
<strong>newest</strong><strong> drivers that work</strong>. NVIDIA's site indicates they are only certified for Windows 8, not 8.1, but I've been using them with 8.1 Enterprise for a few days now without any problems.</p>

            <p>Yes, even I have been using this new driver from couple of weeks now. Haven't faced any issues related to sleep so far. And flickering of photos/flash animations is gone as well.</p>
<p>However, I feel that graphics performance has degraded after&nbsp;I installing these new drivers.</p>

            <p>It's not the best - I still get some graphical artifacts in the Facebook app sometimes - but it's better than not being able to use sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt NVIDIA will ever release new drivers that support the NVS 3100, since it's a four-year-old mobile GPU at this point.</p>

                    so I changed my log in password, forgot it, went through the steps by using the alternate account on my laptop and I'm still not able to log in using the new password. However I am able to use the other account that i set up for my sister on this laptop
 but I can not do anything in mine, in which I am the administrator. What do I do? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, as mentioned in your original thread, we are not able to process refunds in Skype Community. Please get in touch with our

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking on the Order Number you have provided, it is showing that the Skype credit was not refunded back to your PayPal but it was returned to your Skype account as credit as it is already used.

<p>
</p><p>It is not eligible for refund to PayPal. We suggest for you to consume the credits.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last resort is to have the charge disputed with your financial institution.

<h2>            Locking&#47;pinning Windows 10 desktop icons in place</h2>
                    Is there any way in Windows10 to keep desktop icons in place? Windows seems to want to&nbsp; shift them around on occasion. I know you used to be able to right click, freeze them in place with a setting, lock icons in place and then uncheck auto arrange, but
 I'm not finding that in Win10.

            <p>Mr. Bial, this does not resolve the issue, it just shifts all of my desktop icons over to the left side of my screen. I want to put the icons in specific places on my desktop and have them stay there, not be moved around when I get a new icon on the desktop.</p>

            This is fine if you are happy with Microsoft's seemingly random ordering of your icons but most people wish to position icons in a way that is convenient to them. Surely there must be a way to position and then lock the icons in place?

            And I am having just the opposite problem. All of my desktop icons are locked in place. I can't save anything to the desktop or remove anything. I am running Fences from Stardock and it was installed on Windows 7 before the upgrade to 10. I wonder if this
 is the cause of my problem.

</p><p>I have the exact problem as yours. I can not put the icons where I want on Desktop. Did you find the solution yet? If you find it, could you be so kind to post it here?</p>
<p>Did any one from Microsoft aware of this problem??? Probably not :(.</p>

            Yup, Fences is the culprit. The version I had installed was the older free version. I read that the new paid version works, but I haven't tried it yet.

<h3> ireallyjustneedsomehelp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing file, yet I know I didn&#39;t delete it.</h2>
                    <p>Recently my computer has suffered two blue screens. The first one didn't affect anything (to my knowledge), but I believe the second one has deleted (or somehow hidden) a file. After the second crash, as my computer was trying to boot, I got a message saying
 that my drives were being scanned, and showed a percentage. About 30 minutes later, the computer restarted and displayed a new message saying something along the lines of "Scanning and repairing (something) drive, this could take over an hour." Three hours
 later, the computer restarted again, but with the first message again this time. The cycle repeated for so long that I couldn't wait any more and I cancelled the drive scanning. The computer booted up like normal, except not long after I saw that an extremely
 important file had somehow gone missing from C:. I need this file on a day to day basis, and unfortunately I had not created any backups beforehand. I remembered opening files from there in MS Paint, so I checked the recently opened files for a picture from
 the file. After trying to open an image I found, I received this error message:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/253d795e-40ee-4269-a9e4-01f750547061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/253d795e-40ee-4269-a9e4-01f750547061" /></a></p>
<p>"Misc" is the folder that went missing. I know I did not delete the folder because I would have noticed it being deleted as it contains almost 100 GBs worth of data, and to be sure I checked my recycle bin (found other deleted files but not Misc), and I
 used Recuva software to locate deleted files, of which it did not find my missing folder. When I use any shortcuts to files related to Misc, it returns the "This file has been moved or changed" error. When I search for image or program names from Misc, I only
 find shortcuts, and again they return that same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should note that each time I shut down or restart my computer, it attempts to scan and repair drives, and each time it cycles through two processes (as said before) which takes hours upon hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need this file and I'm hoping that there is some way to retrieve it. Should I try and let the computer scan and repair during booting? Is there any way I can get my file back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is always a good practice to have a backup of your files. This is important, especially if you are experiencing blue screens. If the missing files were not properly backed up, we will not be able to recover them. We suggest that you refer to the link
 below to assist you in setting up your backup:</p>

<h2>            Save Data DISAPPEARED for Batman Arkham Asylum GOTA</h2>
                    
<p>Today, I was playing my Batman game. I defeated Poison Ivy (see recent achievement) and this put me over 60% completion. I turned off my system and decided I'd continue again shortly. I turned my Xbox back on (30 minutes later) and there was no saved game
 to be found on my system. I checked all memory storage and nothing. I even redownloaded my profile and cleared the cache. HELP!!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey there, MoCollins92! I'm incredibly sorry to see any issues with game saves!</p>
<p>If the game save is no longer on your Xbox 360 console, then there is no way to retrieve that. It sounds like your hard drive might be going out if things start disappearing. I would suggest checking out your Storage via&nbsp;<strong>Settings &gt; Storage</strong> and checking for anything that has a yellow exclamation mark (!). That means it is corrupted and should be deleted. Then shut your Xbox off.</p>
<p>Depending on your hard drive situation, you have different options.</p>
<p><strong>If you have a 4GB internal hard drive console&nbsp;</strong>and the items are still on your console when you power it back up, you may need a repair. I suggest checking out our <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service Center</a> to see if you are within warranty for a warranty repair, or for the cost of an out of warranty repair.</p>
<p><strong>If you have a slim hard drive that can be removed</strong> and the items are still on your console when you power it back on, you may need a new hard drive.</p>
<p>I suggest moving what items you can to another hard drive or flash drive to hold on to them if these are the cases.</p>
<p>If everything seems to be working well, then it is just a case that the game save became corrupt. I would keep an eye on the health of your hard drive in the mean time.</p>
<p>Hopefully we've got you fully sorted out! If you need further assistance with a repair, do not hesitate to post back in here and we'll be sure to get you pointed in the right direction. :)</p>

<div>Are you asking how many gigabytes Windows XP can use? If so are you</div>

<div>Assuming that you are asking about RAM, here's my standard reply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All 32-bit client versions of Windows (not just Vista/XP/7) have a 4GB</div>
<div>address space (64-bit versions can use much more). That's the</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But you can't use the entire 4GB of address space. Even though you</div>
<div>have a 4GB address space, you can only use *around* 3.1GB of RAM.</div>
<div>That's because some of that space is used by hardware and is not</div>
<div>available to the operating system and applications. The amount you can</div>
<div>use varies, depending on what hardware you have installed, but can</div>
<div>range from as little as 2GB to as much as 3.5GB. It's usually around</div>
<div>3.1GB. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note that the hardware is using the address *space*, not the actual</div>
<div>RAM itself. If you have a greater amount of RAM, the rest of the RAM</div>
<div>goes unused because there is no address space to map it to. </div>

<p>all this ram is starting to clear up,but.&nbsp; i have a friend that i upgraded his memory from 512mb to 4g. my problem is that it only shows it reckonizes 2g, although the system is running alot faster my question is i'm afraid it not picking up on the other
 2g strip.</p>
<p>i installed 2x2g 200 pin ddr2 667 pc2 5300 dual channel kit in a hp compact nx9420 that is running windows xp pro.</p>
<p>is there anyway to tell if both slots are working, max is 4g on this system @ 2g per slot.&nbsp; this is where i fear that one slot might not be detected, but with the other harware that drops the actual detection i would think it would be less than 2g if this
 was the case.&nbsp; i just cannot imagine this system hardware using 2g only alowing for 2g to be detected.</p>

<p>2GB is on the low side, but you can never get to use the full 4GB on<br />
32-bit Windows.</p>
<p>All 32-bit client versions of Windows (not just Vista/XP/7) have a 4GB<br />

<p>I can't see your computer, so I can't be sure of anything. But I was<br />
talking about a situation in which you had 4GB of RAM, but could only<br />
use 2GB of it. 2GB is on the low side, but nobody gets to use all 4GB.</p>
<p>Does that describe your situation? No way can I be sure, but it's<br />
certainly a possibility.</p>

    <title>How to set up Outlook Exchange on Windows 10 Mobile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hclairet  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to set up Outlook Exchange on Windows 10 Mobile</h2>
                    <p>I had to delete my Exchange account as my phone wasn't syncing correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never had a problem setting up Exchange on my Windows 10 mobile before but this time it hasn't worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm with 1&amp;1 (for now!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I did</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Settings &gt; Email and app accounts&gt; Add an account</li><li>I select Exchange (I need it to sync calendar and contacts as well as email)</li><li>I entered the email address - I checked with 1&amp;1 and it is the correct one and click next</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>It looks for the account and then creates an account.&nbsp; A new screen then comes up saying "choose an account."&nbsp; This shows
</p>
<ul>
<li>one account with a person icon, showing the email address I use to log into Office 365. Under this is the phrase "workplace or school account"</li><li>a second account with the windows logo, with no email and the phrase "assigned by your organisation" underneath.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">4. I select the second on, workplace or school account. (this is a guess - I've not had this screen before)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This brings up a screen saying "Let's get you signed in" It shows the email address for my Exchange account in the top field then a space for my password.&nbsp; Below this is says "Which Account should I use? Sign in with the username and password that you use
 with Office 365 or other business services from Microsoft"&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As I start to type in the password the screen changes and it says "it looks like
<em>[my exchange email address]</em> is being used with more than one account.&nbsp; Which account do you want to use?"&nbsp; I chose the personal option and it redirects to another password screen, with the Exchange email address.&nbsp; I type in the Exchange password and
 get the error message "your account or password is incorrect. If you don't remember your password, reset it now" This is a Windows password error message, not Exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to step 4 and chose "work or school account" the same screen comes up as with the first option.&nbsp; When I type in my Exchange password the error message says "we don't recognise this user ID or password.&nbsp; Make sure that you type the password for your
 work or school account"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the Exchange password is correct as I changed it today and it works for my PC version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called 1&amp;1 and they were of little use and could only give me the IMAP settings.&nbsp; I have tried these and it works for a few minutes then asks repeatedly for the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help gratefully received.</p>
<p>
</p><p />
