<h2>            Update for Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; 2012 Update 4 Redistributable Package &#40;KB3032622&#41; breaking NTBackup</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hallo,</p>
<p>excuse me for my mistakes but I am not a native English speaker.</p>
<p>Moreover, I already asked this question in social.technet.microsoft.com: excuse me for the duplicate request but I am really stucked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run a Windows 7 Pro sp1 x64 and I use NTBackup.exe to perform my weekly full backup (I know that NTBackup is not meant to be run on Windows 7, but it perfectly fits my needs and it perfectly run until last windows update).</p>
<p><br />
Since last windows update of 10/02/2015, NTbackup fails and in the NTBackup log I find this message: "Error returned while creating the volume shadow copy:Catastrophic failure".</p>
<p>Looking into Windows Event Log/Applications I find 3x error messages related to in VSS, where the only really significant one is "Volume Shadow Copy Service error: Unexpected error calling routine CoCreateInstance.&nbsp; hr = 0x80004002. 42554543584D4C43333533320000000042554543584D4C433334393400000000".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent the last three hours reading about potential NTBackup issues and I think I can exclude those related to VSS itself because:
</p>
<p>- the "Volume Shadow Copy" and the "Microsoft Software Shadow Copy Provider" services perfecly start, stop and restart</p>
<p>- I can browse previous versions of files being saved (e.g. because of system restore points)</p>
<p>- the "vssadmin list writers" reports all writers being stable and with no errors</p>
<p>
</p><p>I therefore wanted to try and uninstall the KB3032622 but was unable to, since it is not listed in those than can be uninstalled.</p>
<p>I also tried via command prompt (wusa /uninstall /kb:3032622) but it reports the KB is not installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here my questions:</p>
<p>1- Is anybody experiencing my issue?</p>
<p>2- Has anybody been able to solve it?</p>
<p>3- Does anybody know how to uninstall a KB that is not listed as one that can be uninstalled?</p>
<p>4- Has anybody tried to re-install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Update 4 Redistributable Package? Has it solved the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your support</p>
<p>

<p>The fact that KB3032622 is <em>not </em>listed in <strong>Installed Updates</strong> very clearly suggests the something else&nbsp;- perhaps another update you installed on 10 February 2015 - caused the

    <title>My CPU is always running at 100&#37; in TaskManager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexbankov  say:</h3>
<h2>            My CPU is always running at 100&#37; in TaskManager</h2>
                    When I open the task manager, my cpu is always at 100%. It never goes less than 100%. Programs are always changing. When Microsoft Edge is opened, its percentage is around 80% but I don't think it should be. When I open to play GTA V for example, it's
 running at 70%. All other programs add up to 100%. Shouldn't GTA V be using GPU instead of CPU? - I don't know but when I first downloaded GTA V, I had around 120fps with ULTRA settings. Now my settings are at medium and MXAA (I believe it was) is Off and
 I have 50 fps. MXAA was on 16X and I had 120fps before now when it's 16X I get 30fps. And I think it has to do something with that CPU being at 100% problem. I did soooo many things and nothing works, please help. My CPU is Intel core i7-7700HQ 2.8Ghz and
 my GPU is Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060, 3GB VRAM but on laptop.<br />

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />The CPU maxing out can be caused by a lot of different issues which include startup programs, antivirus, malware, drivers, and many others. It can even be hardware or heat.
<br />
<br />Try these :
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a process of elimination : (especially use Process Explorer and ProcMon)
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG 
<br />
<br />and hit enter

<br />
<br />===========
<br />
<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />Tips to improve PC performance in Windows 10 &lt;-- read this link

<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS and drivers.
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

            Uh well, I did a few things of that essay (which I'm so happy for, don't get me wrong) and I don't know If it was from that but on the next day, my CPU was around 1%-40% and I was really happy about it. The next day though, my CPU was at 100% again and
 I didn't know what to think. I told my self to give up and today I have got 1%-50% again.. Not going to 100% at all.. Tell me what to think :D

            Use Task Manager - Processes tab - click the head of the CPU column which brings those processes using the most CPU to the top. Note which processes are using the CPU.  The Arrow on the left of the process name if there will show more parts.

    <title>asp.net State Service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> k_ohio  say:</h3>
<h2>            asp.net State Service</h2>
                    I posted this on the ASP.Net Forums without getting a reply. I was hoping that someone here could help.<br />
<br />

<p>I am working on an ASP.Net / C# web application. It currently runs on a remote server, and I have been testing it online. (I am a tester who also does HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
 I have done a little bit of programming in the past.)<br />
Recently, we tried putting the app on my laptop computer.<br />
<br />
My laptop is running Vista Home Premium 32-bit.<br />
I have 2005 Visual Studio and SQL Server. <br />
I have the .Net Framework turned on.<br />
<br />
The problem is that, when I try to run the app on my computer, I am getting an error about the ASP.Net Session State. Part of the error&nbsp;is listed below at the end of this message.
My manager had me look in my Control Panel/Admin/Services to turn on ASP.Net Session Service. But, it was not listed on the Services list.
<br />
<br />
This may be a rather simple question, but:&nbsp; Why don't I have this Service?<br />
Does it have something to do with running 32-bit?<br />
(This is the main reason for me posting this.&nbsp;I would like to find out what is going on here. I like to learn about what is going on and why I don't have this service.)<br />
<br />
My manager had me comment out a small&nbsp;section of code in the Web Config file of the web app that referred to the State Service, and I am now able to run the app.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any help. I have checked the MSDN site and others, but because I don't have much programming experience, there is a lot that I don't understand there. I would like&nbsp;to know why I don't have this service.<br />
<br />
Here is the first part of my error message I get when I try to run/debug on my laptop:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Unable to make the session state request to the session state server. Please ensure that the ASP.NET State
 service is started and that the client and server ports are the same. &nbsp;If the server is on a remote machine, please ensure that it accepts remote requests by checking the value of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\aspnet_state\Parameters\AllowRemoteConnection.
 &nbsp;If the server is on the local machine, and if the before mentioned registry value does not exist or is set to 0, then the state server connection string must use either 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' as the server name.</span>

            I do not think Palm has updated their software to be compatible with Windows 8. &nbsp;It is their responsibility to update their software to work with the newer version of Windows. &nbsp;You will have to contact them if they plan on doing so or not.

    <title>Windows 7 BlueScreen Error 1033 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zacharymahoney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 BlueScreen Error 1033</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I recently bought a new hard drive. I installed <strong>windows 7</strong> and have been replacing my files and updating my drivers. All worked fine and yesterday nothing was going wrong with my laptop. It is a
<strong>Toshiba Satellite A665D-6082</strong>. This morning when I woke up I signed onto my computer and within about 3 minutes I got a BlueScreen error. I restarted the computer (well it restarted itself) and once again it loaded fine and not 2 minutes later
 I got the same blue screen error. Afterwards I started it in safe mode with networking which is&nbsp;what I am currently in now and everything works fine. However, I have restarted it ran recovery 4 times on different restore points all of which failed. The last
 attempt succeeded but BLAM 3 minutes later I got the BlueScreen error again. I have exhausted all of my resources and am on the verge of just reinstalling my entire OS. This is a very urgent matter as I am in the United States Air Force and really need my
 Laptop to work functionally. Below I will post the details from the error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Note:</strong></u> The only other information I can provide is that when I try to open the
<strong>Device Manager </strong>either the entire computer freeze, or I get another BlueScreen Error. Also on my device list for drivers under
<strong>Network Adaptors</strong> my <strong>Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller</strong> fails to start. I dont know if this has anything to do with it, I dont see why it would as it failed to start yesterday but everything was working fine. In addition I use
<strong>Norton 360</strong> and last night before I shut down I ran a<strong> full system scan</strong>
<strong>and repair</strong>, <strong>a disk optimization, a defragmentation, a registry cleanup, and an online backup.</strong> That is all I know and here is the code below thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BlueScreen</strong></p>

<h2>            What and where is &#34;Family Room&#34; on windows 10 network&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a homegroup network consisting of 2 windows 10 PCs (one relatively new) and a Sony Blu-Ray player.&nbsp; When I check my "network" tab with windows explorer, both PCs show 2 Arris Manageable Devices and 1 Family Room (listed under "other devices") and
 1 Family Room listed under Media Devices.&nbsp; My Sony player connects to the "Family Room" and shows umpteen folders labelled "Channel 1-100", "Channel 101-200", etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously, my Sony player used to connect to the&nbsp;original homegroup </p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions are: What is Family Room &amp; Arris?&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I need them? How do I delete them?</p>

            <p>The label is exactly that, a device that has been given that label. It would only be applicable to you and nobody else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 1st place to look is the router or whatever device acts as your DHCP server. It will show you all devices it has issued addresses to and in some cases also other units on the network that it has seen and not had to allocate an address. Associated with
 that should be the MAC Address and you can use the 1st 3 pairs of the MAC address to look up the network chip manufacturer which may identify the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't "remove" devices, they are items found to be on the network and you need to identify the device. Don't forget they include games consoles, tablets, phones and satellite tuners (channel xxx?). Arris manufacturer routers etc.</p>

    <title>Left mouse and touchpad buttons not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vetenari  say:</h3>
<h2>            Left mouse and touchpad buttons not working</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 7 a couple of weeks ago. Everything has been fine until today. Suddenly, it is a though the left mouse and touchpad buttons do not register.<br />
<br />
If I try clicking on the start bar, task bar,&nbsp; any thing icons on screen, any programs on the start menu, etc., left clicking from either the mouse or touchpad does not register.<br />
<br />
The only left click fuctionality that seems to work is from the context-sensitive menu. If I right click on the desktop and select e.g. New &gt; Folder by left clicking, the folder is created.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any idea what I can do to resolve this? I can't access anything to do anything at all on the laptop at all.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm having the exact same problem. It happened all of a sudden this morning. I have a Dell XPS Laptop... and there seems to be no apparent cause for my left mouse pad not working anymore.
<br />
<br />
You should make sure your mouse is enabled and the software updated. You can check by going Start ---&gt; Control Panel ---&gt; (Printers and Other Hardware) Mouse. I hope this helps... :/<br />

<p>An update - after 30 minutes the laptop (MSI GT729) goes into sleep mode. When I hit the power button and the PC starts again everything is fine; I can left click as normal on everything.<br />
<br />
Turned on the laptop this evening and lo and behold - no left clicking again. After 30 minutes, laptop goes to sleep. Hit power to bring it out of sleep mode and left click functionality on mouse and touchpad working again.<br />
<br />
Any ideas at all? It's very frustrating having a laptop that is effectively unusable for 30 minutes until it goes to sleep!</p>

            This is very bizarre issue. I came across this yesterday (15th Mar, 2012). I have searched for it all over the internet and there is no clue of why this is caused.<br />
<br />
After reading several posts, I came to know that it is not a Hardware vendor specific (HP or Dell), it is some what related to software, may be Microsoft Windows (as in such situations, touchpad/mouse works fine with Linux).<br />
<br />
The sad state of affair is that there is *no clue*, what causes this, and yet alone how to fix it!!!<br />
<br />
Would Microsoft please assist? Or be silent about it...this issue has been around for past 2 years.<br />

Hi all
<div><b>I have the same problem, mouse&nbsp;buttons&nbsp;are not working,</b>&nbsp;they work only with icons on a desktops and also sometimes scrolling works</div>
<div>
<p>It only happens occasionally and ALWAYS after a restart.</p>
<p>Keyboard works fine, but trying to use the USB mouse to click on any buttons within a window&nbsp;(e.g. Yes / No / Cancel etc.) will not work.</p>
<p>Also the mouse will only let me click on&nbsp;some hyperlinks in a web&nbsp;page&nbsp;but not all.</p>
<p>However, right-clicks work for me in all windows.</p>
<p>I also have the same problems using the touchpad.</p>
<p>The only way I can close open dialog boxes is by using the keyboard.</p>
<p>I have searched for a resolution to this for a few weeks now, but have been unable to find an answer to why this happens.</p>
<p><b>This method helps, but not resolves the problem completely</b></p>
<p>If I just open "task manager" by the keys;&nbsp;Ctrl&gt;Alt&gt;Delete, the hang would end&nbsp;without taking any action most times.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Guys from Microsoft, please switch your brain and help!!</p>
<p>This is a big Issue!!!</p>

            <p>I tried every possible solution I could find on the internet...and the problem did not go away.
</p>
<p>I then baught a new Laptop. The previous laptop (Lenovo T400)&nbsp;was an old machine and originally came with Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my hunt for solution, I got the impression that the issue started after some Microsoft updates. I also found that there were new updates on Lenovo websites for my Laptop, respectively. But, updates didn't help either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue has also weird behavior with Adobe's video player, the player we see on youtube.com in browser.</p>

<h2>            What to do about CTOERROR.FLG</h2>
                    <p>I have a file C:\CTOERROR.FLG that, when I open, contains the following:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Panic<br />
[12:23:48.65] 2ndCap.cmd&nbsp; : ----------------------------------------<br />
[12:23:48.65] 2ndCap.cmd&nbsp; : Detect error at extending partition... &nbsp;<br />
[12:23:48.65] 2ndCap.cmd&nbsp; : ----------------------------------------<br />
[12:23:48.65] 2ndCap.cmd&nbsp; :&nbsp; Check&nbsp; S:\ExtPart.log, or<br />
[12:23:48.65] 2ndCap.cmd&nbsp; :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\system.sav\Logs\ExtPart.log... &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>It looks as if at some stage, maybe when changing from Windows 7 to 10, or maybe before even,&nbsp; I made a hash of something.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I correct whatever is wrong? It appears to be a partition error but I can see nothing obviously wrong on the partitions. I would have posted a picture of the partitions from Disk Management but copy and paste seems not to be available on the partition
 page.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hello Santosh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your first question I can say that I am<strong> not </strong>receiving error messages related to disk partition when using the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you ask what is the make and model of my system I am unsure what information you are seeking so I hope the following provides the answer:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is a HP Compaq Presario CQ56 Notebook. &nbsp; The OS is Windows 10&nbsp; Home (previously Windows 7 Home Premium&nbsp; but now upgraded) 64-bit.&nbsp; It has an AMD V140 Processor 2.30 GHz with 3.0 RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should, perhaps, add that I had a lot of problems when the Notebook was running on Windows 7.&nbsp; I ended up having to do a HDD Copywipe followed by a re-install of the OS. Only then was I able to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to remember having a similar ERROR file in Windows 7 but now having looked in Windows.old I cannot see</p>
<p>such a file.&nbsp; Perhaps it's hidden away and I'm not looking hard enough.</p>

<h2>            Asus blu ray drive forces crash &#34;DRIVE_POWER_STATE_FAILURE  &#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Asus blu ray drive forces crash </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, I have a similar issue to that described <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/new-internal-asus-blu-ray-palyer-causes-driver/85cf7c13-8151-4271-8702-56a25383eeef">
here</a>. I have just built my new system, including the Asus BC12 D1ST CD/DVD/BR drive mentioned in the link. I install the drive, and boot, and it works initially. I have tested it by playing a few DVDs and Blu Ray discs and it appears to work fine.<br />
However the next time I boot, it works normally for a while, then randomly I get the DRIVE_POWER_STATE_FAILURE&nbsp; message and the computer auto-reboots.<br />
Once rebooted, it will not detect the drive and it is inactive. in fact, it doesn't even see it in the BIOS.<br />
If I turn off, change the SATA connection the drive is connected to on the motherboard and reboot, it then "sees" the drive again and it functions normally until some random time after the next re-boot, as described above.<br />
Could somebody help me find a solution please?<br />
<br />
edit: link to my minidump files: <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/#cid=BB2E1A77CB28CAE4&amp;id=BB2E1A77CB28CAE4!105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://skydrive.live.com/#cid=BB2E1A77CB28CAE4&amp;id=BB2E1A77CB28CAE4!105</a><br />
<br />
I would be extremely grateful for some prompt help, before I get demoralised. This is my first ever computer build from scratch, and I did it all on my own with no help.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Thank you for providing all the important information related to the issue.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>The information in Blue screen error message shows that the issue is caused by “ntoskrnl.exe” and “atapi.sys” driver installed on the computer.
</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Usually, the error message could occur due to a driver which is in an inconsistent or invalid power state. It could also occur due to disk errors present on the computer.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>First of all, I would suggest you to check if all the updates offered from Windows update are installed. There could be optional drivers available for better functionality of the hardware device connected to the computer.
 Refer to the link to check for updates:</font></font></font></p>

</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If there are no updates pending, follow the methods and check if it resolves the issue:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Method 1:</strong></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I would suggest you to refer to the manufacturer website to download and install the latest driver for the hardware devices that are connected/installed&nbsp;on the computer.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Check if you receive the same error message after updating all the drivers. If yes, move to next method.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Method 2:</strong></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Let’s check if it’s disk error which is causing this issue. Refer to the link to run disk error checking tool from Windows:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Refer the section “<strong>To repair a drive</strong>”:</font></font></font></p>

            Yes auggy, every time I get the error message and forced reboot the drive becomes invisible. Yes I have tried swapping the cables out.<br />
&nbsp;By the way I am running Windows 8 64 bit Pro and the problem-drive is an Asus BC-12D1ST.<br />
EDIT:<br />
By the way, I just noticed another stage in the system-drive-fail process.<br />
I took the offending drive out to obtain the serial number to report this on Asus's website, and noticed that there is an additional stage to the fail process.<br />
When I put the drive back in and reboot, it fails to boot into Windows after the POST. I get the BIOS splash screen and the columns of data. Then it normally says "Verifying DMI data" and Windows starts. But the first time (first time only,) after reinstalling
 the drive it fails to boot into Windows at this point. Subsequently it boots normally, and follows the pattern described in my initial post.<br />
<br />
I think the quickest way to get this solved is to take the drive back to my local friendly computer shop and chose a different model.<br />

            Hi, I did all these things and got as far as booting in safe mode. I left it running all afternoon in safe mode and nothing happened. this is all I can do because basically none of my programs work in safe mode.<br />
So please what am I to conclude from the fact that the computer, including the blu ray drive, works in safe mode?<br />
<br />
I was a bit concerned when I looked in Device Manager and saw the driver Windows uses for the optical device hasn't been updated since 2006 and my lovely (expensive!) blu ray drive is merely listed as a generic "CD ROM" drive!<br />
<br />
I'm actually itching to pull that drive out, obtain a refund and install one from a different manufacturer to see if that makes a difference. T.b.h. I'm probably not going to watch that many blu ray films, but it would have been nice to have that option. :-(<br />

<p><br />
There appears to be an update F4 (for rev. 4.1):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4305&amp;dl=1#bios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4305&amp;dl=1#bios</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the risk involved in updating the BIOS it may be prudent to try a different drive&nbsp;or do further troubleshooting with the present drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no issue now with the drive being recognized&nbsp;by the BIOS?</p>

            Hi, the problem with the computer's issue is that it is "intermittent", "periodic" and "cyclical". I would not have believed it possible for a brand new drive, brand new computer and brand new operating system to experience this kind of failure.<br />
As I said in my original post, after I re-installed the drive (on different mobo SATA connectors,) to try to eliminate mechanical/electrical issues, and reboot, the drive works fine- until some time after you NEXT reboot. Then it disappears from the BIOS, despite
 still being in situ, and I get the Windows 8 memory dump and blue screen.<br />
However you are right, I will try the F4 BIOS update- whilst the drive is freshly installed and working!<br />
<br />
EDIT: BIOS update completed successfully, however the drive is dead again. Will try one more time re-installing it but I think it needs replacing.<br />
        </p>

            Hi Pinaki Mohanty, thankyou very much for your diagnostic support<br />
I got started with Step 2, and managed to eliminate the startup program which was causing the issue, which turned out to be Java (TM) Update Scheduler.<br />
Once this was eliminated the optical drive functioned perfectly again, without having to physically re-install it.<br />
However, please can you advise me on what to do next- do I now simply leave Java without any updates? Or do I carry on with the diagnostic process and start with the "Services" tab in msconfig?<br />
I think I will contact Oracle and see if they have a bug fix for this, since it is useful to keep Java running smoothly on my system.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
It turns out it wasn't Java causing the issues after all- on my next reboot I got another BSOD. Have taken PC into friendly local repair shop to see if they can solve this issue! Back to the drawing board.<br />

            This is just information message that remind you that you have to run only one Firewall at the time, it doesn't mean that you have two firewall. But you could check Windows Security Center and under firewall , you will see name of firewall that you have.
 If it is more than one then disable another but if it is only one then you are fine.

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try pressing the <strong>windows key + P</strong> on your keyboard and select
<strong>Extend?&nbsp;</strong>If it doesn't work, I'll recommend to update the display adapter drivers on your PC from device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please let&nbsp; us know what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>In Display settings I can see that Win10 sees my HDMI connected monitor, but it doesn't send any signal to the monitor.&nbsp; And the monitor reports no signal received.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Try pressing Win+Ctrl+Shift+B&nbsp; (more than once, with psychic pauses between retries). &nbsp; FWIW something happened to my Surface 2 Pro today which is even worse.&nbsp; It seems W10 on a Surface gets into a state where it simply can't use real HDMI.&nbsp; E.g. I still
 have the HDMI-HDMI Surface adapter but inserted a HDMI-VGA converter and switched to a VGA cable.&nbsp; Now my second screen works, whereas before W10 wouldn't do anything useful with it.&nbsp; Usually I can at least fix your symptom with the Win+Ctrl+Shift+B but not
 today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there is something else going on with W10 and Surface from the last couple of updates.&nbsp; My MWDA won't connect either.</p>
<p>

            I too&nbsp; have this problem in Firefox, and am curious if anyone has gotten an answer other than rolling back the update - again - which also likely will roll back IE 10 to IE 9 - again.

    <title>Windows 7 BSOD Physical Memory Usage Too High - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthony baratheon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 BSOD Physical Memory Usage Too High</h2>
                    I am using an Acer Aspire 5253 Laptop with an AMD &nbsp;E 350 1.6Ghz dual core processor and 4GB of RAM. Over a week ago whenever I log on my computer's physical memory usage would gradually increase from its normal range of 30%-40% up to 95+%, to the point
 where I could not open or load any programs due to "insufficient memory". Eventually the memory would get so high I would get a BSOD and each time I do get onethe memory dump it makes takes up a ton of space which I am not sure whether or not to delete it
 or save it, in hope that Windows Error Reporting would work and I could send it to them for help. A few times the memory returned to normal, once when windows recovered from a BSOD and once when I unchecked a few unnecessary start-up programs, but it only
 remained normal until I shutdown the computer. Initially this problem&nbsp;
<div>only affected one account on my computer but today all the accounts on my computer have high physical memory. I have run MalwareBytes, McAfee, and Windows Defender Scans in Safe Mode; Hardware and Memory Diagnostics; Microsoft FixIt (which told me about
 the too many start-up programs); Windows Update; and Event Viewer (tells me I have over 7000 errors since the problems really started getting serious), all of which have not even told me what the problem is or how to fix it. However, ever since I unchecked
 those unnecessary start-up programs the memory usage has gone down from 95+% to 85%-95%. On another note my videos often stall behind the audio and my audio&nbsp;</div>
<div>sometimes degenerates into electronic buzzing, freezing everything else until it is sorts itself out (probably something wrong with my drivers that I do not understand). I am at my wits end and am seriously considering a System Restore, though I would
 lose 6 months of data since my last backup was in April 2013 and after reading a couple other threadshere I found out that A System Restore doesn't always fix the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help me and if you can please explain the solution very simply to me, I am scared of deleting anything in fear of breaking my system beyond repair.</div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Make a current backup just in case the issues get worse.<br />
<br />
Check with the support and&nbsp;forums&nbsp;for any programs being used when this happens</p>
<p>as they are likely to be at fault and probably there will be known issues.<br />
<br />
Check with Acer Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, diagnostics, and ask<br />
in their forums about any known issues. Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and</p>
<p>the major on-board and separate device drivers. Especially the video.<br />

    <title>How can my playback device switch to HDMI when I plug in the HDMI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peteronthesurface  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can my playback device switch to HDMI when I plug in the HDMI cable&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Dell XPS M1330 laptop running Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; It has the internal sound card and a HDMI output (among other things!).<br />
<br />
Now, I have set my playback device default to be the "Speakers/Headphone".&nbsp; However, when I plug in the HDMI cable (to connect to a HD TV), the audio does not switch to the HDMI output, but rather stays playing through the speakers.&nbsp; I have to manually go into
 the Sound control panel and change the default device.<br />
<br />
How can I have the playback device automatically switch between speakers (when there is no HDMI cable) and HDMI output (when it detects the HD TV)?

<p><span>Hi Peter,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue occurs because the audio device driver for the HDMI output port incorrectly reports the cable state. Try
 the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong> and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>. </span></span></li><li>
<span><span>Click
<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>. </span></span></li><li>
<span><span>Under
<strong>Sound</strong>, click <strong>Manage audio devices</strong>. </span></span></li><li>
<span><span>Click the playback device from which you want to output sound.
</span></span></li><li>
<span><span>Click
<strong>Set Default</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. </span></span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know if this worked.</span></p>
<p><span>All the best!</span></p>

            Hi Samhrutha,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response.&nbsp; I have followed your steps, but this requires me to change the default playback device each time I connect the cable.<br />
<br />
Can you advise how I can correct the system, so that the "cable state is correct reported" and so that the playback device changes automatically?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Peter

            Hi Manuel, Thank you again.&nbsp; It appears that Im unable to locate the stickynotes.snt file anywhere in the machine. A search finds nothing so I am assuming I may be stuck.

    <title>Saving Recorded Call Issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Saving Recorded Call Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've recorded a 30 minute Skype video call. I am able to play the file as it appears in the chat log.</p>
<p>However, when I make any attempt to save to downloads or save as, the file appears as 0 bytes and I get a corrupted file message.</p>
<p>I am using a brand new laptop with Windows 10 with all recent updates.</p>
<p>Is there another way of saving this file through a browser or other method?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Seth</p>

    <title>POWER PLAN DEFAULTS TO POWER SAVER AFTER RESTART - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            POWER PLAN DEFAULTS TO POWER SAVER AFTER RESTART</h2>
                    Hi. &nbsp;I have a new Samsung laptop running Windows 8. &nbsp;I have selected 'Samsung Optimized' as the power plan of choice. &nbsp;All good as long as the laptop stays on. &nbsp;As soon as its shut down and restarted the power plan defaults back to 'Power Saver'.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This was never an issue with Vista. &nbsp;How do I get it to stick? &nbsp;An easy way out would be to change the Power Saver plan to my own preferences as the system is defaulting to this anyway but I prefer it to do what it should. &nbsp;Cheers all.</div>
