<h2>            User friendly task bar and Steam &#40;Team Fortress 2&#41; Bug</h2>
                    <p>One thing that I would love for the different monitors is to have same app opened on different desktop. More like, just treating the other desktop like a whole new one, for example, not showing all the apps that are running on the other desktop, it makes
 it more confusing to see all those apps in the task bar ( at least for me). For example, if I have my work desktop and my "lazy" desktop. I don't want to see the Netlfix app in the task bar while I'm working on the other desktop. Another thing that can make
 the desktops more friendly is naming them (like just giving a name to different desktops so it never gets confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another bug that i encountered is while playing on a Team Fortress 2 server, my Steam is closing itself down each 20 min. Yes, I actually timed it. Though it only happens when I'm playing on a public TF2 server. If I'm playing on a private server, it doesn't
 close it self, whereas if it's public it only runs for 20 min and then closes Steam. I'm not sure if the same thing would happen to other games (I don't have any).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary: Make different desktops completely different and possibly add an option to name the desktops. And try to fix the Steam (TF2) bug.</p>

            <p><strong>Virtual Desktops</strong></p>
<p>yeah i agree totally, the way they are implementing virtual desktops so far is NOT good, many people want complete separation with different background , apps, etc..</p>
<p>linux systems are a good example of this</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Team Fortress 2</strong><strong>/steam</strong></p>
<p>I was unable to reproduce the problem you had with steam while playing teamfortress2 on my win10tp rig, i played it online for several hours.&nbsp; you should post your memory and video information from dxdiag so that perhaps we can narrow down systems or video
 cards affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thought...&nbsp; did you freshly install windows 10TP from the latest .ISO or has it been upgraded? a clean install direct from the ISO seems to resolve many problems in windows10TP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my Video Information from dxdiag</p>

<h2>            N97 - Weird issues with Internet connectivity</h2>
                    
<p><font>Hi and happy new year! I wonder whether any of you has experienced the issues I do after upgrading the software version of Nokia N97&nbsp;from 12 to 20.0.019. I upgraded on 30.12 and since then the following problems arosed:</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>1. Usually I was able to browse the Internet using WLAN in which I selected the WLAN network (known or unknown) and then clicked "Start web browsing". Then the browser connected to the specified network and I was&nbsp;online. After
 the upgrade if I do the same, the browser does not connect to the selected network, but tries to connect with some other access point, the name of which has been remembered&nbsp;somehow in the browser. I am able to connect with the desired network only if I explicitly
 click "Connect" first and then "Start web browsing". This of course is highly inconvenient and requires more time.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>2. Every time I start the browser from the Applications menu and try to browse using my GSM packet data connection (HSDPA and EDGE), the first site I open makes the browser establish the packet data session. Prior to the update
 the site opened just after the session has been established. Now the error message "Web: Unable to perform operation" is displayed. If I try to go to the site again (no matter which site after the session has been established) it works and there no problem
 with any other site until the browser is closed. Since the packet data session is also closed, the same problem reoccurs if the browser is reopened.
</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>The new version of the software brings cool features like the improved touchscreen navigation, but I regret updating it as this greatly hindered my web experience. I hope this will be fixed in the future or if I have misconfigured
 something, please help. Thanks in advance. :)</font></p>

<p>Hi, after update did you hard reset phone and format mass memory ? This basically gives you a 'new' phone and a fresh start, abit of a pain as you have to re-install everything , but it works. Also before doing all the hard work just check the settings in
 the connectivity settings. Go to destinations-internet-options-organise and set your home wifi as priority 1, wap services priority 2, and Gprs as 3, the phone will then connect to home whenever in range and move down the list when out of range. Hope this
 helps,</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p><font>Hi and thanks for your reply. I didn't do a hard reset after the update. Actually I backed up the phone using Nokia Ovi Suite and then restored it after the update. Interestingly, the program said that the restore failed
 but all the settings were OK. </font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>Currently the browser's access point in&nbsp;Options-Settings-General-Access Point is set to "Ask when needed". Thus, if I start the browser manually and navigate to a web page, the application offers me to select a connection
 - "Search for WLAN", connect using a preferred WLAN (if found in range)&nbsp;that I have saved in Destinations-Internet and "WAP Services" which is my HSDPA connection. This is excellent and I found that I can work around the issue 1 if manually start the browser
 and select the WLAN when it offers me to search for one. But, the second problem is driving me nuts. If I select the EDGE/HSDPA connection it displays the error "Web:Unable to perform operation" (the status icon of the GSM signal then changes to display that
 a 3.5G session has been established) and the page will open only if I click to reload it.
</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>Maybe it is worth resetting it, but I will lose my messages and contacts probably. I also have some paid services like Shazam and wonder whether the license will be gone after resetting. Jesus, I thought newer version of software
 are supposed to be better... what a horrible mistake.</font></p>

            <font>I cleaned up some access points (there were 35 of them) in Destinations and also removed 5 uncategorized ones. After that the error appeared neither when using WLAN, nor using the 3.5G connection. I really hope the
 problem will not recur. If it does not do so in the following days&nbsp;I will post another message listing&nbsp;my settings so that other users can benefit from the 'solution' if they need to. Anyway, thanks for your time, carman58. :)</font>

            <font>Unfortunately it does recur. And of course it is the worst case scenario - you can't tell under what cirumstances the error is displayed and when it is not. Currently I can tell that restarting the phone fixes it, but
 after connecting once with WLAN the 3G connection has this issue and then recurrs randomly. I won't hard reset for now but if this becomes too obtrusive I may reconsider. Hopefully this is something that is going to be fixed in the next firmware version (yes,
 I still believe that newer software SHOULD be better...). :smileysad:</font>

            <font>Hi. You can connect to a WLAN if you click on the button, then Settings--&gt;Connectivity--&gt;WLAN. The device will then show the wireless networks in range. Choose a wireless network, click on it and then "Connect" from
 the context menu. If you connect successfully, a new access point will be created in Settings--&gt;Connectivity--&gt;Destinations--&gt;Internet. From the "Destinations" menu you can also manually create an access point (e.g. for a hidden network). An HSDPA connection
 can also be configured by choosing "Access Point-add new acc.pt." from the Destinations menu. Just choose "Packet data" when it asks you for the connection type.

<h2>            How to set a free upgraded W7 PC to insiders account.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I signed up for insider program just before WX released. I purchased a WX&nbsp;Pro&nbsp;32 bit OEM and installed to a new hard drive. I get build releases on that drive.&nbsp;I had removing my W7 Home 32 bit OEM&nbsp;drive, and replacing&nbsp;every now and then&nbsp;for,,, well I don't
 know why. I finally upgraded it with the media creation to iso from an older build. The Get insider builds is null.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get this active or a way to&nbsp;download&nbsp;the&nbsp;latest build?&nbsp;Current Version 10.0.10240 Build 10240. I just can't live with this ugly window dressing in earlier builds.</p>

            Type of email account in outlook?
<div>- Outlook.com (Although this shouldn't matter, I'm not creating tasks from e-mail, just creating them in OneNote and sending to Outlook 2013)
<div><br />
<div>Is outlook opened when you are creating the task, does it help if outlook is closed?</div>
<div>- Yes, Outlook is opened. When Outlook is closed, this problem does not occur</div>
<div><br />
<div>Does this error pop up only with custom dates?</div>
<div>- Yes. All other Outlook task creation from OneNote work fine. Custom dates open a separate window so I can put a specific date to the task (rather than "today", "tomorrow", "this week", etc.).</div>
<div><br />
<div>And if it helps, this problem did not occur in OneNote and Outlook 2010 - just when I switched over to 2013.</div>

            Yes, the scenario is exactly the same.<br />
<br />
I select a text to transform into a task. Press Ctrl+Shift+K. A task window appears. I start filling in the various fields. And when I try to click Save&amp;Close the mentioned error message pops up. I have to close without saving. Then open the task again and
 fill the fields one more time. It's rather irritating and time-consuming.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, I don't know what a blank profile is. And secondly I pay a monthly fee for this service so I believe I'm not the one who should be repairing it.</p>

<p>Is there a real Microsoft support, like someone who I can call and stick to them until they fix my problem?</p>

<h2>            &#91;firefox issue&#93; &#34;Send to Onenote&#34; Clip for Firefox</h2>
                    Halo Onenote users,<br />
<br />
I use Firefox web browser and installed the add-ons "Clip to Onenote" and "Bring to Onenote"<br />
<br />
My isssue is that they do not include some elements of page to the clip.<br />
e.g. On this forum we see the following:<br />
<br />
<p>=====</p>
<p>Question </p>
<p><span>"User-Name" </span><span>asked on</span> "Date"</p>
<p>"Title-of-Question"</p>
<p>=====</p>
<br />
Those two add-ons exclude the "Date" , "Me To", etc. from the clip. <br />
The add-on "Send to Onenote" via Internet Explorer includes them.<br />
<br />
- Why is it so ?<br />
- Is there "Send to Onenote" for Firefox ?<br />
<br />
<br />
NB: I still like using Firefox instead of InternetExplorer. <br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
.<br />

            Thank you for the reply.
<div><br />
<div>Well, I did mention on the previous post that I used those two add-ons on firefox.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is firefox that does not include some elements of the html page while copying them. If I use Internet Explorer and SWare-Iron, and manually select and copy some lines including those elements, they are copied.</div>
<div>Perhaps, I will use SWare-Iron again; I stopped using it a couple of months ago. Those two add-ons are available for it too.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

    <title>Outlook email template change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robert mitchell &#40;rmitchell&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook email template change</h2>
                    <p>A couple of months ago an update was pushed out to my computer and it changed the formatting template in my Outlook emails.&nbsp; The spacing after hitting the enter key changed so it defaults to 10pt.&nbsp; So every time I hit "enter" to go to a new line, it adds
 an extra space between them.&nbsp; If I want a space, I'll add it myself by hitting enter twice.&nbsp; Sometimes I don't want one, and this makes is a big pain in the butt to undo it when that's the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated the template in Word, and got it changed to where the 10pt after spacing was not the default.&nbsp; And this works for new messages.&nbsp; But it still gives me the 10pt on replies, and I can't figure out how to fix that.&nbsp; Is it locked in because the people
 who are sending to me got the same update and I'm stuck mirroring their formatting?&nbsp; Or is this something that I can fix in my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            You need to change the style in outlook to use no spacing style or remove the extra space from the default style. 
<br />
<br />In outlook, go to the styles, expand the change  style setting and set as default. Instructions are here - <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/problems/messages-are-double-spaced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/problems/messages-are...</a>

<p>Hi there&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/24185727-10ce-47bb-8e55-c39472b2ae0c" title="Thuan Soldier"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Thuan Soldier</span></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Can you confirm what iOS and Skype version you have? If you are using the new Skype application v.8.2 then the statuses available are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Active Now</span></li><li><span>Last seen&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Do not Disturb</span></li></ul>
<p><span>The status will show as <strong>Active Now</strong> whenever you are signed in and online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2ffa300xx%2ffa34742_1.png" /></span></p>
<p>It will show as <strong>Last seen</strong> and how long ago you were online when you are signed out or offline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2ffa300xx%2ffa34742_2.png" /></p>
<p>You can set your status to <strong>Do not Disturb </strong>to let your contacts know that you are currently not available. This will stop all messages notification though you can still receive Skype calls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To change your status to Do not Disturb:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Tap your <strong>profile picture </strong>in the <strong>Chats </strong>screen.&nbsp;</li><li>Tap the bell icon&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2ffa300xx%2ffa34742_bell.png" />and tap to

<h2>            5300 XM Cold Storage</h2>
                    
<p>I recently retired my 5300 for the 5800. I want to keep it as a backup. My question is, how should I store it and the battery? I assume the battery should be removed, however, I would like to keep the unit -- which I love -- in good working order in case
 I need it for a backup or go someplace I don't want to take the 5800 (like on a bike ride).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm planning to bag it and keep it in a cool drawer and bag the battery and keep it separate. Is that correct?</p>

            I am more concerned with safety and longevity. I don't care if I have to recharge the battery on reuse. I want to make sure I do not damage the unit during it's idle period.

a. Go to Start and in the search type "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
b. Click on "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
c. Browse to the Internet Explore and uncheck the mark in front of Internet Explorer 8.<br />
d. Restart the computer<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>Step 2.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Enable the Internet Explorer 8:</span></strong><br />
a. Go to Start and in the search type "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
b. Click on "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
c. Browse to the Internet Explorer and place a check mark in front of Internet Explorer 8.<br />

<br />
<br />Are talking about outlook.com or Office Outlook?
<br />
<br />If you are using online version you can use only one account per time.
<br />Other one you can add only as connected account. 
<br />
<br />Look here: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-your-other-email-accounts-to-outlook-com-c5224df4-5885-4e79-91ba-523aa743f0ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-yo...</a>

<p>Thanks Mark. I am working within a business email system Outlook 2016. I want to set up a group of three people for emails to come into from internal source and evenly split the emails so the workload is shared among the three people. Is that possible in
 outlook? I was reading about the arbitrary outlook function but it sounded like a moderator had to manually assign each project.</p>

    <title>Possible Fault in Paragraph Numbering, Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve_r_w  say:</h3>
<h2>            Possible Fault in Paragraph Numbering, Word 2010</h2>
                    
<p><span>I am writing a technical document that details complex cloud services supplied by my Customer. My Customer has not started their migration project to Windows 7
 &amp; Office 2010 – so the document must be written in Word 2007 compatibility mode. The document is due for delivery about now – but will probably not be upgraded to Word 2010 for at least a year.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I moved some of the sections to appendices – as they refer to functions that are very rarely used (e.g. during installation).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have about 20 references to appendices in a document of (so far) ~ 150 pp that my Customer tells me will be subject to continuous revision as their service develops.
 Cross references that will automatically update are therefore essential as hand updating every link would be too time consuming and potentially quite complex.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All headings are linked to a single Multi-level List. I have checked, double checked and re-checked so many times – there are definitely no clashes between the
 Multi-level List definitions and the Heading Style definitions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I re-defined the styles Heading 4 and Heading 5 in order to match the styles Heading 1 and Heading 2 – with the exception that the paragraph numbering is styled:
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Appendix 1</span></strong><span>(for a Heading 4)</span></p>
<p><span>and</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Appendix 1.1</span></strong><span>(for a Heading 5).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In both styles the word Appendix is just text in the paragraph numbering field, and the paragraphs are numbered by only including numbers for Numbering Level 4
 and Numbering Level 4 &amp; 5 respectively.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, obviously, I made sure that paragraph numbering restarts at the first Heading 4.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The resulting cross-reference links (not headings) look like this: “For more on Factor Y see</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Appendix 2, Factor Y, p. 120</span></strong><span>”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span> … and “For more on Substance Z see</span></p>
<p><span>Appendix 3.3, Substance Z, p. 130”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Where:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-<strong><span>Appendix 2</span>
</strong>is a cross-reference to a paragraph number (from the Heading numbering scheme), hyperlink off</span></p>
<p><span>(as appears in Ribbon &gt; Insert &gt; Cross Reference &gt; Reference type: Numbered item &gt; Insert Reference to: Paragraph number)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-<strong><span>,&lt;space&gt;</span>
</strong>is initially plain text (Normal style)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-<strong><span>Factor Y</span>
</strong>is a cross-reference to the corresponding Heading Text, hyperlink off</span></p>
<p><span>(as appears in Ribbon &gt; Insert &gt; Cross Reference &gt; Reference type: Heading &gt; Insert Reference to: Heading text)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-<strong><span>,&lt;space&gt;p.&lt;space&gt;</span></strong>is initially plain text (Normal style)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-<strong><span>120</span>
</strong>is a cross-reference to a page number, hyperlink off</span></p>
<p><span>(as appears in Ribbon &gt; Insert &gt; Cross Reference &gt; Reference type: Numbered item &gt; Insert Reference to: Page number)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Problem 1.</span></p>
<p><span>Whenever I reach the end of the cross reference definition stage – and whenever links are updated – the paragraph number cross-reference has the numbers 11 added
 – like this:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>11Appendix 2, Factor Y, p. 120</span></strong></p>
<p><span>and</span></p>
<p><strong><span>11Appendix 3.3, Substance Z, p. 130</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This error appears both before and after the application of a hyper-link overlay – see Microsoft Answers (Question:</span><span>Cross References do Not Work as Expected</span><span>,
 posted Fri Oct 15)</span> <span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have searched the document for errors, and the Microsoft forums, and help utility, for what seems like forever.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have even completely re-written the document, over two nights, from scratch, to ensure I have eliminated any hidden style or numbering errors – but they are
 still there. I just cannot fathom where these numbers are coming from.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can delete the characters<strong>11</strong> by using keyboard arrow keys and &lt;Back Space&gt;.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I then tried to disable ‘update fields’</span></p>
<p><span>(Ribbon &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Display &gt; Update fields before printing &gt; remove tick [remove check mark])</span></p>
<p><span>… in order to get a printed document without them but, let’s face it – it’s a kludge.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Problem 2.</span></p>
<p><span>Even the kludge doesn’t always work!</span></p>
<p><span>Last week I updated all references</span></p>
<p><span>(go to Contents page, &lt;Ctrl&gt; A [select all doc.], right click Table of Contents, click update)</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span> … then hand-deleted the score of rogue instances of<strong>11</strong> characters and saved the document, then printed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The printed version still came with the<strong>11</strong> characters!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I reckon there’s a Word 2010 bug there somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Interestingly, problem 1 only appears in cross references - and not in Table of Contents, which works as advertised.</span></p>
<p><span>When I toggle field codes for:</span></p>
<p><span>See also 11Appendix 1, Minimum Computer Requirements, p. 140.</span></p>
<p><span>… it reads:</span></p>
<p><span>See also { REF _Ref270496591 \r \h \*MERGEFORMAT} , { REF _Ref270496591 \h \* MEGEFORMAT }, p. { PAGEREF _Ref270496591 \h }.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to ask.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for listening.</span></p>

<p>Make sure that you are not tracking changes. With track changes active, any numbering (as well as fields displaying numbering) may be incorrect in Word.</p>
<p>Also, did you set up the numbered list as suggested in the links below?</p>

<div>I'm bamboozled by the phantom "11," but, after reading part of your previous thread, I think I can offer some suggestions. It appears that you are overlaying your cross-references with hyperlinks so that they will have hyperlink formatting.
 This is not necessary; the cross-references can be inserted as hyperlinks, and the formatting can be applied as explained in&nbsp;<a href="http://sbarnhill.mvps.org/WordFAQs/FormatCrossReferences.htm#FormatFont" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sbarnhill.mvps.org/WordFAQs/FormatCrossReferences.htm#FormatFont</a>.
 The only thing you would lose would be the tooltip "Click to go there," which is probably not required for most readers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It may be that if you simplify the construction of the cross-references (by omitting the added hyperlinks), the "11" problem will also be solved.</div>

            Hi Suzanne,<br />
<br />
The problem appears both pre and post hyper-link application - as previously detailed.&nbsp; It is therefore extremely unlikely that the application of hyper-links is the root cause of the phantom 11.&nbsp; My motivation for mentioning hyper-link application was merely
 to highlight that the problem is fundamental to cross references based on appendix numbering.<br />
<br />
I previously inserted the cross references as hyper-links, but this gave me the two problems discussed in my previous thread.<br />
<br />
The solution I was given in my previous thread helped me to get the visual and functional result I was aiming for - for a document designed to be read on both paper and screen.&nbsp; I am therefore not inclined to look at going back to three separate links.<br />
<br />
It's easy to say that the Screen Tip (formerly: tooltip) is probably not required for most readers - until your customer has seen it and given it their seal of approval...&nbsp; Anyway, I have that now, applied using - separate - hyperlink overlay.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your input.

<p>Hi Steve</p>
<p>I'm mulling this over, but no "lightening bolts", yet...</p>
<p>1. You should be able to stop the 11 from appearing when you print if you either turn off the "update fields" in the Printing options (Advanced tab) OR by locking fields (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+F11 -- Ctrl+Shift+F11 unlocks).</p>
<p>2. Are all three "higher" Heading + numbering levels being used in the document? Or is level 3 "empty"? What are the numbering formats for those levels?</p>

<p>Hi Cindy,</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by Printing Options (Advanced tab).&nbsp; Remember I'm using 2010 - perhaps you mean:</p>
<p>Ribbon &gt; File tab &gt; Options &gt; Display &gt; Printing options &gt; Update fields before printing &gt; remove tick [remove check mark]) ?</p>
<p>I have already tried that - as per my reply to Stefan.</p>
<p>There is also:</p>
<p>Ribbon &gt; File tab &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Print &gt; Allow fields containing tracked changes to update before printing &gt; remove tick [remove check mark])</p>
<p>But this second option should, surely, only kick in when:</p>
<p>Ribbon &gt; Review tab &gt; Track Changes is switched on?&nbsp; It is not, as per my previous conversation with Stefan.&nbsp; I have removed that tick anyway as Word's Track Changes feature will not be used by my Customer.</p>
<p>I will try the &lt;Ctrl&gt; F11 idea next time I need to print.&nbsp; If it works ... it's not really a long-term solution, is it.</p>
<p>It may take a while before I can try &lt;Ctrl&gt; F11 as I need to get on with drafting the next document while the current one waits for review on Friday.</p>
<p>The numbering scheme is:</p>
<p>Heading One / Numbering level 1 - Para. No.s = Lvl. 1 only in Headers, no text in paragraph number - Uses page break before and is only used once per Section - Breaks down doc into main areas.&nbsp; There are 11 of Heading One.</p>
<p>Heading Two / Numbering level 2 - Para. No.s = Lvl. 1 &amp; 2 in Headers, no text in paragraph number - Introduces main subjects, designed to make TOC an easy reference for Users to find info. / activities.&nbsp; There are 44 of Heading Two.</p>
<p>Heading Three / Numbering Level 3 - Para. No.s = Lvl. 1, 2 &amp; 3 in Headers, no text in paragraph number - Breaks down some of the larger level 2 subjects, also designed to make TOC an easy reference for Users to find info. / activities.&nbsp; There are 57 of Heading
 3.</p>
<p>Heading Four / Numbering Level Appendix 1 - Para. No.s = Lvl. 4 only in Headers, with text 'Appendix' in paragraph number - Uses page break before and is only used once per Appendix - Breaks down appendices of little-used, but vital, reference info. into
 main areas.&nbsp; Designed to make for easy cross-reference within doc. for new and infrequent Users.&nbsp; There are 3 of Heading Four.</p>
<p>Heading Five / Numbering Level Appendix 2 - Para. No.s = Lvl. 4 &amp; 5 in Headers, with text 'Appendix' in paragraph number - Breaks down appendices into small reference bites, mostly simple facts.&nbsp; Designed to make for easy cross-reference within doc. for
 new and infrequent Users.&nbsp; There are 12 of Heading Five.</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>
Still looks like a fault to me.<br />

<p>Hi Steve</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;I'm not sure what you mean by Printing Options (Advanced tab).&nbsp; I have already tried that - as per my reply to Stefan.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;I will try the &lt;Ctrl&gt; F11 idea next time I need to print.&nbsp; If it works ... it's not really a long-term solution, is it.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>No, but it would be a stop-gap while getting to the bottom of what's going on AND it would be interesting to know if it did not work (I expect it to, but if it didn't that would be important).</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;The numbering scheme is:&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Thanks for that... Unfortunately, I'm not able to reproduce the problem based on this information. I do find it... interesting... that you're seeing 11 and there are 11 instances of Heading 1 in the document. If you were to remove a couple of the Headings,
 or add a couple, does the 11 change?</p>
<p>I notice you mention "once per section". Your document has section breaks? These are notorious for causing "odd behavior". Perhaps the section breaks are damaged. Have you have tried copying all the text<em>except</em> the section breaks and the last paragraph
 mark to a new document? Recreating the section breaks as you go (no copying!)?</p>
<p>I did see two anomalous behaviors:</p>
<p>1. When I went to change the Heading 1 &amp; 4 styles to "page break before" the text indent in the numbering definition for level 4&nbsp;changed to -22.something inches (not an acceptable value) after changing the setting for Heading 1. No idea why that should be.
 I corrected that, then was able to change the setting for Heading 4.</p>
<p>2. Ctrl+Dragging a numbered heading unlinked that numbering from the ListStyle I had applied and linked to the Heading style. I had to apply the Normal style, then re-apply the Heading style.</p>

            Hi Cindy, You asked "I do find it... interesting... that you're seeing 11 and there are 11 instances of Heading 1 in the document. If you were to remove a couple of the Headings, or add a couple, does the 11 change?" The answer is yes. I discovered this
 while reducing the main document down to a new style sheet. I also discovered that the multi-level list that I had defined for the document has been converted by Word into a simple numbered list. Word did not ask, or prompt, before doing this. My best guess
 is that this may have to do with the fact that I am writing this in 2007 compatibility mode. What do you think? I may try saving it in 2010 to see if I can remove the numbered list and apply a multi-level list again. If it works I may have to ask for someone
 in Marketing to be upgraded to 2010 in order to handle the portfolio of documents I am completing. My Customer will be looking for trial subjects, so maybe it won't be that difficult... You also asked: "I notice you mention 'once per sect

<p>Hi Cindy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry it took so long to respond - I have suffered a series of blue screen crashes with Windows 7 that trashed a lot of my work.&nbsp; I had backups, of course, but it still took a long time to recover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your tip on using F11 to lock and unlock fields was very useful.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; It has enabled me to put a finished document in front of my customer, and they are happy (though they haven't had to try and edit the doc themselves yet ... ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still unsure how the paragraph numbering error occurs.&nbsp; As far as I can tell I am using the multilevel list function correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously: It's a bug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your support.</p>

<p>Great, you "smoke and mirrored" your client during a show-and-tell, but you still have to fix the problem before delivering it. Or do you plan to let them have the problem and then have more (BILLABLE) time to fix it? The don't update during printing will
 only work until a valid new heading 1 is added and you HAVE to update the table of contents.</p>
<p>The point that 11 in the appendix matches the number of level 1 headings leads me to believe that you defined the Appendix style "Based on: Heading 1". It is carrying over the numbering defined in Heading one. You have 2 choices. Go into your Appendix style,
 modify it, apply Format / Numbering / NONE explicitly. This should turn off the carried over numbering.</p>
<p>The other choice is to remove the "Based on: Heading 1" link, base it on something else, like normal. Then reapply all of the specific formatting used in heading 1 except for numbering.</p>

<h2>            N95&#58;saving WLAN network key &#63;</h2>
                    Hi<br />
When I want to connect to my WLAN I'm asked everytime to type the key. Is there no way to have the phone rember the key just like with any PC or laptop ? I went to access points&gt;security where there is a field for a key but that's only five digits and my key
 has at least twelve digits.<br />
It's a Fritzbox router by the way.<br />
Does anybody have a tip for me ? Thanks in advance .

            <p>Be certain the Installation DVD matches the Windows 8.1 in edition (core/Home, Pro, ProN, etc.) and architecture (x32 or x64). &nbsp;I don't know what 8.1 SL is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you are running an upgrade install by opening the DVD from within the running Windows 8.1 and clicking on setup.exe from the DVD. &nbsp;DO NOT boot from the DVD to perform an upgrade. &nbsp;A Windows 10 upgrade with matching edition should not ask for or
 need a key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be safe, before starting the upgrade, run Windows Update and make sure you are up to date with required patches for 8.1. &nbsp;Also check that your drivers are up to date.</p>

    <title>Active-X controls are disabled on Excel 2013 worksheets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rabnud  say:</h3>
<h2>            Active-X controls are disabled on Excel 2013 worksheets</h2>
                    <p>Excel 2013 in Office 365, running under Win 8.1 fully updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of a sudden the Active-X command buttons in my workbooks don't work. The cursor does not change, and the VBA event handler doesn't fire. But the handlers and all other VBA subs work fine when run from the VB editor. Furthermore, in design mode I cannot
 insert a new active-x graphic control. Every attempt raises a "Cannot insert object" box when I click on the worksheet to insert the selected control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made no changes in Excel Options, and the settings (especially Active-X) are identical to the Excel 2013 settings in my Surface Pro 3 where there is no problem. I ran Office Repair from the Control Panel - didn't change anything. I have not yet run sfc
 /scannow in a command line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other thing I did at about the same time is to start using OneDrive to a) back up the Excel files, and b) make them readily available on the SurPro3. A file that has this problem on the desktop works OK on the SurPro3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Excel applications employ VBA extensively,&nbsp;with many graphic controls on worksheets, so this disabling of Active-X is a real hindrance. I don't use VBA in any other Office apps, so I don't know if the problem is Office-wide or only Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest a cause and remediation for this problem?</p>

            <p>This is probably caused by a bug in the December updates from Microsoft. If you close all of Office and delete all from your user Temp folder that is not in use, the problem should go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user temp folder can be easily accessed by entering </p>

    <title>Office apps in Windows 10 ask twice to enter file name when saving - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> halimg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office apps in Windows 10 ask twice to enter file name when saving &#40;or save as..&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I started encountering an issue when saving documents in Office (Word, Excel). When I click save, I get an initial dialog in the backstage (showing the current document name, or document1 if it is a new document). After I enter the name (e.g. "sample
 document" and click save, a window pops up, asking me once again to enter the document name, ignoring the name I entered in the first dialog. If it is a new document, the default would still be "document1" and not the name I entered in the first dialog; and
 if it is a previously saved document, and I entered a new name (save as..) in the first dialog, the second dialog still keeps the previous document name. &nbsp;The file is always saved with the name entered in the second dialog (pop up window), and not with the
 name entered in the backstage dialog. This is very confusing since I have to enter a file name, click save, then have to re-enter the file name again in the second window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office365 is connected to OneDrive for Business, SharePoint, and OneDrive (Personal).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue only started appearing recently on Windows 10 Pro. &nbsp;Can anyone advise me what may be causing this? Thanks.</p>

            <p><span>Hi HalimG,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, please make sure that you have the latest update for the Windows system and Office client.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then I would suggest you try the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Online Repair</a> to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I would confirm the following information for further investigation.</span></p>
<p><span>1. The version of your Office client.</span></p>
<p><span>2. For the screenshots you provided, do you save your files into the local synced OneDrive for Business folder? How about saving the file into another place (eg. The local folder in your PC)?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please let us know the update at your convenience and we will continue to assist you based on the update.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Allan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I have the latest version of Office (16.0.6965.2076). &nbsp;I tried first Quick repair, which did not resolve this issue. I then tried Online repair, which also did not work. I looked at my installed apps, and noted I have office installed twice, once
 with -en-ca (English) and once with -ar-sa (Arabic).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, the repair dialog (and also the Microsoft Office 2016 Tools in the menu) were showing in Arabic. I had indeed added Arabic as an additional editing and proofing language, so I thought I may have unintentionally reinstalled another version of Office
 which could be causing the issue. I uninstalled Office with the -ar-sa extension, but to my surprise Office got completely uninstalled from my computer, including the English install (everything was gone completely). I went back to Office 365 online (logging
 in on my business portal) and reinstalled Office from scratch.. To my pleasant surprise, Outlook files (and settings with additional Exchange and POP email accounts) were all recovered. However, the issue of the file name being requested twice still remains
 after reinstall:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8a59a75-e171-4f0d-8852-2b12786c3b89" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8a59a75-e171-4f0d-8852-2b12786c3b89" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The active account shows as my business account, and connections to OneDrive for Business, SharePoint, OneDrive Personal were all still there after reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working on a Windows 10 Pro personal computer at home (I have no Active Directory for my company). Current user is logged in with my personal Microsoft account (@outlook.com). My business account is Enterprise E4 plan, and, for safety, I had enabled
 device management using my business account security on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, the active account on my installation seemed to switch for no reason from my business account (which has my subscription) to my personal Microsoft account (on which I used to have an old subscription to Office 365, but which I have not renewed
 since I got a business account). And sometimes, both emails appear together as the Active Account. Here is an example showing both my personal account and business emails showing under my name as the Current Account (screenshot taken yesterday before reinstalling
 Office today):<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Not sure if this configuration with a mix of personal and business accounts may be causing a conflict that could be causing this behaviour?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your kind follow up.</p>

            <p><span>Hi HalimG,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your detailed clarification.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To check whether the issue is caused by the configuration with a mix of personal and business accounts, I would suggest you sign out all of these two accounts from Office and then remove the related credentials use the method below to
 see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Please go to Control Panel &gt; credential manager &gt; Windows credential &gt;&nbsp;remove Office 365 related accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Try running regedit as administrator -&gt; from Registry Editor, browse to: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity, and then delete the Identity folder.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>WARNING</span></em></strong><em><span>:&nbsp;Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from

            <p>Hi Allan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted all Windows credentials that started with "MicrosoftOffice16_Data" and deleted the identity folder in the registry. I restarted the computer, and was asked to reenter credentials for Skype for Business, OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, which I
 did. I ensured to sign out from accounts in Excel (sign out completely, not just switch), and signed back in using my business account. The same behavior persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am enclosing screenshots of credentials as they stand now, if this helps:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I do not have a formal IT background, but was going through various forums, and read that the Anniversary Update has changed some functionality in Windows Pro, that is now only available in Windows Enterprise.. I am not absolutely certain, but the behaviour
 I am seeing is only recent, and may indeed have started after I installed the Anniversary update. Is this something that I should investigate, or not really related ?<br />
</p>
<p>Again, it is not a critical matter.. I am still able to work - just need to be careful when saving, to enter the file name that I want in the second dialog that pops up..&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p><span>Hi HalimG,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As we have done some general troubleshooting steps from the client end and the issue persists, and according to the description, if the issue happened after the Anniversary Update, that might be related to the Windows system. Given the
 situation, I would suggest you send a frown by clicking the “<strong>Send a Frown</strong>” icon in the Excel client like below to the related team with the detailed information about the issue. The engineers will look into the issue further.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Allan.. I do not have the smiley in Excel or Word (will check how to activate reporting) but I finally found out what happened.. I went to options/save and noticed that "Don't show the Backstage when opening or saving files" was unckecked (I don't
 know what caused it to be unchecked).. I checked it to see what will happen, and indeed, now I immediately get the pop up dialog when saving, without being asked twice for the file name.. It was that simple ... It got fixed in Word too..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your support and follow up.</p>

            This worked. The same issue has been bugging me for months in Office 365. I can't believe that more people are not reporting this! Strangely the tick box was checked for me (in WORD but not Excel) and it was still showing the same behavior. I unchecked
 then checked the box again and it worked. Does this happen for everyone who uses the "backstage" dialogue (i.e. putting anything in the file name text box does nothing, just a new save dialogue appears)? I can say for the regular issues I have with Microsoft
 products the actual certified "Answer" people (Microsoft outsourced support) appear next to useless and use reset, reload and delete as answers for everything they have no answer to. You dont have to read too many of the support answer and reply trails to
 find how much unnecessary effort they put customers/users to chasing spurious "fixes".&nbsp;&nbsp;
