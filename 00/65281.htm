<h2>            Network protocols missing - Update after some more digging</h2>
                    <p>This is my most recent update</p>
<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p>After some more OS updates I can confirm the my Win 10 Home is now Version 1511 (OS Build 10586.71).</p>
<p>I can also confirm that the issue has nothing to do with any protocol missing and that in my case it just happens on Win 10 not on Win 8.1 or Win 7 (all&nbsp;HOME versions). I can finally confirm that the issue is related to my ISP (internet provider) at home
 only. In my case ACN using a DSL service that comes from Bell.</p>
<p>I have no network issues when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connected to the internet through my phone (tethering) - using Telus</li><li>Connected to the internet on any high broadband connection even public ones like at starbucks or Chapters</li><li>No issues when connected to my office through a Citrix connection from my home with my crappy ISP provider although I&nbsp;get some random&nbsp; messages now and then telling me that I've lost my Citrix connection which is something that will last only some seconds.</li></ul>
<p>When I get the connectivity issue, that I can confirm is the "missing protocols" error when doing a "troubleshoot problems" on the network connection (right click on the network icon on the screen's bottom right) I can recover easily from it just issuing
 these commands:</p>
<p>ipconfig /flushdns<br />
ipconfig /registerdns<br />
ipconfig /release<br />
ipconfig /renew</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes twice. But as I'm telling I only need to do this when connected from home. I am soon moving up to a 30Mbps internet service and will update this ticket after doing some experimentation. My son's laptop, also a new one with Windows 10 Home (Asus)
 has less problems but with the same issues and only at home, not at the university.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both laptops are with the latest Win 10 certified driver from the manufacturer. and NO, going for the compatibility install doesn't work either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just bought a Win 10 Pro license, which is the only thing left to try and see if the Pro version doesn't have this issue..... Keep trying Microsoft.... :-) ... I like this version and have get used to issue the commands I've mentioned lines above
 when working from home (even created a bat file I run every time I need)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of lucks and let me know if you are able to find another solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the OLD posting</p>
<p>-------------------------</p>
<div>I bought a Dell Inspirion 13-7352 with windows 8.1 Home which I upgraded to Windows 10 right after I got it home with no issues so far till the 1511 patch/upgrade or some patches after that where I have been having internet issues. At first impression
 random, my web browsers won't load any pages. Other programs that can use the internet seem to work fine, like the VPN connection to my office using Citrix.
</div>
<div>My system is:</div>
<div>•Windows 10 Home</div>
<div>•Version 1511<br />
•OS Build 10586.36<br />
•Processor Intel Core i5-5200U 2.20GHz<br />
•8GB RAM<br />
•System Type: 64-bit OS, x64-based processor<br />
•Pen and Touch: Pen and Touch Support with 10 Touch Points (this model flips to become a tablet)</div>
<div><br />
When I attempt to troubleshoot the network, I get the message "One or more protocols are missing on this computer", if I ask for the details I will get the message "Windows Sockets registry entries required for network connectivity are missing". The troubleshooter
 will often fail to automatically fix it. </div>
<div>I've validated that all my drivers are Dell certified for Windows 10, upon my insistence Dell send me the latest INTEL driver for my wireless card from Intel itself (this model doesn't have an Ethernet port) which turn to be the same version I already
 had but I install it anyway. AS with all previous fix-it tries it worked till it simply failed for no reason. At this moment every time I have the issue I will execute from an admin Cmd prompt:</div>
<div>ipconfig /flushdns<br />
ipconfig /registerdns<br />
ipconfig /release<br />
ipconfig /renew</div>
<div>However the problem is still recurring and at this moment I'm totally out of options on what else to try, which adds stress to my work as I cannot trust that my laptop is working properly everytime I have a connectivity issue.</div>
<div>This is what I've tried before, which pretty much resumes all suggestions posted on the matter as of today:</div>
<div>ipconfig /flushdns<br />
ipconfig /registerdns<br />
ipconfig /release<br />
ipconfig /renew</div>
<div>NETSH winsock reset catalog<br />
NETSH int ipv4 reset reset.log (need to get into regedit to give permissions to everyone on NSI item 26 or you will get an error)<br />
NETSH int ipv6 reset reset.log (same as above for NSI)</div>
<div><br />
or </div>
<div><br />
netsh int ip reset reset.log (Same as above for NSI)</div>
<div><br />
or</div>
<div><br />
netcfg -d as admin<br />
or</div>
<div><br />
netsh int ipv4 install<br />
netsh wlan show wlanreport<br />
or (weird last suggestion)</div>
<div><br />
netsh int tcp set heuristics disabled<br />
netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled<br />
netsh int tcp set global rss=enabled<br />
netsh int tcp show global</div>
<div>Also have:</div>
<div>• reinstalled my network driver (which is windows 10 certified)<br />
•Deactivated the option to let the system put my network card to sleep<br />
•Disable NetBIOS and LMHosts</div>
<div><br />
I can confirm that there is no real issue with winsock as with every type of fix the connection is restored till it fails again.</div>
<div>
<p>I will really appreciate you guys giving me a meaningful solution as Its really hard to work like this.
</p>

            <p>Thanks very much for the recommendations but none of them worked till I tried doing the stuff when booting in safe mode. Which basically solved the issue. This is how I did it and I'm not sure if there is a easier way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - As recommended I put the oldest driver for window 8 in compatibility mode, which was a nightmare because after that y laptop refused to boot. This was my case with my Intel AC-7352 wireless card.</p>
<p>2 - I booted in safe mode WITH NO NETWORKING</p>
<p>3 - Got into device manager and installed the latest driver for my wireless card, in this case a windows 10 certified one from Intel</p>
<p>4 - After it was done I did a netsh winsock reset catalog from an elevated command prompt window (with admin)</p>
<p>5 - rebooted and everything started to work after I did </p>
<p>
</p><p>ipconfig /flushdns<br />
ipconfig /registerdns<br />
ipconfig /release<br />
ipconfig /renew</p>
<p>
</p><p>6 - After that I did a clean shutdown and from there everything started to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried as similar procedure numerous times from a normal boot without success. I can only guess that something was not letting the driver update to really reinstall again. Somehow on safe mode this was possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That day, Jan 12 everything went OK, with the exception of my citrix sessions to the office getting disconnected for like 5 to 10 secs to automatically reconnect again. But something similar already was happening on Win 7 so I guess I can blame my ISP for
 that behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next day on Jan 13 a new update was added by MS. After that I've had no issues at all. The update was KB3124263 which came across with a bunch of updates for my Office 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this can be of help to someone else. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Forgot to mention that after the windows update KB3124263 my windows now is version 1511 OS build 10586.63 before that it was OS build 10586.36</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>the patch was applied on Jan 13, when I was still testing the stuff I did on Jan 12 which at the time it was working. Any how I'm glad this is over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            UTF-8 on windows by default</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I face a problem of Enicode,</p>
<p>I have plain .txt files that contain Arabic language, i was created before, now when I tried to open it on notepad I see just garbage, I have a backup sources on the cloud but it's the same thing, when i tried to open the same files on another PC operating
 windows 7 there is no garbage at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 Home edition 64, is there any solution to change how windows read this type of files, I thinks by default windows change it to ANSI Encoding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also I tried to download subtitle.srt files from internet that contains Arabic characters its the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ec61751-2209-483d-bea7-62cdd099e40f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ec61751-2209-483d-bea7-62cdd099e40f" /></a></p>
<p>...................</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only way i have is to open it by word &gt; change encoding &gt; Arabic (Windows), its not useful at all, many steps and i have to open all files by this way !!</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89645100-64b0-448f-8bf7-c2d1787125a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89645100-64b0-448f-8bf7-c2d1787125a1" /></a></p>

 3, but not 4 and told me I'd have to contact Microsoft to get it fixed.&nbsp; I looked at Microsoft support but was completely confused as to how to talk to a human.&nbsp; Does anybody here have info on how to resolve this?

    <title>Newest skype cuts sound to speakers when I start call. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Newest skype cuts sound to speakers when I start call.</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
This is on desktop, Windows 10. Skype version 8.30.0.98. Application version 14.30.98.1000</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
So this new update has introduced a weird bug. When I make a call, it cuts sound to my speakers. Often I'm playing a game and on skype, so I'd like to hear what's going on and who I'm talking to. If I change default audio output to something else, the sound
 comes back, but goes away again when I swap back to speakers.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
However, unplugging my speakers and plugging them back in makes it work again. Any suggestions on how to fix this?</p>

            How do I update? I see no option to update manually and the Windows Store isn't giving me an updated version, either.

    <title>Microphone muting itself on a windows 10 laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valentinbulbuc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microphone muting itself on a windows 10 laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using a lenovo laptop, and the microphone(internal microphone) keeps muting itself down to zero. I noticed that it happens especially when connected to the internet.</p>
<p>I've tried different solutions that I read online including: malware bytes software, unchecking the box in the advanced microphone properties that allow applications to take control of this device, set up a microphone, and others that did not help.</p>
<p>Any input is much appreciated</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Valentin</p>

            Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Communications tab
<br />Select 'Do nothing'
<br />

<br />
<br />See if that works...
<br />
<br />If not...
<br />
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.

    <title>Netbios - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> becks99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Netbios</h2>
                    <p>I've seen lots of problems with Windows 10 and Netbios. I am unable to netbios from a win 10 machine to any other. Works fine from a Windows 7 machine. I've tried every single change I could find for the registry, firewall, hosts, lmhosts, you name it and
 I've tried it. Still I cannot netbios from Windows 10 to any other machine, regardless of OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love a fix/solve for the problem but there does not seem to be one. I have a need to access machine via the \\machinename\c$ (or IP\c$)&nbsp; method. However, if I am unable to get this to work and if the future has no ability to do the above, then the next
 question is - what is the replacement?</p>

<p>Also - THE WAY it tries to connect is different. I ran some captures with wireshark and a capture from a win 10 machine is totally different from that of a Win 7 box. Windows 7 starts with SMB2 and then TCP, works fine. Windows 10 tries to use NBSS, TCP,
 NBNS and keeps returning NBSTAT &lt;00&gt; &lt;00&gt;, etc.</p>

<p>I have never seen a machine that would not let me create a share, then connect to it, whether Win 2000 - Win 10, server, domain or workgroup.</p>
<p>Did you create a share as I suggested?</p>
<p>Did you create it in File Explorer or with a console command?</p>
<p>What happens when you type these console commands on the machine that hosts the share?</p>
<p><em>net&nbsp; share</em></p>

<p>Yes, the shares are there. I can see each of them. I used File Explorer to create them. On the destination machine they are there. I can connect to the destination from a Windows 7 machine. Cannot connect to them from a Windows 10 machine.</p>

<p>If I issue the net use command, it comes back and tells me system error 53 has occurred. The network path was not found. I have research this error extensively and tried many of those suggestions. The bottom line is that the machine(s) I am trying to access
 are not the problem since I can connect from Windows 7 boxes.</p>

            I'll try those but I've tried most of this stuff. Also, the Windows 7 box is not the issue....reason being - I can connect from a Windows 7 to a Windows 7 and from a Windows 7 to a Windows 10. I cannot connect from a Windows 10 machine to either a Win

<p>Sorry, I have run out of thing to suggest. Seeing that there are millions of Win10 machines out there that establish networking at a blink of an eye, the problem clerly lies with your environment. When dealing with such baffling
 problems then I go back to basics. In your case, I would run a number of tests on two Win10 machines that are factory-new or that have been configured by someone else. The results would give you some valuable clues.</p>

<h2>            My HDMI port doesn&#39;t work after 5th December 2018 update &#40;Win10&#41;</h2>
                    <div>My problem is very clear. After the 5th December 2018 upgrade, my HDMI port stopped work. I can't switch between my laptop screen to the external one. The monitor and HDMI cable works with other PCs. I was trying to upgrade and even downgrade graphics
 cards drivers - no result. I'm sure that this is because of Microsoft update. Probably this version was installed: KB4469342. In the description, we can read "Addresses an issue that causes display settings to stop working when changing a multi-monitor configuration.",
 but in my case, something went wrong. This option was working, now doesn't work.</div>
<div>
<p>What may I do to fix it? Install the older version of the update? But which one? I'm looking forward to the new, better update for windows 10...</p>
<p>Please, ASAP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            Hi  mjc_OS 
<br />
<br />Could you try performing a system restore before this happened?
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard, try choosing an earlier point in time before that update was installed to see if it restores stability.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem is that I reset the PC settings to the initial state using recovery disk and all this Microsoft tool. Because of this now I don't have any point of system restore... Moreover, the Windows10 system is installing with new updates and drivers for
 devices and not with setups delivered by ASUS.</p>
<p>Windows10 version: 10.0.17763.</p>
<p>I'll try using rstrui.exe, but probably that's the same solution which I used but in GUI mode.</p>

            Hi mjc_OS
<br />
<br />Thanks for that detailed information. Its beginning to sound like this is a compatibility issue. I would recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1803 for the time being. 
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1803 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1803 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1803 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />

<p>Hi lincolncorbinjr,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There can be several reasons why this error occurs, such as outdated or incompatible drivers. In order to identify the root cause and determine appropriate solution, I'd like to learn more about your concern. Please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue started?</li><li>What is your Windows 10 build and version?</li><li>What is your device's make and model?</li><li>Did you make any changes on your device prior to the issue?</li><li>Does the error message appear on other media program?</li><li>Does issue occurs on different user profile?</li><li>Is this happening to both built-in and external camera?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest you to update your driver by following the steps on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> as an initial troubleshooting. If issue persist, kindly visit the manufacturer website and check if there
 is a new release of drivers then manually install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Hi Elliot,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know more about this issue to come up with an accurate solution. Are you using the Camera app for recording videos? If so, we suggest running the Windows app troubleshooter from this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Another solution would resetting the app from settings. Go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Apps </strong>&gt; <strong>Camera </strong>&gt; <strong>
Advanced options</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>The computer has been installed with a Volume License (Not from Dell) issued to the "organisation" referred to in the background screen. This is contrary to the EULA terms as the license remains the property of that organisation and cannot be sold individually
 for personal use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to prevent abuse Volume License systems must connect periodically to the organisations license management server (every 6 months max) which your system has not been able to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell would not have sold this system with the license so it must have been loaded by somebody else. If you go onto the Dell support site the service tag may give you access to the system component specification which would show what O/S it was originally
 sold with. This would be the only version of Windows it would be licensed for.</p>

            You do not have any other option. Only a reload will remove the Volume License. They need to reinstall it with the original version of Windows as supplied by Dell.

                    <p>Some Programs are not maximizing when i minimize them or after i switch to another program. When i minimize them, they go to the taskbar. When i try to bring it back up by clicking on the program, it just doesnt work. It shows that the program is open in

            <p>1. Task Manager, Games like Minecraft and games that use full screen.</p>
<p>2. I dont think so. I only used to connect my laptop to my TV using HDMI. But the problem was there before I connected it to the HDMI.</p>
<p>3. I have checked to make sure that windows logo + p is pc screen only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also some programs like powerpoint and adobe reader flash like it is switching between programs very fast. This happens randomly.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I ran System File Checker and it said that it found some corrupted files but could not fix them all. Even after this i still can't maximize some programs from my taskbar after minimizing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the link to the log.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sadly it did not do the trick.</p>
<p>I normally use my laptop always with a clean boot so no need for that method.</p>
<p>In the second method, i already did sfc /scannow. While i did&nbsp;<span>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth , I got an
</span>Error: 0x800f081f. It also said</p>
<p>
</p><p>The source files could not be found.<br />
Use the "Source" option to specify the location of the files that are required to restore the feature. For more information on specifying a source location, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243077.<br />
<br />
The DISM log file can be found at C:\WINDOWS\Logs\DISM\dism.log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need the log, just reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a good day!</p>

    <title>How to connect WMC with a DirecTV receiver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rabinzx  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to connect WMC with a DirecTV receiver</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Here is what I have in for the task: 1 toshihba laptop Satellite ( ATI graphic card), 1 Tv wonder 600 USB(made by&nbsp;AMD), DirectTV receiver Model No: D12-300,&nbsp; Remote control #:RC64</p>
<p>Details: VIDEO OUTPUTS<br />
1 S-Video<br />
2 Composite (RCA)&nbsp;&nbsp; I used 1 for my plat screen TV, and connect another one to TV tuner.<br />
1 RF (Coaxial)<br />
1 Modulator switch (Channel 3/4) <br />
AUDIO OUTPUTS<br />
2 Stereo (L/R, RCA) <br />
OTHER<br />
1 Satellite In<br />
1 Off-Air Pass Through<br />
1 Phone<br />
1 USB (For future use)</p>
<p>&nbsp;The turner comes with telescopic antenna with coaxial cable for connection to the tuner, 24-button remote control(no number key, but can control MWC through IR from Tv- tuner), Audio/video input cable(S-video and RCA)</p>
<p>Here is What I do: I connect Tv tuner to laptop(installing driver,etc), and then&nbsp;connect a head of RCA to tunner, another head to the Composite on DirecTV Box.</p>
<p>Open WMC, go through TV set-up( tv signal checking, Program Guide- EPC) everything is ok, until it tells me to set up remote control(I didn't get that part, so I just keep clicking ok).</p>
<p>When it's all over, I can see the TV channel on my laptop and record it, but I cannot switch channel by my laptop keyboard but have to use DirecTV remote control. By using that, both pictures on my TV and laptop have been changed at the same time.&nbsp; And even
 worse, when I change the channel by using DIrecTV remote, the channel info on my laptop didn't change(it is like I switch to Channel 4, my laptop still say Channel 2. It is like the information and video don't have connection)</p>
<p>My question is: Can I&nbsp;have&nbsp;DirecTV satellite box to show different channels on my laptop and TV at the same time?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I use my keyboard number to choose the channel?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have noticed DirecTV doesn't have HD channel now(at least in my area), If I want to watch HD channel, then I have to use over the air--- telescopic antenna that was given with Tv-tuner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I use both tv satellite and over the air at the same time(my tv-tuner has antenna function)? how?</p>
<p>here is the&nbsp;pic of&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;the&nbsp;DIrecTV receiver, and manual of D12-300&nbsp;</p>

            I actually believe that it would.&nbsp; The reason I feel that way, is because you get an IR device that feeds from the set-top-box to WMC.&nbsp; Allowing changing of channels with the keyboard, remote, etc.&nbsp; I have this setup at home, and it works great.&nbsp; If, for
 some reason, it doesn't work though, you should be able to return it and get your money back.<br />

<h2>            Trouble processing payment</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to purchase Sea of Thieves on my PC through the Microsoft Store, but I keep getting an error message.<br />
I know my billing information is correct, and in fact made a successful payment to change my gamertag earlier today without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I try to make the payment for Sea of Thieves using the same credit card I get a massage titled "Contact us at Microsoft Support".<br />
It reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We're having trouble processing your payment and we'd like to get it sorted out.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Please reply as soon as possible, as I want to pre-purchase the game before it releases on the 20th of March.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
