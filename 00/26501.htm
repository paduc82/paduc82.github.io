    <title>Calendar issue when removing an &#34;Attendees&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryantrayner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendar issue when removing an &#34;Attendees&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have a re-occurring calendar event that occurs every week.&nbsp; At one point I sent out an invite to an "Attendee".&nbsp; That attendee declined I went to remove the person on my Lumia 920 with 8.1 + Cyan.&nbsp; After deleting the person (and it is the only person that
 was invited) I go to save the change to the event and it asks to send updates to the attendees, I press OK and I get "We've encountered a problem".&nbsp; There is no way for me to remove the person from that event if I chose to make any changes to it so that they
 do not get a new invite.</p>

            <p><span>Hi RyanTrayner,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All calendar information (as well event) is sync from your Microsoft account calendar. You can check them as well online on that site:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://bay02.calendar.live.com/calendar/calendar.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://bay02.calendar.live.com/calendar/calendar.aspx</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Which is a part of your Microsoft account within Outlook.com. I would suggest to contact them regarding your issues with Calendar.
</span></p>
<p><span>Only thing we can advise here is try to re create this event and set it up again in your Calendar.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your contribution to the forums!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kind Regards, </span></p>

    <title>Computer hangs on autosave - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p. adrian frazier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer hangs on autosave</h2>
                    My computer hangs often whenever I am using Office Word or Office Excell. I believe this occurs whenever autosave kicks in. It doesn't freeze or anything, it just hangs until the save completes. I had this problem with Office 2007 and Office 2010, and
 have had the problem before and after a clean install of Windows 7. My computer is an ASUS N61JQ-X2. Are there known problems with this model? Is this a common problem with many computers? What can I do to resolve it?

            <p>Where does your autosave go to? If it is a network location (not likely, not normal), slow network connections could be the answer.</p>
<p>The computer, actually the Word application, "Hangs" because it is busy working on the autosave process. Because Word (actually 99% of all apps) is still "single threaded" it can only "think" about one task at a time. Writing a file to HD is a very slow
 activity because HD's are slow.&nbsp; I don't recognize that computer model. Is it a laptop? Many low end computers use relatively slow HD's (5400 RPM), which would therefore take apparently take longer to save files.</p>

<h2>            How do I mark all emails as read&#63;</h2>
                    [Running Windows Mobile 6.5 on an HTC HD2 with a manually configured email account (not Outlook), which connects to gMail via IMAP]<br />
<br />
Is there any way I can mark all emails as read?&nbsp; I've hunted around for the feature and can't find it.&nbsp; Since I pick up the majority of my emails through my desktop, it's frustrating having to go through each email in turn.<br />

            Duh .... now I understand what you want (I must be a little slow on the uptake ... too much snow falling here and it makes me sleepy (lol)).&nbsp; I think that is just something you will have to live with .... select all, mark all as unread, then mark all as
 read.&nbsp; Yup, it is cumbersome!

 outlook is working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Problem is that I cannot select contacts, calendar or tasks from the WMDC change content sync settings.&nbsp; Need to get contacts updated.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; Thanks much. John Sargent *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

<p>I would probably rollback to a past restore point John.&nbsp; That has been a "life saver" for me on a variety of occasions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do that, then to fix your issue, I think I would delete the profile as Linley suggested and then reinstall Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually I would have uninstalled Outlook, rebooted, thenr reinstalled but I understand that you want to preserve your data.&nbsp; You could copy the pst file but try a reinstall to see if that help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DON'T FORGET to set a NEW RESTORE POINT before you do anything.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Onenote 2016 login issue</h2>
                    <p>Here's my current configurations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop with Windows 10, OneNote 2013 - works perfectly fine using my Windows account login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Work computer Windows 7 Pro, OneNote 2016 - Cannot login. &nbsp;I have tried my Windows account credentials directly and they are fine. My OneNote files are on my OneDrive which is associated with my Windows account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I DO NOT HAVE AN office 365 subscription. &nbsp;Will NEVER have one. When Microsoft stops selling regular versions of Office it will be my last.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have ANY problems using Onenote 2013 with my Windows account why won't it work with 2016????? &nbsp;If it won't work with out an office 365 subscription then I'll go back to 2013. I have no use with an Office 365 subscription.</p>

    <title>Email text disappears when typing a new message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wandathompson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email text disappears when typing a new message</h2>
                    <p>My husband recently bought an HP Notebook with Windows 8 operating system. He has MS Office 2010 installed on it, and I do also. The problem is that he can be typing away on a message in Outlook 2010 and all of a sudden the cursor jumps to another area of
 the screen and then most of the time, the message he has been typing on will disappear. Occasionally we can go to the drafts folder and retrieve the message, but most of the time the bulk of the message is gone. I don't have that problem on my laptop running
 Windows 7 and MS Office 2010. Thanks for any help.</p>

    <title>ADFS Logout problem on our testing platform - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ADFS Logout problem on our testing platform</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is Patrick. I found there is a problem when we try to perform logout by using ADFS logout link.</p>
<p>https://[Domain name]/adfs/ls/?wa=wsignout1.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>The case is quite strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I am trying to use Shibboleth to integrate with ADFS service. When I try to perform logout for first time in the browser (Do both Shibboleth local logout and perform ADFS session logout by using the logout link), it could logout properly. By the
 way, when I access to the application in the same browser and perform the same logout action again. The logout process could not be proceeded and below cookies keep retained on the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- MSISAuth</p>
<p>- MSISAuth1</p>
<p>- MSISSignoutProtocol</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do anyone get the insight of this problem? As I could not find much information from the log.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Patrick</p>

    <title>Manage Styles, Hide Until Used - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greg maxey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Manage Styles, Hide Until Used</h2>
                    <p>This feature of Word must be hopelessly complex (so much so that it is over my head), or flat out broken in the UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I created a new template and in that template, I created nine new styles "Legal List L1 trough Legal List L9."&nbsp; I then linked those new styles to a new List Style which I named "Legal List."</p>
<p>
</p><p>After creating the new styles, all nine styles appear in the Styles Pane.&nbsp; My style pane options are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select&nbsp;Styles to Show:&nbsp;&nbsp;In current document</p>
<p>Select how list is sorted:&nbsp; Alphabetical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the template open and blank (containing no text).&nbsp; All of these 9 styles appear in the Styles pain regardless if the select Styles to show is set to "In current document" (which I concede they may be), or "In Use" which they certainly are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same behavior occurs if I open a new blank&nbsp;document based on this template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next using the Manage Styles dialog Recommend Tab, I set styles Legal List L4-L9 to "Hide until used."&nbsp; Again, no combination of settings in the various Manage Style dialog tabs&nbsp;resulted in L4-L9&nbsp;being hidden in the styles pane until used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I ran this&nbsp;macro which does at least hide the L4-L9 styles until they are used.&nbsp; However if say L4 is applied to a paragraph and then that paragraph is deleted L4 remains visible and I can only hide it again by rerunning the macro:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Sub ScratchMacro()<br />
'A basic Word macro coded by Greg Maxey<br />
Dim oStyle As Style<br />
Dim oPar As Paragraph<br />
Dim bNotUsed As Boolean<br />
bNotUsed = True<br />
For Each oStyle In ActiveDocument.Styles<br />
&nbsp; If InStr(oStyle.NameLocal, "Legal List L") = 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Right(oStyle.NameLocal, 1) &gt; 3 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each oPar In ActiveDocument.Paragraphs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If oPar.Style = oStyle Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bNotUsed = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit For<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If bNotUsed Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oStyle.Visibility = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oStyle.UnhideWhenUsed = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
Next<br />
End Sub</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Is it supposed to be this hard?&nbsp; Is there nothing in the Manage Style UI dialogs that can be used to "hide" a style until it is actually used and if it is no longer being used then hide it again?</p>

            <p>Charles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I agree that once used means used (never unused).&nbsp; However, while the 9 styles were created in the template, they were never really used there and certainly never used in new blank documents based on the template.&nbsp; It seems to me that the simple
 dialog settings should suppress the display of any style marked "Hide until used" until it is actually used for the first time in a document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is broke plain and simple :-(</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I would agree that it is broken. The fact that the vba setting to HIDE a style is '.Visibility = True' should be a good indicator that Microsoft's developers haven't paid enough attention to this area over the years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that the hide until used setting relies on the .InUse property which sounds right in theory but as you know, is similarly misnamed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also assume that only built-in styles can possibly have an .InUse setting of False. If you have created the style then I would guess that Microsoft's .InUse is always going to be True on that style. Since .InUse is a read-only setting you are probably
 stuck with the kludgy macro approach to shorten your displayed style list.</p>

<h2>            What is the Microsoft  &#34;Best Practice&#34; for Backing Up IMAP&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I support many customers who use Outlook 2013 to access an IMAP server. &nbsp; What is the proper method to assure that a client can recover from the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A group of messages is accidentally deleted (through either user error, application error, or OS error)</li><li>The IMAP server becomes permanently unavailable&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>These scenarios are described specifically to indicate the common situation where a customer's email is hosted on a server which they do not have control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daily backups of the desktop client are scheduled so there are numerous versions of the .OST file available.</p>

            .OST files are tied to the Outlook profile that created them, so they cannot be used for backup purposes.&nbsp; In your scenarios, the only method really available is to export the .OST to a .PST each backup interval and back that up.&nbsp; Since the export is not
 incremental, a full export will need to be taken each time.

<p>
</p><p>That unfortunately is the only option when it comes to anything related to .OST files&nbsp;short of opting to purchase an expensive 3rd party&nbsp;OST2PST converter utility should it ever be required to retrieve the data contained in the OST file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, depending on how your IMAP accounts have been configured, they will also contain "This Computer Only" contact/calendar folders. The loss of contact/calendar data can be mitigated by creating a PST file in the profile and designating it as the "default

<p>In a business scenario, the "Best Practice" is to backup the IMAP server or have an SLA with the provider of your IMAP accounts to ensure uptime and&nbsp;backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Karl Timmermanns already mentioned, you can configure Outlook 2013 in such a way, that other data that is usually stored within "This Computer Only" folder of the IMAP ost-file (like Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, etc...) are stored within pst-files. Those
 pst-files can be included in your regular client-to-server backup solution.</p>

            <p>SMB customers who are using a hosted email service from providers such as Microsoft or Google are typically not prepared or able to negotiate a SLA for email hosting including the terms necessary to ensure regular backups and the services and timeframe for
 restoring from the backup. &nbsp; &nbsp;The idea that you would need to contact your email host to recover remotely stored email that is also contained in numerous local client side backups (the .OST file) seems like a poor model. &nbsp; The time and resources required to
 engage the provider to request a restore of an archived email store for a single user would be significant. &nbsp; I'm not certain the provider would even accommodate such a request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I requested information on best practices related to backup of IMAP for hosted email. &nbsp;The consensus seems to be that companies must rely on the host to backup and restore data; a service that may not be readily available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the company is backing up their client workstations regularly, why isn't the capability offered to merely restore the .OST file. &nbsp; Currently, as Karl mentioned, there are 3rd party apps available to read the .OST file which can then be exported as a PST
 file. &nbsp; &nbsp;When I asked that question of Microsoft I got the inexplicable answer "it's a security issue." &nbsp;That is wrong in so many different ways I can't list them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there consensus among IT professionals who support client email systems that the .OST file should be available in the same manner as PST files? &nbsp; In my opinion, this is such a serious vulnerability that I am considering recommendation that business customers
 us POP instead of IMAP unless they have control (few do) of the IMAP server.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Hal. &nbsp; Even though there are other email solutions that have the needed protections from accidental or malicious deletion from the message store, I'm trying to determine how to best protect the installed base of IMAP users. &nbsp; The solution (allow
 users to open their .ost files as they can .pst files) seems so simple that I would prefer that method since it employs an existing data protection strategy (regular backups of client data). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, I am at a loss to provide a reasonable answer to the question; "Why can't I open my .ost file to retrieve my data?" &nbsp; All the answers that I imagine for this rationale don't reflect well on Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The recoverability of the ost-file and not needing to rely on 3rd party tools for it is a long outstanding request and discussion but it is not directly the point of this discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole purpose of IMAP (and (Hosted) Exchange for that matter) is that&nbsp;the mail client&nbsp;syncs with the mail server and thus create a centralized managed storage location. Why don't you want to manage your backups from this centralized storage location?
 When you want to use a 3rd party to host your mail, you should pick one that fits your requirements and thus the uptime, redundancy and recoverability of the infrastructure from your chosen hosting partner comes into question then too. When they don't fit
 your requirements, you don't choose them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention both Google and Microsoft apparently as an example of a&nbsp;"bad&nbsp;partner" since you can't negotiate your SLA even though they both already have that in their standard SLA and an excellent track record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As much as I personally would also like to be able to open ost-files in an easy and native way, I must also acknowledge that it would only be needed in the extreme case of a total loss of the mail environment, its backups and all client side configurations
 (connected ost-files can be exported to pst-files, orphaned ost-files cannot). A serious administrator of a centralized or hosted environment should never (EVER!) need to rely on client side stored data to recover his/her environment (and also note that someone
 can have Outlook configured to only cache the last 6 months in the ost-file). With that in mind, recovering data from ost-files can be seen as a "last resort attempt" to still salvage some data from an apparently poorly maintained and/or fragile environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That you are actually even considering to use pst-files and POP3 account and thus resort to an unmanaged and&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;(client-side) storage location for your email environment makes me believe that you are an administrator for a relatively small environment
 (&lt;15) with relatively capable users to maintain their own computers. In those cases it might sometimes make more financial sense to go this way and accept a certain risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The choice is yours, but you asked for the best practices to backup data from IMAP accounts. The answer in relation to Outlook&nbsp;is; Don't rely on client side caches.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure what I wrote that lead you to believe that I was saying that Microsoft and Google were "bad partners". &nbsp; That was not my intention. &nbsp; &nbsp;I was responding to the suggestion that if a user suffered a loss of messages, the solution is to have a SLA
 with the IMAP provider. &nbsp; I'm not aware of any SLAs with those partners that will result in restoring an individual email from a prior period. &nbsp;Their SLAs cover server 'up time' which is not in play in my scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say "don't rely on client side caches" but what is the alternative if you can't reasonable rely on the server host for restoration? &nbsp;My question is specific to situations where the client does not have control over the IMAP server. &nbsp; &nbsp;A client side file
 which contains the needed data, and which is backed up and archived sounds like a pretty reasonable way to go; if only the file could be opened by the owner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recent case which provoked this question involves a user who upgraded to Windows 10 after which Outlook crashed consistently upon attempting to open. &nbsp;Reinstalling Office fixed that problem, but after configuring the email accounts, IMAP server sync'd
 with the client and a single folder was missing (possibly due to corruption when Outlook was crashing repeatedly). &nbsp; So now there are two .ost files on the client computer; a 'pre-crash .ost file' which contains the missing data and a new .ost file created
 after the re-installation which is missing the folder. &nbsp; Google is the host and their support team was unable to find the folder or the messages contained within and Microsoft was unable (or unwilling) to provide the tools to open the old .ost file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you point out, this issue is relevant for small organizations that elect to outsource email hosting; which is becoming very popular due to the low cost ($5 - $10 per month, per user) and high reliability. &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm trying to close the gap I described and
 it sounds like you also believe that access to .ost data would improve the ability to recover from data loss.</p>

            <p>When it comes to single-item-restores, the recommendation is no longer to rely on backups for this but on server-level retention settings as Hal Hostetler also pointed out. This is only needed in the cases where the user first deletes the message and then
 also deletes that message again from the Deleted Items folder. I don't know about Google, but Microsoft allows for recovery of those items for 30 days and it can be
<a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">performed by the user</a>. Business critical information can even be put on "Legal Hold" or other retention solutions to keep it longer or even indefinitely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I can understand the data loss in your scenario and how restoring the data from an ost-file could be helpful, it is a corner case scenario and still&nbsp;a "last resort attempt" rather than a "best practice" as multiple things have gone wrong here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, you already had a synching issue before having a crashing issue with Outlook so the data was never stored on the server&nbsp;(and data doesn't get deleted from a server when Outlook crashes). Second, reinstalling Outlook doesn't delete its mail
 configuration so the data was still there after the reinstall. Third, you removed the mail account from the mail profile and only at that stage did you orphan the ost-file and made it unrecoverable by conventional means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had you discovered the synching issue before the crashing issue, you would have recovered the data and fixed the issue beforehand. If there hadn't been a synching issue, you could have recreated the account all you want (as an additional measure to reinstalling)&nbsp;without
 any data loss. Had you known about the synching issue, you wouldn't have deleted the account as well&nbsp;if all it actually took was reinstalling Outlook as you stated. It's the original synching issue followed by the complete local reset of the&nbsp;affected client
 which caused the data loss in your case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not trying to point any fingers here, nor am I stating that being able to recover from an ost-file is worthless in all cases (I'm actually a strong advocate of being able to recover it especially when it comes to the "This computer only" folders within
 IMAP ost-files as you might have noticed in the article I referenced in my earlier post). All I'm saying is that for a "Best practice" you should not rely on a local cache when it comes to being able to recover your IMAP&nbsp;data.</p>

    <title>One Note Notifications when user edits shared notebook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> missnike  say:</h3>
<h2>            One Note Notifications when user edits shared notebook</h2>
                    <p>Hello -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a shared OneNote space, stored in a OneDrive location somewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The team is looking for ways of receiving periodic notifications (e.g. daily emails) when a change is made to the shared One Note document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way of doing this? I'm rather shocked that I haven't been able to find a way of doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to this address (https://www.onenote.com/sharenotificationsettings?fromAR=1) and tried to turn on notifications, I was told that apparently this cannot be done with a work or school email address, which is odd because the people who would most
 want to share files and documents are those at work or working on school projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone who may help? I'm really stumped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No, the whole idea of the headset is that it takes all sound. If you are using the headset to listen to music, watch a video etc., then those activities would be interrupted by the call. The solution is to disconnect the headset when it is not being used.</p>

<p>This is by design, and cannot be customised, sadly.<br />
Please refer to the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Resolve-Sync-issues-in-Mail-and-Calendar-apps-in-Windows-10-0dd86c69-18f3-4f73-9d3d-375bdc9c3e34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
documentation regarding sync issues ...</a>&nbsp;about 2/3 down the page.<br />
Also notice the desktop vs. mobile devices &amp; EAS vs. Google/iCloud sync differences.</p>
