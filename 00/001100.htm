            The <i>Environ(...)</i>&nbsp;function should help you there. Test a few of these in the
<i>Immediate</i>&nbsp;window (e.g. <i>Ctrl+G</i>) to see what they are returning as results and how you can incorporate them into your path string.
<div><br />
<div>?environ("APPDATA")</div>
<div>?environ("USERPROFILE")</div>
<div>?environ("USERNAME")</div>
<div><br />
<div>The <i>Environ(...)</i>&nbsp;function can be used with anything you find from a command prompt's SET command. Use like,</div>
<div><br />
<div>TXPATH = Environ("APPDATA") &amp; Chr(92) &amp; "MyWorkbook.xlsm"</div>
<div><br />
<div>A <i>backslash</i>&nbsp;is ASCII 0×092.</div>

<p>It's not you.</p>
<p>While my install&nbsp;experience has been pretty much flawless on a laptop&nbsp;VM, a desktop,&nbsp;and on&nbsp;a tablet, this has not been the case for many Insiders over these past eight months with all the builds.</p>

            <p>have you seen the new blog post about the next build? more of the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only luck ive had with the last 3 builds is in VM's everytime I try it on RH I have nothing but problems. A lot of my devices have no drivers or broken ones. It seems (even in the VM's) that launching Win32 programs take forever now. I have a small utility
 program I use a lot and it takes 5 seconds to open even on a latest gen SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant wait for the host of new threads we will get after july. Here are some examples ive come up with</p>
<p>

            No. It's more&nbsp;about finding the right bag of tricks to get these to install now. Then&nbsp;comes the&nbsp;long wait&nbsp;with baited breath hoping that the install will go through this time. At least that's how I'm reading the&nbsp;comments found&nbsp;on these forums. Myself,
 I haven't had too many issues getting my installs to work until I hit upon build 10130. Then it refused to install altogether until it was revealed that the&nbsp;NX-bit thing needs to be enabled in your BIOS&nbsp;came along. One or two more builds before the week of
 July 29th RTM?&nbsp;It should be interesting to say the least if we are still having major problems now.

            <p>The last few builds (121, 125, 130) have been buttery smooth, both via update and fresh install.&nbsp; Yesterday I ran a test upgrade of Win 7 Pro SP1+ to Win 10 and it couldn't have gone smoother.&nbsp; The usual stuff didn't work but the upgrade was butter.&nbsp; After
 upgrade I found some updates, downloaded and installed them but one of them bricked my machine.&nbsp; I ended up doing a fresh install and that went smoothly as well.&nbsp; So far so OK.

<h2>            Cannot connect with my friend</h2>
                    I have been using Skype for years to have a video session with a friend.&nbsp; Since updating to the latest version we can no longer set up a session.&nbsp; Both of us can initiate video sessions with other contacts but not between ourselves.&nbsp; We are both using
 Win 10 with all updates.&nbsp; I note that others seem to have had the same problem.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the call/video button greyed out? Also, are you getting error message of any kind? If this is happening to a specific contact, this could be an issue with your friend's device and not yours at all. Are you using Skype for Windows Desktop? If so, let us
 check some of your settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First, make sure you and the person you’re calling install the <a href="http://www.skype.com/go/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
latest version of Skype</a>, check that you have a good connection, and close any applications that might be interfering with your call – then follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Make sure your camera is on, pointing towards you and there’s nothing obstructing it.</strong> Sometimes&nbsp;Skype turns off video to save bandwidth. If video is switched off if the video button it has a line through it, tap or click the button to switch
 it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>On Windows desktop check your privacy settings.</strong> In the menu bar, select
<strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Privacy settings</strong>. Under
<strong>Automatically receive video and share screen with</strong>, make sure that either
<strong>anyone</strong> or <strong>people in my contact list only</strong> is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Check if your&nbsp;camera&nbsp;is operational.</strong> Go to&nbsp;Skype&nbsp;upper menu tab &gt;
<strong>Tools </strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Options </strong>&gt; &nbsp;<strong>Video settings</strong>. Are you seeing yourself? If yes, then your camera is working and you&nbsp;should be able to make a call if your contact is
<strong>ONLINE!</strong></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Give these&nbsp;guidelines to your friend so he/she&nbsp;can check his/her settings too. Let us know how it goes!</p>

            Thank you for your suggestions.&nbsp; We have both made all the checks and all are OK.&nbsp; The problem is that my friend appears on my computer as OFFLINE and my name appears in the same way on his machine.&nbsp; We know we are both online because we have talked on
 our telephone landline.&nbsp; Any other suggestions please, it is very frustrating when we have used SKYPE for years.&nbsp; Thanks again.<br />

            <p>Sorry but Publisher only provides height and width adjustments of the entire table, not row height. The height and width of individual rows or columns must be done manually. Look to Word for more control and settings to build your table and then copy and
 paste special to Publisher. </p>

<p>you might be able to transfer them to an android phone later, but you need a windows phone to get the messages from the online storage.</p>

<h2>            Calendar Print Assistant and Office 2010</h2>
                    
<p>We just upgraded to Office 2010 in our Office and we were using to the Calendar Print Assistant with Office 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we tried installing the orginal version, it said office 07 wasn't there but Office 2010 is working fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We just downloaded the
 newer version this morning and it will install but it said it is unable to find outlook 2007 and wont' see Outlook 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are using the 64bit version of Office 2010. Do you know what Calendar print assistant is looking for or if it is not working for Office
 2010 64 bit?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Diane, Office-guru, Paul,</p>
<p>The issue that you are running into is that the updated <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=e7bab4eb-d032-46cd-908e-a7a6af2ef404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Calendar Print Assistant for Outlook</a> released 7/1/2010 does not support Office 2010 64-Bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you need to use&nbsp;the Calendar Print Assistant&nbsp;with Outlook 2010 please uninstall the 64-Bit version of Office and install the Office 2010 32-Bit version.</p>
<p>We will be updating the documentation on the download page for the Calendar Print Assistant to clarify that it supports both Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 but requires the 32-Bit version of Office 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two main clarifications I want to share about the updated <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=e7bab4eb-d032-46cd-908e-a7a6af2ef404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Calendar Print Assistant for Outlook released 7/1/2010</a></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; This download is an updated version of the original Calendar Print Assistant for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 released 4/25/2007.&nbsp; It has been updated to enable it to work with Outlook 2010 32-Bit.&nbsp; The user interface will still display that it is for
 Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 and that is expected.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The updated version of the Calendar Print Assistant for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 is intended to install on machines with either Office 2007 or Office 2010 32-Bit.</p>

            Hi<br /><br />According to Skype: “The ability to receive SMS messages in Skype is currently only available to customers with US Skype Numbers, and will be rolling out gradually over the next few weeks”<br />This is possible if you have “version 8 on Android (6.0+), iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, and Skype for Windows 10 (version 14) if you have a Skype Number, and have caller identification set up”<br /><br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34884/how-do-i-receive-sms-text-messages-in-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34884/how-do...</a>

            To send an SMS text message, first you need to have a little Skype Credit. You can then send an SMS text message to any contact with a saved phone number.

<p>Starting at 9:00 pm last night my mac&nbsp;users, Yosimite, Mavericks&nbsp;and outlook 2011, stopped working.&nbsp; Users could no longer connect to Office365 to send or receive email.&nbsp; They could go to the Web and access their mail but not through the client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has an update been applied? Has a changed been made to make outlook2011 obsolete?&nbsp; If so why weren't we notified of this?&nbsp; I am really confused by this.</p>
<p>Outlook 2016 works if we upgrade to it. </p>

<p>Hi Richey,</p>
<p>We haven’t heard about any change made to lead such an issue. However, since it works fine in Both
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App (OWA)</a> and Outlook for Mac 2016, it implies the accounts have no problem but the issue might be related to Outlook for Mac 2011.</p>
<p>So, to troubleshoot the issue, please confirm the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;How many users have the same issue?<br />
2.&nbsp;If not all the users, does the issue persist if the account is configured in another workable Outlook for Mac 2011?</p>
<p>3. What's the detailed version of the affected Outlook for Mac 2011?<br />
4.&nbsp;What is the detailed symptom when you said Outlook for Mac can’t send/receive the emails? For example, if sending an email, it would be stuck in “Outbox”.
<br />
5.&nbsp;Is there any error message while the issue occurred (connecting to Outlook for Mac 2011)? If so, upload a screenshot about it. To upload a screenshot: Click “Use rich formatting”&gt; “Insert Media”.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<p>1. We have about 750 users with the same exact issue.</p>
<p>2. If we login through a windows computer outlook client it works, if we upgrade the client it works.</p>
<p>3. All the outlook 2011 are on 14.6.3 version.</p>
<p>4. The outlook2011 clients can connect to the exchange server to send or recieve emails. &nbsp; If I delete the account and try to re-add the account I get the error message that says the autodiscover can't set the server field on the client, but this works on
 a windows outlook client.</p>

            Hi Nathan,<br />
<br />
May I know whether she can send emails to any other internal/external users without any issue except this recipient you have mentioned.<br />
<br />
Please try to send email via using <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Sign-in-to-Outlook-on-the-web-for-business-e08eb8ac-ac27-49f4-a400-a47311e1ee7e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a> to see whether the problem still occurs.<br />
<br />
We also suggest you contacting the recipient side and try to troubleshoot these issues via adding the sender's email address or suffix domain (<em>@contoso.com</em>) into the safe sender list on their side.<br />
<br />
You can test the user ability to send mail from your Exchange Online organization by using the
<strong>Outbound SMTP Email</strong> at <strong>Office 365</strong> &gt; <strong>Internet Email Tests</strong> in the
<a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer</a> and send us a screenshot of the ExRCA output result via the private message.<br />
<br />
Could you please provide us with the detailed Non Delivery Report (<em><strong>NDR without editing</strong></em>) and tenant domain (<em>@contoso.com</em>) via the private message for further analysis?<br />
<br />

            Hi Nathan,<br />
<br />
Thanks for update in the private message. According the error message report issue is most likely to lie with the recipient side.<br />
<br />
As I suggested above contacting the recipient side admin and try to troubleshoot these issues via adding the sender's email address/sending IP addresses or suffix domain (<em>@contoso.com</em>) into their safe/allowed sender list on their side.<br />
<br />
Regarding this we would truly appreciate your kind understanding. <br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal

<h2>            Not receiving verification code email from instagram</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
</p>
<p>I am facing problem receiving verification email from instagram. since I clear my browser history often, Instagram asked me to&nbsp;verify my account and sent me an email verification code which I&nbsp;am not&nbsp;receiving. I receive emails to reset my password
 but when i login it asks me to verify my account and thats when i dont receive any mail to verify. its been two months and its really very frustrating. There is no way to reach for help on instagram. at least&nbsp;I cant find any way. I have checked everything
 mentioned&nbsp;in previous threads and everything seems to be fine. can someone please help me?</p>

<p>Exactly!! Its super annoying. I mean rather than updating stupid stuff on facebook or whatsapp every other day, wouldnt that be helpful for users if they actually fix instagram? I am super super upset right now because its been more than 4 months that i
 can not login to my account. Whoever's fault it is, either hotmail or insta, i am done with both. I hardly use hotmail too now because of this issue not getting resolved.</p>

    <title>Symantec End Point Protection on Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob_alan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Symantec End Point Protection on Win 10</h2>
                    <p>After doing an 8.1 to 10 upgrade (keep everything) everything worked fine except my security suite</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running&nbsp;Symantec End Point Protection ver 12.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;-- &nbsp;Suspect this is a SEP problem and not MS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My recommend would be to uninstall SEP (maybe any 3rd party security software) before doing the upgrade and try to re-install SEP after the upgrade. &nbsp; Until I understand the problem just activated Windows Defender.</p>

 on Fix doesn't work.&nbsp; Maybe an update will fix it.&nbsp; I don't use Network Threat Protection because it kills my wireless connection.&nbsp;

<p>SEP 12.1 RU6 MP1 (12.1.6306.6100) does NOT run correctly in Windows 10. It also hangs EXPORER.EXE and must be removed for any PC to boot correctly. SEP is NOT Win10 ready. I have three Win10's and all same exact issue where it boots to desktop and cursor
 has blue circle spinning. Systray ICONS are missing at this point. Clicking the taskbar, either left or right, causes EXPLORER.EXE to crash at which time the desktop is re-displayed. The systray ICONS are then displayed correctly.&nbsp; And it is 6318.6100. RU6
 MP1a&nbsp;SEP removal is the only answer at which time DEFENDER gets activated and all PC's run just fine. When more corporate testing is done and Symantec gets their **** chewed out&nbsp;for waiting so long for their Win10 testing, then it will be resolved. Hopefully
 after the fourth attempt, Symantec will get a SEP release that actually works on Windows10. Currently there is no such version.</p>

<p>Reply was for the subject of the discussion, SEP on Windows 10. It belongs here for all to see what a lousy job Symantec has done yet again. And the answer you provided on this forum was 100% purely&nbsp;INCORRECT.</p>
<p>SEP12.1.6 RU6 MP1 AND MP1a are NOT Windows 10 compatible regardless of what Symantec may say and write.</p>
<p>I would also like to add the same holds true on my VMWare VM's. I think three had SEP which required removal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two of the PC's were clean Win10&nbsp;installs with no previous O/S. Only thing&nbsp;installed was SEP which won't run.</p>
<p>But it does install nice &amp; fast. All unmanaged clients. Now I can understand much better why Symantec is selling off assets. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Very simple and there is no finger dancing. Symantec got caught ONCE AGAIN with their pants down. Win10 pre-releases have been out for months and Symantec did NO QUALITY testing of their product during that timeframe.</p>
<p>They are currently on their third iteration of a SEP version for Windows 10 which is 12.1.6 RU6 MP1a released August 3rd. Now that is FIVE FULL days AFTER the official release of Windows 10, which proves their testing got a late start. RU6 MP1 was released
 July 28th, one full day before Win10. All three "Win10 compatible" versions came extremely close to the July 29th release date. Symantec should have had a fully QUALITY testing completed six months ago. As of this date, Symantec has no SEP that is compatible
 with Win10. Even though they "say" they do. Now they need to sell Veritas Backup to keep their security business afloat. Go figure!!!!!!!!!!!!! If businesses using SEP attempt to qualify Win10, they will be met with an ultra-high stumbling block.</p>

<h2>            14936 corrupted graphics, not repaired with 14942</h2>
                    <p>Folks,</p>
<p>Very bizarre problem cropped up on upgrading from 14905 to 14936.&nbsp; I lost all graphics starting with the background on the login screen (which is now just a white background with a few grayed-out boxes where the text bits used to show up, e.g. the text 'Password'
 just shows as a grayed-out box, but it still fortunately accepts text input so I can get logged in.)&nbsp; After logging in my desktop is all fine, but when mousing over the Action Center the graphics initially flash up for about 1/2 second and then disappear and
 are replaced by blue boxes on a black background.&nbsp; Then mousing to where the All Settings box is supposed to be expands the All Settings options as shown below (snip of my desktop with Settings window graphics, note the icon boxes - the icon at the end of
 the second row is for Updates &amp; security.)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d0bf1e2-2d3b-4f49-9a4a-738acf4c1bef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d0bf1e2-2d3b-4f49-9a4a-738acf4c1bef" height="423" width="678" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Following is a snip of my desktop with the Start Menu expanded.&nbsp; Note the icons with empty text boxes!</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13771295-cf56-4340-aaa6-2e8ba314df85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13771295-cf56-4340-aaa6-2e8ba314df85" height="425" width="679" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I waited to be offered 14942 which came through fine and the installation proceeded normally.&nbsp; However, the same bad graphics still exist with no discernible changes.&nbsp; It does show the correct 14942 watermark on the lower right-hand side of the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am mystified.&nbsp; I have tried sfc /scannow and DISM RestoreHealth as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0db0f71a-f507-46bf-8dbb-d557e0769ad0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0db0f71a-f507-46bf-8dbb-d557e0769ad0" height="181" width="416" /></a></p>

<p>DISM fails regardless of where I put the install.wim or install.esd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise on how I repair this or properly use DISM if I am screwing it up somehow.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

            I had the same problem and it was due to out dated video drivers so I just went and purchased a new up to date card and everything works fine. As a workaround you can go to device mgr and then to display and change the drivers to Microsoft Basic Video
 but it does not have the high res FYI

            <p>baggerbob,</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; Disabling the Intel G31/G33 Express chipset drivers did restore low resolution graphics!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion, this is a completely unacceptable situation for MS to have created, however, because at this point there is no clear path for me to say 'screw W10 Pro' and simply revert to W7 Ultimate.&nbsp; The automated reversion to prior OS must be done within
 30 days or the files are no longer available from what I understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really **** me off to no end as I've been running every freakin' revision of W10 Pro Insider Fast with no graphics issues on any of my W7/W8 systems (4 total PCs/laptops/tablets) and they better get this sorted as this specific system has a color
 critical monitor (NEC LCD2690WUXi2) with custom profile.&nbsp; There is no reasonable excuse to have any system that was running under W7 Ultimate to not remain fully functional under W10 Pro or suddenly hit a snag after 14905.&nbsp; The motherboard/chipset may be somewhat
 dated but it is not archaic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Absolute BS!&nbsp; Rather than rant, can anybody point me to a resource that actually listens to and/or reads Insider feedback?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

            <p>You could talk to the maker of your outdated hardware ... they would be the ones needed to update their graphics driver that is out of date. If they were to choose to do that, and provide it to Microsoft, it would become available in Windows Updates. Intel
 says that they will not continue to update their drivers at their own expense for outdated equipment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can spend about $30 and buy a graphics card that supports the graphics of the newer OS. Or, you could offer to reimburse Intel for the cost of updating their driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The insider feedback that you mentioned is read and considered by Microsoft, as they work on development of Windows 10, but they aren't the ones to update drivers from other companies .</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't wish to buy a graphics card, you could choose to stay with an older OS for which the outdated driver works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also choose to buy a computer that is built to run the newer OS to replace the outdated one.</p>

            <p>mel77084,</p>
<p>Thanks for your input.&nbsp; I am aware of all of the several options you described.&nbsp; However, none of them address the issue I've encountered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the drivers were not outdated one month ago on 14905, then they should not be outdated now.&nbsp; W10 is advertised as an upgrade to W7 systems.&nbsp; So, given that W10 is advertised as such and given that it has functioned just fine until 14936, I think it is
 reasonable to expect MS to maintain compatibility with systems that are already successfully running W10.&nbsp; Alternatively, perhaps they could enable 'compatibility mode' in some manner if the specific change that resulted in the video resolution issue between
 14905 and 14936 could be identified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are entitled to your opinion if you think it is OK for MS to make changes that destroy existing functionality, but I do not share it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>johnliv</p>

            <p>Yes, Windows 10 is advertised as an upgrade for Windows 7 systems, but that doesn't guarantee that all hardware and related drivers found in those Windows 7 systems would continue to be adequate to run Windows 10, without need for updating, as it's further
 developed. One could choose to stay with the public release version of Windows 10 that was released in July ... your outdated equipment and drivers would run that very well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were computers that were originally built and sold to run XP, but after adding more RAM, had been upgraded to Windows 7, and ran 7 very well, but couldn't run Windows 10, because of their P4 processors.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The advertising of Windows 10 as an upgrade for Windows 7 systems didn't say that
<p>
</p><p>Trying to force Intel to continue forever providing new drivers for outdated equipment using their chipsets that wasn't made or sold to run some future OS, or, trying to force Microsoft to stop the development of Windows 10 will probably not succeed very
 well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Performing a small upgrade to you outdated equipment probably would.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One can choose to fight progress, or go along with it, even though he might need to participate by making a small expenditure in upgrading. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, what you choose to do is totally up to you. I do wish you well.</p>

<p>Yes, dealing with the issue in a tablet or netbook would be a whole different ballgame than in a conventional computer, such as we were discussing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to Microsoft giving advance notice that a new build will not work correctly in particular hardware without installing an updated driver, they have not done that in any case that I'm aware of. They simply distribute, via Windows Update, whatever
 updated drivers they have received from the equipment manufacturers, that related to the hardware in the system checking for updates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean about losing data if you set up a system to run the anniversary edition. In our lab, we often switch units back and forth between various preview builds and the anniversary build, and don't lose any data in doing
 so. </p>

<p>I'm pleased to learn that you already know all the options available to you. I don't understand what your term "rolling over for MS" is intended to mean ... I suppose that's a factory worker term that I just haven't had the opportunity to become familiar
 with, so I feel a little deprived, now, but that's ok, I suppose. I spent 42 years as an engineer, and have been retired now, since 2004, so have missed out on a lot of the stuff that you seem to know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good thing is, that you know who to speak with at Intel to persuade them to continue updating their chipset drivers, and that should help quite a number of users of outdated hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your statement "It is unconscionable (and unbelievable) that MS W10 developers would intentionally destroy compatibility within an ongoing revision of their OS." seems to me to be an opinion, and, since you said "opinions are not of very much use", I'll
 leave that alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to follow your admonition to "Please try to be constructive in your comments in the Insider forums", and, on that note, it appears to me that you might also benefit by doing so. Your rant about Microsoft doesn't seem to fit that line of reasoning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had said in your post that you knew all the answers, but just wanted to rant, I wouldn't have bothered to reply.</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you for trying to correct my errant behavior ... I need that now and then.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 build 10525</h2>

<p>Thanks for your answer.</p>

<p>Thanks to lawrencecrumb for answering to my post, but I may have not&nbsp;explained what my question is:
</p>
<p>The question is that since I already upgraded my windows 10 build 10240 to the free upgrade to&nbsp;W10&nbsp;RTM offered to the W10 insiders by Microsoft will&nbsp;it be ok to update&nbsp;to build 10525 from &nbsp;W10&nbsp;RTM already installed? .. Will my new build 10525 be also RTM?
 Thanks again.</p>

            <p>10240 is ALSO the RTM.&nbsp; If you are an insider and want to remain an insider then 10525 will be offered to you.&nbsp; If you either said stop insider builds or installed the release to the public build you will not be offered it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>YOu might want to stop calling it RTM for there is no "rtm" in the classic sense&nbsp; Both insiders and the public will be getting additional features the difference is the public will remain on 10240 until it is deemed safe and available via the "slow" ring</p>

<p>Can you provide an official link for Garmin XT for the N8 and for Japan Road Navi 2.1? I'm sure that would be much more useful to users than another random screenshot.</p>

<p>As no doubt you were aware when posting Garmin Mobile Xt is now no longer available:<a href="http://www8.garmin.com/support/collection.jsp?product=010-11034-00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www8.garmin.com/support/collection.jsp?product=010-11034-00</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this is the only way of getting navigation for Japan, Pakistan and Cyprus which Nokia have choosen to avoid providing for with Nokia Maps, presumably you would rather OP was left in ignorance of technical feasibility of it's use upon Symbian devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whereas under your profile it says "<em>Please do not contact me asking for assistance in a personal message (that includes bringing posts to my attention), you will not receive help from me in that way"
</em>I have always been happy to provide further guidance should user so request under such situations.</p>

            So if its no longer available what is the point in posting about it? Technical ignorance or otherwise its pretty pointless to show something that they cannot have.<br />
<br />
Surely a more logical response would be to tell them that its no longer available rather than giving them false hope by posting a screenshot with zero explanation?

            Noticed you edited your post after I'd made mine mentioning something that's in my profile. What is the relevance of this to the user?<br />
<br />
To me that reads as if you are willing to help people illegally obtain and modify commercial software for use on non supported devices. Surely a "sensei" of this forum would not behave in such a manor?<br />
<br />
If that is not the case please explain the relevance and perhaps post any solutions you nay have for public viewing.

            Because there is not a Large Market in Japan for English Only drivers in Japan to Justify the costs or making English GPS. Japan is 99 percent Japanese....they speak Japanese. There are very few people that do not so it wouldnt be that profitable.

<p>Good old LonelyPlanet does the trick, no problem, been there. You can also rent a japanese phone there, they have English of course. If you have a solid roaming plan, just use openstreetmap.org</p>

<h2>            Hotmail &#40;via Live&#41; does not delete mail off server &#40;Palm 700wx&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have the Palm Treo 700wx on Verizon using Windows Mobile 6&nbsp; professional, CE OS 5.2.1620 (build 18125.0.4.2) Treo software version TREO700WX-1.24-VZW.&nbsp; I have upgraded to Live as required.&nbsp; For a while, all was well downloading my Hotmail to the devices mail
 utility (where I get Exchange, text and MMS succesfully).&nbsp; Some months back, while all else is well with Hotmail both on this device and via my PC, the messages I deleted on my PDA did not delete on the Hotmail server.&nbsp; I know there is a check box for deleting
 off server and I have that checked.<br />
<br />
Also, is it now necessary to continue to have the Live software on the phone?&nbsp; I don't access my mail using the Live browser interface.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

<br />
Not sure why that is happening.&nbsp; For me I generally do not delete the items from my device but prefer to download to my PC when I return.&nbsp; However I just did a test to make sure thatit was working as expected.&nbsp; I opened Hotmail on my device, let it refresh
 from the day before and it deleted the emails that were on the deviec (but were deleted from the server via my PC last night).&nbsp; Then the NEW emails appeared.<br />
<br />
I opened hotmail on my PC to verify that I was seeing the same list (and I was).<br />
<br />
I then deleted two emails from my device THEN refreshed my device with a SEND/RECEIVE.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I then checked my email on my PC with a refresh of the page and the two email were deleted so I know that the process works.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&nbsp;I know there is a check box for deleting off server and I have that checked.<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
As far as I know, that checkbox you are referencing is for other email accounts ... not Hotmail.&nbsp; I do not remember seeing that when setting up Hotmail.<br />
<br />
Is this Client you are using for Hotmail, Messenger etc?<br />

            Hi Kellie,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In OneNote desktop application, we can left click mouse to open the Text Hyperlinks. To open the Image Hyperlinks, we need to hold down
<strong>Ctrl</strong> button, and then left click mouse. It means hold down <strong>
Ctrl </strong>makes the Image Hyperlinks clickable.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Best regards,<br />

                    I have Version 1804 (Build 9226.2114) of Outlook 2016 on Office 365.&nbsp; Cannot save multiple attachments. Works if i select one at a time, but that's not practical.&nbsp; Worked before in Office 2013, but Outlook is broken now.&nbsp; What's the fix, or what's being

<p>Hello Brian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steps to download multiple attachments in Outlook 2016(Version 1804 Build 9226.2114) is:</p>
<p>1 . Click on the one attachment and choose <strong>Save All attachments</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47b251f9-3b0b-4ed8-a5a3-1cc8f301aa73?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47b251f9-3b0b-4ed8-a5a3-1cc8f301aa73?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 . Then you can choose which to download attachments. If you hold <strong>Ctrl</strong> and click on the attachments, you can choose which one will not be downloaded.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c3123bd-9020-4906-9161-2d7a24d75971?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c3123bd-9020-4906-9161-2d7a24d75971?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 . Click OK and you will be able to choose the location to download.</p>
<p>4 . Click OK to save them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you are not able to save multiple attachments, would you mind let me know which step are you stuck? If there is any error message, please also capture a screenshot of the full error message for further check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi Dawn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To clear cache (AKA Browser temporary file history):</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tools | Internet Options |&nbsp; General | Browsing History | Delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check ONLY "Preserve Favorites website data" and "Temporary Internet Files".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Delete and wait.&nbsp; It will notify you when done.&nbsp; Your cache is now cleared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To increase cache (AKA Browser temporary file history size)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tools | Internet Options | General | Browsing History | Settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set Temporary Files to Automatic</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Increase the Disk Space to use from what it is to at least the recommended maximum or up to the stated maximum above that.&nbsp; I use 250MB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decrease the number of pages of History to store - I had troubles set at 180 days (performance issues - not same error as you), so I now use 90 and am considering reducing it to 60 or even 30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When done, reboot and see how things go.&nbsp; If the problem persists, try running IE in no-add-ons mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can run <em>iexplore.exe -extoff</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will start IE with no add-ons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then through Tools | Internet Options&nbsp;| Manage Add-ons, you can enable/disable each add-on to identify which, if any, add-on is creating problems and deal with the culprit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*********************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            I dont have the webpage link to point you to.. but perhaps on this windows updates.. you need to wait and see too. &nbsp;&nbsp; Old windwos updates often had issues for meny users.&nbsp; Actually there is nothing wrong with the newer windows updates now.. but they have
 mentioned that its not complete yet.

</p><p><span><span>Hi</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you have been using Windows long enough, you know that there are tons of problems with the existing implementation of Windows Update&nbsp;in previous versions.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>These existing versions used the old (and outdated) <strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Direct UI
</span></strong>code which is a set of libraries used by the Microsoft developers to build
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Shell Code</span></strong> in Windows.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In this current 9926 Build, Windows Update (and many more of the old Control Panel components)&nbsp;are now using a
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">XAML</span></strong> code base to build these components.
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">XAML</span></strong> gives the developers many more advantages such as performance, stabilitiy, and is much less prone to vulnerabilities.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Remember that Build 9926 is still very early&nbsp;pre-release code&nbsp;and many more features will be added to all of these new components.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Regards</span></span></p>

            <p>Thanx for that info,Ron.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm all in favor of the new XMAL code.&nbsp; Newer,better,safer.</p>
<p>What concerns me is the wu gui.&nbsp; Or more accurately whats <strong>NOT</strong> in the new wu gui.</p>
<p>This forum is full of posts about wu wantonly installing crappy display drivers.</p>
<p>These people go to a lot of trouble to get correct intel/nvidia drivers installed then in the middle</p>
<p>of the night windows update blanks the display !&nbsp; MUST be able to set up wu to prevent this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I agree 100 percent. Here is how I have stopped the <strong>unwanted </strong>
driver updates, non Windows 10 updates&nbsp;and etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Go to "</strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Update &amp; Recovery</strong></span><strong>" via Settings. Click on
</strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Advanced Options</strong></span><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Uncheck</strong> "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Give me updates for other Microsoft products when I update Windows</span>".</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/badf5922-f1a1-4e07-b16b-ae250010065f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>After I did this, the only updates I have seen since are&nbsp;only the&nbsp;updates for Windows 10.</p>
<p>I no longer receive the video drivers updates (that Were always there) and so forth.</p>
<p>

            I tried that with a recent reset.&nbsp;Did not do a thing. All the updates driver included installed, nothing I could&nbsp; could do to stop it.
