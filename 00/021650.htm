<p>
</p><p>I create&nbsp; an email that i plan to use to send invoice to my customer the email is something like:&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I configured the cloud portal that i use to compile and send invoices with the SMTP info and so far everithing was looking good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when i try to send from the Invoice portal the email directly, i can see that the email is not delivered and i get this message:</p>

<p>Hi G-Edin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for post your question in our community. I guess this is your process:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Click the gear icon &gt; select List Settings;</p>
<p>2. Advanced settings &gt; check "Read items that were created by the user" go to the bottom right of the page &gt; click OK.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the above is exactly your process, your colleagues will only be able to see items created by themselves. To check who created the items, please refer to the following process:</p>
<p>1. Click All Items &gt; Edit current view;</p>
<p>2. Check <strong>Created By&nbsp;</strong>&gt; go to the bottom right of the page &gt; click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the item isn't created by your colleague, you may simply refer to my first process and uncheck "Read items that were created by the user".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if there is any update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

    <title>End Series without it changing past events. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            End Series without it changing past events.</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to switch over from Google calendar, trying to switch the entire company to Microsoft for security reasons. I use the calendar to track events and bill insurances for services, and is my record of work done. &nbsp;It is also shared with the clients
 so they know when to expect services. &nbsp;I make a series for planned work, and when things pop up (cancellations, extra work, etc) I edit the single occurrence. &nbsp;When I need to cancel the series (such as the client no longer receiving services at that time),
 I go to edit series, and add a end date for the series. &nbsp;When I do this, it changes all the previous events as well, and I lose my records. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to end a series without changing previous events in the series? How do I just change all future events in the series? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ending a series without changing previous events is only applicable for Outlook app as of the moment. The best way to cancel remaining meetings in a series is to send a meeting update with a new end date. This prevents the deletion of any meeting agenda,
 notes, and attachments you or the attendees saved in past meetings on your calendar. For more information about this, please check this

                    <p>My 'sent' emails are getting stuck in the Outbox of Outlook 2010. I called my host (Godaddy) and they thought it was because my email account had gotten hacked - which seems likely, because I had been getting strange "Mail Delivery System notifications.
 We changed from a 'free' email program to a paid one, which should have eliminated the problem of too many emails being sent. We also changed my password to the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as a virus, of being hacked, I ran a scan of my computer with Microsoft Security Essentials, but I still have the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what the message reads when&nbsp; this problem happens:</p>

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>Yes. If we want to create files with Office Online, we need a to login to the Office 365 consumer service with a Microsoft account or the Office 365 business service with an Office 365 Work or School account. The files created with be stored online correspondingly.&nbsp;
 However, you can choose to open the files stored online with the Office client or save a copy to the local to view files alternatively.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jerry</p>

<h2>            Album Artwork Not Showing on Music Folder</h2>
                    <p>I recently posted a question asking how to prevent WMP from changing the album information on my downloaded MP3 files (thank you to the person who helped me to fix that). Anyway, now that I have all of my downloaded music in folders by artist and then album,
 many of the icons don't show the artwork, just a plain folder within a folder icon. A vast majority of the music shows the artwork. How do I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>These pictures below show what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>Hi again - sure... btw you can always refer to your previous posts by clicking your username... that will take you directly to your profile and activity.</p>
<p>More often than not WMP will create an image file for the folder... but if it doesn't you can create one yourself - e.g. for Paul Simon you could download this jpg image and rename it Folder (Folder is the default name for any image that appears on a folder
 icon) - it's best to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">rename it on the desktop</span> because there won't be another file of that name to conflict... then just drag it into the relevant folder. If there's already a jpeg so named there, you'll get a
 prompt asking you if you wish to replace it...</p>
<p>A 'hidden' folder of music art exists in the appdata folder but this has all been resized to WMPs (ancient!) default of 200x200 px&nbsp;large** - or 75x75 small so I keep a folder of music art at around 500x500 (always above 300 minimum)</p>
<p>** This is why some of your art has a white border around it... The default size for system folder images is 266x266 against the 200 image&nbsp;created by wmp. One of the many things that needs updating in the WMP platform!</p>

                    Customer with a Windows 7 PC needs to download the necessary winhlp32 files to access Help File software, but the target PC resides behind a firewall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is there an FTP site which will allow a download of a portable msu (I think) file to run&nbsp;independent

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question on Microsoft forums. As per the description, you need help in downloading the win32hlp files to access file software.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To confirm, are you&nbsp;referring for an FTP program to transfer the portable files to the other computer?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may download Help program (WinHlp32.exe) for Windows 7 from Microsoft Download center:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For 64bit computer- You may download the file named "<span>Windows6.1-KB917607-x64.msu</span>"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For 32 bit computer- You may download the file named "<span>Windows6.1-KB917607-x86.msu"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Windows Help program (WinHlp32.exe) for Windows 7</span><span><br />
</span></b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=91</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The better option would be using a portable flash drive. You may download the file to a different computer using internet and transfer the setup file using the flash drive. You can install the program and use it later.
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hope this information helps. Please reply with the status so that we could help you further.

            Hi,<br />
<br />

 unblocked. <br />
<br />

<p>So I tried the Answers link (above) and it seemed to be some sort of paid support site that I didn't really understand. It didn't explain how much it might cost nor what I might expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried once again to ask for a security code to be sent to my alternative address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gave me a security code to verify this address. I entered that and got a security code sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email said "Please use the following security code for the Microsoft account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was the same security code I had just used to verify this address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I used that security code to try and unblock the other address I was told it was invalid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stumped&nbsp; :(</p>

<p>Over a period of a year, I created 3 email accounts, 1 for my father, 1 for me, and 1 for a friend to be used to keep in touch while I was on a road trip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested each account, send and receive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within a couple of days, before I could turn the accounts over, they were each Temporarily Suspended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suspected of being used for Spam or some other reason that was in violation of the user agreement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to unlock them was to provide a text able phone number and reactivate the accounts within 10 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all 3 accounts I used the option upon creation: Alternate email address instead of text able phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know for a fact, that none of these accounts were being used for spam or anything else that would violate the user agreement, PERIOD!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course, Microsoft would not show any evidence of misuse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion, Microsoft is attempting to gather text able phone numbers to be used to for spamming the users later in the event they return to the mobile phone arena and for tracking the user similar to what Google and Apple already do. I feel that if Microsoft
 did not allow Alternate Email address, you may not create the account in the first place.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the biggest annoyances I have had to deal with is the constant spamming and notifications (phone) from using a Microsoft account. I can easily say that more than 90% of the rules I create for managing emails are to block the barrage of emails from
 Microsoft. When the updated the way you create rules, which when that happened, I had to recreate the rules to again block the continuous barrage of spam from Microsoft, they made it difficult to block emails by domain name. You can do it, just search for
 How to block by domain in Outlook.com. And if you use Bing to search, don't be logged in to your email account or you will get annoying popups. You may have better luck using Google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is funny how spell checker challenges the word "Bing"!</p>

<p>Repeating an answer (probably automated) that I have already said didn't work does not make me feel it is worth asking anything here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft may be one step ahead but it is not anything to do with securing this customer's account. This customer didn't get a chance to use the account before it was blocked.</p>

<p>We are having office 365 goverment plan G1 (Equates to Office 365 Enterprise E1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office-365-plan-options.aspx," target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office-365-plan-options.aspx,</a>&nbsp;infopath forms services is not available in G1 (E1), we also tried to publish infopath
 form through E1 plan but we couldnt, although we didnt get licencing error. This made us believe that we can't publish infopath forms/utilize infopath forms services on G1 (E1). -- Am I correct ?</p>
<p>Based on this post :&nbsp;https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/154/t/257047&nbsp;they are saying we can utilize infopath forms services/publish forms in E1 as well. -- Is this true ??</p>
<p>Based on this post : https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/148/t/219023&nbsp;I believe E3 is only needed for people/developers who publish/modify infopath forms using infopath forms services but to use/fill those forms in
 browser users (external users as well as E1 users) do not need to have E3. Is this correct ?</p>

<p>Which one is correct ?</p>

<p><span>Hi Glamourous Star,</span> </p>
<p><span>You can in fact get a14&nbsp;day&nbsp;free trial by signing up for it on www.zune.net Be sure to set up your Zune account using the same Windows Live ID that you have in your phone. If you haven't already downloaded the Zune software for your pc you can also
 do that from the site. You will then be able to listen to music through your pc in addition to your Windows Phone.</span>

                    I am creating an index for a large desk guide. I want to have an index.&nbsp; Is there an option for the page numbers in 2010 Word document to be linked? I do not see or cannot find how to do this.
<br />
<br />
Is there also a way for this index to span multiple documents? Thank you.

            <p>The background: On December 5, someone asked Microsoft's Gabe Aul—he's emerged as the face of the Windows Technical Preview—whether testers would be "able to update to the RTM version [of Windows 10] when it ships? Mr. Aul responded in the affirmative: "Yes,
 that is our intent."</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My preference would be a clean install the released version. As for the cost it could be a free or low cost upgrade for preview users if history is any judge:</p>

            To all the people who are going to be rolling back I suggest you make a set of startup disks from your manufacture. After getting the disks you should Format your hard drive, and learn the key strokes remembering Format.com /? this will open up format.com
 and tell you what each option you have with format. I just reformatted my hard drive and I had build 10.532 I used Format.com /q /u /c c: the q is quick I have a hugh hard drive, u is for unconditional meaning it can't be over ridden and c equals check hard
 drive. It's difficult to wipe a hard drive and if you don't most of the time down the road you'll lose your hard drive I have been doing this right after windows 3.1. Even with these new builds I use check disk every 2 hours of working and I have build 10547
 from 3 days ago I deleted 3 files 7zip, and hp's button driver and 1 other a couple of hours ago my build hung up I ran check disk and it found 2 errors and 2 security errors but check disk fixed both. If you are going to roll back then

You've responded to a post that's nearly seven years old, and you did not get Malwarebytes from Windows Update.&nbsp; Start a new thread and try to explain your problem clearly.

            <p>Thank you for your help. I have forwarded my comment to malwarebytes.com.</p>

 was the release about the middle of May, 2016.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I wish to forward my U.S.A. cell phone number to a Skype number so that I can continue to receive calls on my cell phone when outside U.S.A. (in Canada).</p>
<p>

            You have to buy a Skype number and set the number (Skype number) on your phone to forwards the calls to your Skype number on Skype app.<br /><br />To buy a number go to <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA256/how-do-i-get-a-skype-number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA256/how-do-i...</a><br /><br />Plus you need to get some credit or buy a plan to forward the calls

<h3> kien nguyen trung  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Relay domain type</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone explain the different between Internal relay domain vs external relay domain? I have a single server exchange 2013 and didn't see any different. I can still create the mailbox user and send / receive email internally (even from the internet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that, Office 365 has remove the external relay domain type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled and found the main different is with Edge Transport Server. So how if there is no Edge Transport in the exchange organization?</p>

<p>Hi Kien,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Authoritative Domains:</strong></p>
<p>Authoritative Domains are those for which an Exchange organization</p>
<p>hosts mailboxes that have email addresses that use that domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, a company named Contoso Pty Ltd may own the domain name contoso.com and use email addresses of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; The Exchange organization would be configured to consider contoso.com an Authoritative Domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Internal Relay Domains:</strong></p>
<p>Internal Relay domains are those for which an Exchange organization</p>
<p>hosts some, but not all of the mailboxes that use that domain.&nbsp; This</p>
<p>scenario is sometimes also referred to as a “shared SMTP namespace”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internal Relay domains are common when two companies have merged but</p>
<p>are yet to consolidate their Exchange environment into a single</p>
<p>organization.&nbsp; When they have a need for consistent email addressing</p>
<p>across both Exchange environments Internal Relay domains are the</p>
<p>solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>External Relay Domains:</strong></p>
<p>External Relay domains are those for which an Exchange organization</p>
<p>will accept email, but hosts no mailboxes for that domain.&nbsp; This</p>
<p>scenario might occur when one organization is acting as an ISP for other</p>
<p>organizations, or offering services such as email content filtering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in office 365, External Relay Domains is not an option. Only the Internal Relay Domains and Authoritative Domains are available.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook&nbsp;</p>

<h3> eleftheria irimia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Contacts</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get straight into the topic, my Skype has been acting up strange since the latest update. After the Facebook button was cancelled, seems like I've lost all of my contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sadly, when I realized I had to use the transfer tool, it didn't work either. I was directed to my Facebook page but in zero time a message appeared claiming ''Oops, something went wrong'' and I needed to come in touch with Skype's Services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I need to admit I'm not really satisfied with the new update. Although it's fancy enough, it lacks a ton of tools and settings the old one used to have.</p>
<p>Please, give me a helping hand, fixing out my problem. I'm not in favour of losing all of my contacts and dumping Skype community once and for all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours Faithfully,</p>
<p>Eleftheria Irimia.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I apologize if this brings confusion to you. However, as announced, after January 10<sup>th</sup>, there’s no way or option now for Facebook Skype

    <title>Notifications for Errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joaquin jares  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notifications for Errors</h2>
                    Last night at about 3am my phone tried to sync but couldn't (bad 3G connection, I assume, as it happens a lot around here). The phone showed an error message in a screen, turning the display on. I found it still on this morning as it was charging and my
 charging profile is to never turn the display off. I think that was a waste of battery/electricity. Can you send a notification for errors and updates instead of a full screen? That way if I'm really interested I can click on the notification and dismiss it
 if I'm not. And it will not drain the 5 minutes battery of a full powered display that I have configured when on battery.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks a lot!</div>

<br />All you need to do is log into your MS Account used to purchase your subscription, deactivate the license for the machine your replacing and then install Office 365 on your new machine.

<h2>            Release 14986 crashes</h2>
                    <p>For the first time since 2014, one of my build installs caused my PC to crash 6 minutes after rebooting. It really didn't give me much time&nbsp;to try and test anything before&nbsp;a new hard reboot. By that I mean no pauses or freezes, no warnings of any kind just
 a hard reboot.&nbsp;As I tried looking into some of the logs it didn't seem to matter what I was doing, 6 minutes in, and BAM reboot.</p>

            <p>I had an OCZ Revo PCI express drive that had that same problem years ago. Something was causing the drive to just disappear and the system would just shut down with no explanation. But every time I powered back on every thing would work again until It would
 just Stop with no error report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I added another SSD to the Standard SATA port and installed the OS to see if it would change anything. I found out that if I used the PCI express Drives for any large file the drives would just quit working with no warning and I could not see them in
 File Explorer until I rebooted which explained why my system was crashing before. The OS can't Operate without a drive. It did not matter which of the Drives I used on the Card It would fail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So about&nbsp;a year and a half ago I removed the HDD Drive from the card to see if it was OK. It has been working perfectly and it is one of my backup drives now. .</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess what I am getting at is if you are getting no kind of a error message and non of the other Replies help you might try a New Drive just encase you are having the same problem I had.:)</p>

            <p>Thanks Cal54, I was thinking along the same lines, but since this drive was a clean install on a drive and the only change made overnight was the most current build I am not sure. There is no error messages, or indication prior to sudden shut down other
 than the screen goes Black and I wait for POST messages to show up and wait for boot up.</p>

            Hi Bob,<br />

            Same issue. I have been running all the Insider Versions on the same computer. This 14986 is the first one that does not work. I will get to the login screen, then it blue screens with various errors - Stop Code System Service Exception being one of them.
 It then reported there was an issue with my account when I was able to login. Rolled back to previous build 14971 and it booted up fine.

<p><span>ActiveSync 4.5 forgets Partnership</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This happens every once in a great while, I’ll plug in my t-mobile sda via usb and ActiveSync 4.5 will start the new partnership wizard. It like it loses the
 partnership. When I try to re-create the partnership the wizard tells me this phone is already setup to syncwith another PC. BTW, no 3rd party FW.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is there away I can delete the partnerships on the phone with out losing data OR recover lost partnership in ActiveSync? Suggestions?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>TIA!</span></p>

<p>To delete the partnerships, open Activesync on your device and click Menu - Options. Select your PC and click Menu - Delete. I recommend you reboot your smartphone and before connecting again, delete the partneship
 in Activesync on your PC as well. Click&nbsp;File -&nbsp;Delete Mobile Device. Reboot.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will go through the new partnership wizard again and it shouldn't be the only time you will be asked to do that.</p>
