            As it has been posted many times that 3rd party programs/software may have issues with Beta Preview builds, suggest that you ask the makers of such software about working with Beta builds of Windows 10.

            Is there an easy way I can get out of this insider build without reseting, as I have 1tb of games and documents, and only a 1mb per second internet speed

    <title>copying text from sql server into onenote formatting lost - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            copying text from sql server into onenote  formatting lost</h2>
                    I use One note to maintain my daily work and usually i have to copy paste queries from SSMS to One Note. Problem I am facing is that in one note the formatting is lost and it is in simple colour which creates problems in review later.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I started copying text into MS Word then into OneNote but it causes a new problem that special characters are inserted and when i copy paste same text from onenote to SSMS query generates error and i have to manually delete the special characters.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since SSMS and Onenote both are Microsoft apps there formatting should be copied over.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using windows 7 operating system and onenote 2010.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help to overcome would be appreciable</div>

Also since the issue seems to be while copying from SSMS, you could check the technet for suggestions.<br />

<p>I recently had to debug this very same problem and found that the error is caused by the instant actions setting.</p>
<p>More specifically the error is caused by a corrupted target folder setting and the interpreting JavaScript which isn't able to correctly handle getting the "Instant Actions" images for this non existing folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:</p>
<p>- Disable "Show instant actions" on the page/menu: Inbox &gt; Options &gt; <span>Instant actions</span>.</p>
<p>- Optionally re-enable the same setting as it will correct the corrupted setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will help.</p>

<h2>            Is this N95 8GB a Bad one &#63;</h2>
                    Hello<br />
<br />
I'm interested in a N95 8GB phone that somebody would like to selle it.<br />
<br />
The mainly actual issue that the 7th and 8th digits of the IMEI are 02 ( the phone is from SFR France ) and according to some sites these phones are assembled in UAE which seems to be very bad.<br />
<br />
So does the quality of the phone suffer from this ? thanks for answering :)

            If it is a genuine N95-2 then you have nothing to worry about. They are all made to the same specifications using the same parts and processes regardless of the place of manufacture. Only models made for the Chinese market lack WiFi and UMTS.<br />
<br />
The one you want was obviously made for the French market, so you're fine.

            Obviously make sure that the phone is unlocked. If it isn't, you won't be able to use it unless you too are on SFR.

            Locking and blacklisting are different things.<br />
<br />
When it is locked to a specific network operator's (carrier's) SIM cards, then you can only use that operator's SIM cards and it works in that operatpr's network (and those networks where the operator has a roaming agreement). The operator who had the phone
 locked in the first place can generate and provide an unlocking code that removes the SIM lock/restriction.<br />
<br />
When a phone is blacklisted, it is usually because it has been reported as stolen, and then no network that uses/shares the same blacklist will allow it to connect to their network with any SIM card at all. Convincing the operators that it has been incorrecly
 blacklisted is much harder than getting an unlocking code from them.

<br />
Is the phone locked or is it blacklisted? They are two fundamentally different things.<br />
<br />
If it was originally bought from a network then it is almost certainly <u>locked</u> to that network and will not work with SIM cards from any other network - even the "same" network in a different country (eg. you can't use an Orange France SIM in a phone
 locked to Orange UK). This can be dealt with by contacting the original network and asking them for the unlock code that will allow you to use SIM cards from other networks. There may be a charge for this.<br />
<br />
OTOH, if the phone is blacklisted, it is because someone has reported it as stolen and its IMEI number has been entered into a worldwide database of "do not let this phone work!" numbers. In this case you're pretty much snookered because you'd have to find
 out which organisation entered the phone's IMEI number into the database and then convince them that you are the rightful owner of the phone and that it was incorrectly reported as stolen.

<p>Jon - as an alternative to what you are trying to do why not add the tick symbol to the Quick Access Toolbar (QAT)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing this means that the tick symbol will be available on 1&nbsp;click only&nbsp;rather than having to type in, for example,
<strong>tik</strong> all the time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>See here on how to add the tick symbol to the QAT:-</p>

            <p>I also have the GUID-like folders, in Outlook 2010 desktp, Outllok.com online, and on my Windows Phone 8.1 (Nokia Lumia) and I don't believe it is anything to do with changes to my email account that is synchronized in these places.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>It seems necessary to delete all folder from each of the 3 locations / devices</strong>,
<strong>MANUALLY</strong> - since synchronization cannot occur because the folder names are &gt; 30 characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this a right PITA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[EDIT]</p>
<p>Deleting all folders from Outlook 2010 (desktop), and then again from where they go into the system Deleted folder, seems to clear the same folders from online Outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had around 40 GUID-folders, not 150 as I guessed earlier - but still a lot of mouse clicks to get back to some semblance of normality - but left with a deep suspicion about the reliability of Outlook.com and the synchronization process across devices.</p>

            So I was advised to manually delete these folders. &nbsp;I did so and they have not returned, but I see that isn't working for most people. &nbsp;For the record, I have a windows 8.1 system, but don't use the mail app and I have an android phone. &nbsp;Not sure if those
 who have the folders return after deletion after deletion are in the same boat.

            <p>Same issue. All of a sudden today I have "Guid Folder Syndrom". Dozens of them. It's a PITA to delete each one by one since the UI doesn't support multiple selection. I don't even know which email "account" was responsible for causing it.

            From what I found out, the certificate has to be in DER format and have the .cer extension. If it then is a certification authority (ie. root) certificate, it will install rightaway when you open it using the web browser. After that, no more trusted site
 certificates will be needed since all certificates signed by the CA will be covered.

<p>I think I have the same problem as the original poster; I need to install both a client certificate and a CA certificate, in order to access a WLAN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I copied both certificates onto the phone's memory card, and then opened the client certificate (.p12) which installed fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then opened the CA certificate (.der), which also got installed, but under "Trusted Site Certificates" instead of "Authority Certificates". I have also tried to open the certificate using the built-in web browser, and it will still install as the wrong
 type of certificate. If I open the certificate using a web browser on my computer, the certificate is recognized as a CA certificate, so I believe this is an issue with my E66.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Very similar problem on my E71.</p>
<p>I transfered files&nbsp; to the phone's memory card via USB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installed personal certificate (pkcs12) without problems - just opened the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have CA certificate in DER format (tried with suffix .der, .cer, .crt). When I try to install it I get error "Unable to open. File type not supported." &nbsp; If I try with the same cert in PEM format it opens as txt file and can't be installed either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No clue yet.</p>

<p>Ok. Solved.</p>
<p>Quite like 
jmroth said.</p>
<p>Uploaded CA cert (DER format, .crt suffix) to web. Accessed it with web browser and it installed to appropriate cert store.</p>

            Maybe you better install in the phone memory, not on the memorycard. All the authority certs are installed in the phone's memory.

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I think it can't be installed anywhere else but in phone memory (cert/key store). As I said above&nbsp; - trying manual install failed for me, so I uploaded CA cert to web and installed it via phone's browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the same problem on the E52!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case it is a EAP-TLS WLAN. For a connection the authority certificate and the personal certificate is needed. I had no problems with installing the personal one, but I don't know how to get the authority certificate into the right folder. It always
 ends up in the "Trusted Site Certificates" folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also uploaded it to the web and opened it with the phone browser, as you suggested: same result!</p>

<p>I already spent hours on this issue now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a possibility to access the authority certificate folder? Where is it &amp; which program do I need to access all data on my Nokia?</p>

<p>I've got the same issue on my E52.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even when I access the certificate via browser it gets downloaded and finally ends up in trusted sites certificates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The certificate has the ending .cer and is in DER-format.</p>

            <p>Sounds like you really have data problems in your spreadsheet.&nbsp; Excel doesn't really have data validation, thus when you import in to Access it blows up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all check that the fields in Access all allow NULLs and try importing the 2nd series.&nbsp; If that fails try changing the data types in Access to Memos.&nbsp;&nbsp; Memos allow anything...you then should be able to review the data for problems and write queries
 with CDate, CLng to find the problem.</p>

<p>Below the ‘Bing’ bar in a banner reads &lt;!--[if It IE7]&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt; starting from the left hand side. The rest of the banner has nothing else. Below the above mentioned is the normal header banner with ‘msn More Outlook.com Mobile Bing Rewards’ choices
 and the ‘Bing’ search field ‘Site Search’ and ‘Web’. Never have seen this weird behavior before from ‘IE9’. All other activity using right click ‘Copy shortcut’ then ‘Paste’ into the upper left hand side of ‘Bing’ address bar has ever done this before.</p>

 between the two.&nbsp; Now none of the programs open when I click the icons (PC).&nbsp; I tried to uninstall and reinstall, but didn't get far...not even sure I uninstalled correctly.&nbsp; Help! I need Word, PowerPoint and Excell for School!

How to Fix It</span></span><span><span><br />
</span></span><span><span><br />
Try to modify your message, or change how you're sending the message, using the guidance in this article: Bulk E-mailing Best Practices for Senders Using Forefront Online Protection for Exchange [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526654]. Then resend
 your message.</span></span><span><span><br />
</span></span><span><span><br />
If you continue to experience the problem, contact the recipient by some other means (by phone, for example) and ask them to ask their email admin to add your email address, or your domain name, to their allowed senders list.</span></span><span><span><br />
</span></span><span><span><br />
Was this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=717204].&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><br />

</span></span><span><span><br />
More Info for Email Admins</span></span><span><span><br />
</span></span><span><span><br />
Status code: 550 5.7.350&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><br />
</span></span><span><span><br />
When Office 365 tried to send the message to the recipient (outside Office 365), the recipient's email server (or email filtering service) suspected the sender's message is spam.</span></span><span><span><br />
</span></span><span><span><br />
If the sender can't fix the problem by modifying their message, contact the recipient's email admin and ask them to add your domain name, or the sender's email address, to their list of allowed senders.</span></span><span><span><br />
</span></span><span><span><br />
Although the sender may be able to alter the message contents to fix this issue, it's likely that only the recipient's email admin can fix this problem. Unfortunately, Office 365 Support is unlikely to be able to help fix these kinds of externally reported
 errors.</span></span><span><span><br />

    <title>Access database question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m-123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access database question</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am creating an Access database for our office.&nbsp; We have one main sheet that contains "check" information such as date entered, check number, vendor ID, vendor name, Site, etc. for 5 different sites.&nbsp; Each site has to add more info for their own checks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am creating access database that still have the one spreadsheet (all the checks info goes on the one sheet) and by creating query for each 5 different sites, we can disseminate the "split" database with each site on it to give to each site.&nbsp; My question
 is that is it ok for them to adjust/add/delete in query and that will automatically link to my one main sheet that I keep at headquarter?&nbsp; Also, each site have multiple people who has to go in and adjust the same query database.&nbsp; Is that going to be ok with
 simultaneous entry?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not want to create five different tables and we have to enter each sheet because we get large amount of checks but don't know which site until we research each of them. So it's easy to paste into the main sheet and enter all the info to include site
 info and query automatically dissaminate the site info on each sheet.&nbsp; Thank you for your help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Access is NOT a spreadsheet. Access tables are not spreadsheets. That is the first thing you need to understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second question are each of these sites on the same LAN or do you have to send then copies of the application to get their data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, you said you don't know which site will do the research, so how is this determined?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fourth, you do data entry in forms, not queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to help you we need more info.</p>

            I understand - it looks like spreadsheet.&nbsp; I collect all the checks and annotate information (with location) and have to give each location's checks so they can make inputs, etc. but the main form should still be connected to the query and update itself
 automatically.&nbsp; So we can't use query to update the info?&nbsp; I tried and it works (link to the main sheet) but we are not supposed to?&nbsp; Thank you for your help..

<p>Again, Access is not a spreadsheet. Access is a relational database and you should use it relationally as it was intended. Using Access with a single table is a waste of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You refer to a query, but with a single table I don't know what you need a query for. You need to understand how a relational database works and how to normalize a database. And the first thing you need to do is stop thinking and referring to it as a "sheet".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the very least, based on what you have said, you need at least three tables:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblChecks</p>
<p>CheckID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>CheckNumber</p>
<p>VendorID (FK)</p>
<p>CheckDate</p>
<p>CheckAmount</p>
<p>SiteID (FK)</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblVendor</p>
<p>VendorID (PK )</p>
<p>VendorName</p>
<p>other Vendor info</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblSite</p>
<p>SiteID (PK)</p>
<p>Sitename</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for only allowing the sites to edit their own, you should have a login that identifies which site and then filter the form soo they only see their site.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<div>
<p><span>You can use the recover deleted / lost emails feature in Outlook.com&nbsp;</span>to bring back your lost emails. However, when Outlook.com recovers missing / deleted emails, it restores as many emails as it finds regardless of its dates.
</p>
<p>There is no option to choose the range of dates of the messages. </p>
<p><strong>If the messages are not recovered they have been purged from the system.</strong></p>

<h2>            After windows phone 8.1 update 1 IE became slow</h2>
                    <p>After this update I noticed that some sites I usually look through became incredibly slowly (wpcentral and w7phone.ru). After IE loads first article title from the news list, it takes a snap for 15-20 seconds and then reloads the page with full site content.</p>
<p>But another site (habrahabr.ru) loads in a moment (before this update it took a while).</p>
<p>Now I'm trying to type this message from IE and it lags when I'm trying to delete some characters or words. It's sad, I think.</p>
<p>I have Nokia Lumia 625, do somebody have the same problems?</p>

<h3> frederic joss  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive for Business - Restrict permissions</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are deploying OneDrive for Business to a thousand of users. The majority of them are not IT guys, they&nbsp;don't know about&nbsp;SharePoint and see OneDrive for Business as a simple storage space based on the cloud.</p>
<p>When the licenses "Office Online" and "SharePoint Online" are assigned to a user from the O365 Admin portal, a full My Site web environment is created (including Newsfeed, Documents, Recycle bin, etc.).</p>
<p>My problem is that the user is a full Admin of his "My site". So he has access to the admin menu like "Add an App" or "Site Settings" directly from his OneDrive web page. For example, some curious users already change the "site permissions" and lost access
 to their Library, some change the "Look and feel", etc.</p>
<p>My question: Is there a way to restrict the user rights and allow only to manage documents?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance for your answer.</p>
<p>Fred</p>

<p>Hi Frederic,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates.<br />
<br />
I’d like to answer your questions as follows:<br />
1.If we give the user Contribute permission, they can see the Site Contents but don’t have the option to add a new app. Meanwhile, they can see the recycle bin via accessing the Site Content. So, this should be the best practice for your requirement. Users
 can upload files, can see the recycle bin but cannot add apps or configure other settings.<br />
<br />
2.As the user himself are not the administrator for his OneDrive for Business site, it will display the site administrator's picture and this picture will redirect the user to the administrator's Delve page. It’s not feasible to change this picture and the
 redirect URL when the user is not the administrator for the OneDrive for Business site.
<br />
<br />
3.For using the scripts to finish the settings for thousands users, we suggest you post a new thread in our
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home?category=sharepoint&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint MSDN forum</a> for professional support. It's a specific channel that handles scripts customization for SharePoint related questions.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />

                    Having done a global search and found the email message, how do we know where the email message is currently located preferably without using VBA?&nbsp; I have a lot of folders in the inbox and I usually manually move the incoming messages to the respective
 folders upon receipt.

            <p>If you know the keywords then you can use the search feature in Outlook which will give the results along with a column named
<b>In Folder </b>which will show the messages in the respective folders.</p>
<p>To enable to
<b>In Folder</b> Column:</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to <b>View</b> tab -&gt; Click on
<b>View Settings</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Columns</b> option</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select <b>All Mail fields</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select <b>In Folder</b> under the available columns.</p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Add</b> button to add it in the Columns.</p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click OK.</p>
<p>To include results in
<b>All folder</b>s:</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on<b> File</b> -&gt;
<b>Options</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to <b>Search</b> option.</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Under <b>Results</b> -&gt; Select<b> All folders.</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>OK.</b></p>
<p>Now you can type keywords and the results will show up along with the Folders where the e-mails are in.</p>

 the first time so there should be a paper trail. I guess I will download the trial for now so she can get her work done. Thank you in advance.

<p>Hi Serge,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my experiencing and test result, it is not feasible to create a rule that applies to all users under the same domain to copy specific emails to a specific folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fully understand your concerns, therefore, I'd like to recommend you take a moment to share this idea and send your feature request to our development team in the
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273493-office-365-admin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UserVoice
</a></span></strong>forum for feature improvement in the future. Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as a workaround, end users can create inbox rules to copy specific emails to the specific folder. Here are the steps to create inbox rule in
1. Click Settings &gt; Mail &gt; Automatic processing &gt; Inbox and sweep rules.</p>
<p>2. Under Inbox rules, click “+” to create a new rule.</p>
<p>3. Then set the rule like below picture to copy emails sent to the specific client to a specific folder:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6dd2846a-2984-4ad9-ae42-ffaa01230689?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6dd2846a-2984-4ad9-ae42-ffaa01230689?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>4. Then create a new rule like below picture to copy all emails from this specific client to a specific folder: &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bbb9f7c-a6ac-40b0-b890-371e89875afd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bbb9f7c-a6ac-40b0-b890-371e89875afd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Note: inbox rule is not applied to all users in the same domain, so every user may need to create above two rules on their end.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Thanks for your understanding.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>
