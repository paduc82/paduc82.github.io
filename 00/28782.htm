<h2>            Outlook 2013 crashes constantly and repeatedly downloads emails in duplicate as a result</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new Lenovo operating on Windows 8 in July.&nbsp; I subscribed to Office 365 Home Premium.&nbsp; All was fine until August when Outlook 2013 within Office 365 started crashing and reopening repeatedly.&nbsp; Each time, it would re-download emails from my server.
 You can imagine how cluttered my inbox has become.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have tried:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>+ Went into safe mode and unticked all the add-ons.&nbsp; Didn't work.</p>
<p>+ Crashes even in safe mode.</p>
<p>+ I took out all my email from my server.&nbsp; There seemed to be half an hour of stability...but then it all started crashing again.</p>
<p>+ I tried turning off my antivirus in case that was causing the problem. It still crashed.</p>
<p>+ I tried an earlier restore point. Didn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to uninstall Outlook...but you can't separately uninstall Outlook without uninstalling all of Office 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot operate without Outlook.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the frustration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we proceed with the troubleshooting, I need more details:</p>
<p>How is the email account setup (POP3/IMAP/Exchange Active Sync or Exchange Server)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us restart the computer in Windows clean boot following the steps from the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</font></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note:</font></span> Ensure you restart the computer in normal mode after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, create new Outlook profile following
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2752583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2752583</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add an email account in new profile in Outlook 2013, refer the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/add-an-email-account-HA102809480.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/add-an-email-account-HA102809480.aspx</font></a></p>

            Many thanks Aravinda.
<div><br />
<div>It says it's POP3. (I use 123-reg.co.uk as my server.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried your clean boot. I can't tell if it worked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried to change the profile, but that didn't work. &nbsp;I got to the point where you put in your email address and password and it said:</div>
<div><br />
<div>"An encrypted connection to your mail server is not available. &nbsp;Click Next to attempt using an unencrypted connection." [I did try that and it didn't work.] &nbsp;This is puzzling because I have never had this problem in the past.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have since noticed that the problem only occurs when there is email on the webmail server at 123-reg. &nbsp;If I clear that out, my OUtlook does not crash. &nbsp;That is obviously not practical however as I access my email through Outlook. &nbsp;Also, I have been using
 123-reg on my Windows 7 computer for years with no problem with Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks for any continued help.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply and sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me help you further in regards to your issue.</p>
<p>As you state that 'If there is an email on the webmail server', what type of email are you referring to (Spam, from a specific sender, etc.)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you were not able to setup the email account automatically, try to setup the email account manually with the correct account settings on the new profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the details and the results for further assistance.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I had the same problem...&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Apparently this happens when u have a slow internet connection...<br />
<br />
All u have to do is open the Setup file.. <br />
Ex:<br />
Setup.X86.en-US_O365HomePremRetail.....<br />
or<br />
Setup.X64.en-US_O365HomePremRetail....<br />
<br />
&nbsp;And wait for the error msg to come... When it appears..<br />
Close it.. Wait for 10 Seconds.. Again open it.... <br />
<br />
I monitored all the traffic usage and it actually downloads some data... Even though the error pops...<br />
<br />
At one point it will start to work and go into streaming mode...<br />
<br />
Dont worry if the error msg pops up early compared to the early percentage...<br />
<br />
In the sense at one time the percentage will go upto 22% and pops up the error...<br />
And in the next one.. It may only go up to 11%... <br />
<br />
But dont worry... Eventually it will add up all together and will take you to the next stage...<br />
<br />
Good Luck waiting...<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Ohh... BTW... <br />
<br />
For people who already had older office versions installed on ur computer,<br />
I highly recommend to cleanup the mess that it left behind when uninstalling buy using this small fix tool..<br />
<br />
Its a Microsoft tool so feel free to use it...<br />
It clears out all office junk that was left behind...<br />

<h2>            MS Access 2010, Windows 7, part of chart is not visible</h2>
                    <p>I have a database converted from Access 2003 to Access 2010 running on a Windows 7 PC.&nbsp; When I create a chart, the right side is cut off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my searches in the forums and on the Microsoft website, the problem seems to point to Windows 7’s dpi scaling feature and some bug in the MSGraph.Chart.8 control that Access uses. I’ve checked my Windows 7 PC though and even turning off UAC and setting
 the theme to Classic doesn’t seem to solve the issue. I’ve also recreated the graphs from scratch in Access but the problem still persists.</p>
<p>The only way I’ve found so far to get around the problem is to switch the graph size mode to ‘Zoom’ and then to shrink the graph to about 2/3 the size until the display area is not cropped. I haven’t been able to figure out why expanding the graph beyond
 a certain size starts to crop it as it seems to be independent of the page margin size.</p>

            <p>I ran into the same problem in Access 2007 last year, and the only workaround I have been able to find is to reduce the size of the charts to a maximum width of about 928 pixels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's very disappointing that a year and a half later, after the first service pack of the next version (Access 2010) has been released, the problem still hasn't been solved.</p>

<h2>            How can I find which add-on is causing Internet Explorer to keep recovering itself</h2>
                    
<p>Original title:&nbsp; <strong>Add-ons...Heeellllpppp....aarrgghhhhhh.....</strong></p>
<p>Gday Guys/Girls,</p>
<p>Hope you are all well. Im hoping that someone could possibly shed some light on my nightmare of a problem. Well.......</p>
<p>Everthing was fine with my compaq presario B1900 laptop running windows vista, and IE8, until this morning. When i went to use internet explorer, it would not let me connect, and the IE page kept trying to recover itself, so i never actually got onto the
 internet home page....It just kept saying internet explorer not responding as well...mmmm....</p>
<p>So i tried everything, like running in safemode, using virus checker, but no look. So then i thought check the add-ons, and hey presto,&nbsp; i can run IE no problems....</p>
<p>Come to think of it, this has only happened since i last did an auto update from microsoft.</p>
<p>Could anyone please let me know, how do i find out which add-on is causing the problems, as they all look ok, and sound ok, and dont look out of place...?? (without having to disable each add-on separately)..</p>
<p>Thanks so much guys, really look forward to hearing from you all...</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>Mark</p>

            I think that the only way you will find the problem is to disable each add-on individually until you find the culpret.

<h3> browsers not working need help  say:</h3>
<h2>            browsers not working even though i&#39; am connected </h2>
                    Hi, I just got window 7 about a month ago and I use internet explorer and google chrome to browser my internet. Then suddenly one day all my browsers stopped working and i get message like "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage" and etc. My Firefox
 is somehow still working but I don't like using it and want to get a fix for IE and google chrome. I' am almost current that i don't have malwares or things like that because i scanned my computer with norton, avg, avast, and malwarebytes and all showed that
 I'am clean. Also I'm 100% sure that I'm connected to the internet because i use Aim and firefox fine when i try to open IE and google chrome. I even tried to use safari which also did not work.<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate if anyone can help and thank you in advance
<br />

<p><span><span><span>Hi,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>It may happen that the Firefox and/or chrome have overridden the network settings. I would suggest you to uninstall these browsers
 from the machine and check if that help. Uninstall the browsers only if you have the backup to install them again and check if Internet Explorer works.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>If that does not help, run the Network Diagnostics tool in Internet Explorer</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>To do this, follow these steps:
</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span>Start Internet Explorer, and then try to access the Web page that is displaying the error message.
</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>On the page that displays an Internet Explorer error message, click the
<strong>Diagnose Connection Problems</strong> link. The Network Diagnostics tool will run. When the tool has finished running, it will report one of the following results:
</span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>It was unable to find a problem.
</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>It has detected a problem. Additionally, the tool will provide guidance about the next steps to take to troubleshoot the problem.</span></span></span>
</li></ul>
</li><li><span><span><span>Click
<strong>IP Address</strong>, and note the IP Address. You may need it for future troubleshooting.
</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Follow the steps in the Network Diagnostics tool to fix any connection problems.
</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Start Internet Explorer</span></span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the above mentioned steps do not resolve the issue, visit the below given link and follow the suggestions.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>You receive an error message in Internet Explorer: "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage"</span></span></span></strong></p>

I actually tried that already but no hope at all, also i did the Internet explore/Tools/internet options/connection/Lan setting/ and checked off everything and tried both ways but nothing. I even reset advance settings and that didn't do anything. I'm starting
 to think that there isn't any problem with internet explorer but more of something else in my systems that is making internet explorer and every other browsers except firefox not working. I really wanna find out what the problem actually is so i can start
 looking for a actual solution.<br />

            One main reasons of browser not working is the acceptance of cookies and the users may not be aware that these are one of the reasons behind the problem. Another reason can be the adapter problem. The cables must be checked and the adapter diagnostic program
 must be run. It may be a bad adapter, so it is better to replace it. Proxy settings are also one of the major problems which lead the browser for not connecting to the Internet. Even sometimes, computer viruses lead to the problem of browser not connecting
 to the Internet. If the Internet service provider is facing any problem, like if the server is down, then again it leads the browser not getting connected to the Internet.<br />
<br />
There are many solutions available for the user and it depends on the choice of the user that which solution he/she will go for. The first is that the loopback address must be checked as it tells you whether your TCP/IP address is working correctly or not.
 The network adapter must be verified on your computer. The default gateway must be pinged to see that the computer has communication with the subnet and the local gateway. You can ping your IP address with the local gateway to see that the data is getting
 forwarded beyond your network. If it gets connected then the problem is solved, otherwise the user at least gets to know that what the problem is and where is it starting from. It must be made sure by the user that the ISP i.e. Internet service provider provides
 access to the Internet. If this cannot be done, then click the ‘Tools’ option and restore the settings of the default browser.<br />

<p>Hi Olli, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already posted a feedback, then we can only wait for the rollout of a fix for the said issue. As of right now, we haven't received any bug fixes for the said error.

<p>Hi Josef,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>Windows automatically reported the greenscreens via the built in "Problem Reports" feature. So I assumed the dump files will reach you automatically.</p>
<p>Is that true, or are Windows Problem Reports not evaluated since they are a pre-Win10 technology?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, is it best practice to attach the dump file to the Feedback Hub report then, since it is not automatically transferred via telemetry?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Oliver</p>
<p>

<p>Yes, that's right. You have to include the dump file on the feedback report manually.

<p>Thanks Josef, done now.</p>
<p>Good to know that I have to attach dumps to the feedback report, because some documention really suggests that crashdumps are transferred automatically:</p>

<h2>            Introducing Skype Preview for Android devices running 4.0.3 to 5.1</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello, Skype Insiders. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven’t seen it already, check out Skype Preview built specifically for Android devices running 4.0.3 to 5.1. It’s available in the Google Play Store now. Look for version 7.48.76.7. Check it out and let us know what you think!
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>For those running Android 5.x specifically, this update includes a brand new experience for those who have already been using the Skype Preview app. You will need to sign-in to continue to use the app and get notifications. Apologies for the inconvenience.
 We’re about to release the new Skype experience to these devices and need to test a specific update scenario in the Skype Insider community before we make it available more broadly. As usual, Insiders, you’ll see the new stuff first!
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Remember you can give feedback here in the forums or in the app by (gently) shaking your device or going to Skype&gt;Feedback.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all you do to support Skype. We can’t wait to hear about your experience.<br />
The Skype Team</p>

<p>This is way better than the snapchat clone. This is the New Skype for Android as it should have been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make this the NEW app for more updated versions of android, </p>
<p>
</p><p>and make the NEW iOS, UWP and Desktop Clients look similar to this as well<br />

    <title>What happens when I click the &#34;Redeem Now&#34; button on the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertb_946  say:</h3>
<h2>            What happens when I click the &#34;Redeem Now&#34; button on the office.com&#47;offer webpage&#63;</h2>
                    I purchased Office Office Home and Student 2010 (Family Pack for 3 PCs which included a free upgrade to Office 2013.&nbsp; I understand the offer must be redeemed by May 31, 2013.&nbsp; When I go to the office.com/offer webpage, I see that I am to click on the "Redeem
 Now" button, but there is no indication what happens when I do this, e.g. will my installed copy of Office 2010 be uninstalled and the new 2013 installed automatically, or will I be given options for downloading an executable file to install Office 2013 later?&nbsp;
 I would prefer not to install the Office immediately now but continue to use the 2010 program for&nbsp;some time&nbsp;if only for compatibility reasons, since I use the 2010 program on two Win 7 machines and one XP machine (on which Office 2013 cannot be installed.)&nbsp;
 I would appreciate some help in determining what will happen when I click on the "Redeem" button.

<p>Hi Projectadmin,</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue, could you clarify the following information?<br />
1. Does the issue happen to this specific document library? How about the result in other libraries in other sites?<br />
2. Can you create new Excel files in Excel Online?<br />
3. How about other types of files like Word or PPT files, will the issue happen？<br />
4. Can you open the problematic files via desktop Office clients?</p>
<p>Please post back with the information above at your convenience and we will continue to assist you based on the update.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Allan</p>

<p>Hi Projectadmin,</p>
<p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>As the issue only happen to 2 Excel files, could you temporarily download these two Excel files to the local and then delete these two Excels files from the document library.
<strong>Note:</strong> Please also delete them from the Recycle Bin. After that, re-upload them again to the library to see the outcome.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, if possible, could you provide these two problematic Excel files with us to further investigate the issue.&nbsp; To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect it. You can check the PM via the link below:<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p>Let us know the result at your convenience so that we can assist you further.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Allan</p>

create calculations in reports or queries?<br />
<br />
How do I get the number to show 2 decimal places?<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Arithmetic calculations can only be performed on numeric data.&nbsp; However, under many common circumstances, if you use a&nbsp;string value in&nbsp;such a calculation, it will be converted to what the program thinks is a suitable numeric data type before performing the
 calculation.&nbsp; For example, if you were to enter this in the Immediate Window:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?1 + "2"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The response would be:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, if one of the operands is a string and the other is a numeric type, the string will be converted to a number (if possible).&nbsp;&nbsp;But you have to watch out!&nbsp; If you enter this in the Immediate Window:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?"1" + "2"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'd get this result:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's because the "+" operator is also used for concatenating strings, and since you gave it two strings to work with, that's what it did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, you should avoid storing numeric data as text if you are going to calculate with it.&nbsp; Calculations will be more efficient and accurate if the values to be used are stored as the correct data types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The number of decimal places displayed is a formatting option, and so is most easily controlled by the Format and Decimal Places properties of the text box that will be displaying the value.&nbsp; If you choose one of the numeric formats, then the Decimal Places
 property controls how many decimal places are displayed.<br />

 about 5 times and denial everytime. </p>
<p>&nbsp; I have an Apple mail POP account which fetches my outlook (hotmail) mail and stores it offline, so I can still see th content of my e-mails subjects, contacts, everything. The only problem is that it doesn't have all of my e-mails.I have really need to
 get back into my e-mail, needless to say, I have very important e-mails in my account. Please help!</p>

            <p>Hi Amir Hosseinux, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Community. I understand that you're unable to download apps and games due to an 80004003 error and that you've already reset your phone as suggested in another thread on this error.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have not already done so I would advise checking the forum thread at <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp7-sync/error-code-80004003/eb9f0b7a-9ec8-42ee-8067-9b351fd241fe">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp7-sync/error-code-80004003/eb9f0b7a-9ec8-42ee-8067-9b351fd241fe</a>&nbsp;where another customer found a way around the error. For the sake of convenience I'll post those steps below.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have now fixed this issue despite "trying everything", by the following:</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, copy any&nbsp;data (pictures and so on) that you may have on your phone to your PC as this will erase everything!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Providing you have copied all your data, reset the phone back to factory settings (Settings &gt; About &gt; Reset your phone)</p>
<p>2. Allow the phone to guide you through the "First time use" wizard, but **do not** sign into Windows Live.</p>
<p>3. "Buy" an app from Marketplace - at this point you are compelled to sign into Windows live but that's fine.</p>
<p>4. After you have downloaded all the apps you want then you can go to Settings &gt; Email &amp; Accounts &gt; Windows Live and tick the box to sync email (if you want to).</p>
<p>5. Update your phone using Zune (phone &gt; Settings &gt; Update)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After doing all of that, I found that I was able to get apps, whereas before, any attempt to get any app failed.&nbsp; The key was NOT to sign into Windows Live when setting up the phone for the first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if these steps are helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, </p>
<p>Nate W.H. </p>

    <title>Ovi Suite hangs on sync - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ovi Suite hangs on sync</h2>
                    Hello, I just bought a Nokia N8 and wanted to sync with Outlook. The first time it worked, but after removing the phone and reconnecting the sync hangs at different stages. Sometimes in the preparation stage "Synchronisation wird vorbereitet", sometimes
 during sync. There is no error message, why it hangs. After deinstalling and removing any phone specific drivers from device panel I reinstalled the Ovi suite. First sync worked, second not. In my opinion, regular reinstallation for every sync is no option.
 Any other ideas? Windows 7 pro 64 bit, Ovi suite 3.0.0.290, Outlook 2003.

<p>i see the same issue. Haven´t been able to sync my phone since 7th of February. Worked perfect before Version 3.0. Now i can sync SMS, photos and contacts. But when i try to sync my calendar it just stops with" preparing sync of calendar" im using outlook
 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also i cant login in to OVI from the program it just comes back with error not avaible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can things that have worked suddenly fail, to you even check the SW before rolling it out?</p>

<p>Additional testing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've added a new contact in the phone, connected the phone to my PC and the new contact showed up in OVI Suite as stored in phone memory. In my opion, this clearly shows that the connection to the phone works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After starting a synchronisation process, the program hangs at different stages as written in my first post. Canceling the sync doesn't work either. The program shows, that cancel is in progress, but never stops. No error message, no hint, why it doesn't
 work.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you try the solutions below:</p>
<p>-Try creating the connection between your phone and computer totally from scratch. Start by disconnecting your phone. In Nokia Ovi Suite, select Tools &gt; Options &gt; My devices. Select your phone at the top of the window and click Remove this device.
</p>
<p>-Then, select Tools &gt; Add new device, and follow the instructions to reconnect the phone.&nbsp; Check that your sync settings are correct in Sync &gt; Sync options &gt; Device sync. Finally, try syncing again.</p>
<p>-Manual sync <br />
Open Nokia Ovi Suite--&gt; Sync--&gt; Sync option--&gt; Uncheck the sync automatically everytime you connect the device.Then Sync--&gt; Sync now--&gt; Contact, Calendar&amp; tasks, Messages or Notes one by one individually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Br</p>

            This seems to solve the problem. To avoid HUGE amount of customer complaints, you should correct this SW problem in the Ovi quickly, before more Managing Directors start using their calendars etc. with E7 like me...

<p>Hello Mahayv,</p>
<p>I'm afraid, but your solution doesn't worked for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I disconnected the phone and removed the device from the Ovi Suite. Added the device and reconfigured synchronization details. Automatic Synchronization was unchecked. Started manual synchronization. Progress bar shows synchronizing contacts, but stays by
 about 5 %. After about half an hour I canceled the sync. After another half hour, in which Ovi Suite says, that it cancels the process I disconnected the device and rebooted the PC, to get fresh starting conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, removed and added device as described above. Instead of syncing with Outlook, I added a new connection to Thunderbird (only contacts). Thought, it would either copy the contacts from phone (or the Ovi Suite database) to Thunderbird, or delete the
 contacts in my phone. But none of them happened, synchronization hangs again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm very disappointed with this piece of software. It makes my smartphone useless (when I can't sync PIM data to have them everywhere with me, I can use a much cheaper phone).</p>

<p>Another supplement:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deleted the database from AppData\Local\Nokia\Nokia Data Store. Synchronization of contacts with Thunderbird works like a charm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disconnected the device. Reconnected it, started synchronization of contacts:</p>
<p><font>Program hangs again!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disconnecting the mobile phone from a computer breaks the synchronization. <strong>
This is sick!</strong> And the problem seems to be the database.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry to hear that solution i gave did not solve your synch issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me give you more:</span></p>
<div><span><span>
<p><br />
&nbsp; 1]</p>
<p>Go to Nokia Ovi Suite--&gt; Sync--&gt; Repair sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the following workaround too...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2]</p>
<p>&nbsp;Go to Start--&gt; Run and type %temp% and delete the Nokia folders.</p>
<p>Windows XP</p>
<p>C:\DOCUMENT\&lt;username&gt;\LOCALS\Temp\Nokia Remote Data Store</p>
<p>Windows Vista/ W7</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp</p>
<p>Delete all the files in the "Remote Data store" of that particular IMEI No.</p>
<p>3]</p>
<p>&nbsp;Remove the device profile in the&nbsp;Ovi Suite&nbsp;then connect&amp; configure the device again with Ovi Suite.</p>
<p>Go to </p>
<p>Nokia Ovi Suite--&gt; Options--&gt; My devices--&gt; </p>
<p>"Remove this device"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and connect&amp; configure it again.</p>
<p>4]</p>
<p>&nbsp;Go to </p>
<p>Control Panel--&gt; Right click and "Repair" Ovi Suite.</p>
<p>Go to </p>
<p>Control Panel--&gt; Right click and "Repair" Nokia Connectivity cable driver &amp; PC Connectivity solution.</p>
<p>In PC </p>
<p>Go to Run--&gt; type&nbsp;&nbsp; devmgmt.msc&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go to 'Portable device'&nbsp; and right click &lt;device&gt; do Driver update'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5]</p>
<p>If, Anti- virus is enabled, allow Nokia Ovi Suite&amp; Nokia programs in the Anti- virus program and try sync.,</p>
<p>6]</p>
<p>&nbsp;Delete the "MDataStore.db3" file and try synchronizing to Ovi Suite again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows XP</p>
<p>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Local Settings\Application Data\Nokia\Nokia Data Store
</p>
<p>Windows Vista/ W7</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Nokia\Nokia Data Store </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the user delete the above mentioned files/ folders all the user information in NOS will no-more be available.</p>
<p>Every time you delete the MDataStore.db3 -file - you also delete all contacts and text messages that might be stored in Ovi Suite. Also other metadata may be lost (music playlists, photo albums, etc).</p>
<p>So if you do not want to lose: move the Nokia data store file&nbsp; to a different location on
<br />
the hard drive.<br />
This data store holds contacts, calendar entries, notes, messages <br />
synchronized from the phone. </p>
<p>Next time after connection, new nokia data store will be created <br />
instead of corrupted one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Br</p>

<p>Hangs again, too. The long list of "help" doesn't help.Same problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What the H*LL is wrong with this software??? It's not our users job to fix these problems, it's Nokia's programmers! It's OK to update phone's SW every once in a while, but to get into computers different folders and delete this-and-that every day, THAT
 SUCKS!!! I've owned the phone for two days and this much of trouble, no way... :-(((((((((</p>

<p><span><span>Thank you very much for your patience, but I'm out for now. I just did a new factory reset and will send the phone back to my dealer. I'm sorry to do that, since the N8 is a very nice device, but synchronisation with the desktop is a must have

<h2>            Lumia 930 battery not charging after updating the software  into windows 10</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I'm currently using the Lumia 930 limited edition.<br />
<br />
The phone was doing just fine, other than for the fact the mic doesnt work when using speaker phone option. &nbsp;And I just updated the &nbsp;system software from Windows 8.1 Denim to Windows 10.<br />
<br />
And since then, the batter is not charging. Tried to charge it using all options as I have, and the phone is not charging. Now before the phone dies out completely, any one can suggest me any help...???<br />
<br />
Btw, I live at Abu Dhabi, UAE.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Shaheen Neo..

<h2>            Where is total editing time in Excel&#63;  It&#39;s not in Advanced Options</h2>
                    I use Excel Professional Plus 2010 and can't find the total editing time.&nbsp; When I go to File, Properties, Advanced I don't get a row of tabs but a list of advanced options with headings starting:&nbsp; Editing Options, Cut, Copy and Paste, IMage quality ...
 Can anyone tell me how I can get the total editing time?
