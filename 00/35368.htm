<h2>            How do you want to open this file popup when battery is charging</h2>
                    <p>Hello support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly help, I have been facing this issue for a long time now and it is slowing my laptop and its very annoying. A popup saying how do you want to open this .0 file? keeps popping up every second, I have searched everywhere for the file and there is no
 file. I also noticed that it comes up only when my laptop is charging, I currently run a windows 10 operating system. I have installed several antivirus and have scanned my computer several times, all to no avail. Kindly help. The screenshot of the popup is
 attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to solving this problem in earnest. Thank you.</p>
<p>

                    <p>I have run the automatic fix-its from MS and I am unable to use the Windows 7 Update. I continue to get error code 8024000B when trying to install KB 2640148.&nbsp;The optional updates won't install either, in fact, nothing will download at all when I try to
 install. &nbsp;Are there any other solutions to try before I wipe the computer?&nbsp; Any help will be much appreciated and the resolution will garner the utmost praise and adulation from me!!</p>

            <p><em>Oy! Where to begin...?</em></p>
<p><em>Ideally</em>, you would have (a) uninstalled the Norton application <em>and then</em> (b) downloaded/run the Norton Removal Tool &amp; rebooted (c)
<em>before</em> you installed the McAfee application <em>and before </em>(d) you created the Dec-11 image...</p>
<p><em>And</em> you would have (a) uninstalled the&nbsp;McAfee application <em>and then</em> (b) downloaded/run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool&nbsp;&amp; rebooted (c)
<em>before</em> you first installed the AVG application...</p>
<p><em>And</em> you would have restored all Registry cleaner backups <em>before</em> you created the Dec-11 image.</p>
<p>[Do I need to say that ideally you wouldn't have EVER used a Registry cleaner <em>
at all?</em>]</p>
<p>Not that your answer will make much difference now but&nbsp;may I ask if you (a uninstalled the Norton free-trial (which came preinstalled on the
<em>Vista</em> computer) <em>and then</em> (b) downloaded/ran the Norton Removal Tool &amp; rebooted (c)
<em>and then </em>did a <em>clean install</em> of the paid Norton application or did you just upgrade to the paid version?</p>
<p>Moving on...</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>The <em>good news</em> is that the computer appears to be fully-patched at Windows Update
<em>right now</em>.</p>
<p>The potentially (at least) bad news is the 8024000B error you&nbsp;encounter&nbsp;when trying to
<em>install</em> KB2640148 [<em>not</em> that KB2640148 isn't installed, if you can understand the distinction]. This
<em><u>may</u> mean</em> that one or more<em>&nbsp;</em>of the updates Microsoft releases on 14 August 2012 will NOT install either.</p>
<p>That being said...</p>
<p>For now, your best course of action is to do <em>nothing</em> (since <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2640148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB2640148</a> is an Optional, <em>non-security</em> update). [1]</p>
<p>But if you find that one or more of the 14 August <em>security </em>updates fail to install, please reply to this thread (instead of beginning a new one). Got it?</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>PS: In the meantime, see if you can locate (a)&nbsp;your Win7 Upgrade disc and (b) the discs that came with the Vista computer when you bought it. There's a remote chance that you may need both very soon.</p>

    <title>No sound in Action Center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sound in Action Center</h2>
                    <p>I've updated to Threshold 2 a few days back with no errors, problems, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only issue I have is that the Action Center doesn't have sounds for the notifications anymore, like in the previous build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The notifications pop up like before... for Twitter, regarding system, weather, others. But with no sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that how it's supposed to be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the Sound Scheme, also the settings in&nbsp;<span><span><span>System &gt;</span></span>&nbsp;</span><span><span><span>Notifications &amp; actions.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hey there and thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooter didn't find any problems at all. I was expecting this, no others programs, apps, have this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the driver is fine.&nbsp;It cannot be a driver issue anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I deleted the sound scheme and set back the Windows Sound default one. The deleted one had only one option modified, the sound for emptying the Recycle Bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, everything else has sounds, just like before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Sound Scheme (both the default and the deleted one), the Notification has the same sound as the notifications in Action Center had. They just don't come up with sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you trying to help me is an answer that the notifications in Action Center should have sound in this latest build?</p>

            <p>It's a Dell Latitude D620.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know, it's old. But every since Windows 7, 8, 8.1, first 10, I haven't had any issues regarding drivers, or had to look for specific drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's a driver related issue it's weird. The first Windows 10 had no problems playing the notifications sounds in Action Center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, on this latest build, there are no other sound regarding issues. None at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it my understanding that Threshold 2 acts totally different when it comes to app sounds?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'll try that thing about drivers, also I was thinking of doing a Reset. Since 7 I haven't had any clean installs, only upgrades to 8, 8.1, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll see how that goes...</p>

            <p>Sadly, after a clean install of Threshold 2, Action Center still has no sounds for its notifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not totally ok with accepting it as being a driver issue, since no other program installed or Windows itself has sound issues. That includes Device Manager of course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way this is a driver issue is if Threshold 2 handles app sounds in a different way requiring the hardware to act differently than the previous build or Windows 8/8.1 for that matter, which is a truly downstep for Microsoft. And a bit illogical actually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there's a cumulative update which is installing right now, I'll wait for the reboot to see what happens and probably mark this as answered anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A driver issue would be the fact that Windows 10 both July and November don't see my Lumia 920 connected. Another fail, since 8 &amp; 8.1 had no problems. Also, July Windows 10 was an upgrade on my system not a clean install so it's again weird for it not to
 keep that driver but to delete it completely, rendering my Lumia, well... somehow useless regarding conectivity with the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, back to sounds, I'm waiting for the reboot, without hope in solving the Action Center issue, actually.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Cumulative Update rolled up today didn't turn on the Action Center's sounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking, Cortana and Edge are also apps and they do play sounds. Also the Solitaire Collection, plays sounds in games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this, my issue, isn't that apps have a problem with my sound driver or that strangely this latest build would require the sound card to act differently from a hardware point of view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's only the Action Center that is acting this way, the whole thing being a bug of Threshold 2, more than it being a problem regarding old hardware systems.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No, the apps don't have sounds anymore. Not even with yesterday's update. I mean that actually as notifications in the Action Center. Everything else that needs a sound coming from an app works just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's probably like they said, a driver related issue. My laptop is a bit old, surprisingly works great with Windows 10, but this sound thing in Action Center seems not to.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            File Explorer not working in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Just upgraded to Windows 8.1and noticed that File Explorer does not load from the Task Bar Shortcut.Also if I right click on Recycle Bin for example no context menu appears all that happens is the Desktop and Task Bar disappear then reappear.<br />
<br />
My friend also has the same problem so I know that it is not unique to me.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any fixes or suggestions.<br />

            I solved the problem on my pc by downloading this<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
once installed sort by type and look for whats listed under 'context menu'<br />
<br />
assume everything from Microsoft is good<br />
<br />
now for each other one listed under 'context menu' you will have to disable them one by one and try file explorer each time you disable one...it's trial and error basically<br />
<br />
the problem for me was a Jriver Media item but i can't recall exactly what it was maybe 'jriver media X64'<br />
<br />
good luck and let me know how it goes....my pc is working great again now<br />

            Just tried this solution and it worked. For me I had to disable "IEContextmenu Class" run by Norton Internet security by Symantec Corporaton. File explorer came right up. I went ahead and enable it again after file explorer cameup.&nbsp;Also closed&nbsp;explorer
 and opened it again a few times just to make sure. Works like a charm!! Thanks a lot. :)

    <title>Problem with Windows Resource Protection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with Windows Resource Protection</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I am not sure if this community is speaking finnish or english so I'll write in english. The problem I am struggling with is that when I'm trying to log into windows, it stays in the 'loading windows' -mode for a while and then gives me BSOD. The reason
 this is happening, I believe, is that I think I filled my SSD with too much data (which was not the brightest thing to do, I know) and it crashed something on the ssd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I loaded the installer tool into my USB-stick and went to BIOS. From there I tried to do the automatic repair, but then it gave me the notification that the drive is locked, and in order for me to do the repair, I must unlock it. So i called to the Microsoft
 support. After 17 minutes in phone of trying to fix it from the safe mode with different prompt commands of which none seemed to do the trick, the support person gave me some more suggestions of fixing it through email. None of these worked either. The commands
 we were trying were&nbsp;</p>
sfc /scannow
<p>Into which the computer answered with "<span>Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation". The next one on the lis</span><span>Windows Resource Protection could not
 perform the requested operation". The next one on the list was&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>sfc /scannow /offbootdir=c:\ /offwindir=d:\windows&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;And the answer to this was&nbsp;</span><span>"Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service." Any ideas about what could be the next step?</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Okay, so I tried the commands on the link and I ended up with Error: 50 - DISM does not support &nbsp;servicing Windows PE with the /Online option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I searched the error and I ended up with this article: http://appuals.com/best-fix-error-50-dism-does-not-support-servicing-windows-pe-with-the-online-option/ -in which the guy suggested to delete the MiniNT -key, and I did. No effect, it still gives
 me the number 50.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>...Ssso my computer thinks that it is in pre-installed form? "Nu-uh, you cannot fix me because I don't exist yet". Then what is the entity that I'm talking with? I'm beginning to go through existential philosophy with my computer. I think I'll end up to
 mental hospital before i get this fixed. But hey, thanks anyways, and if you have some more ideas to suggest, I'm more than happy to try them.</p>

            <p>Okay, so this just happened: I had tried pretty much every prompt command suggested in the internet that could help in this situation, and none of them worked. So I went, out of curiosity, to the "refresh windows" and from there I somehow ended up getting
 to the SSD which was almost completely full. From there I was able to delete some of the big files, and after I had deleted about 15 gb of data, I tried to log in again. It gave me the "something went wrong" tab, but when I pressed cancel, something magical
 happened: it logged me in in a temporary profile. From there I am writing this as well. I get to control my files, and nothing on the SSD seems to be corrupted nor missing. However, none of my apps seem to be installed, so I can't use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange thing about this is that every time I now try to log in to my profile, it gives me the "something went wrong" and throws me to this temporary profile. Any ideas on how to fix this and get to my normal profile?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Most Windows 7 product still available are "OEM" versions which can not be used to upgrade from Vista (by upgrade I mean keeping your applications. The only option with an OEM version is a 'Clean' install' over top of Vista. OEM version are available in
 32bit OR 64Bit but not both.</p>

            <p>Be carefully as there are a lot of scammers selling either a product key (no media / DVD) or at a price too good to be true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do decide to go the OEM route just remember two things:</p>
<p>1) OEM versions&nbsp;are tied to the 1st PC it is installed on and can not be moved to another PC.</p>
<p>2) Be sure you have the installation media AND product keys for all your applications as they will need to be re-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as Palcouk mentioned you need to check to see if there are Windows 7 device drivers for you make and model. In some case a Vista driver will work in Windows 7 but this is not always the case.</p>

<p>hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'd like to upgrade an older PC from vista to windows 7. does anyone know of anywhere online that i can purchase and download an upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i purchase a windows 7 disk/keycode, do i have to purchase the full version? is there such a thing as an upgrade version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help would be appreciated.</p>

<span>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. In your case, you can upgrade to Windows 7 depending on edition and architecture of Windows
 Vista you have installed. If you are running a 32 bit version of Vista and want to upgrade to a 64 bit version (edition of Windows 7), you will have to a do clean install, this applies vice-versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running consumer editions of Windows Vista such as Home Basic or Premium, you can only upgrade to either Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate. Also, you cannot do downgrades, which means, if you are running Windows Vista Ultimate now, you cannot
 downgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium. You must do logical upgrades:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Vista Home Basic &gt; Windows 7 Home Basic, Premium or Ultimate</p>
<p>Windows Vista Home Premium &gt; Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate</p>
<p>Windows Vista Business &gt; Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise or Ultimate</p>
<p>Windows Vista Enterprise &gt; Windows 7 Enterprise</p>
<p>Windows Vista Ultimate &gt; Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Windows 7 is in limited stock because Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand because of its scarcity. This means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain affordable.</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Full version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Upgrade version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OEM System Builder version:</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>There is nothing wrong with using it too, especially since all future releases of Windows will be full versions anyway.
</strong></p>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>OEM Windows 7 licenses</strong> - <strong>These are the best deals you can get on Windows 7 right now.

    <title>How to delete microsoft account from laptop without losing all my data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> user747  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to delete microsoft account from laptop without losing all my data and installed programs&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I set up my new Windows 8.1 laptop a couple days ago and during the set up I was literally forced to enter my email address and password. If I didn't do that I couldn't continue and clicking I don't have an account did absolutely nothing. That's low, Microsoft!
 So I entered my email address and password and now I have to log in to my laptop and I didn't get to pick a user name, apparently my username is my email address. How do I change my microsoft account to a local account without losing my files and downloaded
 software? WITHOUT putting anything online in SkyDrive or OneDrive?</p>

    <title>Chrome and Taskbar shortcut are not getting along&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coreyogburn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chrome and Taskbar shortcut are not getting along&#63;</h2>
                    All this is on Windows 7 x64 Ultimate and is fully up to date with it's patches. I was running Chrome 37 when it said it wasn't able to upgrade chrome (it didn't give a reason why). So I uninstalled Chrome and reinstalled it from scratch. Now I'm at Chrome
 39.<br />
<br />
I should also point out that I have changed my Program Files location by manipulating ProgramFilesDir, ProgramFilesDir (x86), and ProgramW6432Dir in the registry at HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion because I have an SSD and would rather install
 on my secondary drive. These registry values are changed to D:\Program Files and D:\Program Files (x86) accordingly. I've had these values changed for a couple years and have never had issues with it (except some programs still manage to install to C). If
 at all possible, I'd like not to change these back to the C drive.<br />
<br />
Chrome installs without a hitch and I can find it in C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe along with it's accompanying files in the same folder. After installing, it pins itself to the taskbar and runs an instance of the browser. With
 that instance going, the pinned Chrome icon in the taskbar is highlighted normally just as you'd expect. If I close Chrome and attempt to reopen it by the pinned shortcut, I get this popup:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5dc24149-eff5-49ca-b276-add3a1eefe37" /><br />
<br />
Semi correctly, there is of course no file there in the D drive. However it shouldn't be looking in D, it should be looking in C where it successfully installed.&nbsp;I hold shift and right click the shortcut and click properties. The Target of the link is pointing
 to the D path. I change the D to C, click Apply, click OK, and try to click the link again and I STILL get the popup above! If I go back to the properties, it has reverted back to D instead of changing to C. I remove this taskbar link.<br />
<br />
So I tried going to C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe and dragging the exe to the taskbar to create a shortcut directly to the exe. This is where things get weird (again). After clicking on the new link, Chrome opens as expected and
 a SECOND Chrome shortcut will popup on the taskbar:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/abf328af-eccc-4c72-ab4c-a50ac56ad824" /><br />
<br />
Then the original link will become unselected after about 3 seconds:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/010c72fe-9dda-43f8-b141-f096e27c0b94" /><br />
<br />
Then the original link disappears and the new link gets a default icon after about another 3 seconds:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/993cedc1-281a-4446-b65e-aae96212b7ec" /><br />
<br />
Closing Chrome and using the new generic icon pinned in the taskbar behaves exactly the same as above where it says it can't find it on the D drive. Again, I can't change it's properties without it changing back.<br />
<br />
I've restarted a few times and uninstalled/reinstalled Chrome a dozen or so times by now. I've tried both Google Chrome's Single User installer and it's Multiple User Installer as suggested by a few outdated forum posts. Never am I offered a choice of where
 to install Chrome (if I could, I'd put it in D so it wouldn't be on my SSD and things would stop complaining).<br />
<br />
I'm at my wits end! What's happening here and how can I set up a simple link to Chrome?

            Nothing changed. When clicking the newly created shortcut in the taskbar, it still creates a second chrome tile, deselects the first, and loses the icon on the second one as the pictures above show.

            <p>I've found that if I revert my registry changes back to the C drive and restart explorer.exe then the shortcut will start to work normally. Now that the shortcut is working, I have changed the registry values back to D, restarted explorer, and it breaks
 the shortcut again.</p>

            <p>Sounds like taskbar is using that key as a variable to determine the location. I had never seen that. Does any other shortcut behave this way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe try creating a regular desktop shortcut to chrome, and see if it behaves correctly. If so, drop it on the taskbar.</p>

            <p>I don't keep many shortcuts in the taskbar. Usually just Chrome and Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I tried a plain desktop shortcut. It would work fine, but after I moved it to the taskbar, it would also change to use the D drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried creating a new shortcut from scratch so that I could make sure there wasn't an environmental variable in the path. I hardcoded the full, absolute path and still after putting it in the taskbar, it'd try to use the D drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss. For now, I'm just leaving the registry values pointing to C.</p>

<h2>            Mail app not working</h2>
                    <p>On adding accounts to windows mail app. The app is crashing and shutting down or showing error 0x80004005</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the cumulative update of windows 10 version 1803 (KB4343909), my windows mail app stopped syncing. I tried terminating and removing accounts from the mail app, but the app was crashing and shutting down. Then i resetted the mail app but after which
 i am not able to add any account. Either it is shuting down or showing error code 0x80004005.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Uninstalling and reinstalling the app using powershell</p>
<p>2)Reset and terminate</p>
<p>3) Waited for another cumilative windows update and mail update. Yet it is not resolved</p>
<p>4) A common suggestion found was to rename the comms folder in user/appdata/local folder. After restarting a new comms folder would be made by windows and mail would start. But when i renamed/moved comms folder, no new comms folder is being generated by
 mail app/windows. why? i don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help please, as i use mail app regularly for my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            1. Reset would not happen. Reset is done individually for the apps and carries the risk of losing data is data is stored only on computer not in the cloud.
<br />
<br />2. You are correct. If there is a correlation, then only update installation will work. 
<br />
<br />Do you have problems only in Mail app or in few other apps also?

<p>Tried both solutions. Not working. I come to think now may be the problem with mail app has been before the windows update. probably after 2 days of the mail update I received. I am only having the problem with mail apps and other apps are working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing which worries me is why renaming comms folder is not working? This solution has been working for many. Why is windows not able to make another new comms folder?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 tiles going blank after a while</h2>
                    All tiles in the start menu are going blank one by one after a few weeks. The only want to get em back is by going through the untile-&gt;tile hoopla. Are there any solutions to this bug? First reported in mid 2017 and yet still going strong!

<p>You want me to restart my computer and do all those things every time one of the 40+ tiles go blank? You gotta be kidding me. What about the BUG FIX??</p>

<h2>            Acer Aspire Switch 11 &#38; windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a brand new Acer Aspire Switch 11 with Windows 8 installed. I immediately tried to install Windows 10, but after going through all the install process, it gives the message '0x80004005 - 0x20004 The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase
 with an error during INSTALL_RECOVERY_ENVIRONMENT operation'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas or should I just send it back to Microsoft Store for a refund. Cheers.</p>

<p>Thanks, but it is straight out of box with no 3rd party AV software installed. It has defender. Should I disable this.

            <p>Did you ever find a solution to this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just bought an Acer Aspire Switch 11 Signature Edition, from the Microsoft Store where they say it comes clean and engineered to work and is ready for upgrade to Windows 10. I specifically wanted to be sure it would upgrade cleanly, so I haven't installed
 anything on it and also switched off Defender's anti-virus, to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating everything, I didn't get an option for upgrading to Windows 10 with Windows Update, so I went on a chat with Microsoft support. They ran through various things and decided that I was missing certain updates which would be necessary to be offered
 Windows 10 - although they also ran the MSDT for "Get Windows 10" and it came back showing no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, they got me to use the media creation tool to upgrade and, exactly the same as you, mine stopped with the error "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error
 during INSTALL_RECOVERY_ENVIRONMENT operation"&nbsp;</span>immediately after entering the black screen with the white progress circle... and then reverted to the Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you found a solution for this.</p>

<h3> uglymonkeybutt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Pro unable to create new user account &#47; profile</h2>
                    
<p>I built a brand new computer and installed Windows 7 Professional (64-bit), which I obtained through my school from MSDNAA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the install I created an administrator account for myself, which works fine.&nbsp; However, I am unable to create any other user accounts.&nbsp; I go through the steps to create them, and they show up on the list of accounts, but no user directory is generated
 in c:\user.</p>
<p>I have tried to create admin, standard, and guest accounts.&nbsp; None of them work.&nbsp; I have tried wiping the drive and reinstalling Win 7 from scratch, and got the same results.&nbsp; This problem is happening right from the start, not as a result of other programs
 installing or of a change in security/ownership settings.</p>
<p>I've seen this problem reported on this and other sites, but I haven't yet found a clear fix.&nbsp; Help!</p>

<p><span>Hi Yglymonkeybutt – Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
I know that’s by design in Windows®, I mean think again. <br />
AFAIK, Windows® will never add a new folder (with the username) <br />
under C:\Users\ directory; however, if you logon using the newly <br />
created account then you’ll see this on log in screen. <br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpublic.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pNQDfRaW8M0K1mwqXDSbZDCithZMZKKqypKH0xp2zL9-zZyDLDi1JpSd0rWqJ06B2R1bDtkABPWNqc-OJaMr4Yw%2ffirstTime.png%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<strong>Figure 1:1:</strong> Windows 7 preparing the&nbsp;newly&nbsp;created user desktop for the<br />
first time. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
During the process of preparing your desktop Windows®<br />
will create a folder with the user account name under the <br />
C:\Users\ directory and add the folders (e.g. Desktop, My Documents <br />
and more). <br />
