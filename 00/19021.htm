<h2>            Can&#39;t Delete Folder in IMAP Account in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    I have 2 folders in an IMAP account in Outlook 2016 which I cannot delete. &nbsp;Both are only local to my computer so I cannot delete them via the web. &nbsp;I tried to unsubscribe (right-click the folder, select IMAP Folders, run query) but they do not show up
 in the list for me to unsubscribe. &nbsp;I did move them to the Delete folder at one time, then moved them out; perhaps that affected this. &nbsp;Bottom line is I'm trying to do something very simple and Outlook can't do it. &nbsp;Any assistance is appreciated.

            I came up with a work-around. &nbsp;Move the local folder to a new folder that is not local, then delete the new folder via the web. &nbsp;Ludicrous that we still need to fight with our technology in 2016, but hopefully this will help someone else with the same
 dilemma.

<h2>            Need help&#58; Emails not sending &#34;Something went wrong and we haven&#39;t been able to send your message yet&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to send emails through my online account on the&nbsp;https://outlook.office.com/owa and I&nbsp;get this error:</p>
<p>"Something went wrong and we haven't been able to send your message yet"</p>
<p>I had the same problem for some time last year but fixed by each self. That started happening the last month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the emails even when I get this message are delivered to the recipient, the problem though is that I don't know if have been sent&nbsp;once all the emails stay&nbsp;in the "Drafts" folder (even if they have been delivered already).</p>
<p>That is happening 90% of the emails. not always.</p>
<p>Even when I reply to email addresses and to email addresses that I never had any problem&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we fix that problem? It is causing too much frustration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

<h2>            Questions about change from Zune to Groove</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am still confused on this. Will we not be able to use the Zune software at all to put music on the Zune device, even music we already downloaded using the Zune software? If the Zune
 software is not going to continue to exist, and if we won't be able to use Groove to put music on the Zune device, will the music we downloaded using the Zune software transition to the Groove software so we can at least listen to it on the computer and put
 it on a phone, or will we have to download everything again?</span>

            <p>It depends. Outside of storing your music on a Mapped Drive on a NAS (Like myself), if your music is already downloaded to say your "Music" folder in Windows, Groove should already see and be able to play the music you have downloaded from the Zune software.
 Any past purchases should work fine as well and also appear in your "Collection" within the Groove Software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This change burns me a ton with the continued removal of features that were once in the Zune software, and there is no way I am moving my music collection from my NAS to local, or have the bandwidth to store it all and just stream it everywhere from OneDrive
 (Especially since they reversed OneDrives features from Windows 8.1 with Placeholders to Windows 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I continue to wonder why Microsoft even has a Music service at all these days. When they once offered features years before everyone else, now it feels like they are never going to be competitive again where they once could have owned the market, and if
 they offered a free ad supported streaming service, could have owned the Spotify/Pandora market as well.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Thanks for replying. I have all my music in the music folder and backed up on a portable hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am glad all the music should transition to Groove and not have to be downloaded again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it seems we won't be able to put any of the music on a Zune device anymore in the near future. Just have to listen on the computer or put it on a phone. Is that right?</p>

            <p>According to the Zune FAQ at <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3096659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3096659</a> you (and I) can still transfer&nbsp;MP3s to and from your Zune. Just not the DRM'd songs. So, yeah, for licensed songs, you do need a computer or phone. Otherwise you're good.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>As of November 15, 2015, Zune services will be retired. You will no longer be able to stream or download content to your device from the Zune music service. However, Zune devices will still function as music players and any MP3
 content that you own on the Zune device will remain there. Youâ€™ll also be able to transfer music to and from your Zune player</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I'm not quite sure how that's going to work because as far as I know&nbsp;we still need the Zune software to transfer MP3s. That might be all it's good for. :(.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if I have a monthly pass with 10 credits, will my account be changed at the end of this current billing period or the next one before November 15th? &nbsp;I'm confused. &nbsp;To more confuse the issue my credits expire on the 14th of the month but I get charged
 on the 1st of the month so where does this leave me for the next two months?</p>

            You can still use the Zune software to transfer your personal music collection&nbsp;- this is any music you have purchased and own outright - to your Zune Player. Any music you have downloaded but not purchased via a Zune Pass will stop working on your computer
 and your Zune Player since the DRM rights for subscribed music will not be renewed after the Zune subscription service is shut down,

            If you have a monthly pass with 10 credits, your subscription will be converted to a Groove subscription that costs about $9.99 a month, includes no credits and is limited to 4 devices. If you do not want a Groove subscription, you need to cancel your
 Zune subscription.

            That is exactly what they are doing, sure if you own songs you can transfer them, but any subscription songs (what the zune was really made for) will not work anymore.) &nbsp; I was enjoying paying the 13$ or whatever for the 10 song credits, looks like i will
 probably cancel now as our family has 3 Zunes we use for offline listening on road trips and jogging etc.

            <p>This is horrible. The desupporting of the zune is bad enough, but the messaging around it is deplorable.&nbsp; The information is all about how awesome this is, but in reality the player has far fewer features and there is no sync capability at all (even just
 to the phone).&nbsp; And purchased but DRM'd music may no longer play if the groove app can't renew the license for some reason... and will NOT play on the Zune device anymore once the license expires.&nbsp; Also, the groove app is NOT YET AVAILABLE for windows phone,
 though it appears to be available for iOS and Android.&nbsp; That is stunning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to find a simple set of documentation including:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>feature comparison between zune software and groove software showing what we GET and what we LOSE</li><li>feature comparison between zune pass and groove pass (again, what we GET and what we LOSE)</li><li>How-to documents describing how to "sync" or whatever workaround exists for it to get music to at least my phone (preferably to my zune).&nbsp;
</li><li>How-to documents describing how to start over with groove - it has completely mangled my music library: wrong artwork, wrong details, etc. with Zune I could just delete the library file and start over... I can't FIND a library file with groove.</li><li>How-to documents relating to preventing previously downloaded and then subsequently deleted songs from being constantly re-downloaded by groove.&nbsp;
</li><li>Documents explaining how the one-drive storage "feature" works when you're not on wifi, specifically explaining how or if phones can automatically stop using data plans to stream music and instead only use locally stored music if not on wifi</li><li>Documents explaining how to use networked and/or removable drive storage with groove</li></ul>
<p>I have plenty more questions and concerns but they could all be addressed with the sharing of some actual information rather than just marketing fluff that is trying to sell us what amounts to a major downgrade from what we had.&nbsp; As a Zune user since v1.0
 of the software and hardware, I'm really disappointed in this.</p>

<h2>            Need to fix footnotes</h2>
                    I have a document with over 1000 footnotes.&nbsp; All footnotes numbers are in the doc, and all footnotes have text.&nbsp; However, the text for one got skipped, so I need to move all text down one to fix the problem.&nbsp; Is there an easy way to do that or do I have
 to move all text manually down?

<p>I am not sure what you mean by the "text for one got skipped".&nbsp; If there is an empty footnote in the footnote pane, it would suggest that there is an "unused reference in the body of the document and by deleting it, the numbering should correct itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is not the issue, on a copy of the document, using the Footnote and Endnote dialog, that can be accessed by clicking on the dialog launcher in the Footnotes section of the References tab of the ribbon, try converting the Footnotes to Endnotes and
 then back again. &nbsp;</p>

<p>All footnote numbers are in the footnote area and all of them have text in them.&nbsp; There are no empty footnotes.</p>
<p>However, several of the footnotes have text from more than one footnote in them, so I have had to manually cut and paste the footnote text to move it to the correct footnote, and if there is not an easier way, say a macro, then I will have to manually fix
 all the footnotes for a document that is almost 400 pages.</p>

            Your description suggests someone has been adding their own footnote numbering to your footnotes, plus simply typing the reference #s in the document body, instead of letting Word manage the
<span>footnote </span>numbering automatically for both. Otherwise it would be impossible to end up with "<span>several of the footnotes have text from more than one footnote in them</span>". Unscrambling this omelet with a macro would require
 access to the document so that one could analyse exactly what needs to be fixed.

<p>Hi Craig,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate your effort to reach out with Microsoft Community. We understand that you wanted to separate your Outlook email for business related matters, and use the Gmail email instead for personal matters. There are several ways to achieve such goal.
 To get you sorted, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your Gmail account added to your Outlook account?</li><li>Have you set up your Gmail account in Outlook 2016?</li><li>Did you use POP3 when you have set up your email?</li><li>Since you have mentioned that you wanted to keep Outlook for business matters, may we clarify if you are pertaining to your Outlook account or Outlook 2016?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your prompt response. </p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Gmail is totally separate from Outlook to deal with personal related emails (i started it by going thru standard Google procedure totally outside of Outlook via Chrome)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have about 300 + personal email items on Outlook i want to migrate over to Gmail without having to Forward each email one at a time. (these 300 + emails are in separate folders in Outlook and some are in the inbox)</p>
<p>
</p><p>can i export them in a couple steps in outlook (pst file?) then go to Gmail and import them in?</p>
<p>

<p>Set it on 4:3 aspect ratio and see.</p>

<p>When you take a 16:9 picture the 4:3 picture is software cropped, some is chopped off on the bottom and top,&nbsp;to make it 16:9 so the picture has fewer mp</p>

            Hi Noemi
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isnÃ¢â‚¬:tm:t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. ItÃ¢â‚¬:tm:s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you donÃ¢â‚¬:tm:t have any. If you donÃ¢â‚¬:tm:t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system wonÃ¢â‚¬:tm:t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. SlackÃ¢â‚¬:tm:s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you donÃ¢â‚¬:tm:t see any improvements after trying all the above, then itÃ¢â‚¬:tm:s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

            You're welcome and thanks for the reply. Did you send my feedback to developer team? Because I don't want to install Windows 10 on my very old computer

<h2>            Mail merge text and date format if...or...then statement</h2>
                    <p>I am working from an excel document where I placed "o" as a placeholder for an incomplete certification or a date (expired or valid) regarding the status of a certification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the letter to read:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If [Criminal History Cert Date] is before 12/10/2017: you must recertify.</p>
<p>If [Criminal History Cert Date] is past 12/10/2017: the certification is valid.</p>
<p>If [Criminal History Cert Date] reads "o": your certification is in process, no further action is needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I am working from but can't figure out how to nest the third "in process" statement:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>IF {&nbsp;</span><span>MERGEFIELD Criminal_History_3 \@ "yyyyMMdd" }&nbsp;</span><span>&gt;
 20171210 "is valid. Please note it expires on {&nbsp;</span><span>MERGEFIELD Criminal_History_3 }</span><span>." "is expired or expiring. Please
 contact your specialist to arrange a date and time to recertify."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have tried using:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>{ IF {&nbsp;</span><span>MERGEFIELD Criminal_History_3 \@ "yyyyMMdd" }&nbsp;</span><span>&gt; 20171210
 { IF { MERGEFIELD Criminal_History_3 \@ "yyyMMdd" } = "o" "is in process, no further action is needed." } "is valid. Please note it expires on {&nbsp;</span><span>MERGEFIELD Criminal_History_3
 }</span><span>." "is expired or expiring. Please contact your specialist to arrange a date and time to recertify." }</span></p>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<p>
</p><p><span>But the result is now only showing the result if the info from excel shows a "o" in the cell. Do I need to switch the order of the nesting?</span></p>

            You should create o as first condition and then others..For example the right condition would be -
<br />
<br />=IF(A2="0","your certification is in process, no further action is needed.,IF(A2&lt;=Date, "you must recertify",IF(A2&gt;Date,"the certification is valid.","")))
<br />
<br />Where A2 can be your Merge Field and Date is your date.

<p>Didn't work. Word is asking for a message to display if the first condition is not met but I want it to test 3 conditions and display a message according to what condition the information meets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I am asking an OR condition: If the cell shows an expired date, then they should recertify, OR if the cell shows a valid date, then no action is needed, OR if the cell shows the letter "o" then their paperwork is being processed.</p>

<p>So I've been working at this for a while. I noticed you are giving me codes for excel and I am not looking to do that. Instead I want the calculation done in word which I know is a hassle but for my purposes, will be much easier in the long run. I tried
 the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ IF { MERGEFIELD CH } &gt; DATE "is valid." "{ IF { MERGEFIELD CH } &lt;= DATE "is expiring." "{ IF { MERGEFIELD CH } = o "is in process" "" } " } " }</p>
<p>
</p><p>where DATE is in the format 20171210</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it is still not reading the letter o whether I include it in quotes or not. It seems to be working for the other conditions though which makes me feel very close to an answer. I am wondering if I need to reformat the entries in excel to be read as general
 text instead of dates? Or if I should replace the holder "o" as some infinite future date.</p>

            You very likely don't need all 66 addons for it.<br />
<br />
You can remove some / all of them: Office button &gt; Word Options button &gt; Add-ins option. this displays all of the addin's you have, active and inactive. At the very bottom of the dialog there is a "GO..." button. Clicking on the drop down beside it allows you
 to select the various categories of addins and manage which ones you want to enable or disable.<br />

<h3> engrattny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Report page footer will not expand&#59; contains textbox that CanGrow&#59; Auto Height&#59; Access 2010</h2>
                    I have a Report page footer that contains a text box. That text box is filled using a function call, and has 1 to several lines of text returned. I placed that textbox into the page footer of the report, set the textbox to canGrow to yes, and set the page
 Footer AutoHeight to yes. The color of the pagefooter is set, and not transparent. As expected, the textbox grows to the correct size for the returned string. However, the page footer will not expand to accommodate the textbox. Instead, the page footer retains
 its given size, and the textbox spills below the bottom edge of the page footer (i.e., below the color band) Is this a bug, or am I incorrectly using AutoHeight ?

<p>I haven't used A2010 enough to know what AutoHeight does, but a page footer can not change its Height after the details on the page have been formatted.&nbsp; If it could, the entire page may require reformatting (because there would be less room for the details),
 which could change what was in the page footer, which could change the page formatting ad infinitium.</p>
<p>I think the best you can do with a CanGrow text box in the page footer is to set the page footers height to the tallest you can tolerate.&nbsp; If the text box grows beyond that, it should fail to display the part that doesn't fit in the footer.</p>
<p>Having some part of the text box display below the bottom of the page footer section sounds like a bug to me.</p>

            I erred. Let me rephrase that question, as I notice that both the page head and page footer don't have "CanGrow", but do have the AutoHeight. How can I get the page footer to automatically adjust its size, without having to go through the torture of calculating
 the size of the largest/highest of two text boxes, and manipulating the height of the page footer section? Why doesn't the page footer have the CanGrow? Why is it that even when autoheight is set to no, the section expands when I expand a control, manually?
 I can't discern what it is that the AutoHeight does for the page footer... or any section for that matter.

<p>I was typing a reply when it just vanished??&nbsp; I'll try again.</p>
<p>As I tried to explain before, the page footer can not have its Height changed after a detail has been formatted.&nbsp; This means that the latest you can change it's Height is in a page **header** section's event procedure.&nbsp; With that background, I conclude that
 there is no way to get the effect you want with the page footer.</p>
<p>If you'll explain the goal of the report. maybe someone can come up an alternate approach.</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer...</p>
<p>This is what I am attempting: At the bottom of all reports, I expect to include two variable height text boxes.&nbsp; (In addition, I am placing, at the page bottom, the typical date/time and page#).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In theory, I could place them on all pages at the very top,
 but the page header&nbsp; can not grow, either.<br />
<br />
I can not expect the height of either text box to be fixed, as their content is user defined [with carriage returns as part of the content].&nbsp; The first box is a Name/Address box, and the second is multi line text.&nbsp;&nbsp; The name/address may or may not have all
 lines occupied.<br />
<br />
Figured it would be nice if the bottom expanded to fit the larger of the two text boxes, rather than being a fixed height.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also figured that it would be nice not to put a footer height calculation in every pageHeader event, in each of the many reports.</p>

<p>Well, it certainly would be nice if you could do that, but, unfortunately, not using a page footer.</p>
<p>That kind of height calculation is a very difficult thing to do and impossible on the page header&nbsp;if there are multiple details that can also grow.</p>
<p>Does the page have plenty of space for a big footer?&nbsp; Probably not, but what is your arrangement of details?&nbsp; Are they grouped?&nbsp; Would a group footer be close enough?&nbsp; Is this CanGrow text box go with every detail or once per group or on every page regardless
 of the number of details on the page?</p>
<p>In a situation where I absolutely had to have a&nbsp;variable amount&nbsp;of text at the bottom of the page, I made the footer/text box as large as I could afford&nbsp;and then used that very complex code to reduce the font size until it fit in the fixed size text box.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>Then... why the "AutoHeight" function exist after all !?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the AutoHeight property has a value of True the section will automatically be resized at design-time if a control's height property is changed, so that it can no longer be accommodated within the height of the section.&nbsp; If the value of the property is False
 on the other hand, a control cannot be resized to a height which cannot be accommodated within the height of the section.<br />
<br />
My understanding is that the property is intended for use when controls are resized programmatically, and does not apply to the resizing of a control by allowing it to grow on the basis of the data, i.e. it is for use in advanced report programming situations.

<h2>            The database has been placed in a state by user</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have a accdb file in shared mode without locks containing everything (tables, forms, reports and code)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I get the following error: â€œThe database has been placed in a state by user â€˜Adminâ€™ on machineâ€¦ that prevents it from being opened or lockedâ€<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Before moving from XP to Win7, I used to open the database with shift key (to prevent any code execution at startup) on one machine and leave it open. This used to be enough to avoid the problem. This not the case anymore with Win7.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Iâ€™ve red several articles and answers on forums. One of them (</span><a href="http://www.source-code.biz/snippets/vbasic/10.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.source-code.biz/snippets/vbasic/10.htm</span></a><span>) advices to open the same db a second time
 with vba. It didnâ€™t help fixing the error. </span></p>
<p><span>But most of articles advices to split the database and put a copy of the FE file on each machine. Before applying this advised solution, I would like to know what is the meaning of setting the default opening mode to â€˜Sharedâ€™. If I cannot share an
 mdb file with this stetting, whatâ€™s the purpose of putting such an option then? </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2 question:</span></p>
<p><span>Splitting a database is recommended first to â€œreduce network trafficâ€ because not all the objects are loaded. I can afford such traffic with our network of 1Gbs and I donâ€™t see how it could be faster. Response is instantly. As a second advantage: simplify
 the â€œfront-end developmentâ€. I find it much easier to update one mdb file when nobody is connected to it than go through each machine and make sure they have the latest version (but this is my point of view from my perspective).</span></p>
<p><span>My second question is: if these are the advantages of splitting a database how can this solution prevent the error of the database put in a state?<br />
<br />
I thank you in advance for your time and help.<br />
Regards</span></p>

            <p>A few questions I have are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>+&gt;Are you able to open the database with one user or does it not open at all anymore?</p>
<p>+&gt;If you can open it with one user, then does this occur when the second user opens the file?</p>
<p>+&gt;Where is the database file located?</p>
<p>+&gt;Does each user have full control over the folder the database is located in?</p>
<p>+&gt;When you open the database or Access, do you see any add-ins that are being loaded.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example an Adobe or Avery add-in?</p>

This error indicates that someone has opened some object in the database in Design mode. That would prevent others from opening it.<br />
<br />
By splitting the database, especially by using a local front end, this problem is completely eliminated. Even if a user opens their FE and opens design mode on an object, they are locking only
<br />
This option also means you do not have to wait for for no one to be using the database to do design work. Your design work is done on a development copy and moved to production when its ready. As to deploying the updated front end their are tools to make that
 easy. The most popular is AutoFE Updater but I believe Bill Mosca has a similar solution. So its not necessary to go to each machine to update them. Its done automatically.<br />

Yes I am able to open the database with one user. But the error occurs sometimes when the 2nd database get connected to main one. The connection is done as link reference in VBA (Tool menu, Reference -&gt; main db).</p>
<p>-<span> </span>
Most of the times yes, this occurs when a second user connects to the main db.</p>
<p>-<span> </span>
The database is located on Win 2008 server.</p>
<p>-<span> </span>
Yes all users have read/write permissions on the shared directory.</p>
<p>-<span> </span>
From what I can see in the database Addins options, there is only â€œAdobe PDFMaker Office COM addinâ€ that is active.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One precision though concerning the second db that is connected to the main, since it is the one generating the error. As I said, the second database references the main one as a library because I use the same procedures and donâ€™t want
 to duplicate them. Also, the second database contains linked tables on the main database that are used to inserts or update data from both main and second databases.</p>
<p>If I follow Scottgem when he says â€œThis error indicates that someone has opened some object in the database in Design modeâ€, I cannot determine where in infrastructure mentioned above is trying to open the database in design mode.</p>

<span>Scottgem</span></a>, Thank you for your message.</span></p>

<p><span>Iâ€™m not sure that splitting the database will make my development and deployment easier. Without splitting, today I have a database copy for development where I am free to change and test my code at anytime. When I
 am ready, I simply ask my (5) users to disconnect, generally during lunch time or evenings and then I replace the production by the development copy.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have already tested a spitted database. It was slower by one second from the non-spitted! And I thought
<span>&nbsp;</span>already on how to update the FE files. On the startup, it can check for local version compared to the server version. If the end user doesnâ€™t have the latest, then I run a batch file and close the database. The batchfile will download the copy
 from the server and past it on the en machine. When done open the new file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now I simply want to understand where my code is trying to open the database in desing mode as you said if this is the source of my problem</span></p>

            <p>In regards to the error message you are seeing, if you arenâ€™t using the Adobe PDFMaker Office COM add-in, then I would recommend disabling it on each machine and then seeing
 if you still have the problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>I donâ€™t know why this produces the error, but I assume it is actually related to what Scott was describing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In order for this add-in to load itself into the toolbar it almost seems like it needs exclusive access to the database in order to make this design change.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you can disable this add-in through the add-ins option on each machine, I would try that first.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If that doesnâ€™t work, I can provide you with a registry key to modify in order to ensure it is disabled.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as splitting your database goes, as Scott mentioned and as you have heard from other people, this is the recommended approach.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Another large benefit of splitting the database is it can help reduce some of the risk with database corruption, due to the decrease in network activity.<span>&nbsp;

Every developer I know (and I know a lot of them) will tell you that ANY multi-user app NEEDS to be split. I will not do it any other way. Even with only 5 users, you are interrupting their work for them to get out while you update or waiting for the opportunity
 to deploy. But, more importantly, a shared front end is an invitation to corruption.

            <p><span>All right then. Then whatâ€™s the purpose of putting the option â€œOpen in shared modeâ€? (this was my first initial question).<br />
<br />
I agree with you on the basis of client-server design. But this isnâ€™t my question. What I want to know is the source of my problem. Not the solution. So at least I understand what I type rather than simply apply the solution.
<br />
<br />
What Iâ€™m trying to figure out is what is trying to put the database in design mode, since you said that was the reason of the error.</span></p>

<div><br />
<div>- slows down the time response by&nbsp;about&nbsp;1 second</div>
<div>- 5 users have been working with this database for 10 years now, and I&nbsp;only&nbsp;got about 1 record corrupted per year.</div>

<em>live:ID</em> format). </span><span>When an account was created using an email address, its Skype Live&nbsp;ID will show as
</span><em>live:whatevercomesbefore@</em><span>. While when an account is created with a phone number, the Live ID will show as "live:" plus a combination of alphanumeric characters (</span><em>live:1a2b3cxxxxxxx</em><span>).
 These Live IDs cannot be used to sign in to Skype. Its only&nbsp;purpose is for the user to be easily searchable in the Skype directory.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the Skype ID you provided, it looks like the account you're looking for is created with a Microsoft account (email address). So, you need to sign in using the Microsoft account connected to it to access the account.</p>

<p>I'm afraid we do not have that kind of access to your account for us to check what email address is connected to that Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a suggestion, you can <a href="https://signup.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a Microsoft account</a> with your preferred name as your email address. In this way, the Skype Live ID that will be created will be the same as your preferred one.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive Business , Recycle Bin not showing todays deleted documents</h2>
                    
<p>a client was hit by the Locky virus, they shared files using both drop box and onedrive.</p>

<p>I was able to recover the files from dropbox by undeleting the files.</p>

<p>however with Onedrive for business I cannot find the files in the recycle bin, and when i look at the modified files with the virus rename and encryption it only shows it as version 1.</p>

<p>Where is my Onedrive for business version history or a record of the files being deleted.</p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>I have found that the version option of these files were not turned on in the settings, i have read that this should of been done by default on installation. I did not turn this feature off and no one else with access to this account would possibly be able
 to navigate the menus to do this on purpose or by accident.</p>
<p>Drop box has found that these files that i am looking for were deleted (may be a case that its flagged as deleted when the file was renamed). So maybe the virus didnt delete the files but only renamed it overwriting the onedrive version in the cloud.</p>
<p>Is there anyway of rolling back my onedrive account to this morning?</p>

<h2>            Emails are not coming through to my Inbox or any other folders</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Can you help me? This afternoon I noticed I wasn't getting certain emails from sellers on ebay. So I have sent 2 test emails from my gmail account to my hotmail account and they haven't come through. I also tried sending an email from my Hotmail address
 to my Hotmail address and I didn't receive that either. I have only had 1 email come through in 7 hours which is unusual. That was a notification email from ebay.&nbsp; I should have received several emails regarding purchases from other websites also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use internet explorer mainly to view my emails but also have access through Outlook 2010 and my HTC Android smartphone. They all show the same thing.</p>
<p>I haven't knowingly changed anything and I can't see a problem with any of my settings.</p>
<p>I sent an email to my gmail account and I received it ok but the reply I sent back never arrived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I am having the same issue. &nbsp;I am a member of an online discussion forum and was receiving email notifications of replies and new topics without trouble up until about a week ago, then they stopped. I've added the domain to my safe senders and set up a
 rule to move all messages from that domain to my inbox, but to no avail. &nbsp;I've tested the notifications with Gmail and they work just fine, but in Outlook.com, they do not arrive nor do they appear in Junk mail. &nbsp;They simply are not delivered.

            I woke up this morning to a flood of emails from the day before so I'm guessing there was a hold up in the servers somewhere along the line. It was hugely annoying at the time but I'm glad it's fixed itself.

<h2>            ScanPST &#34;Failed to add row to FLT, irow &#61; nnn, RowID &#61; nnnnn&#34; errors...</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just recently migrated from Windows Live Mail to Outlook. When I scan my PST files with ScanPST.exe it reports the error "<span style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)">Failed to add row to FLT, irow = nnn,
 RowID = nnnnn" in large numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)">ScanPST.exe doesn't attempt to fix this further. It is unclear
 from reports elsewhere whether I should be concerned about this error - but I don't want to trust my email storage to a potentially corrupt file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)">What should I do to get rid of this error?</span></p>
<p />

<p>First, did outlook tell you the pst was corrupt and needed to be repaired?&nbsp;You shouldn't run scanpst on it as a precaution.&nbsp; There will always be a little corruption reported by scanpst - this is normal (its a database with constant read/write) - you could
 run scanpst hourly and it will find errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to avoid corruption is by not using the pst in a folder that syncs to a cloud service or on a network drive. Keeping it reasonably small will also help (reasonably small is around 8 - 10 GB).&nbsp; You can store a backup copy in the cloud or on a
 network&nbsp; drive - the problem is with opening the pst from cloud or network drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On to the error - are you using 32- or 64-bit office? How large is the pst file? Did you export from Live mail to Outlook to create it or use a utility to convert?&nbsp; AFAIK, the error is normal. If you are worried, export the pst to a new pst and use the new
 pst.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, very many thanks for the extremely helpful response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I migrated Windows Live Mail directly to Outlook using WLM's export with Outlook installed on the same system. In other words, it was Outlook's responsibility to create and maintain the PST files, and not a third party utility.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran ScanPST as I found that Outlook wouldn't apply my current view to all other folders, and this issue was mentioned elsewhere on the web as indicating possible PST corruption. Running ScanPST successfully resolved this, and resolved several other types
 of error, but left the "Failed to add row to the FLT" error outstanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PST files are not large, being between 200 - 600 MB. They are stored locally, and most definitely not in the cloud or on a network drive. I'm using 32 bit Office 365 on 64 bit Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is slightly annoying that ScanPST reports an error, but doesn't resolve it, and doesn't give any indication about whether it is serious or not. I'll try and get rid of it as you suggest, just because I feel I should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks again for your help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Charlie</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - I very much like SlipSticks Unified Inbox View macro, so thank you for that as well!</p>

<p>Just to add a further update - I have just exported and re-imported the PST showing the "Failed to add row to the FLT" errors, and the errors are still there. They must be a consequence of the way Outlook builds the PST, so re-importing the PST won't fix
 the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still keen to resolve this if possible, so do let me know if there's anything else you can think of for me to try.</p>

    <title>Word documents getting deleted automatically. Please help. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word documents getting deleted automatically. Please help.</h2>
                    I use MS-Word 2007 on my Lenovo laptop. OS: Windows 8. For the last few weeks, when I try to type a Word document, the text starts getting deleted automatically, and when I close the window I find that that particular document - although I have saved it
 somewhere - has gone automatically to the Recycle Bin. When I go to the Recycle Bin and try to Restore that document, I am asked "Do you want to permanently delete this file?". After a lot of difficulty, I am able to restore that word document. But when I
 open that word document again to type or edit it, the deleting process starts again automatically and the document again goes to the Recycle Bin. Is this a virus? Please help. Also, when I am listening to songs on Windows Media Player on the same laptop or
 watching photos on the same laptop, I am asked "Do you want to delete this file (that particular song or photo that I have opened at that time) permanently?" Is this virus affecting everything in my laptop? Please help.

            You need antivirus help, not Word help, on this one.
