<h2>            Lenovo S10-3 screen blanks after 1 minute of no activity</h2>
                    Installed Windows 10 Technical Preview on Lenovo S10-3. &nbsp;One annoying problem is the screen blanks out if there is no activity for 1 minute or more. &nbsp;I am using the power charger and never had a similar issue with prior version of Windows. &nbsp;I reset the
 power settings and changed the screensaver to ribbons. &nbsp;So I know It's not the screensaver cutting in too early. &nbsp;I also checked the screen timeout settings and it doesn't appear to be that. &nbsp;My display resolution is 1024 x 600 which is the recommended for
 this Netbook but there is a message that my resolution is lower than 1024 x 768. &nbsp;Could this be causing the problem? &nbsp;Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this annoying issue?

                    I have a new Microsoft Lumia 640 and am not bothered about syncing video/music etc onto it, as I only want to put very specific stuff on which I can just copy and paste, right? And I can copy the photos off my phone onto my pc (don't take that many, not
 a huge problem). The only thing I need to to sync automatically is my outlook contacts and calendar. Will it do this if I am not using the Windows phone app?&nbsp;

Contacts and calendar sync 'over the air' to the Microsoft account. If everything is as expected after login from a PC to

            Older S40 phones usually had a limit on the size of java apps that could be installed, often 128Kb or 140Kb, so this could well be the cause with your 6020.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there is no way around this if it is the case. More recent S40 phones (those on the 3rd or 5th edition platform) can often take apps up to 1Mb, but 2nd edition phones were often much more restricted.

<h2>            Interfacing Visual Studio with Excel or getting access to all of visual Studios&#39; toolbox controls in VBA for applications within Excel</h2>
                    Hey Guys,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Basically what I am attempting to do is pull data from an excel spread sheet instead of a text file. I want to use an excel file for convenience purposes with coding.(Using excel's built in functions and other things). I have had success using the developers
 tab inside excel, but the controls listed in the toolbox are very limited and are only allowing me to make a very basic graphical user interface compared to what I can create inside of visual studio. Using VBA for application also makes the program I intend
 to make dependent upon excel being available and open which is another thing I do not want or need for all of my programs functions. I have been successful at creating commands to open excel with visual studio, but I can't find a way to pull information from
 ranges within it. &nbsp;I've tried importing the Excel namespace, but it is not listed under Microsoft(see image below). I am using the shell command to start Excel which works fine. Telling excel to open a workbook has been completely unsuccessful and I can't
 find any suggestions on the web that seem to work. If anyone has successfully integrated Visual Studio with excel I would appreciate the help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            <p>It would help to know what you want to do with the data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To clear up a misconception, while using VBA would require Excel to be available on the machine (so does using Shell for that matter), it does NOT require it to be open, or even make the user aware that it is being accessed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have many applications that access data in Excel workbooks, all using Late Binding so that the code is independent of the version of Excel that is installed.</p>

            Hey Doug,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply. In regards to your question, it's still a work in progress and I still haven't decided about everything I want to do with the data. In a basic sense, the program I am writing is acting as a GUI for a database where most of the information
 that is being consolidated has been placed into excel workbooks. The GUI is being designed for searching across multiple excel workbooks or it may be designed to pull data from multiple excel workbooks and save it to one file. I could go either way. The data
 ranges from numbers to strings. It parses information and categorizes it. &nbsp;The user will be able to create search filters and the appropriate information will then be displayed. Also I am relatively new to programming so I've never really been exposed to using
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<h2>            Office Linkedin Connector still gone</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Linkedin removed support for outlook a while ago, back in 2015. Then Microsoft bought linkedin.</p>
<p>Almost 2 years later, is there any hope of ever seeing the linkedin connector re-appear in some form?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in consulting and having the ability to tie contacts into Linkedin lookup gave a good perspective</p>
<p>on a client before I met them.&nbsp; Kind of the same fashion of their Office Contact Manager, but all the work was</p>
<p>done by the clients themselves, it just looked up the email and pulled the data including picture profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering how they are trying to turn LinkedIn into a Sales/Business platform like Salesforce, and salesforce</p>
<p>has an Outlook connector, you would think they would re-introduce it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone from Microsoft in the Office team have any ideas on this?&nbsp; There have been regular enhancements to Office 365 delivered with new niche features, this could be one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I did post about this a few months ago, and got a response about a forum:
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273494-outlook-and-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273494-outlook-and-calendar</a>.&nbsp; but it is a closed forum and I do not have access
 to provide feedback there. Since there was no activity on that thread, I started a new one.</span></p>

            <p>That is an interesting observation. Are you asking a question?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have Microsoft Office installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your templates, like your keys, are where you put them. In recent versions of Word, the default storage location for newly created templates is Custom Office Templates in your Documents folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is much more about where templates can be stored and where they should be stored here:

            Not really - I was reporting a bug: MS provides a tool for setting custom templates for all Office apps at the same time. But it can't find Office. Which makes it a not very useful tool.<br />

            Hi Letino,
<br />
<br />If you are a military employee, you may be eligible for the Home Use Program. Here is the FAQ page for the Home Usage Program (HUP).
<br /><a href="https://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/faq.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/faq.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />If a military employee, see: <a href="https://enterprise.microsoft.com/en-us/articles/industries/government/federal/military-discount-through-the-home-use-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enterprise.microsoft.com/en-us/articles...</a>
<br />
<br />============================================
<br />Moving to a different computer
<br />============================================
<br />You should get the email that has the product key and download link from your original email after you bought the HUP version.
<br />
<br />Use those on the new computer.
<br />
<br />Note that the HUP license is limited to use on one computer at a time and limited to the time you are employed with the HUP sponsor.
<br />
<br />Here is a chat site you can use if you have trouble with that.

            Turn off glance and don't use automatic brightens for the screen. That works for me, but I don't want to stop using this features only to fix this tedious problem. Hope Microsoft release a firmware to fix it.

            <p>Hi .. this is actually an update bug, i believe. because my phone too have the same issue. It takes a while to open the display. Not an issue with Hello or Glance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also i found another issue after anniversary update. The display dims when it is close to time out, and if you touch the screen during this time it still continues as display dim. Do you have this issue too?</p>

 to try adjusting the notesSz cx or cy values, but I'm at a loss.&nbsp; this is what a notes page looks like:</p>

<p>Wow, you have a seriously impressive array of articles out there! I was able to fix it after looking through several of your steps. Here's what I did:</p>
<p>1. saved the pptx as .xml</p>
<p>2. Opened in Notepad</p>
<p>3. Found this: notesSz&nbsp; (mentioned here: http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00811_Notes_pages_are_odd-sized.htm)</p>
<p>4. And changed values to cx="6858000" cy="9144000" as above link</p>
<p>5. Opened the .xml version from PowerPoint.</p>
<p>6. Bingo, but...</p>
<p>7. Had to format the Notes Master (drag the slide to right spot, resize the text box to fit below, found the Page Number way down below and brought up to slide)</p>
<p>8. and had to format each slide too (drag the slide to fit, sometimes adjust font color and size)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for offering to help. Much appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi Mari,</p>

 the code back to us, then we know that you’re really you, and we can get you back in to your Microsoft account. For complete troubleshooting when PIN prompts, click

    <title>If Statement to Check if the Format of Existing TextBox Value is of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craig davidson&#39;s ms excel support account  say:</h3>
<h2>            If Statement to Check if the Format of Existing TextBox Value is of Format &#91;H&#58;mm&#93;</h2>
                    <p>I have a user form that has a few frames, with a number of textboxes within each frame.&nbsp; I&nbsp;ensure the textboxes force a certain data entry format by using the 'Application.Text' function in my VBA&nbsp;coding, as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Private Sub TextBox11_Exit(ByVal Cancel As MSForms.ReturnBoolean)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IsNumeric(TextBox11.Value) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TextBox11.Text = Application.Text(TextBox11 / 24, "[h]:mm")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNumeric(TextBox11.Value) And TextBox11.Value &lt;&gt; vbNullString Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Sorry, only numbers allowed."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TextBox11.Value = vbNullString<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>That coding&nbsp;allows the user to simply enter a numeric value for time&nbsp;(such as 7.25)&nbsp;and have it automatically convert to 24 hour format (07:15), without needing to type the colon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I am having is in trying to enforce that same data entry format if the user exits the textbox by using the mouse to activate another textbox in another frame.&nbsp; Doing so triggers the&nbsp; Private Sub Frame1_Exit(ByVal Cancel As MSForms.ReturnBoolean)&nbsp;
 event, and skips executing the&nbsp; Private Sub TextBox11_Exit(ByVal Cancel As MSForms.ReturnBoolean)&nbsp; event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have placed the same&nbsp;VBA coding in the Private Sub Frame1_Exit event, which&nbsp;works fine if populating TextBox11 for the first time,&nbsp;but if TextBox11 already contains a value, and the user exits to another frame, the coding see the [H:mm] value in the cell
 is not being&nbsp;'Numeric', and thus executes the TextBox11.Value = vbNullString code to blank the cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...&nbsp; when a user uses&nbsp;the mouse to activate another textbox in another frame, I need to have the Private Sub Frame1_Exit event&nbsp;coding look at what's in&nbsp;TextBox11.&nbsp; If what's there happens to be in the correct&nbsp;"[h]:mm" format, then I don't have a problem,
 but if it's not in that format, I have to continue executing more code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I believe I need is a VBA IF statement&nbsp;that&nbsp;checks if what's in a textbox&nbsp;is in the format of "[h]:mm".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your time and effort to assists is appreciated,</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Craig</p>

            <p>Yes! I must have had a mind blank there somewhere. Change to the following because the test for greater than 24 is already done when&nbsp;entered as&nbsp;a number so just test like the following. Basically looking to see if it looks like a time with 2 numeric values
 separated by a colon.</p>
<p>

            do you check for any updates ? see weather latest updates are installed and also do reboot your system ,,clear your browser cookies cache and revert back settings to default mode 
<br />
<br />please follow below steps
<br />-&gt;win+i (for settings) -&gt;apps and features -&gt;search for edge -&gt;advanced settings 
<br />
<br />under that you will find repair as well as reset option perform both 
<br />
<br />and do check weather sites are blocked on internet explorer and does other family safety features are working or not ,,and if issue still persists 
<br />
<br />remove your child's device and re-add it

            please follow below steps 
<br />
<br />-&gt;With the latest update of Windows, you're able to set up one schedule that'll apply across all of your child's devices. This means if you give them five hours in a day, they'll have five hours between their Xbox One and Windows 10 devices. Otherwise, time gets tracked separately, so 1 hour of screen time means 1 hour per device.
<br />
<br />-&gt;Check to make sure your family’s devices have the latest Windows updates by selecting the Start button, then selecting Settings  &gt; Update &amp; Security  &gt; Windows Update  &gt; Check for updates and installing any available updates. If you're on your child's device now, check if it needs an update.
<br />Try rebooting your family’s devices. Select the Start  button, then select Power  &gt; Restart.
<br />
<br />note-&gt; there might be sync issue so please have a look at below link 
<br />-&gt;Make sure your child is signed in with their Microsoft account on their device. If they are, you can check to make sure their account is syncing up right. Select the Start  button, then select Settings ﻿ &gt; Accounts and follow the prompts to verify their account.

    <title>Outlook double spacing on replies - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terra99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook double spacing on replies</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook has started to dbl. space incoming replies.</p>
<p>I send out an email, when the recipient replies, all my original written text is dbl. spaced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New incoming messages are fine, but when I reply, and then the recipient replies back,&nbsp;this time all the written text is dbl spaced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've modified the the template(normal.dotm), to reflect the proper spacing, made changes to style/paragraphs/line spacing.</p>
<p>No signatures are being used, or created, and/or stationary.</p>
<p>I've also compared Outlook and Word settings, from&nbsp;a pc with an almost identical setup. The parameters were the same, and no issues with the other pc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I can't find on the problematic PC, is a normailemail.dotm file, where the other PC's with outlook installed have that file.</p>
<p>Tried repairing, completely uninstalling reinstalling still no email template file being created.</p>
<p>Also copied the normalemail.dotm file from another PC, and tried it that way still no resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>outlook will function correctly without that file, but I can't set a default template.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have tried many of the suggestions online....stumped</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>the email template should be at C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates - if you don't see it, is show hidden files and folders enabled?
</p>
<p>Is all mail double spaced or just some, from specific senders? double spacing is a problem with web-based mail clients, like gmail and when using the web interface for most ISP accounts.

            hidden files and folders are disabled...i can see all the files.<br />
<br />
I'm aware that web&nbsp; based clients can cause this issue.<br />
<br />
I tested with 3 web based clients(Gmail/Aim/OWA)...only gmail is causing the issue.<br />
<br />
It also happens intermittently with outlook to outlook clients. no specific sender.<br />
<br />
The outlook clients are only sending the emails between the same organization, no web based recipients, nor is it attributed to a specific sender.<br />

<p>I found a solution. I uncheck the options "Use Office 2016 to sync Office files that I open" from [Onedrive Settings] -&gt; [Office] and everything works perfectly. I think this option has bugs!</p>

<h2>            Setting Password for Content Advisor</h2>
                    I am trying to set a password in content advisor for internet explorer 11 on windows 7 computer.&nbsp; Every time I get to the tab to set the password on content advisor, it tells me to enter the new password and confirm the password (none has previously been
 set-I've already checked all the ways to erase a set password, but there is none.&nbsp; This is the first time I have set one).&nbsp; Once I enter the password, it tells me the password is incorrect, but I know I am typing the same thing both times.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            I am sorry, but this does not help. I have repeatedly followed all the steps to enable content advisor. Even though no password has ever been set, it will not allow me to create one. &nbsp;I can access the tab to create a password, but it just tells me the
 new password is incorrect. I know for a fact that there is no previous password set on the account because I have no trouble surfing the web. I am never asked for the content advisor password while surfing the web.&nbsp;

            I created a new user account and even made it an Administrator so there would be no hindrances in setting the password, but got the same response from Content Advisor that the password was incorrect.&nbsp; I am completely at a loss to know what the issue could

<p>
</p><p>In outlook.com, we can create some aliases and while sending an email from aliases, same sender name and same signatures goes to a recipient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to customize separate sender name and separate signature for all aliases?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, please let me know, how to do this?</p>

<p>Hi GNJha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using an alias will give you an additional email address that&nbsp;uses the same inbox, contact list, and account settings as your primary email address. You can choose which email address to send mail from, and you can sign in to your Outlook.com account with
 any of your aliases. However, as of now it's only possible to use the same sender name and signatures of the primary alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have questions.</p>

    <title>Office 365 Powerpoint Slideshow border issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heidi boutwell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Powerpoint Slideshow border issue</h2>
                    <p>I've looked through all the posts and found a partial solution but not a full solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the issue. I run slideshows in Powerpoint Office 365. &nbsp;When I go to record them and actually run the slide show I get a border on the left and right. &nbsp;Now I found this is due to the CRT monitor change of going from 4:3 to 16:9 monitors some time back
 and found that if I go to Design&gt;Slide Size I can change my slides to Widescreen or 16:9 or 16:10 or custom. &nbsp;So I've tried all the settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what happens. The Widescreen, 16:9 and 16:10 Onscreen settings do remove the border on the left and right. But now I have a border top and bottom of the slide. &nbsp;how do I get rid of that? &nbsp;I do NOT want any black borders around any portion of the slideshow
 when recording at a resolution of 1280x864 or 1280x916 or something close to that. &nbsp;I need those borders gone. &nbsp;This is my company's required recording settings. So when I record there should be NO black border. &nbsp;Once those left and right borders go away,
 how do I make the top and bottom one goes away?</p>
<p>

            <p>You'll get borders at sides or top/bottom whenever the aspect ratio of your slides doesn't match the aspect ratio of the screen you're displaying your presentations on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aspect ratio is geekspeek for "Width divided by Height". &nbsp;</p>
<p>So for example a 4:3 slide's aspect ratio is 4/3 or 1.333333</p>
<p>
</p><p>1280 / 960 also = 1.33333 so if you can choose a slightly different resolution as your final target, use 1280 x 960 and start with a 4:3 ratio presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're completely locked into the other resolutions you mention, there may be other ways of making the video match up, but we'd need to know exactly how you're recording the video. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if you're using a tool that lets you choose the area or the window to record, that might help.</p>

<h2>            graphics and text on same page - can&#39;t copy all and paste</h2>
                    <p>I do alot of flyers for our local volunteer organizations.&nbsp; Using word 2003, I could group all the text boxes together, then select all and then copy and paste to my email server.&nbsp; Now using word 2007 I can't "select all" to copy so now the graphics are
 not pasting into my email.&nbsp; I do not want to do an attachment, since most of those I email prefer the flyer in the actual email.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried using the graphics as is or inside a text box. Same with the text, inside a text or outside. I have to use the graphics
 since many are the logos or letterhead of the group</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So question is how can I get the complete flyer with graphics and text as a whole document to be pasted into an email.</p>

            <p>Yes and no</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a flyer that has graphics that I have overlaid with text boxes filled with words.&nbsp; Both are in their own text boxes and I "order" them front and back...&nbsp; I then shift key and click on each text box to group together.&nbsp; After I do this, I used to be
 able to copy and paste right into AOL, which I would then send to a yahoo account and forward onward to the parents and such.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AOl is my personal account and the yahoo is one of the volunteer parent organizations I do this for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I can't - doesn't even show up on the write mail window on AOL.&nbsp; Yahoo doesn't work at all- never did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried your suggestion - and it worked somewhat in Outlook 2007, but when sending it to a yahoo, aol or earthlink account, it came over as an attached image and only the two graphics showed and they were split up!&nbsp; When sending back to an outlook user,
 the flyer was cut in some places, but that could be just margin issues, which I can check on my own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use both Outlook 2007 for a yahoo account&nbsp;and my personal AOL.&nbsp; So I need to get my flyer sent to many different servers as is and not as an attachment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HELP!!</p>

<p>No it doesn't work, I tried.&nbsp; It seems that the issue is using a Microsoft product in a non MS product.&nbsp; Unfortunately I can't determine or dictate who uses Outlook.&nbsp; :((</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway suggestions to make them compatible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also - do you know of any classes that are for Word 2007 users, intermediate level?&nbsp; I think I could use them!</p>

            Did you download (or get on a CD or DVD) and install a special version of Solver?&nbsp; It looks like Excel is trying to use this particular add-in and it cannot find it.
