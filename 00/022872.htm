<h2>            Yammer upgrade process - impact to users</h2>
                    
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Scenario</span></b></p>
<p>Our Client is upgrading to Yammer Enterprise</p>
<p><b>About the client and AD accounts</b></p>
<p>Our client used to have a primary email address policy of lastname_Initial (e.g. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)&nbsp; however a few years ago (well before Office 365 project started) they changed it to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such everyone actually have both
 as a proxy address.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally the majority of people have *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as their primary email address, and subsequently their UPNs and Office 365 logins are that as well. However out of habit, some still use *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (even though itâ€™s
 not their actual primary email address).</p>
<p>Therefore what you will see is that some users signed into Yammer using lastname_initial and some with first.last.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some users, lastname_initial *may* match their primary email address (as they got exceptions to the new email address policy) but more often than not â€“ they will not match.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For users signed into Yammer with first.last â€“ this will likely match to
 their Office 365 account.</p>
<p>They already have @clientname.com.au registered as verified domain in their Office 365 tenancy</p>
<p>It is understood that the Client will only have a single Yammer network, using the @ clientname.com.au namespace, which indicates that a network merge activity will not be required</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Questions</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Will Yammer will match to both their primary email address OR their proxy email address then we will be fine, because then we definitely we get a match.
</li><li>Do we need to export data - assuming no </li><li>Do we need to provide a user mapping input file </li><li>How long will this take </li><li>What are the implications of not performing a user content match<br />
<br />
WILL This cause the user content to not map to their Office 365 identity.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Does Microsoft have a backend support process that allows mapping of user content when there is an identity mismatch
</li></ul>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">YOUR ANSWER and <strong>my answers in bold</strong></span>&nbsp;and questions in additional post<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Hello Simon,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting! Please find the answers below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will Yammer will match to both their primary email address OR their proxy email address then we will be fine, because then we definitely we get a match.
<ul>
<li>When you activate Yammer Enterprise in the Office 365 tenant, by design users should login to Yammer using their Office 365 credentials. If they can access their Yammer account using their primary SMTP in Office 365, they can do this as well using their
 email alias. The complication of this is that users can login to the clientname.com.au network as well as on clientname.com.au.
</li><li>To have a good mapping in Yammer and Office 365, make sure that usersâ€™ primary SMTP is the same as their Yammer account. If ever you will assign an alias to the user, that email alias should not have a Yammer account<br />
<br />
</li></ul>
</li><li>What are the implications of not performing a user content match
<ul>
<li>There will have two Yammer networks. First is clientname.com.au and clientname.com.au. Users can both login to the clientname.com.au network using two email addresses using user@ clientname.com.au and clientname.com.au.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Will this cause the user content to not map to their Office 365 identity. &nbsp;
<ul>
<li>This will cause the users to map their Yammer identity in the wrong credential.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h2>            Excel Editing From Both Mobile and Desktop</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue with a workbook I have uploaded to Excel.&nbsp; I saved it as an "Excel Workbook".&nbsp; I then uploaded it to my onedrive, and attempted to edit it from my iPhone&nbsp;6 Plus.&nbsp; It worked just fine, but when I went to double check it on the desk top
 I received the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Unfortunately, the workbook needs to be closed or checked in before you can edit it. If everyone uses Excel Online, you can work on it at the same time."</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I am the only one with access to the file, and I have closed it down on my phone; even went as far at to turn my phone off completely, but still got the same message.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to change the format I am saving it as, or what do I need to change?&nbsp; Eventually I would like for multiple people to be able to work in this at the same time in Excel online, but I can't open it up in Excel online myself before I have even shared
 with others.&nbsp; </p>

</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could be specific to that Excel Workbook which you are trying to open on the Excel desktop version. To verify this let us check the issue on a test Excel Workbook. Let us follow these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Create a test Excel file on iPhone and upload it to your OneDrive account.
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Close the Excel app. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open the test workbook on the iPhone from OneDrive and make some changes. Save the changes.
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Close OneDrive drive and Excel apps. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Try opening the test Excel file from OneDrive on the desktop computer and check if you get same error again.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Check the above and let us know the result. </span></p>

            <p>I have just experienced the same problem when trying to share an excel file with 15 other "On Line Excel" users. The files could be viewed but not edited using the online Excel</p>
<p>
</p><p>We resolved after realising that the originator had the file open in a desktop version of Excel. When this was closed the file could be edited on line. We tested this by reopening the file on a Desktop version and tried editing again with the online version
 and the message reappeared. I did not run through all scenarios such as what happens if the online version is being edited and the Desktop version is opened. I am sure this will create more fun in the future. I am guessing a similar conflict will occur.</p>

<h2>            Outlook password works on Laptop but not iPhone.</h2>
                    <p>Iâ€™m helping my mom with an issue she is having with her outlook account. Recently, she got a message on her iphone to reset her outlook password, which she did on the laptop but when she went to enter it on the iphone it didnâ€™t accpet the new password, so
 she reset it on her iphone and then the computer woundâ€™t accept it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know why this might be? Thanks. Also, I donâ€™t think she is using two factor verification.&nbsp;</p>

            Dear Garrett90,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />This sometimes happens with the mobile application. In order to resolve this please try to do the following:
<br />1. Check for System updates for your phone
<br />2. Remove the account from Outlook app
<br />3. Delete Outlook app
<br />4. Go to store and check for updates
<br />5. Download and install Outlook app and set up your Mom's account using this support article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-email-in-outlook-for-ios-mobile-app-b2de2161-cc1d-49ef-9ef9-81acd1c8e234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up...</a>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - send receive group is empty</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have 2 Office 2010 home&amp;business licenses. One works fine. The other (on a Dell notebook) will not send or receive mails. The ususal intelligent MS error message tells the whole story - it's just that I am not qulified to make sense of it :-)</p>
<p>The message is in German, the translation reads: "the attempted action could not be executed. One object could not be found"
</p>
<p>And: if I go to send/receive, send-receive-groups: the drop down list is empty.</p>
<p>Does anyone have an idea ... what "the missing object" might be?</p>

    <title>How can I &#34;share&#34; from Outlook by default rather than Mac Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaelc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I &#34;share&#34; from Outlook by default rather than Mac Mail by default&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had to switch to a completely new computer yesterday at work. Now, after having run the latest install, (I'm running OS X el Capitan 10.11.6) I can't figure out how to get my computer settings back to the way I liked them. In particular, I can't share
 from Outlook anymore when I want to email a word document to one of my colleagues. I used to be able to click "Share&gt;Email document" and a new message window containing my document would pop up, using Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I've reset up my computer, my computer is trying to send emails from my Exchange set up on the Mac Mail interface. Of course I know that its sending the emails from my work address, I just can't switch to working with Mac Mail after having used
 Outlook for so long. It is not happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things that I have tried that would seem logical that for some reason haven't worked are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) &nbsp; Setting the default in Mac Mail (Ran mail application&gt;Mail Menu&gt;Preferences&gt;Default Email Reader&gt; Choosing Outlook&gt;Close</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-There is no "save" or "apply" button at the bottom of this window. So maybe this is one of those Mac things where it's just too hard &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to tell that it does in fact save. Nope, it doesn't save. When I open the Mail application up again, the
 default is back to being set as Mac Mail. ****?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) &nbsp; &nbsp; Setting the default in Microsoft Word. (Run Word application&gt;Preferences&gt; There doesn't seem to be an category addressing this here)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Doesn't look like there is any option in Word on where you want to share the document "from"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Setting Outlook the default in Microsoft Outlook (Run Outlook&gt;Preferences&gt;Accounts)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-It just shows that I want to send things from my work (exchange) account. But it doesn't give me a choice of what application I want to send my Exchange account with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing that's really pissing me off, is that I know that this setting exists. I know that because I have been working this way for 6 months. And if I had not had to switch computers because of a crash, I would never have had to address this. What gives?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I send mail from Outlook exclusively? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't tell me some solution that I just said didn't work, it's why I listed them; while painstakingly describing every single step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>I think that I did get it fixed, finally. &nbsp;I did two things, actually, but I think it was the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you, I had changed the preferences in Mail. &nbsp;I did this by selecting Outlook from the drop down menu&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Mail Menu&gt;Preferences&gt;Default Email Reader. &nbsp;Closing out of Mail, and then opening it again, and
 then checking the same&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Mail Menu&gt;Preferences&gt;Default Email Reader, the Outlook was not selected. &nbsp;It's like the preference was ignored (like you say, there's no apply or save, but we have SDD drives).
 &nbsp;So, I'm guessing the ongoing feud between Gates and Jobs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">However, on a whim, I tried something else. &nbsp;Rather than selecting Microsoft Outlook from the drop down menu, instead, I chose Select... and then navigated to my Applications and manually chose Microsoft
 Outlook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This time, quitting out of Mail, and then reopening and going back to preferences, Microsoft Outlook was there. &nbsp;Yeah! &nbsp;I even tried "Sharing" a document from within Word, and yeah! &nbsp;it opened Outlook
 mail with the document as an enclosure.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this helps.</span></p>

    <title>How to Enable Bluetooth A2DP in N73&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> falam_ii  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Enable Bluetooth A2DP in N73&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I just upgraded my phone to firmware version 4.0726.0.1 (26-06-2007) and I was wondering how do you enable A2DP via bluetooth headphone?<br />
<br />
Just to state my current situation, I have a Sony DR-BT10CX (yes it does support A2DP) bluetooth stereo headset. The headset can pair with the phone with no problem, I can make and answer phone calls, I can also get stereo sound when using the MSI Blueplayer
 (for the first 30 secs anyway before they tell me the player is only compatible with a MSI bluetooth device), so it's not a hardware issue. However when I go into my music player and select a song, I get nothing from my stereo headset, I can, however, hear
 the headset sort of "turned on" and I can hear the "hollow static-ish" sound in the back.<br />
<br />
Before I upgraded the software I can get audio when I open the music player, but it's played through HSF thus the sound quality is horrible.<br />
<br />
Your help is much appreciate it.

            The new firmware since 4.0723.2.0.1 does support A2DP.<br />
<br />
Version 4.0723.2.0.1<br />

New problems / regressions<br />
The focus sound (when the viewfinder becomes green) is early by a second, also the camera sound is earlier than the flash<br />
There is a cursor blinking in the pop-up baloon when getting\dialing a call<br />
Camera viewfinder in primary and secondary quality is worse, a bit snowy<br />
<br />
Changes<br />
You can now exit the Music Player, as on the N95<br />
FOTA (firmware over the air) support added<br />
=*-*-&gt; A2DP (stereo bluetooth) support added -*-*=<br />
All editions now feature the music player from the Music Edition handset<br />
Snakes has been removed from the firmware (available to download from <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4323689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

When you want the messages to be on the MiniSD instead of the phone or vice-verca, the phone now asks "everytime" if you want move them, unlike before when there was no confirmation<br />
Updated version of Real Player<br />
QuickOffice updated to version 3.8<br />
<br />
And many sources have confirmed that firmware version 4.0726.0.1 (26-06-2007) A2DP works fine. Seems like this is a compatibility problem with Sony bluetooth headset and N73. Before I updated my firmware (when N73 did not support A2DP), when I open the music
 player the music would play but in mono, so via the HSF profile. But after I updated the software music player have no sound but I can hear the ring tones and the keypads. I figured maybe it is because the voice calls, ring tones, and keypad sounds are broadcasted
 via HSF profile, and it is the A2DP profile having trouble broadcasting. I have found at least one person having the same problem as I am, and he/she is also using a Sony headset. I will take this headset back to where I bought it and try another headset to
 confirm if I have right, in the mean while, anybody else experiencing similar issue with other Sony bluetooth headsets?

<h2>            Changing Calendar item crashes Outlook</h2>
                    Outlook 2007 SP2 on Windows XP SP3.<br />
When changing a repeating meeting where I am not the organizer, I get the message that I am doing so, and then Outlook crashes.&nbsp; This started when I upgraded from Outlook 2003, but only happened every 2 or 3 times I made a change.&nbsp; Recently, it has started
 happening every time.<br />
I have a long repeating meeting (we've been meeting for over 4 years), and I occasionally change either the starting time or ending time to reflect the actual time.&nbsp; I do this by manipulating the graphic on my calendar, usually on past entries.&nbsp; Also recently,
 the notifications have started saying the the event happened some large number of days ago (well over 100 days, but less than a year IIRC).<br />
<br />
Is there a fix for this?

<p>Tried to repair Office, the behavior did not change.</p>
<p>When saving as, Word tells he's tring to connect to... a local drive directory and waits a long time before eventually saving to it.</p>

    <title>Why is Band showing calories burned when I haven&#39;t worn it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikez_522  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Band showing calories burned when I haven&#39;t worn it&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a method to reset the counters to 0? I've requested this through feedback but wasn't sure if we just had to be patient for an update. I had phone motion detection on the older app, and the updated app doesn't have that option anymore so I think
 it's stuck since my calorie counter keeps going up in the 1000s from doing nothing and not wearing the band.

</p><p>Thanks for sharing and for posting your feedback on the <a href="http://microsofthealth.uservoice.com/forums/283636-microsoft-health-and-microsoft-band" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
User Voice site.</a>&nbsp; As you mentioned, there is no method for users to remove the recorded calorie counts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us/support/health-and-exercise/calories-burned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Track your calories burned page</a> states, calorie counting is an estimate that occurs even when not wearing your Band.&nbsp; So I can see a little higher than expected calorie burn may be reported, but thousands over an expected amount seems off, or like you mentioned,
 stuck.&nbsp; Unless the level of activity used when calorie burn is estimated is very high.&nbsp; If this is the case, wearing your Band more will help these estimates become more realistic.<br />
</p>
<p>You may consider trying to reset your Band in conjunction with removal&gt;reinstall of the Health app.&nbsp; As always, be sure that your
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us/support/install-update/update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
firmware and software are up to date.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this seems more of a data issue than a firmware/software issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep posting here and in the user voice pages with your feedback.&nbsp; I already passed this on to raise the visibility of this concern but cannot speculate on how/if/when your feedback will result in changes to the app or dashboard.</p>

<p>I re-did my subscription for office 365 on August 11th or so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They could not get it working on my computer because of some kind of licensing problem. &nbsp;After some time, they were able to get most of the apps on the computer. &nbsp;I thought all was well, and realized that the outlook was not working. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to office 365 support again, and was assigned to a person in China, i think, to solve this problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have 2 case numbers:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1394882298 and 1395114480. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a terrible time understanding what the lady was talking about, she took over my computer for over 3 hours, and phoned me back and said the outlook was now working. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>She did not tell me that my documents and pictures were gone.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>She did not tell me that my office programs - Peachtree Sage and ACT! would not come up. &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>I run a business out of this computer, and I need my programs.</p>
<p>Can microsoft help? &nbsp;I do not want to speak with an Asian person because I cannot understand them at all. &nbsp;I am sorry about that!</p>

<p>Dear Support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hotmail inaccurately sent some incoming emails from Carousell.com to my Spam folder. I did not move these important emails from my Spam folder into my Inbox because I assumed they would be there permanently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while, these "mistaken junk mails" were deleted by Hotmail system automatically and I lost all these important emails due to Hotmail's stupid system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you retrieve all these important "mistaken junk mails" back for me?</p>

<p>I have an issue with Office 365.</p>
<p>2 months ago, I successfully purchased the Office 365 package for 1 year. However, it is now requiring me to activate the product because it is unlicensed. I have tried my best to contact Microsoft but failed.</p>
<p>Then, I downloaded the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365, but there is another problem. The app continuously asks for my password although I have entered it over 10 times already (I am sure that the password is correct since I have
 already checked it on the web).</p>
<p>Problems with Office will tremendously affect my work since I depend on Word too much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that someone can help me</p>

    <title>Printing a form in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sobiz network  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing a form in Word</h2>
                    <p>I have created a form using Developer that makes it fillable to users on their own computers (our clients). I would like to print out this same form to have a hard copy incase a computer is not available.
</p>
<p>I have tried to print out the form, and the form prints with the "click here to enter ____" still on the page. Is there any way to have this print with a blank space in there instead so it can be filled out manually and without me having to create a whole
 new document?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials Error Code&#58; 0x80248014</h2>
                    <p>I reinstalled windows VISTA on my computer and when I try to reinstall MSE I get error code: 0x80248014 error description: security essentials couldn't install the definitions update.&nbsp; Yes I did uninstall the only antivirus windows auto put on (norton).&nbsp;
 I have tried all of the following and all have FAILED: uninstalling/reinstalling, resetting the internet explorer settings, set IE as the default browser, ensured date/time is correct, renamed the software distribution folder (3 different ways), deleted the
 software distribution folder, reset the microsoft antivirus update engine, and manually installed the updates.&nbsp; I have looked through the forums and no one seems to have such a deep rooted problem as me.&nbsp; Yes I did try just about everysuggestion everyone had.&nbsp;
 Yes I did email microsoft but they want me to pay a ton of money to have them "possibly" see what the issue is and "possibly" fix it.&nbsp; Also, I reinstalled windows VISTA twice thinking it did something wrong during installation the 1st time with no luck.&nbsp; PLEASE
 HELP!!&nbsp; Thank you. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; I figured it out....... Windows just had the updates selected for windows updates all I had to do was select get Windows and other products from Microsoft updates.&nbsp; Which is kinda odd because I had it&nbsp;checkmarked&nbsp;but I had to click a link to activate
 them in which there was the definitions updates in them for MSE.... ah well... all is good now.</p>

<p><span>Hi Orinmor,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am glad to help you here, if you want to filter junk emails by setting the levels, Iâ€™d like to share something with you. At the moment, the feature of setting junk email filter levels is not available for outlook 2016
 for mac, for your reference: <a href="https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.technet.microsoft.com%2Foffice_for_mac_support_team_blog%2F2015%2F06%2F19%2Fjunk-mail-in-outlook-for-mac-for-office-365%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C205ef6ab7106414beec108d60d76eb7c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636711201728419885&amp;sdata=yAJW3nhpgptChzZF46Kn4MXiwVV%2FOXs1v8fD6W3eviM%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not want to receive the junk emails you mentioned above, I recommend you can add the junk email address ( domains) to the block sender list, you can click Outlook menu &gt; Preference &gt; Junk&nbsp; and add the email address
 ( domain) to it. On the other hand, if you are an office 365 user and you can not add the email addresses to the block list in outlook 2016 for mac, I recommend you can sign your account to
<a href="https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Foutlook.office365.com%2Fowa%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C205ef6ab7106414beec108d60d76eb7c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636711201728429894&amp;sdata=b1wc1KXtgNlhnl%2FFj%2FIszOnGP4%2BV2Qq3AUSsVxMOv50%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Formula Showing the Last Value in a Column of text in a Separate Cell</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for a formula to show the last text in a column in a separate cell. I understand I could just reference the last cell with an = sign, however multiple people edit the sheet multiple times a day and I just want to see the last date entered, as
 I wish to reference that to another sheet. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Comparing to other solutions presented, this solution is little complicated but I am sure there is a philosophy behind it. Could you please explain how this solution finds the last value?</p>

            <p>Hi Rasoul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amit solution is definitively the best (short + very efficient) in this case - I wonder why I didn't think about it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I find the last value?</p>
<p>The question was: ...I just want to see the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
last date entered.</span> As you know Dates are Numbers in Excel.</p>
<p>MAX(ISNUMBER($B$2:$B$5001)*ROW($B$2:$B$5001)) is an array calc. that checks if each value in B2:B5001 is a number. This generates an array of i.e.&nbsp;{TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,...,TRUE,...,FALSE}, multiplied by another array&nbsp;(the row numbers) that in this case is {2,3,4,5...,5001}.</p>
<p>TRUE*2=2, FALSE*3=0, FALSE*4=0...,TRUE*18=18, ...FALSE*5001=0. In&nbsp;the end&nbsp;we get an array like {2,0,0,...,10,...18,...,0}. MAX of this array returns 18 (last row where a number was found).</p>

<p>In other words. by combination of ISNUMBER and ROW functions, you create an array, where the last entry is the maximum one.</p>
<p>If we want to find the last entry in a one row entry, it will be enough to change the ROW to COLUMN in your formula.</p>
<p>One more question, Is it possible to conclude from this method that following formula will give the first entry in a one column array? I suppose all entries are numbers and there is no empty cell in between.</p>

<p>Values in A2:A11. Column C simulates the array generated by&nbsp;ISNUMBER(A2:A11). Column D simulates the array generated by ROW(A2:A11). Column F simulates the result of ISNUMBER(A2:A11)<strong>*</strong>ROW(A2:A11).</p>

            <p>I tried the Troubleshooting approach twice - all it tells me is that I need to restart the tablet, which I did, but with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manager there are two drivers available for the imaging device on the tablet:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Intel(R) Imaging Signal Processor 2400 dated 18/07/2014 version 17.18.42.692, not digitally signed</p>
<p>If I delete all the Imaging device drivers, this is the driver that is loaded by the system.</p>
<p>With this driver, the camera app just displays a black window, and Skype just has a rotating circle where the picture should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Intel(R) AVStream Camera dated 21/07/2015 version 20.10154.5744.721, signed by MS Windows HW Compatibilty Publisher.</p>
<p>This is the driver that is installed when I update driver automatically from the internet.</p>
<p>With this driver, the camera app has the following error message: "Something went wrong. Make sure your camera is connected and not being used by another app,"</p>
<p>Skype cannot find a camera at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NB both drivers report that they are working properly in Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this issue so that I can Skype my son on my tablet in Windows 10.</p>

            <p>I can pretty much confirm all of the above as what I am experiencing. I've found that if you use one of the&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Intel(R) Imaging Signal Processor 2400 drivers, the camera will&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;work.
 In most cases though, you will be left with the black screen in Windows Camera, and the spinning circle in Skype you describe. With the Avstream driver (which Windows 10 seems to think is the appropriate driver), I haven't been able to get any image at all
 as it can't seem to detect the camera.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>What I have noticed is that the camera often starts working after the tablet has been in sleep mode. It seems like 8 times out of 10 this works. Can anyone else confirm this?</span></span></span></p>

            This happens if we have more then one capture device. I noticed this with nvida shadow play and my AV usb capture device. Or the drivers, or the device has a issue. Check the properties of intel driver to see if they have an inbuilt capture enabled

            Hi I had the same trouble with the Linx 7 tablet. Tried numerous ways of trying to cure it. Eventually went to the LinxTablet.co.uk site, registered, and checked out their drivers sections which comes from the Windows 10 section at the top of the screen.
 Downloaded the camera drivers, opened the camera in device manager, opened the driver section and then updated to the folder I had put those drivers I had found in. It worked! Camera seems to be working perfectly again. I then created a restore point with
 Control Panel - in case the drivers for some reason disappear again. The problem had come when I upgraded (?) to Windows 10 or possibly one of the ensuing updates. I hope this helps if you haven't found any other method

<h2>            Table of Contents doesn&#39;t pick up appendix headings created with Heading 6 built-in style</h2>
                    
<p>I've created appendix headings according to Shauna Kelly's instructions in <a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/NumberingAppendixes.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to number headings and figures in Appendixes in Microsoft Word</a>. The headings work great, and I've figured out how to get figure captions numbered correctly inside the appendixes. (Thanks, Shauna!!!)</p>
<p>But the TOC field isn't picking up the Heading 6 paragraphs, even though it shows up correctly in the TOC dialog box, and the field code {TOC \o "1-3" \h \z \u \t "Heading 6,1"} looks like it ought to be working right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've updated the field multiple times, always checking "Update entire table"; I've even deleted the TOC field and recreated it.&nbsp;But I can't get those appendix headings to show up.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t set up user in Office 365  Outlook 2016.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a user I'm trying to set up on Outlook 365 (2016 client) &nbsp;on a user's new PC that is running Windows 10. &nbsp;When setting up the account entering User name, Email address, password, the Add Account dialog box indicates that it establishes network connection,
 but seems to hang on the step "Seaching for &lt;User's email address&gt; settings". &nbsp;It never gets to Logging on to mail server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>deleting and then recreating the user profile&nbsp; </li><li>turning off BitDefender Endpoint Security&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>and it still doesn't get past the the Searching for settings line. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the Outlook Connectivity Test and that was successful, &nbsp;I've also had the user log into the Outlook Web client and that seems to work fine, so I'm assuming it's not a password issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did find out that the user's old PC which uses Outlook 2010 doesn't seem to successfully connect either -- it displays "trying to connect" on the status bar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know what could cause these symptoms and how I can get the user successfully setup?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

            Data Sense is network-carrier dependent, so as of now, only a handful of operators in USA have this feature running, with more expected across the world this year. Find My Phone is applicable to every Windows Phone 8 device.

                    I can sign in but then it won't open the edition.&nbsp; There has to be something in the internet options preferences that is not set right.

            Just in case anyone else has this problem I have the answer.&nbsp; Go into internet options, security, custom level, miscellaneous - then under 'display mixed contents' change from prompt to ENABLE.&nbsp;&nbsp; Haven't had a problem since.

    <title>E-51 Snooze Options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonbak  say:</h3>
<h2>            E-51 Snooze Options</h2>
                    Have found that unlike some earlier models, the E-51 only allows for a 5 minute snooze which is a little frustrating. Any likely solutions to extend to say, 10 minutes?

            it is **bleep** you can't change it. It will autosnooze I noticed as well. If you let the alarm go off for a couple of minutes it just snoozes itself then goes off again in 5 minutes.
