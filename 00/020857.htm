            Hi, 
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures below: 
<br />
<br />You must run the following commands in CMD to disable previous versions of Office installed on your computer: 
<br />
<br />Run the following commands, look for the System Symbols program (Command Prompt) and right click and open as Administrator. 
<br />
<br />Search the full path to find out which folder Office is installed on. 
<br />CD .. Until you get to directory C: 
<br />
<br />cd "C: \ Program Files (x86) \ Microsoft Office \ Office16" or cd "C: \ Program Files \ Microsoft Office \ Office16" 
<br />
<br />Then, execute the following commands 
<br />cscript ospp.vbs / dstatus 
<br />script ospp.vbs / rearm 
<br />
<br />Observe the result and copy the KEY which is 5 digits and paste them in the next command. 
<br />
<br />cscript ospp.vbs / unpkey: GVGXT 
<br />
<br />After removing all the keys, run the following command for activation. 
<br />cscript ospp.vbs / act 
<br />
<br />4. Remove all Microsoft Office16 / 15 credentials in Control Panel &gt;&gt; Credentials Manager &gt;&gt; Windows Credentials &gt;&gt; then remove all the Microsoft Office credential. 
<br />
<br />5. Restart the computer, and then log in to the Office 365 apps. 
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works. 
<br />
<br />Best Regards, 
<br />
<br />Diego R.

<h2>            Resizing the Start Menu</h2>
                    You can drag the Start Menu bigger if the Taskbar is docked ti the bottom of the screen but not the sides or top. I'd like to see the functionality to resize be independent of where the bar is docked

            <p>It would also make sense to allow for resizing width wise separate from height and manually adjustable regardless of the number and size of pinned apps.&nbsp; It would allow for more flexibility, comparable to the WP8.1 platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, App Folders on the start menu would be excellent and allow for expanding groups of apps, such as Office, without having to drill into the less functional All Applications menu and having to scroll until you find it.<br />

            Hello Heschel<br />I'm a fellow Community member here to help. I'm sorry to hear that you're having difficulty with this. I know it can be very frustrating.<br /><br />In order to utilize screen sharing in Skype I would recommend to see the following guide by Microsoft<br /><br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10022/how-do-i-share-my-screen-in-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10022/how-do...</a><br /><br />Up to 25 people can join a Skype group at one time.<br /><br />please note, that the new version of Skype is still under development and is lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype. While there is not yet Neta, it is expected in the near future that Microsoft will begin releasing updates rather rapidly to bring features and functions back into the new Skype.<br /><br />In the meantime, for users who wish to continue using classic Skype it is still available here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.sky

    <title>Nokia E90&#58; memory full, can&#39;t send messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ihearte90  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia E90&#58; memory full, can&#39;t send messages</h2>
                    Recently I started experiencing an error when I try to send messages. The error is:<br />
<br />
"General: Memory full. Close some applications and try again."<br />
<br />
The first thing I checked was to make sure all of my applications were closed. Even after a fresh reboot, I get the same error.<br />
<br />
I also made sure to delete all sent messages, all reports, all drafts, and almost all of my inbox (all but 7 messages) to eliminate the possibility that my phone had too many messages stored.<br />
<br />
There aren't any weird background applications running that I know of (double checked with Handy Taskman). Both my memory card and phone memory have plenty of free space. Here are my memory details:<br />
<br />
1091 MB Memory in use<br />
6692 MB Free memory<br />
0 B Calendar<br />
0 B Contacts<br />
1109 kB Messages<br />
64 MB Images<br />
1581 kB Sound files<br />
297 Video clips<br />
13 kB Documents<br />
330 kB MIDP apps<br />
<br />
I've scoured Google and found several other people with similar issues, including a few on this forum, but with no solution.<br />
<br />
Firmware version:<br />
210.34.75<br />
12-04-2008<br />
RA-6<br />
Nokia E90 (01)<br />
<br />
Please help me and the many others who are having this problem. I even did a software reset via: *#7780# to no avail. Help! Thanks.

            Here's an update to the problem:<br />
<br />
I was able to track down the problem to the settings by backing up the entire phone, doing a factory reset (*#7370# with lock code 12345), then reloading the sections one at a time to see which one screwed it up. Whenever I loaded settings, the problem seemed
 to return.<br />
<br />
So there you have it... make a backup and reload everything except settings if you want this problem to go away. Or write angry letters to Nokia to get them to put out higher quality software for an $800-$1000 SMART PHONE. This is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
This is by far the most frustrating problem I've had with a cell phone, and there's no reason a stupid bug like this should exist on so many handsets (not just E90, it seems to be a problem on the E71 and several other phones) for so long.<br />
<br />
C'mon Nokia!<br />

    <title>Microsoft Office 2016 Pro Table Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> briansymonsrxtx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office 2016 Pro Table Problem</h2>
                    <p>This is an example of a table that I am having problems with some tables in Word 2016 Pro Plus.</p>
<p><span>Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016&nbsp; Version 1104&nbsp; Build 11601.20230&nbsp; Windows 10</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cd5ec72c-6f1c-4434-aaaa-bd47248d002d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cd5ec72c-6f1c-4434-aaaa-bd47248d002d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Sometimes I can not get the correct symbol with an arrow each side that is needed to move the column if I wish to use the mouse to change column width.</p>
<p>Instead I get the symbol with arrows on both sides as well as up &amp; down that you will get every time if you try to adjust the very central column that is a dual line.&nbsp; This sometimes happens with other borders.</p>
<p>As well as not allowing the mouse to change widths,&nbsp; often it will not allow the table to be adjusted by adjusting the numeric&nbsp; widths of the various sub columns in the table properties below the wide title
 column &amp; it also will not allow the wide title column to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Adding extra columns &amp; merging or deleting will not work either.</p>
<p>An example of what I was trying to do was add two extra columns into the right hand side of the table with to get column widths 1.2cm, 1.2cm, 1.6cm, 1.2cm, 1.2cm.</p>
<p>Is there any way to attach a demo document to show the problem instead of just a pic?</p>

<p>Judging by the column of ¬∂ down the right hand side of the table, it would appear that it is set to have the text wrap around it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put the selection in that table and then go to the Table Tools&gt;Layout tab of the ribbon and click on Properties in the Table section of the ribbon and on the Table tab of the Table Properties dialog, change the Text wrapping to None and see if that overcomes
 the issue.</p>

</p><p>So yes, an example file would help.There are so many ways to things in Word, so please describe in detail everything you do to create this problem&nbsp; Describe how you create the table. Describe the steps you take to insert the rows.

<p>
</p><p>You can't simply "attach" a file (nor simply past an image ...). Apparently that is too complex for the forum programmers ... &lt;yes, that his snarky&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead what you have to do is upload the file to OneDrive (or other online storage) and give us a Share /Edit link to it.

            Which version of OS X are you running &amp; what is the version of Apple Mail?<br />
<br />
I'm continuing to run Office 2011 14.2.4 here on OS X 10.6.8 using Mail 4.6 with no problem whatsoever. The ability of the Office apps to provide that service is dependent on the external software. Basically, Word, Excel, &amp; PPT just provide a 'button' to contact
 Mail &amp; the file to be attached, so if the message is being generated I'm betting that something about Mail is failing to create the attachment.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Confirm that OS X &amp; Mail are fully updated,</li><li>repair disk permissions &amp;</li><li>restart your Mac.</li></ul>

    <title>Where is the print preview button in Office 2011&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blake b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is the print preview button in Office 2011&#63;</h2>
                    I have looked at Office 2011 help online and they say that there is a Preview button on the Print dialog box where you can see a print preview but, I do not see it. I have looked in PowerPoint, Word, and Excel. Is there a setting that I have messed up?
 Is there a problem with my Preview Apple App? Do you have any suggestions as to where the mysterious button went to? Also, is there anyway to put the button on the quick access bar on top by the "new, open, save, print" buttons? I did that on the PC version
 and I loved it.&nbsp;
<div>I just found how I can "Open a PDF in Preview" to look at the page but it seems a bit less convenient than Print Preview so please let me know if there are other options.</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            Ah - Lion. That's right; there's no Print Preview button.
<div><br />
<div>Click the PDF button and choose Open PDF in Preview (which is essentially what the Print Preview button did anyway).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Use Help &gt; Send Feedback to Microsoft to let the Mac folks there know you want the Print Preview button restored.</div>

<h2>            cannot get Excel to display dates in a uniform manner</h2>
                    I have made up a worksheet that has as it's first column a series of dates that represent the date and event occurred. &nbsp;I am entering the info in one way(Numeric: 1/15/2013). Most of the time, the date is presented in the same format as it was entered,
 but once in a while it is displayed Alfa-numerically, &nbsp; &nbsp; (1-Jan-2013). &nbsp;While the date is correct, it is not displayed in a uniform manner in the date column. &nbsp;Please tell me the date display can be locked so each row of information has a unified date that
 looks the same as all the other dates in that column

<h2>            Runtime Error on 365 Portal</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the afternoon of the 24th I was unable to access the Office365 Portal through Google Chrome, receiving a Runtime Error on the website however as I was able to use it through Incognito mode I ignored it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday everything worked fine, however, Today I am unable to access the portal again unless I use Incognito mode receiving the same Runtime Error as previous. This is quite frustrating as I a lot of my daily work revolves around Office365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noted in this thread there was an issue on the 24th that was resolved that afternoon, however, I am still having troubles two days later and cannot see anything in the Message Centre regarding it being an issue again.</p>

<h2>            Cannot Find MSASCui.exe</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been having a problem with Windows Defender lately and I have been looking all over a solution, but to my luck, I have not spotted anyone else that is experiencing my problem. So, Action Center has been telling me that I need to turn on Windows
 Defender, But everytime that I try to turn it on through Action Center, I get an error message that says "<strong>Action Center can't turn on Windows Defender. Please try again later.</strong>" Then, I took matters into my own hands and tried to open up the
 application, but when I looked it up, It never showed. Afterwards,&nbsp;I tried to open it up from the program file that it is in, but unfortunately, I was greeted with another error message, stating, "<strong>Windows cannot find "C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MSASCui.exe.&nbsp;Make
 sure&nbsp;that the name is typed correctly, and then&nbsp;try again</strong>". Does anyone have any kind of solution? Please Help!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; P.S. I do no know if this question goes into this topic.</p>

<p>To fix it, run scans with these scanners:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HitmanPro</a> </li><li><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Malwarebytes(Free)</a></li></ol>
<p>Scans should remove the infections and the conflicting registry key and Windows Defender should work afterwards.</p>

                    <p>Email addresses are being modified either by Outlook 2010 or by my Samsung Galaxy S5 (Android 5.0). This problem happens on my old PC (Windows 7) and my new PC (Windows 10), both running Outlook 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Email as entered in Contact Card is:</p>
<p>E-mail‚Ä¶&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Display as:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob Smith&nbsp; (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This email address works just fine. Until‚Ä¶</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the contact information is somehow changed to the following.</p>
<p>E-mail‚Ä¶&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bob Smith" &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</p>
<p>Display as:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob Smith&nbsp; ("Bob Smith" &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;)</p>
<p>Once this change occurs, the email address is no longer valid and I receive the error message below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1989a32-28e9-45f6-86f2-d7ff2056d817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1989a32-28e9-45f6-86f2-d7ff2056d817" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This modified email format does not show up in my Android contacts and I can successfully send emails from my Android phone after the change occurs in the Outlook contact (i.e. change is not affecting Android contacts, only Outlook).</p>
<p>

            <p>I recently purchased a new computer which required I create a new profile to set up Outlook when I installed the software. This did not resolve the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, there are threads on this forum from as far back as 2011 that indicate this is an ongoing problem for many Outlook users. See below:</p>

<p>You really can't do this with Access. If a user can open the Access file, then they could potentially have access to your tables. You can deploy a compiled file (.accde, or .mde), and that would stop them from modifying forms, reports, and modules, but not
 tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can takes steps to reduce the chance of this happening, like hiding the navigation pane. However, if someone links to your database tables, they could easily modify data in those linked tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the only way to stop this is to move your data to a more secure platform, like SQL Server, and implement security on that platform. You could certainly stop anonymous access to a SQL Server, unlike Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as a Submit button, that would depend on how your data is structured. If you Forms with Subforms, this can be tough to do, since Access will save your Main Form data when you move into the subform, and the only way to remove that Mainform data would
 be to delete it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several approaches you use to do this. One of the more common is to use temporary tables to hold the data your user is working with (and the form is bound to), and then write that data back to the live tables when the user clicks the Submit button.

            Hi K1n, I'm an independent advisor and can help,
<br />
<br />There is really no way to lock a table as you describe. But what you can do is inhibit the user from gaining access to the tables directly. You can hide the Navigation Pane, Hide the ribbon, force the user to only work through forms you create and compile the file (as accde) to prevent the user from getting into design mode,
<br />
<br />This will, effectively lock down the app to all but really knowledgeable users.
<br />
<br />If you need help in doing this fee free to ask for instructions.

<h3> lfj25  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to format cells for XY coordinates</h2>
                    Whenever I enter XY coordinates into excel they change to either 123,456,789,101 with the 1,000 separators or just 123456789101. XY coordinates need to have a comma in the middle for them to be recognized 123456,789101. Is there anyway to inset the comma
 in the middle of the set of numbers? Thank you for your help.

<p>Prefix the value with an apostrophe '. This will force Excel to treat the value as text. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'123456,789101</p>
<p>
</p><p>The apostrophe will be displayed in the formula bar but not in the cell itself.</p>

 paper on my laptop, latest version of Word 2016 personal and saved it to my OneDrive. About 3 hours later I returned to it on another computer, using Word online. I wrote and wrote and the whole time it said it was saving. When I had finished, just to make
 sure I had everything formatted correctly, I downloaded a copy of it. Only what I had written on my laptop showed up in the downloaded Word doc. As I had left the tab open, I when back and tried a PDF. Same thing. I tried saving a copy to Onedrive, and it
 closed the tab so I couldn't even copy the text. Now I have two half-written assignments that are due. I don't know what the heck I'm going to do. I am not asking for my words back. I know that's imposible. But this has happended b

<p>You can't access the phone details unless the phon is unlocked when you attach it to USB. Then again contacts are not available through USB either.. If you did not sync contacts to skydrive at
<a href="http://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://people.live.com</a> or did not use one of the many backup tools/apps available you will not have access until your screen is replaced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When sending the phone off for repair make sure there is a clear instruction with the phone not to reset or update it.</p>

<h2>            Jumping to end of animation instead of advancing slide</h2>
                    <p>I'm preparing a presentation in which photos slowly pan as I speak. (Think the 'Ken Burns' effect.) The duration of the animation is set to longer than I'll need, because I don't want the effect to end before I'm ready for the next slide. The problem is,
 when I press the advance button, rather than going to the next slide, the animation jumps to its end state. Then I have to press the button again to advance the slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to prevent the animation from jumping, before I move on to the next slide?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using:</p>
<p>PowerPoint for Mac 2011</p>
<p>V. 14.5.8 (1551023)</p>
<p>Latest installed update: 14.5.8</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help</p>

<p>Hi Virfranz.&nbsp; Thanks for the reply on the 'delay send'.&nbsp; I hope it comes back soon!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the signature, there is definitely a bug here.&nbsp; The signature gets added when composing a new email, or forwarding an email, but NOT for a reply email.&nbsp; My signature is just plain text, but I removed it anyway and added it back.&nbsp; Also tried disabling
 the automatic signature and re-enabling it, but same problem as I describe in prior sentence.&nbsp; Who should I report the bug to?&nbsp; My browser is Chrome&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(117, 117, 117, 1)">Version 65.0.3325.181.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi It-crowd,</p>
<p>No, it‚Äôs not feasible to copy and paste clipboard elements from one computer to the computer I am connecting via shared desktop directly.</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can copy and paste the clipboard elements from your computer to the computer you are connecting via shared desktop by sending an IM which includes the elements of the clipboard to the computer. Generally, when presenting the desktop,
 we can also send an IM to the computer we are connecting via shared desktop.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>hi it-crowd,</p>
<p>to avoid misunderstanding the issue, if it‚Äôs possible, could you please make a video to describe the situation and upload it to a workspace? to protect your privacy, i have sent the workspace information to you by the private message. please click this link
 to access the message:&nbsp;https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations</p>
<p>based on your description, do you mean that you want to send the text to another computer when presenting the desktop?</p>
<p>if yes, when presenting the desktop, you can copy and paste it to the dialogue window and send it via skype for business as the following pictures show.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 950</h2>
                    <p>How do I keep my Lumia 950 turned off/closed while I load a new battery for 15 hours? the phone starts up the minute I put the charger in, an starts up again if I turn it off. IS it ok to have it open while loading (closed screen, of curse) but not use it,
 just leave it alone? Because the battery that¬¥s in now is also new but overheat all the time, and it loaded in 15 hours with a phone that was on. Don¬¥t now if that¬¥s why it overheats, but I hope not to do the same mistake again. Please help me!!! (sorry for
 my engligsh, I am from denmark)</p>

            If you mean how do I turn my phone off when recharging you can't as soon as you attache a USB cable onto your phone to charge it will turn on and stay on also if you leave your phone charging for 15 hours you should not it should only take about 3 hours
 to recharge if it's taking much more than that something is wrong with the phone it's a good idea to leave your phone on flight mode during charging try the above method and see if it makes a difference

            Hi!<br />
<br />
this worked: <b>"Add the email address to your Safe senders list"<br />
</b><br />
But what is the reason that this adress was blocked???<br />
<b><br />
</b>I'm waiting for some mails of which I do not know the adress, so I cannot put them on the safe senders list. So I don't know that someone will have sent me some mail, and this person will think that his mail has been sent.<br />
<br />
If I would know why my no-log.org adress never arrived in my mail box, then I could search for a solution.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi matej980,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that the emails were received in your Junk folder instead of the inbox. Have you checked this before? It could also be the settings in your account. You can check this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/hotmail/emails-missing-from-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> on what you can check which could have caused this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you have more questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Johan</p>

            Hi,<br />
I appreciate your help!<br />
<br />
It is not working, this is exactly what I'm doing:<br />
<br />
I sent an e-mail from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to:<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
In my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account, it is noted as sent to both adresses.<br />
<br />
the mail is always arriving in *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
the mail only arrives in *** Email address is removed for privacy *** when it is in the safe senders list. When it is not in the safe senders list, it doesn't arrive at all, not even in the junk mail. It is not in the blocked senders list.<br />
<br />
I want to solve this problem since I'm expecting important mail in *** Email address is removed for privacy *** from people of who I do not have the mail adress. The problem is that maybe someone sent an e-mail, on his account logs it will be indicated that the mail has been sent but on
 my account the mail will never arrive.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi matej980,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for providing the affected email account in the Private Message tab. I have checked it and determined that it is working fine on our end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have sent a test email from our test account and did not receive any bounce message. Kindly check if you have received it and notify us if it didn't reach your Inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please check the article provided by my colleague, Johan_d., specifically the link that states, "Where's my email?", to check if Conversational threading is causing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are other possible reasons why you are unable to receive important emails:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>1. Junk Mail filters</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Kindly check if this is not set to <strong>
Exclusive</strong> which sends all mails from non-contacts to junk. This is to ensure that the setting is not contributing to your issue. Here are the steps:</font></span></p>

<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Tick <strong>Options</strong>, then select
<strong>More mail settings</strong></span></font></p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Under <strong>Preventing junk email</strong>, click

<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">4. Under <strong>Choose a junk e-mail filter</strong>, tick on
<strong>Standard - Most junk email is sent to the junk email folder</strong>.</span></font></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>5. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><font>2. </font>Custom Filters</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Custom filters could be filtering messages to some folder or deleting them. Kindly check your folders and Deleted folder to make sure that your mails are not being sent there.</font></span></p>

<p>I cannot even find it.</p>

<p>I'm trying some more test mails from ***no-log.org and there are not coming in. They only come in when I put this adress in the safe senders list.</p>

<p>I appreciate your help, but I think we have had it. We 've made a gmail account and we will try the make the best of it. Why did you change hotmail to outlook??? It was working fine for us.<br />

<h2>            Latest Skype Update for Mac doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    Why does it appear that I am not logged on to Skype, even though it launches and says I am connected. I cannot change my status from offline and cannot see any online friends.

            It appears that deleting the old version and doing a clean install has resolved the issue. Since I see several of my contacts do not appear to be online, I suspect this is a universal issue; that is, you must do a clean install vise an update.
