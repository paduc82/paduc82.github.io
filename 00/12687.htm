<h2>            How do i reactivate a hotmail account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently closed down my hotmail account as I was having problems with getting hacked and I had other addresses. My problem now is that I opened my facebook account with hotmail and after some issues with my phone, I need to login again to facebook. I can't
 remember my password however.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>My security options apparently are to resend passwords to my hotmail account (which I can no longer access). Is there any way it is still active?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h3> kimstewartca  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merged Accounts - Skype Account Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I merged my Microsoft Account "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" to my Skype account "skypeusername", and I can sign into both accounts using the same password.&nbsp;BUT now when people try to search for me by my Skype account username "skypeusername", they can find me
 online but when they try to add me I don't get the request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to my Skype profile it says "skypeusername" as the username which is also a bit troublesome.&nbsp; I cannot change this in my profile. They can only find me by my Microsoft account "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", so now I have 2 usernames on Skype, but only
 one of which is working for adding me.<br />
</p>
<p>Any ideas how to fix this?<br />

<p>
</p><p>A possible reason for this was you're auto log in to your Microsoft account (use email address to sign -in) instead of your Skype account.<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10858/what-s-my-skype-name?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Click here

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For security purposes, you'll need to have access to your password in order for you to delete the section. Do you still remember your password? If you forget your password, no one has the ability to unlock your notes for you. Even Microsoft Technical Support
 has no access to this. </p>

<p>What phone do you have?&nbsp; These accesspoints are defined to make connections. Open them to see their settings. The name is not important. I assume that&nbsp; e.g. MMS is set to send and receive MMS messages and need settings given by your SP. In the options you
 can set the data bearer to either packet data or WLAN. From there on you can adjust the settings as needed.</p>

<p>ok. let's say that i'm on a network named 'SP'</p>
<p>i have checked the settings and i see that the names are not important. they all have packet data as the data bearer. what differs is the access point name. i have 3 access points used: SPwap,</p>
<p>SPinternet and SPmms.</p>
<p>common sense tells me that when i want to surf the web i have to use the SPinternet access point. but i was wondering what will be happening if i will use SPwap instead or even SPmms?</p>

            All the three you mentioned above requires internet connection Let me start with the first access point, you are absolutely correct with that if you want to browse any www site you have to use SPinteret this is because they wont block any sites via their
 proxy servers and your connection is direct to the interet. SPwap access point is only to access your service provider's wap portal which may incur some charges when downloading from their portal website using this access point you may or maynot access internet
 it depends upon the provider mostly this access point wont work with www sites and connecting via this access point for internet ends up in 'no web gateway' reply if you go into the settings of this access point you can find the host address and gateway. Last
 one is the MMS which is obviously for sending and receiving MMS if someone sends you an mms and if you are retrieving it the mms dowmloads via this access point the same happens when you send a mms.

<p>The big diffference is the data bearer. Packet-data is gprs or 3g. WLAN is used e.g. in a home wireless network. Wap is an internet protocol used by older devices that don't support html. MMS is a&nbsp; message protocol like SMS whitch has support for images
 and audio.</p>

            Hi Sanjeev5798,<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions!<br />
<br />
Can we have the exact error message that you are getting? Is the phone brand new or bought 2nd hand? If you are referring to Nokia Music Unlimited, did you use your Nokia account to activate your previous Nokia phones? We'll wait for this information.

<h2>            Outlook for Android - Filter problem</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Outlook on my Android phone for a while, to manage a number of email accounts "outlook.com", "gmail" and another IMAP account. Mostly works well, but often once I read an email, it disappears from my inbox, so I can't find it again. The
 "Filters" are set to "All Messages". And if I tap on the "All Messages" filter again, they reappear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has to be a bug, in my opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version is 2.2.114(250) mainlineProd</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions please?</p>

<p>Dear Virfranz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am pretty sure I pointed out in my post, that the filter was set to "All Messages".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is irritating that the symptom is not consistent. Sometimes it works fine. Sometimes the emails just disappear.</p>

            <p>Try installing Windows 10 using the .ISO file instead:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to remember:</strong></p>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your&nbsp;commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The benefits of testing Windows 10 on a physical&nbsp;partition&nbsp;or hard disk&nbsp;versus a Virtual Machine include full access to the hardware, which includes memory, graphics and input/output performance of the local disk in addition to the ability to fully experience
 all features of the operating system that are not accessible in a virtual environment. The biggest benefit is, you don't lose your production installation of Windows and you can reboot into it at anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to consider before:</strong></p>
<p>Backup your current installation of Windows. Because you will be making signifcant changes to your computer, you should always backup before doing so. It is
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">strongly</span></strong> recommended! See links to resources about backing up by clicking the link for the respective version of Windows you are running:

    <title>Merged documents disappear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r bancroft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merged documents disappear</h2>
                    <p>I worked all day yesterday creating and modifying a document that was created by merging several other documents. I opened the first document, inserted a page break, then used the "insert, object, text from file" option to add the text from another document
 and so on. When I went to save the document at the end of the day, the box that asks whether you want to save or not kept popping up after I clicked on "save." I was concerned about losing my work, so I saved the document under another name. That name showed
 up in the list of files in that folder. Later on, I did the same thing, naming the document by a third name. I should have noticed that I was not in the newly named document after I saved as. At the end of the day, I tried to close the document with the same
 result - the save or not save box kept popping up. I tried repeatedly with the same result. I finally clicked on don't save, thinking that I had saved multiple copies to fall back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning when I opened the merged document, it was only the original document with none of the documents that I had added and none of my work from yesterday. I tried looking in the "unsaved files" but no files appeared as unsaved. An hourglass was visible
 when I put the cursor on my original document. I left it that way for more than an hour, hoping that it was just taking time to recover the unsaved file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have apparently lost all my work from yesterday. I will not use the "insert text from file" option again, but I would like to know if there is any way to recover the document that I was working on yesterday. I had the document open for at least ten hours.
 It now appears that the document was a phantom and left no trace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be extremely grateful if anyone could help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Word Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you better, we need few details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did you try to open the other two copies of documents which was made after the modification of the file?</p>
<p>2. Provide the exact message of the pop-up you receive when editing/modifying the document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search for the two copies of documents you made on the computer and check if youâ€™re able to recover the documents.</p>

            <p>Hi Nayana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not try to open the other two copies of documents that I thought I had saved until the next day, when I found that they had disappeared - They did not show up in my list of files. I found one, named "Final%20Report%20Merged((Unsaved-30416735020605144000.asd"
 in C:Users/Dick/Recent/ during my search for unsaved documents. When I try to open it using MSOffice, I get a message that says "Other files exist The selected locations do not contain pictures to preview, but other files exist. To view these files, on the
 View menu click Show pictures Only."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do that, a Microsoft picture icon appears in the upper left corner of the screen, under the Microsoft Office 2010 toolbar, with the file name under the icon.&nbsp;When I double click on that icon, it moves to the center of the screen and the file name
 disappears. If I double click on the icon again, I get a "Properties" box on the right side of the screen that has a section for picture properties and a section for camera properties. There are no indications of any text being in the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The day before the files disappeared, I had worked all day&nbsp;merging documents and cutting and pasting the resulting long document (about 90 pages as I&nbsp;recall). I clicked on the save icon a few times during the day, when I left my desk for lunch, etc. Nothing
 seemed out of the ordinary until I tried to&nbsp;close the document.&nbsp;The usual box popped up that asks if you want to save, don't save, or cancel. I clicked on save. The box disappeared and immediately popped up again. I tried clicking on save quite a few times,
 with the same result. I finally tried "save as" and gave the document a new name, "Final Report merged Copy 2". That seemed to save okay and I could see that file listed in the list of files in the folder. At the time, it did not sink in to my mind that I
 was still in the document titled "Final Report Merged" rather than in Final Report merged Copy 2, as would normally be the case if I saved a document that I was working on with a new name.&nbsp; I left the document open and worked on it more before trying to close
 it again. As before, the normal box came up and asked if I wanted to save, don't save, or cancel. I clicked on save. The box disappeared and then immediately reappeared. I tried a few times with the same result. I tried "save as" and gave the document the
 name Final Report merged Copy 3. Again, I didn't think about the fact that I was still in the original document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried closing the document on which I had been working all day again and clicked on "save" when the usual box asked me if I wanted to save, don't save, or cancel. The box disappeared and then reappeared. I must have clicked on save 10-15 times, and each
 time the box would disappear momentarily and then reappear. I could see the filenames for Final Report merged copy 2 and Final Report merged copy 3 in the list of files that popped up when I tried to close the document. I finally clicked on "don't save," thinking
 that I had the two other copies of my document to fall back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shut my computer off until the next day. When I looked for my "Final Report merged," it was the original short document that I had started working with the previous morning, with none of the documents added to it that I had added and none of the changes
 that I had made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The filenames C:\...\Final Report Merged copy 2 and Final Report Merged Copy 3.docx show up in my "Recent" file list, but when I try to open them I get a message that says: "This file could not be found. (C:\...\Final Report Merged copy 3.docx)" The box
 has "OK" or "Help." The "Help" is no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I explained, I spent an entire day editing a document that I had created by adding next page section breaks and using "Insert," "Object," "Text from File." I see now that there is something about the text being added to a newly created text box, which
 is not what I wanted, but I don't see why that would have made the document unsavable. It is as if none of the documents that I worked on that day ever existed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this additional information helps you to understand what happened. Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>

            <p>I received an email asking me to follow-up on my question. I did not receive an answer that helped with my problem, but I consider it closed. It appears to me that the "insert text from file" procedure does not merge the documents as I thought it did. I
 still don't understand how I could have worked on a document all day and then not be able to save or recover it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote a book back around 2000 and used some feature of MSWord that allowed me to merge the chapters of the book into one document. I can't find any Word 2010 help on doing the same thing. That's why I tried the insert text from file. Big mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since copied and pasted the text from the chapter files into one long document and re-done the work that I did on the lost file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my experience is unusual because I can usually find lots of answers to my MS Office questions. None on this one.</p>

            Hi Marianna,
<br />
<br />These shortcuts are inherited from Windows. The problem may be related to language/region/and keyboard settings.
<br />
<br />Is this a problem only with Word?
<br />How about Notepad?
<br />Excel?
<br />Powerpoint?
<br />
<br />If it is a problem in all of those, what is the primary language in Windows? Which keyboard is set up in Windows (this is a language/region setting).
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards

            What happens when you are using the ENG US keyboard?
<br />
<br />Same problem? Try opening Word in safe mode. 
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-O...</a>
<br />
<br />Safe mode is not a way to regularly use Word, but it is a valuable diagnostic step. If your problem goes away when you use Safe mode, we can walk you through other steps that may help eliminate the problem. Please write back.

<br />If it works in Safe mode, you may want to look at the following while waiting for more information from me or here on the forum.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Seems you posted the same response twice, although I've answered to your additional question, that the problem is just in one app: WORD. Others work fine. Therefore, it's strange to me, that it's a problem in Windows settings.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Now I see your recommendation.</p>
<p>I've tried the safe mode and it worked fine!</p>
<p>The strange thing is that when I closed it and re-opened in regular mode&nbsp; it still works fine, as if opening Word once in a safe mode has fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shall I take additional steps to prevent comeback of the problem in future?</p>
<p>Thank you for a quick response!</p>

            Opening once in safe mode doesn't do it. However, if it doesn't come back, let's keep our fingers crossed that this particular gremlin stays away.

<p>It might. I recall that starting Word with the /a switch just once was demonstrated to somehow sort out the Windows Registry to solve nagging problems. This is mentioned at

    <title>Word 2010 Horizontal Line and Text Box Margin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jenny.l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 Horizontal Line and Text Box Margin</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For alignment and other purposes, I have a Word 2010 horizontal line in a text box. I have already set the internal margins of the text box to zero, and everything in the Paragraph settings is set to zero. I have also adjusted what I could on the horizontal
 line itself. There are also no characters or paragraph marks, etc., above the line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reasons I don't understand, there is still some type of invisible "margin" above the line in the text box. Every time I try to make the text box small enough to only show the line, the line moves down out of view forcing me to make the text box vertically
 larger than I have room for on the document in order to see the line again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get the line to stay put when I (vertically) move the text box borders to make the text box smaller? (And, yes, I do need it in a text box.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify: Literally, if the line would just stay in place when I moved the text box borders vertically, then there would be enough room for the line inside the box; why does the line move from view forcing me to make the text box vertically larger than
 it otherwise would need to be? What invisible "force" is doing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide.</p>

            Well, I would still like to know the answer to the above for future reference, but I came up with a work-around. I instead inserted a 1X1 table and made the top border of one the same as the line I wanted and the bottom border of another 1X1 table the
 same thing to accomplish the same look and feel as a line.

            Hi J,J.
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Are you signed into Windows with a Microsoft Account?
<br />
<br />When I click the People app on the Taskbar, click the Apps tab then click Skype, Skype automatically launches. 
<br />
<br />Does your Microsoft Account and Skype ID share the same information?

<h2>            Merging Excel data to Word not working the way it was - seems to be retaining field codes</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been doing excel to word merges for a very long time. We use it for benefit statements where we detail different transactions - beginning balance, benefits paid, investment earnings, contributions, ending balance - for example. it has always worked
 well that if there was no value for one of them - say there were no benefits paid - it would just not show that&nbsp; line and everything would "smush" together. For example someone with benefits would show:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Begin: $5</p>
<p>Earnings: $1</p>
<p>Benefits $-6</p>
<p>End: $0</p>
<p>
</p><p>then the next record with no benefits would show:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Begin: $10</p>
<p>Earnings: $5</p>
<p>End: $15</p>
<p>
</p><p>the benefits is blank, so nothing shows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked all the way up until at least 5/3 at 10:30 am. That was the last time we ran a&nbsp; merge that worked correctly. Now, i'm getting a blank space where&nbsp; benefits would be, so for my 2nd example it looks like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Begin: $10</p>
<p>Earnings: $5</p>
<p>
</p><p>End: $15</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The root of the problem seems to be that when i select "edit" the documents on the merge, the new document that is created has retained a lot of the merge fields. Some merge field data is converted to text like it should. However, not all, and those are
 the ones i'm having problems with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the other thing is it looks fine when previewing it and testing it. it isn't until i create the new documents that the problem happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if i merge to print, and select to print to a PDF writer, it works fine. while that is a work-around, it takes a lot of time (100 records to merge) and i want it to work correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea????</p>

<br />
My bad!&nbsp; Actually, TRIMMEAN works just perfectly for this, namely TRIMMEAN(A1:A5,40%).<br />
<br />
As Hans pointed out in the aforementioned discussion, I had misread the TRIMMEAN help page.&nbsp; Klunk!<br />
<br />
Note that 40% of 5 is 2, so TRIMMEAN excludes 1 from each end (highest and lowest).<br />

<br />If for every countif() I write excel paid me a dollar, I would be a millionaire by now. It is such a versatile and fun formula to work with that I have decided to write about it as third post in our spreadcheats series.
<br />1. Using COUNTIF() to replace pivot tables
<br />2. Counting Valid Phone Numbers in a Range
<br />3. Finding number of customers in a city based on their phone number
<br />4. Pattern matching
<br />5. Counting positive numbers in a range
<br />6. As a replacement to FIND()
<br />7. For sorting text

<br />This tutorial explains the Excel SUMIF function in plain English and provides a numbers of SUMIF formula examples of Excel conditional sum for numbers, text, dates and wildcards. If you are faced with the task that requires conditional sum in Excel, the SUMIF function is what you need. This tutorial will briefly explain the function's syntax and general usage, and then you will extend the new knowledge in practice with a number of SUMIF formula examples.

<br />Actually, an easier way is to define your data as an excel "table", then do a sum on the column and add a "slicer" for "items".  When you select an item (or items) excel will adjust the total appropriately.
<br />
<br />Tables and slicers are great features to learn. They simplify/automate writing many otherwise complex formulas.  As well, once you have the data in a Table, you can move to a "Pivot table" which provides access to all sorts of automated calculations.
<br />
<br />If you want more info about tables, let me know.

<p>HI, thanks for your reply and my apologies I could not come back to you sooner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still keep getting the 0 result, very frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure how I can share my sheet with Onedrive, never used this before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/x/s!AslGwlBZIQ1IhkIyOB7R1Ioa4v_5</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the data in column B ends with a space</p>
<p>So B7 and B8 each have "Bollo " whereas the formula is =SUMIF(B3:B31,"Bollo",C3:C31)</p>
<p>Change this to =SUMIF(B3:B31,"Bollo ",C3:C31) - with a space after <em>Bollo</em>, and the results is 533.87</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best bet: in Formula sheet in J1 enter =TRIM(A1), copy down as far as needed</p>
<p>Copy all this and move to A1, use Paste Special Values. Delete column J</p>

<h2>            Office 2013&#47;2016 Professional Volume Activation Issues</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span>I am having an issue with Office 2013 professional plus and I am hoping someone would have any insight on what the hell is going on.
</span></p>
<p><span>A couple of weeks ago all of our Office 2013 installations started showing â€œyour trial has expiredâ€. If Office was closed and reopened, it would then run through the setup process and show â€œnon-commercial useâ€ at the top of the screen. Under product
 information it would show that that Office is activated. Users can still use Office and most of its features but they have to run through the setup process every time they open it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The organization I work for has multiple sites all within a single domain. We use a MAK volume license key to activate office when we first install Office. The MAK volume key is good for over 2,000 licenses. We are not running a KMS server. Office reaches
 out to the Internet to activate. Some sites are running into this issue and while others are not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One of our sites that is also experiencing the same issue did find this in their logs.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Office 2013 Event</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The description for Event ID 0 from source Office 2013 Licensing Service cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component
 on the local computer.</span></p>
<p><span>If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event.</span></p>
<p><span>The following information was included with the event: </span></p>
<p><span>Subscription licensing service failed: -1073610734</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Office 2013 Event</strong></span><span><br />
</span><span>The Software Protection service failed to start. 0x80070005</span></p>
<p><span>15.0.169.500</span></p>
<p><span>I did some research on the errors presented above and did not find anything that would help resolve the ongoing issue. No Windows updates were pushed out and no changes have been made to group policy.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On a most likely related sidenote. At the same time this issue took place all of our users lost their mapped drives. We still use vb scripts to map drives. When I was doing research on the office issue I found that the software protection service also
 uses vbs. </span></p>
<p><span>Any help on this issue would be greatly appreciated. </span></p>

            It sounds like a trial version of Office 365 has sneaked onto your computer. Check programs/App and uninstall if you find any versions of Office which should not be there.

    <title>Shaded headers don&#39;t print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjon_hinkle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shaded headers don&#39;t print</h2>
                    <p>I have created a report that contains 2 layers of headers and a then a details section. &nbsp;For clarity, I have shaded the background of the 1st header. &nbsp;When viewed on the screen, either in Report View or in Print Preview mode, the headers are shaded. &nbsp;If
 I export the report as a PDF, the headers are shaded. &nbsp;If I send the report to a printer, the shading disappears. &nbsp;I am not set to print data only. &nbsp;The back color and alternate back color are the same, but I've also tried setting the alternate to automatic,
 no color, or any other color, with no change in results. &nbsp;The changes show up on the screen and in a PDF, but not when I print to paper. &nbsp;If I print the PDF, the headers are shaded as they should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

            I've seen the boxes for checkbox controls not print on an Access report if the print quality is not set to High, even though they print/appear just fine on the PDF made from the report.&nbsp; You could try changing the print quality for the report and see if
 that helps.

    <title>Cannot print in Outlook.com on Windows 8.1 system and IE 11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joycemendelson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot print in Outlook.com on Windows 8.1 system and IE 11</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to print from Outlook.com using my Windows 8.1 computer.&nbsp; I am using Internet Explorer 11.&nbsp; I go to the three dots when I have an e-mail open that I want to print and select "Print".&nbsp; Another window opens that is titled "Outlook.com Print Message
 - Internet Explorer provided by Toshiba".&nbsp; There is a "Print" on the upper left side and a "Close" on the upper right side of the window.&nbsp; There is nothing else in this window.&nbsp; In other words, it fails to load the image of the e-mail in this window.&nbsp; When
 I print, I get a blank page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have another Toshiba, Windows 7 computer with IE11 on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no problems with printing an e-mail from Outlook.com on this computer.&nbsp; When I select the three dots, then select Print, a new window opens up as I described above, but it contains
 the e-mail contents I want to print.&nbsp; When I select the Print in the upper left corner of this window, the e-mail prints fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been unable to print Outlook.com e-mails and/or attachments with the Toshiba, Windows 8.1 system&nbsp;since I bought it.&nbsp; I print from my e-mail account all the time and am very frustrated by this problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the same printer with both laptops.&nbsp; There is no network.&nbsp; I connect the printer cable directly to a laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use other browsers so I have not tested this problem with Google Chrome, for example.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problem printing everything else on these laptops...PDFs, .doc, .docx, Notepad, Wordpad, articles or recipes from a website on IE11.&nbsp; My problem is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only </span>when trying to print an e-mail from my outlook.com inbox or other e-mail folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All help/advice is greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello, Ron:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding to my help request.&nbsp; As part of maintenance, I empty IE 11's cache every few weeks.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did empty it again today.&nbsp; After doing so, I closed down IE 11, shut down the laptop, and started it back up.&nbsp; I then signed into outlook.com and tried to print a couple of e-mails.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there was no change.&nbsp; When the print message window opens
 up, there is no image of the e-mail contents there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise....</p>

</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have found where the problem not capturing the image and then printing it&nbsp;in the print feature of outlook.com is located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 Toshiba laptops as I stated in my initial request for help.&nbsp; One is a Windows 7, Internet Explorer system and the other (that's not printing in outlook.com) is Windows 8.1, Internet Explorer 11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of this, I have been able to compare what
 happens when I try to print in both of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Win 7, IE 11 laptop, I open an e-mail I want to print from within outlook.com.&nbsp; I go to the "..." drop down box and select "Print".&nbsp; The "Print Message" window opens and I can see the e-mail image.&nbsp; I then click on the "Print" that is inside this
 window and the e-mail is set to my printer (directly connected to my laptop).&nbsp; When I started up this laptop, I first went to "Manage Add-Ons" in IE11 to see which ones were enabled.&nbsp; I then logged into outlook.com and went through the print e-mail process.&nbsp;
 As I did this, I checked "Manage Add-Ons" again and there was a new enabled add-on called XML DOM Document 3.0.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe this routine or set of routines (programs) is involved in the printing process within outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the same thing on the laptop that does not print for me through outlook.com.&nbsp; Same scenario.&nbsp; First, XML DOM Document 3.0 is not in IE 11 Manage Add-ons and it appears when I start the e-mail process in outlook.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system is Windows 8.1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe there may be a programming code issue between Windows 7 (prints) and Windows 8.1 (doesn't print) involving XML DOM Document 3.0 when printing in outlook.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, a routine is not being called that should be ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com users who use IE 11 and have a Windows 8.1 OS, have you had this issue?&nbsp; Perhaps I have a corrupt file...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to print from anywhere on the Win 7 system and, on the Win 8 system, I can print anywhere except from within outlook.com.</p>
