<h2>            no sound through headphones&#59; headphones stop Netflix</h2>
                    Microsoft Surface Pro Surface Pro with Windows 10 stopped playing Netflix when I plugged in earbuds.&nbsp; Now I can't get sound from earbuds with any application (such as Youtube) which has worked fine for several years.

            Hi francescarlsson 
<br />
<br />I am trying to help you, but if you mark my replies as unhelpful, it makes it even more difficult to do so. Others will also be less willing to help you with your problem too. 
<br />
<br />Here are some other suggestions from Netflix support you can try:
<br />
<br />Play another TV show or movie
<br />
<br />Try to play another TV show or movie. If another title plays without issue, go to the Viewing Activity page (<a href="https://netflix.com/WiViewingActivity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://netflix.com/WiViewingActivity</a>) and select the Report a Problem link next to the title that did not work.
<br />
<br />    If you do not see the Report a Problem link, the problem has automatically been reported.
<br />
<br />Is your volume on and turned up?
<br />
<br />Make sure the volume is turned up on both the Netflix.com player and your computer.
<br />
<br />    Click Play to begin watching a TV show or movie through Netflix.com.
<br />
<br />    While your video is playing, locate the audio icon  in the player control bar. Hover over the icon until you get a slider pop-up, then slide the control knob to the top to turn the volume all the way up.
<br />
<br />    If you're watching on a browser, ensure your tab isn't muted by looking for the mute icon on the Netflix tab while your video is playing. If your tab is muted, right-click on it and select Unmute Tab or Unmute Site.
<br />
<br />    Ensure the volume on your computer is also turned up.
<br />
<br />        There may be volume controls on your keyboard as part of the function keys. Depending on your setup, you may need to hold down the Function (fn) key while also pressing F1.
<br />
<br />        If you're using a laptop or tablet, unplug any external speakers or headphones to see if you get better sound through the built-in speakers.
<br />
<br />        If you need any help with your computer’s volume, check your owner's manual or talk with your computer manufacturer.
<br />
<br />Close other browser tabs, applications or programs
<br />
<br />Netflix streaming performance may improve if you close browser tabs, applications and programs that may be taking up your computer's memory and processing resources.
<br />Change your audio settings (Windows App Only)
<br />
<br />    Launch the Netflix app.
<br />
<br />    Select a TV show or movie.
<br />
<br />    While your TV show or movie is playing, move your mouse over the screen.
<br />
<br />    Click the Dialog icon .
<br />
<br />    If surround sound (5.1) is selected, try changing it to a non-5.1 option.
<br />
<br />    Try Netflix again.

<p>
</p><p>When I tried to log on to the PC as an admin, I noticed several things:</p>

</p><p>1)the system no longer lets me use a pin. I need to use my Microsoft password</p>

<h2>            How do I control which photo Movie Maker uses as a cover&#63;</h2>
                    Windows Live Movie Maker tends to select the second photo in a series as its cover when the movie is saved. One in ten times it chooses the first image. How can I control this? I'd simply like the first photo as the cover.

            <p>This isn't WMM that is doing the choosing... it is Windows.&nbsp; When you have a video clip, Windows needs to pick a thumbnail, but the algorithm tries to be smart and avoids blindly picking the first frame.&nbsp; Because a lot of clips start with a static title
 or perhaps fading from black, the first frame is rarely representative of the content.&nbsp; So the routine tries to look later in the clip to find the thumbnail.</p>
<p><span>I do not know how the default thumbnail generator for .wmv files in Windows 7 chooses which video frame to use, but I suspect that it tries to find the first</span> non-static frame at the beginning of the
 video. Also, because it's expensive to decode multiple video frames, it may skip frames in order to speed up the thumbnail generation.&nbsp; You might play around with extending the duration of the first picture and see if that make the algorithm pick that picture
 or not... but in general, you aren't going to be able to control this.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><div>If your touchpad isn’t working, it may be a result of a missing or out-of-date driver.
<ul>
<li>Open <strong>Start,</strong> enter <strong>Device Manager,</strong> and select it from the list of results. Under
<strong>Mice and other pointing devices,</strong> select your touchpad, open it, select the Driver tab, and select
<strong>Update Driver.</strong> If Windows doesn't find a new driver, look for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</li><li>If those steps didn't work, try uninstalling your touchpad driver: open <strong>
Device Manager,</strong> right-click (or tap and hold) the touchpad driver, and select Uninstall. Restart your device and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</li><li>If that didn't work, try using the generic driver that comes with Windows. Here's how: in
<strong>Device Manager,</strong> right-click (or tap and hold) your touchpad driver &gt;
<strong>Update driver software... </strong>&gt; <strong>Browse my computer for driver software</strong> &gt;
<strong>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer,</strong> select
<strong>HID compliant mouse,</strong> select <strong>Next,</strong> and follow the instructions to install it.
</li><li>If changing your driver doesn’t help, there may be a problem with the touchpad itself. Contact your PC’s manufacturer for help.
</li></ul>
<p>Hope this information helps.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Guru Kiran</p>

<p>for everyone with this problem...</p>
<p>first erase your gamertag-profile from your Xbox, than clear memory cache, restart the box and re download your profile!</p>
<p>and don´t despair...I had to start the profile download 5 times! first 4 tries DL stopped at about 30%!</p>
<p>now all fine again for me, but MS doesn´t look very good in this...an one year old problem (found dozens of forum post all over the internet, about that bug) and the offi. solution is a pice of crap!</p>
<p>lucky that Xbox360 times comes to an end... I don´t buy any MS console again!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update makes computer unstable when D-Link DWA-582 wifi card</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My desktop PC has an Asus Z87 Pro motherboard with built in wireless N which I had disabled in the Device Manager in order to use a D-Link DWA-582 wireless AC 1200 card instead. This setup was working fine until I ran the Windows 10 Anniversary Update to
 go to version 1607 (from version 1511). (The update ran OK until it got to 99%, then it froze for some 15 hours after which I rebooted the computer. The update then seemed to pick up where it left off and complete.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the computer came back up after the update I noticed it had enabled both wireless cards (the motherboard's wireless N and the D-Link DWA-582). Only the wireless N had connected to the router however, and the computer could not see any networks over
 the D-Link card. I disabled the onboard wireless N in the Device Manager as before, but then could not see any wireless networks. The status light on the back of the D-Link card was off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted the computer and everything became unstable. It would not connect to the network, but any attempt to enable or disable the D-Link card made all kinds of things on the computer start to freeze - I couldn't reliably open any programs since everything
 seemed to be jammed up and going very slowly. If I tried to disable the D-Link card the Device Manager froze. I tried disabling the wireless N in the BIOS but then could see no wifi cards at all in the Device Manager (not the D-Link either). I re-enabled the
 wireless N in the BIOS and tried scanning for updated drivers for the D-Link but it didn't find anything. I tried installing the latest drivers from D-Link's site, but the installer seemed unable to find the card. I tried uninstalling the D-Link device altogether
 in the Device Manager and then restarting and scanning for it. The uninstall seemed to hang, and the card would randomly appear or disappear in the Device Manager after each reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was all difficult to do because all applications seemed to be freezing up or going very slowly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few restarts I did manage to disable the wireless N and enable the D-Link card in the Device Manager, the activity light on the D-Link started working normally, and I had an internet connection. But after a couple of minutes the card stopped working,
 the status light started blinking regularly on and off about once a second, and the computer became unstable again. I couldn't get it back to a stable working state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end the only way I could make the computer stable again was to pull the D-Link card out and just use the built in wireless N. I put the D-Link card into another computer running Fedora 24 where it worked fine immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a known issue with the D-Link DWA-582 and Windows 10 version 1607? Why might the new version be having trouble with the card when version 1511 was fine with it?</p>

<h2>            Not downloading Nuketown 2025</h2>
                    
<p>If you download the Nuketown map its going to put you into a small server with only everyone that preordered the game. &nbsp;Its probably going to be impossible to find a game once the 3rd map pack comes out. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does anyone by chance know what the Challenge Coins do?</p>

<p>I pre-ordered the game &amp; I won't be getting Nuketown 2025 (I pre-ordered late). But then again, I never really cared for the map in the 1st place because it was simply too small in my opinion. The only thing I really liked about it was that regardless of
 who won, everyone got nuked at the end...</p>

<h2>            remote assistance does not play sound on novice AND expert computer</h2>
                    I want to set up a remote assistance session on my laptop running windows 7 to be controlled by my windows XP desktop and possibly the reverse.<br />
<br />
I have been able to successfully connect however there is currently no option to share sound with the remote computer.<br />
When I connect, I can't hear anything although sounds do play on the remote computer.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to hear the sounds on both my laptop and desktop simultaneously?<br />

<h2>            Windows cannot find my Backup</h2>
                    <p>I just did a clean install of Windows 10. Before doing the install I made sure to backup my files. Now that I have a fresh Windows 10 install, I want to get my documents, music, pictures, and other files back. I plugged in my external drive where I made
 the backup. After going to the control panel and selecting to restore from another computer's backup, Windows does not find any backups from which to restore. I can see the backup in file explorer though. Why can I not restore from the backup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manual would not work since the file names are all messed up with metadata about when they were backed up is placed in the file names. I don't want to have the nightmare of renaming thousands of files.</p>

            <p>I used the backup system built into Windows. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in my original post, using copy and paste won't work as there are multiple versions of many of my files, and all the file names have been changed to add metadata about when they were backed up. I don't have the hundreds of hours it would require
 to clean that up after a copy and paste. I would then have to go through and manually delete duplicates and change the file names for every picture, document, and music file I have.</p>

            <p>I have this same problem. I have a back-up made using File History in Windows 8.1. Due to hardware issues I had done a complete factory reset before upgrading to Windows 10. Now that Windows 10 is installed I would like to restore from my File History back-up.
 The problem is that there are multiple versions of each file and I cannot just copy-paste them into place. When I run File History it acts as if there is no existing back-up, which there is. I can see all the files (and all their versions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, I have a clean install of Windows 10 and I would like to have File History copy my files onto my computer hard drive from my external back-up drive. It won't do it and instead starts backing up my (now empty) document and photo (etc.) folders.
 Please help!</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Error 0x800f0900 when upgrading from 17133.1 to Windows 1803 &#40;17134&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I encounter the error 0x800f0900 whenever I try to upgrade from build 17133.1 to 17134 (Version 1803). Build 17133.1 because I participated in the Insider program, but a few weeks before the official release of 1803 I decided to set my Insider preferences
 to only "Keep giving me builds until the next Windows release" because I wanted to go back to the public builds when 1803 was released. So Windows Update stopped giving me Insider builds automatically after a while and I thought I'd have a public build running
 on my computer. But later, as you'll certainly know, Microsoft considered 17133.1 not as the final build because of some bluescreens and worked on 17134, the version my computer can't upgrade to. I've tried a few things to overcome this issue, in particular:</p>
<p>1.) I renamed the SoftwareDistribution directory, Windows could create a new one, but the issue didn't resolve.</p>
<p>2.) I used the Windows Update Assistant to upgrade. It could download and prepare the installation, but the installation stopped at 0%, the PC rebooted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and restored the previous version (17133.1) of Windows.</p>
<p>3.) I also tried to upgrade with the Media Creation Tool, selected "Upgrade this PC now", but it said that "The language or edition of the version of&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows installed on your PC isn't supported&nbsp; by this tool".</p>
<p>4.) Then I downloaded the ISO with the Media Creation Tool and ran setup.exe, but same result as in 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also very strange that the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/938205/windows-update-error-code-list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
windows update error code list</a>doesn't know Error 0x800f0900.</p>
<p>Thousand thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10- import video created with Windows Movie Maker in Vista 2007</h2>
                    I&nbsp;have a new pc&nbsp;that came with Windows 10 and&nbsp;I'm unable to open videos originally created with Windows Movie Maker in Vista. Before using Windows 10 I&nbsp;transferred videos/photos from the old pc&nbsp;to an external hard drive. When I transferred&nbsp;the files&nbsp;from
 the hard drive to the new pc the photos came through fine but the videos had&nbsp;extension- .MSWMM and&nbsp;error message that extension was not recognized. It gave option to open with an app.&nbsp;I chose "Windows Media Player" and&nbsp;got&nbsp;another error message-&nbsp;"extension
 not recognized by Windows Media Player." I've reviewed the forum for&nbsp;related comments/answers and followed&nbsp;suggestion to- "Import photos &amp; videos in Windows 8.1" but only cell phone videos &amp; photos&nbsp;were imported.&nbsp; Any help is much appreciated.

            Please start the command prompt (cmd.exe) with admin rights [1] and run sfc [2]:<br />
<br />
<strong>sfc.exe /scannow</strong> <br />
<br />
Is it able to find and repair broken files? Is the d2d1.dll now working?<br />

<h2>            Kinect PlayFit - Sorry PlayFit calorie retrieval isn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t available right now</h2>
                    
<p>Hello I'm having issues with launching Kinect PlayFit. I receive the message</p>
<p>"Sorry PlayFit calorie retrieval isn't available right now. Please try again later. For more information go to www.xbox.com/status."</p>
<p>I've tried numerous times over the last few hours and still the&nbsp;same message. I'm not sure if this is a client side or server side error. Also the status page doesn't list Kinect PlayFit as a service, making this message very misleading. There was also another
 thread about this same issue, and it was marked as answered. There was definitely no clear answer given and I made a follow up post in that discussion as well.</p>

<p>The app is extremely glitchy as it refuses to count some games that it supports, and then gives these error messages all the time. Just keep rebooting the app until it decides to work. Its what I unfortunately have to do on a daily basis to get my playcount
 going on it. So no, I don't think its a server issue at all. Just a glitchy program that needs to be patched. At least its free though.</p>

<p>Hey there, OVT cac2690. I have a response out to you in another thread, but I wanted to post here as well to see if I could catch you. Another user mentioned they are no longer receiving the error message. Can you confirm how often you encounter this and
 whether it consistently or only at certain times? Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Sorry about the late reply. The issue has not happened since. From what I can understand it's only during the account creation process that it was persistent, my friends also had the some problem at the time. I have not confirmed if the issue has been resolved
 due to the fact all my friends are now set-up and running :D</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business conversation is lost when we close the window of the IM</h2>
                    We are facing one single big problem with skype for business. We were unable to see previous conversation with a person. Somtimes it says it saved the conversation and suggests me to go to conversations tab to see messages. But, there is nothing. How can
 I resolve this issue. this is so frustrating to see a paid microsoft service works like this.

<h2>            Quantum Break - Alan Wake downloads</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased Quantum Break digitally on 5/17/16 from Amazon and installed it on &nbsp;the same day and I was supposed to receive a code in my xbox live messenger, which I have not received. This is what it says:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Includes an additional full-game download of Alan Wake, the Xbox 360 game playable on Xbox One, as well as The Signal and The Writer add-ons (download code will be delivered via an Xbox Live message 7-10 days after downloading Quantum Break).</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How do I receive my code for Alan Wake and the DLC?</span></p>

</p><p>If you are no longer have access to the email address linked to your Skype account, the only thing I can suggest you is to answer the verification form. It is the only way to recover a Skype account since account recovery process is fully automated. Kindly
 submit a request through this link: <a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/acsr</a>&nbsp;and wait for the reply of our recovery team within 24 hours. I</p>

<p>Hi Kenneth</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read Michelle's original post once more. She states that she is using a new email address as part of her skype account. And also that the old one no longer exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the recent additional skype security check is referring to the old email, NOT to the email that is currently linked to the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that obviously is a bug at your end.</p>
<p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please ensure that your security programs use the CURRENT email address as per account details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A stupid mistake like that makes one foremost think of a scamming attack.</p>
<p>Please avoid these bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Bernhard</p>

            Actually there is a n issue in verification system. Even if you&nbsp;<span>answer the verification form, you will be asked to enter the code from not&nbsp;</span><span>existing&nbsp;</span><span>email.
 So users like squirrel in a wheel. Terrible support, I'm very disappointed.</span>

<h3> kkastroid  say:</h3>
<h2>            window 10 is so stupid</h2>
                    <p>hwy do they change all the UI? people have been using same UI for decades. it is so frustrating and hard to find just run commend and even control panel.
</p>
<p>i thought the search tool will find the menus easily without going through the hassle of looking for the specific menu through new UI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>who design this? redesigning UI 101 is smooth transition from old ui to new UI so customers won't have to go though the frustration.</p>
<p>why do you change the menu that's been working find for years to make your customers angry?</p>
<p>i hate microsoft. window 10 UI is a disaster.</p>

<p>Hello Butterflylove1983,</p>
<p>In order to give you accurate help, we need a more detailed description of the problem and question that you have.</p>
<p>Some questions that you can answer to help out are:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; What version of Windows 7 are you running?<br />
2.&nbsp; Is it an OEM version that came with your computer, or a retail version that you purchased?&nbsp; (or a beta version)<br />
3.&nbsp; Is your copy activated?<br />
4.&nbsp; Are you trying to locate the key that you used to activate Windows 7? Or are you trying to get a key, so you can activate Windows 7?</p>
<p>If you already have activated and used a key, you can download a product such as Belarc Advisor and run it to retrieve the key.&nbsp; However, if you've installed Windows 7 and didn't use a key, you'll need to purchase a license in order to activate it.&nbsp; This
 can be done through online computer suppliers such as newegg.com or amazon.com, or even through Microsoft's website.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a "free key" or a "crack key", then you've come to the wrong place to ask.&nbsp; Since this is a Microsoft forum, noone in their right mind will tell you where to look for the pirated keys or means to bypass the keys.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you to give us a more detailed explanation of your issue, and have a great day:)<br />
Patrick.</p>
