            <p>Why, why, why Microsoft treats their mobile platform like an Orphan Child?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot delete the primary mailbox.&nbsp; Not Possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cold reset will not solve the problem either since the issue has nothing to do with connection(s) on your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check the settings on the mailbox and make sure the SSL is checked for security/authentication of the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That should take care of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, take the unit to a Microsoft Store and asked them why their support for the platform is in effect nonexistent?</p>

<p>Hello Mahesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the introduction, but I want to unfollow them without being followed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean is it possible to not follow from the beginning when the invited person join Yammer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the following automatically happens when they join and this following is mutual.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Word &#60;2003&#62; has insufficient memory and wants to save as a rescued document&#34;</h2>
                    I get the error message: "Word 2003 has insufficient memory and wants to save a rescued document" when I try to save work on Word, there are different error messages for ppt and excel, but these don't save either. I have just built this PC (therefore virus
 and addon free) and it is only showing this error message for 1 of the 3 users of the PC. The others work as normal. PC is Intel i5 3.3GHz, 12GB ram. 1.5TB HDD and a 240GB SSD with the OS on it. Cheers for reading, hope you can help!

            OK if it is happening for only one of the 3 ID's, I'd suspect corruption of the Windows ID. Try creating a new one to replace it and see if the problem goes away.<br />

<br />
<br />If you need an access to your account that it works for some browsers.
<br />
<br />Try to use different one, as well you can use different browsers on your mobile phone.
<br />
<br />I can sign in using Microsoft Edge/Opera.
<br />
<br />This can be used as workaround.
<br />
<br />Hope the issue would be resolved soon

            Hello rkuzniewski,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your patience.
<br />
<br />I am pleased to inform you that Outlook.com has fully completed its deployment of the fix that had impacted service availability for some users in the infrastructure and there should be no more service interruption now.
<br />
<br />See: <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a>
<br />
<br />In case it is still not working for you, it could be a browser-related issue.
<br />
<br />May I suggest you to delete your Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies and clear browser caches then restart the browser? 
<br />
<br />- selectively deleting browser cookies
<br /><a href="https://www.beacontechnologies.com/blog/2012/10/clearing-cookies-from-just-one-site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.beacontechnologies.com/blog/2012/10...</a>
<br />- clearing browser caches
<br /><a href="https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/</a>
<br />
<br />Alternatively, open in private mode ("incognito mode") or try with a different browser
<br />
<br />Otherwise, clear your DNS revolver caches: <code>Win</code>+<code>R</code> and enter <code>cmd.exe</code> then key in <code>ipconflig /flushdns</code>
<br />
<br />Please ensure that your browsers have
<br />
<br />- JavaScript enabled: <a href="https://www.enable-javascript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.enable-javascript.com/</a>

<br />We are really sorry for the inconvenience caused and please do not hesitate to let me know if you require additional assistance.
<br />
<br />As I am continuously trying to improve myself so that I can give customers the best customer support experience they deserve, please let me know if my answers could be better. Your indication will reverberate across great distances and spans of time especially users who are encountering the same issue as you.

<h2>            Word Document- Converting &#123;LINK&#125; Field Codes Only to Text</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm working on a word document and have ~50 field code links to an Excel Sheet.</p>
<p>Before I send the document to the customer I want to convert these field codes just for these links into text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select the whole document Ctrl+A, and then CTRL+Shift+F9, it converts <strong>
all</strong> the field codes (Figure Numbers, Table Numbers) in the document and the Indexes :-(</p>
<p>I could go through the document and convert the {LINK.....} field codes to text, but I need to do this on a regular basis, and that's not workable.</p>
<p>Any idea how I can select just the {LINK...} field codes and convert them to text?</p>

<h2>            Strange formatting when replying to an email in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">
</p><p><span>Hi, I wonder if anyone can help with a real strange one. If I send an email in Outlook 2013 (say to Gmail) the email content is fine, if they reply with the original text, again this is received
 fine by me in Outlook, but if I reply again then the person in Gmail received strange characters, e.g:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- Our first-hand experience means we know what
<strong><span>we&amp;bsol;re </span></strong>talking about</span></p>
<p><span>- We<strong><span>&amp;bsol;re
</span></strong>a friendly bunch, answering the phone quickly and responding to e-mails promptly &amp;grave; you can deal with the same person
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Please do let me know if
<strong><span>there&amp;bsol;s</span></strong> anything I can help with!</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Basically it looks like it's turn ' into well, I don't know what? It's strange it only happens after the message has been replied to twice?
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Any thoughts?

            <p>Hello Darren,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Was there any earlier version of Outlook previously on the Computer?</p>
<p>2. If yes, did you face this issue anytime?</p>
<p>3. Does the issue occurs only while sending emails to Gmail account or to any accounts?</p>
<p>4. Is recipient using Outlook or webmail?</p>
<p>5. Log on to webmail and check how does it show up there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be best if you can provide us the screen shot for better understanding on the issue which will help us to analyze and assist you in better way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to add the image, click on the â€˜Add Imageâ€™ icon present in the â€˜Replyâ€™ window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I'm getting the same thing:</p>
<p>- happens with Gmail</p>
<p>- happens with the usm.edu Outlook 365 exchange server</p>
<p>- only happens when I reply to a message</p>
<p>- i've tried all of the encoding and smart quotes</p>
<p>- i've created a new profile</p>
<p>- i have an older laptop beside this one and the problem does not occur there, even though I have exactly the same settings.</p>
<p>- each time I reply to the same email message, it adds more and more weird characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot:</p>

            If new messages look OK when you run Outlook in safe mode, then the most likely cause is an add-in. Disable all your add-ins and enable them one at a time until the problem recurs. &nbsp;The last one you enabled will be the offender. &nbsp;Messages already received
 won't change, only ones going forward.

            <p>Thanks but I disabled all add-ins a few days ago and it didn't help.&nbsp; I did this by going to File&gt;options&gt;Add ins and then I went to the manage COM Add-ins and pressed Go.&nbsp; From there I unselected everything.&nbsp; If this isn't enough, please let me know what

            <p>Two other observations:</p>
<p>- if I copy and paste text into my emails, Outlook will convert apostrophes to and quotes to strange characters
</p>
<p>- If I change the format to plain text, these characters are not embedded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I messed around with the encoding etc. and was able to make the symbols change but never go away.&nbsp; I now have everything set to mostly default settings and, as I mentioned above, they work fine on the laptop sitting next to this one, both running Outlook
 2013 and the same email accounts.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Temp File Lost</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded an attachment from my Outlook account (2016), modified it and failed to Save As in a new location. &nbsp;I have a MacBook pro (Sierra 10.13) and tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Navigating to the Library Cache via the Go To Folder command (this folder doesn't exist)</li><li>Navigating to the Outlook Temp File (only contains jpegs of an image in my email signature)</li><li>Recent documents on the Finder main window (&amp; spotlight search).</li></ul>

</p><p>Are there any other options or did I permanently lose my work??</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Generally, if you couldnâ€™t find the modified attachment via spotlight search, the file maybe not been saved. Please double check via Spotlight, Siri, or Click the Finder -&gt;&nbsp;All My Files&nbsp;in the Finder sidebar -&gt;select View -&gt;&nbsp;Arrange By -&gt;&nbsp;Date Last

<p>First, which version of Outlook do you have? Please go to the Outlook menu and choose About Outlook. You should have version 16.11.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to update, please do that and then try again to locate the attachment. I don't understand why you're using Finder to locate the attached file. It should still be attached to the email message unless you deleted it and then emptied tot trash.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Outlook 2013 inbox not syncing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2013 inbox not syncing</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up two separate IMAP accounts in Outlook 2013, which had been working well for a few days. Upon restarting my computer (no updates were installed, as far as I know) and opening Outlook, one of my IMAP accounts stopped syncing the inbox. I could still
 send messages from the account, but could not receive. I've removed and added both accounts multiple times as a potential solution, without success. I am running Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No error messages have come up, so I have no idea what is going on! When I check the send/receive status updates, I get one of two options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Syncing is complete, as in the picture below (although the blue notification bar keeps running):&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94b045e9-ea09-4017-9e7e-1b4c8265606f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. OR item #4 (synchronizing subscribed folders) takes a very long time (around 10 minute) to "complete," but still, no new emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be incredibly appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span><span>Hello Nicole,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I am sorry that you are experiencing issues with your IMAP accounts while receiving emails in Outlook 2013, though you are able to send emails normally.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue might occur due to incorrect email account settings for your IMAP email accounts in Outlook 2013. These issues could also occur due to other issues like synchronizing
 issue with the IMAP server. In order to resolve this issue let us try the following step.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We shall check the account settings in Outlook.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>In the <strong>Account Settings - E-mail Accounts</strong> box (Click on
<strong>File</strong> tab <strong>&gt; Account Settings &gt; Account Settings</strong> drop-down option) click on the
<strong>More Settings &gt; </strong>and then on the <strong>Outgoing Server </strong>
tab. </span></span></li><li><span><span>Make sure to check the option <strong>My Outgoing Server (SMTP) requires authentication</strong> and the option
<strong>Use same settings as my incoming mail server</strong> selected. </span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab and make sure to replicate these settings.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Incoming Mail Server: 993 with SSL.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP): 587 with TLS.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>Save the above settings and the account settings by clicking on the Test Account Settings button on the Account Settings â€“ E-mail Accounts box or click on the Next button
 to perform a test of the account settings. Check if the test completes successfully. In case you receive some errors and the test does not complete successfully then navigate back to the 'Advanced' tab from 'More Settings' option and make sure to change the
<strong>Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP)</strong> to <strong>465 with SSL</strong>; test if these settings work fine.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If yes, then close and reopen Outlook 2013 and check if you are able to receive and send the emails normally in Outlook 2013.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope the above steps help in resolving your issue. Let us know the result.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you.
</span></span></p>

            <p>I am experiencing the same trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted the Outlook setting changes recommended by Mohan, but no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on Send/Receive All Folders from Outlook 2013 appears to complete successfully, but does&nbsp;NOT download new messages on the server. Restarting Outlook 2013 DOES download all messages from the server, but then the same problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? Thanks.</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You have mentioned that restarting Outlook 2013 does download all emails; and then the same issue persists. Does it work only once when you restart Outlook 2013 â€“ in other words
 was this just a onetime occurrence? Are you able to sync the Inbox completely by repeated restarts?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try setting up a new Outlook Profile in Outlook 2013 and configure your IMAP account in the new Profile to check if you are able to sync well.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to create a new Outlook Profile follow these steps from the article below.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now setup your IMAP email account again in the new Profile.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To setup the email account on the new Outlook profile refer the section
<strong>How to</strong> <strong>set up an email account</strong> in the above article.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the above works fine and you are able to receive all emails from the account and works fine on every instance when you try to receive emails in Outlook 2013.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the above steps and let us know the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span>Send us the complete error message - that you received while trying to setup your email account in a new Outlook Profile.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, since both your IMAP accounts are hosted on the same server and use the same IMAP settings, check the server port numbers (on the
<strong>Advanced</strong> tab) and also check the <strong>Outgoing Server</strong> tab on the account which works fine and compare with the other account to check if there is a difference. If yes, try replicating the same settings.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the result.

<p>
</p><p>Both of my IMAP accounts use the same settings (I included pictures of each below).&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>My problematic account (#2) seems to be receiving and sending emails now, though I'm not sure why-- because I haven't done anything different with my settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do get, however, is a "sync issues" folder (picture included) but the folder and sub-folder are both empty. Why does this appear, and how can I get rid of it?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your email with the update on the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Sync Issues folder is created by default in Outlook 2013 and all email clients for all IMAP accounts. It is the IMAP account that creates the Sync Issues folder. This folder stores information about any Synchronization conflicts or issues between
 the IMAP Server and the email client that may have arisen during the send/receive process.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since this is a system folder created by the IMAP account this folder cannot be deleted. You can look into this folder for information regarding any sync issues with your IMAP account in Outlook 2013 and the IMAP server.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regarding the issue with deletion of emails from the problematic email account I suggest you to try creating a new Outlook Profile and setup your problematic IMAP account in the new Outlook Profile (I had added the steps to create the new Outlook Profile
 in one of my previous posts on the same thread, as shown above). Wait for the account to complete synchronization â€“ this may take between a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the number of emails in your account.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once the sync is completed try restarting Outlook 2013 again in the new Profile and check if you are able to delete emails normally from the email account.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the above step and let us know the result.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you. <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Unknown Frequent Contacts</h2>
                    <p>When I write a new email, several email addresses appear in the frequent contacts list that I've never seen before, they don't relate to any of my contacts or any emails that I've sent. Does this mean that someone else has accessed / used my email?
</p>
<p>As there are no messages containing these email addresses in any folders, pressbly they have been deleted. Is it possible to have these or maybe all my deleted emails recovered so u can check what's been sent and to who? I'd appreciate any help or suggestions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unusual process in task manager</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">When I opened my task manager I noticed that under non-windows processes 'Windows Command Processor' was open. I am aware
 this is the cmd, but it still listed this when no cmd was open on my screen. Further more the file location was SysWOW64 rather than the system32 folder where it opens from when I open cmd normally. Is this unusual or does the SysWOW64 version of cmd just
 sometimes run in the background. When I end the process it re-opens itself eventually. I am using Windows 10 with the Anniversary update.&nbsp;</span>

            I haven't done anything to troubleshoot as no problem is arising, I am just asking if what is in my task manager is normal. All it is is that under 'background processes' there is 'Windows Command Processor' which is originating from SysWOW64. Even though
 the cmd isnt open.

            Hi Sandra, 
<br />
<br />Close Word 
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features 
<br />Click on Microsoft Office in the list of installed apps 
<br />At the top click 'Change' 
<br />Choose the Quick Repair 
<br />
<br />Once the Repair has completed, try opening Word 
<br />
<br />If Word does not open correctly, go back and choose the 'Online Repair' Option - it will take longer, but it will repair your Office Installation . . .       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Try following one by one and see after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />
<br />2. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />

<br />
<br />3. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />4. Sometimes, this is caused due to application not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />5. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky / Avast Anti Virus  etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.

<h2>            FIXED 3&#47;4&#47;16&#58; Problems with POP accounts in Outlook 2016&#58; Email is deleted from server or duplicated in Inbox</h2>
                    <p>UPDATE - 3/9/16</p>
<p>------------------</p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're locking this discussion thread, which has grown too large to be manageable; we are concerned that potential issues are getting lost in the comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't already, please follow the steps in KB <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3145116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
3145116</a> to update your copy of Office. If you still have trouble after that, verify that the update installed correctly (you should be on version 16.0.6568.2036). Keep in mind that after applying the update, emails may be duplicated one last time - but
 this should only be a one-time thing, if it happens at all. The KB article provides steps on how to remove those duplicates under the
<strong>More Information</strong> section of the article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've done all of the above and are still seeing duplicate emails or server deletion issues, we ask that you start a new thread in the Outlook 2016 forum so we can follow up with you individually. To do that, click
<strong>Participate</strong> &gt; <strong>Ask a Question</strong> at the top of this page. The more detail you can provide in the new thread, the better (symptom you're seeing, version of Outlook 2016 you're on, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE -&nbsp;3/4/16</p>
<p>------------------</p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Weâ€™re in the process of rolling out an Office update now (version <strong>16.0.6568.2036</strong>), which will fix the following POP3 bugs:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>After Outlook downloads your email, all the email messages on the server are deleted from the Inbox.</li><li>Email messages are downloaded multiple times in Outlook, causing duplicate items.</li></ul>
<p>To get the update&nbsp;immediately, open Outlook 2016, and then click&nbsp;<strong>File</strong> &gt;
<strong>Office Account </strong>&gt; <strong>Update</strong> <strong>Options</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update Now</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong>After the update, Outlook may download all email one final time, which isn't ideal, but may be necessary to fully fix things. If this occurs and email is duplicated in your Inbox, you can use the method described in
 the "More Information" section in this <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3145116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> (KB 3145116) to remove the duplicates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ORIGINAL POST - 2/26/16</p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p>We want to let you know about issues we're seeing with Outlook 2016 and POP3 accounts. If you have the most recent Office 365 update installed (version 16.0.6568.2025), your emails may get deleted from the server or you may receive duplicate emails in your
 inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook team is aware of the problem and actively investigating the issues. We'll update this post and KB 3145116 as more information becomes available. You can click on the
<strong>Subscribe</strong> button at the bottom of this page to receive notifications whenever this post is updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, please try workaround steps provided in this <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3145116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> (KB 3145116):</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Configuring your email account to use IMAP settings instead of POP3 (only if your email provider supports this).<br />
OR</li><li>Reverting to an earlier version of Office 2016 via uninstall of latest update.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> If you disabled the "Remove from server after &lt;x&gt; days" option in Outlook 2016 to fix the delete email issue you're probably now getting duplicate emails in your inbox. To avoid both problems, please re-enable the "Remove from
 server" option and use one of the other workarounds listed in the KB article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your patience in this matter. We are treating this issue with the highest priority as we work to fix the problem.</p>

            <p>On my laptop computer I disabled updates and reverted to 16.0.6366.2062 and the problem no longer exists. However I have no way of knowing when it will be safe to resume updates again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the desktop, a different story. I had over 22,000 messages in my inbox and it continued to download them hundreds at a time whenever I started Outlook.</p>
<ul>
<li>I disabled updates and reverted to 16.0.6366.2068. That did not resolve the problem.
</li><li>Then I ran scanpst.exe on the inbox twice. Each time it reported errors and I repaired them.
</li><li>I ran scanpst.exe a third time. This time it said there were only minor inconsistencies and the repair button wasn't shown.
</li><li><strong>However, the problem persists on the desktop machine.</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Has Outlook hosed my Inbox beyond repair? <em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">What can be done?</span></strong></em>&nbsp;I have work to do. Right now I'm dead in the water on my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I must leave messages on the server. Disabling that and/or moving to IMAP are not options.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Since the laptop is now working, <em><strong>could I move the Inbox pst file from the laptop to the desktop and use it as my new inbox?</strong></em> Could that fix the problem?
</span>Or would it further hose things up? (Though I imagine it would be hard to hose things up more than MS has already done!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what can I do to get my system running again? Why won't scanpst.exe fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[P.S. I hope MS doesn't underestimate the amount of irritation and even anger this lack of basic QA has caused on what should be a reliable product. I've wasted hours trying to fix MS's damage, all to no avail. How can we get the message to MS that there
 are massive customer relations and PR problems from rolling out a release that's not been thoroughly tested?]</p>

    <title>outlook 2013 keeps creating new ost files and backup mail profiles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sharepointisneedlesslycomplex  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook 2013 keeps creating new ost files and backup mail profiles</h2>
                    <p>So I have been having this problem in my org for the last year. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, at certain times, for instance this morning, outlook will create and download a brand new OST file when a previous one already exists. It also creates a new mail profile and has all these "backupX of outlook" sitting in there under control panel
 -&gt; mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The situation today was that exchange server 2013 has rebooted during the night for normal updates and such. My outlook stayed running overnight, however lost connection and prompted me for credentials when i unlocked the workstation this AM.</p>
<p>I then restarted outlook, to fix the credential problem and at that point, outlook "touched" and locked all the OST files, and started creating a new OST file. I cannot even delete the OST files that are old unless i close outlook first.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it was almost like it looked quickly at them, for some reason thought it could not use them, and then decided to make a new profile and redownload the entire OST file from the server again. And of course its still at it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a problem because many people in our company have SSD drives and they fill up fast with all these multiGB OST files being re-downloaded over and over. Not to mention it lags out the server when people all come in at the same time and have to download
 gb's and gb's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not just happen to me, but many many users in the org. Probably all of them. We are all using cached exchange mode.</p>
<p>There must be some setting or something? Anyone seen this or can explain the rationale that outlook uses to build these "backup of outlook" profiles?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>That script (or something else) is doing more than just setting a signature - Outlook would never create a "backupx of Outlook" on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is a new profile is getting created or somehow the account in the profile is getting reset then everything regarding the .ost file is behaving normally since a new one would get created each time.</p>

            <p>Well the only time i have seen the script cause problems is when a user tries to open outlook before its done making the signature. Then they get "outlook is already open" or some such message and have to wait a few seconds for the signature creation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since the issue does not occur with regularity, its hard for me to test to see if the vbs script is the problem. I see people are now doing the same thing (setting the signature populated with AD info) with powershell scripts, but I think they would do a
 very similar thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it doesnt do anything to the outlook profile except load it. But you are saying that simply trying to open the same profile twice should not create a backup by itself, so I dont think that is the cause.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever the cause, you have multiple &lt;backup&gt; Outlook profiles (along with mulitple associated OST files) that based on the description are not being created manually and Outlook certainly doesn't create them so...............</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is installed on these systems that creates backup profiles and which one is being opened since from the Outlook UI perspective? There would be no visible difference in terms of accounts/data file etc if the "backup" is an identical copy of the original.</p>

            <p>It just takes up space, and peoples favourite folders are lost from the top of the left hand menu. Other than that there is no problem with it creating these. well and there is some lag downloading the entire mailbox again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am not convinced that the script is the problem. Is there any sort of log file for outlook, like say on opening? any way to enable some sort of diagnostic mode that might track what might be causing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do have some plugins installing, cisco viewmail, some people have skype.. But other than that outlook 2013 is pretty stock. We do set peoples signature with vbscript, but as i said, you get an error message if you open outlook to fast that outlook is
 busy and cannot open a second copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>outlook must create these somehow. We dont back up users machines. there are no other softwares on all the machines that i can think of that would touch outlook other than what i had mentioned.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Well, if you can ever replicate the issue without your script - please don't hesitate to post the steps involved. To date, this is only reported instance I've ever seen where Outlook creates backup profiles and have never seen it happen on the myriad of
 test configurations I use nor has it come up from any of the other Outlook MVP's who also have countless test systems. If it is Outlook that's doing it - has to be something really, really, REALLY obscure (but then again have also never used Cisco Viewmail).</p>

            <p>Since you said that you didnt think outlook created this file, i started thinking what else configured outlook or touches it on logon. Then i remember the PRF file. So i go looking up docs and what do you know, this page lists a so called "hidden property"
 of prf files:&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/config/understanding-microsoft-outlook-profile-file-prf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/config/understanding-microsoft-outlook-profile-file-prf/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><pre><p class="contentCodeblock">BackupProfile=False</p><p class="contentCodeblock">or</p><p class="contentStandard" /><p class="contentCodeblock">BackupProfile=No</p><p /></pre>
<br />
<p>Then i started hunting around for other people who have used this string in their PRF files, and lo and behold found this:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://ardamis.com/2012/08/17/outlook-2010-creating-backup-of-profiles-for-roaming-users/http://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ardamis.</a><a href="https://ardamis.com/2012/08/17/outlook-2010-creating-backup-of-profiles-for-roaming-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">com/2012/08/17/outlook-2010-creating-backup-of-profiles-for-roaming-users/</a><br />
<br />
which sounds quite similar to my issue. </p>
<p>I am going to try putting this string&nbsp; in the PRF file on monday (i hate making changes to essential configs at 4pm on a friday :P) but i am optimistic that this may solve the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i will post back after a week or so with that in there and see if it does prevent the creation of these backup profiles!</p>

    <title>Can I install Win 10 Preview onto a Partition within Boot Camp on an - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edwardbenz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I install Win 10 Preview onto a Partition within Boot Camp on an IMac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Can I install Win 10 tech Preview onto a new &nbsp;partition that I create within the Boot Camp partition on my iMAc</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have a new iMAc 5k Retina with a 512GB SSD and run Windows 8.1 Pro, 64 bit&nbsp;on it using Boot Camp. The Boot Camp partition is 256GB and has 177GB free.&nbsp;I assume that I can non destructively shrink the Boot Camp partition and create a partition
 onto which I could load the WIn 10 preview. But I am not sure. Among other things, would the option to boot into the new partition exist in the Boot Camp set up?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Alternatively, can I install Win Preview onto an external drive and run it from there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the .iso file and made the bootable thumb drive, but don't want to mess with&nbsp;the Win 8.1 Pro partition on which I do my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am fairly experienced, have built several PC's, installed and up graded a&nbsp; lot software, etc. but don't know much about the booting architecture of Boot Camp</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I wouldn't recommend it, especially with a Preview version such as Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a very speedy machine, why not set it up in a Virtual Machine utility such as Oracle Virtualbox instead?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To install W10 Tech Preview on Virtual Box, I made the following settings in V-Box:</p>
<p>Use the "Windows 8.1" selection for the version of windows that you are installing. (General Section of V-Box)</p>
<p>Check "Enable I/O APIC" (System Section, Motherboard)</p>
<p>Enabling PAE/NX doesn't seem to make any difference (System Section, Processor)</p>
<p>Enable VT-x/AMD-V and Enable Nested Paging (System Section, Acceleration)</p>
<p>Enable 3D Acceleration (Display Section, Video) - the V-Box extensions won't install unless you do this. (You need the V-Box extensions both to increase screen resolution and to access a network.)</p>
<p>Do not enable 2D Video acceleration - this caused my screen to flash on and off!</p>
<p>If V-Box does not work at all - with any OS - then you might need to enable virtualisation in the BIOS.</p>
<p>I had also tried Hyper-V, but it was too invasive, blocked V-Box execution and was impossible to uninstall without a System Restore.</p>
<p>Disable UEFI </p>

            <p>Hi Sundar11,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of things to check. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first one is to make sure that you are entering in the right password. &nbsp;Wi-Fi passwords are case sensitive. &nbsp;Try changing the wi-fi password temporarily to a sequence of numbers and see if that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which security protocol is your home wi-fi using? &nbsp;Windows Phone 8 supports WEP, WPA, and WPA2. &nbsp;Windows Phone 8.1 adds support for&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">EAP-TLS.</span></p>

<h2>            Find&#47;Replace doesn&#39;t work when text is in a text box.</h2>
                    
<p>I want to replace a certain block of text that I know appears more than once in my document. Using Ctrl + H to find and replace the text in question, it skips over anything in a text box.</p>
<p>If I use the new Navigation pane it seems to find it, but once I click off the pane and into the document I have to manually replace the text and then re-search for the next instance.</p>

            In the Find &amp; Replace dialog box, click Find In, and set it to Text Boxes in Main Document. Does that resolve the issue for you (although, it introduces an additional step if you don't know a priori to search in text boxes)?

<h2>            Install VirtualBox fails on Windows 10 &#40;no Virtual Machine&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tryed to install VirtualBox on Windows 10 pro Insider preview build 10122.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tryed to install followed versions of this Software:</p>
<p>- VirtualBox-4.3.28-100309-Win (latest 4.3 version)</p>
<p>- VirtualBox-5.0.0_BETA4-100374-Win</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both have the same issue that I can open the installation program and it start the installation (I force to start with "Run as Administrator"). But in the middle of the installation, a small window in the upper left corner is showing for one second and then
 the installation rolls back due to a problem while the installation.</p>
<p>It shows the text "Oracle VM VirtialBox x.x.x Setup Wizard ended prematurely decause of an error" (no further inrormations.).</p>
<p>After this, Win10 shows the dialog "Installation failed! Error: Critical error at installation." (Sorry, I have german version, so I tried to translate this as good as I could).<br />
</p>
<p>It seems to be an incompatible network driver because, compared with an installation into Win 7/8, it hangs on this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Information of my installation conditions for Windows 10:</p>
<p>- AMD-4170 QuadCore</p>
<p>- 2TB HDD (Win10-Installation, made from a test installation in Virtualbox and then exported it to this HDD on my real machine)</p>
<p>- Bios Virtualization options are turned on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile you could try installing VirtualBox 5.0.0 and uncheck the Bridge network, I suppose is not compatible with Windows 10, at least in my case it worked without it,&nbsp;and all my virtual OS's worked as on Windows 8.</p>

    <title>OneNote 2010 and Office365 - error 0xE4010640 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryan-l  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2010 and Office365 - error 0xE4010640</h2>
                    I am running OneNote 2010 with two notebooks that sync to a Sharepoint location in my Office365 account (Plan P1).&nbsp; Both notebooks are accessed from at least two computers and one Windows Phone.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Today both notebooks refuse to sync from both computers, with multiple sections giving the error
<i>"An error occurred while attempting to sync this section or notebook. (Error code: 0xE4010640)"</i>. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There is another notice stating that <i>"This notebook has not been connected in 9 days. If this location no longer exists or has been moved, you can sync this notebook to another location. If you expect this location to become available again, you do
 not need to do anything."</i> There seems little I can or should do about that, but I include the information for the sake of completeness.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Restarting OneNote.&nbsp;</li><li>Shutting down one of the computers, then restarting the other one and restarting OneNote.</li><li>Searching (via Bing and Google) this error code. Only one result, a person asking about firewall rules - no good answers given.</li></ol>
<div>There is no change. OneNote still gives multiple instances of the same error (one for each section in the notebook). It's pretty frustrating.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for any help you give!</div>
</div>
                </div>
