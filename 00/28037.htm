<h2>            Wrong account used when &#34;Reply&#34;ing to email - outlook 2007</h2>
                    
<p>Outlook 2007:</p>
<p>I have one POP server, at comcast (C) with two email addresses C1 and C2. I also have an e-mail address at a business (B) which forwards email to&nbsp;C2.&nbsp; In Outlook-&gt;Tools-&gt;Account Settings&nbsp; I show 3 accounts C1, C2, and B. C1 is set to the default (send from
 this account by default).</p>
<p>1. I start an e-mail addressed to C2 and verify it is&nbsp;being sent through outlook default account C1 . Then send it.</p>
<p>2. On arrival, I open it and see on the "From:" line it correctly came from address C2</p>
<p>3. HERE'S THE PROBLEM: I hit "Reply" and the "Account" dropdown shows the reply will be sent via. account B.&nbsp; I.e. The reply to address C2 is being sent through account B .</p>
<p>I would expect Outlook to either 1. recognize the reply e-mail address C2 is also an outlook account C2 , and send via that account C2 , or 2. recognize the reply e-mail address is not an outlook account and pick the default outlook account C1 to send through.&nbsp;
 The last thing I expect is outlook pick account B to send through, an account not mentioned in the test email nor set as the default.</p>
<p>How do I prevent outlook from picking account B to send "Reply" emails through?</p>
<p>PS: If I mail to&nbsp;the default account C1 , and then "Reply", outlook correctly picks account C1 to send the reply through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the issue is Outlook, or how the accounts are setup in Outlook.</p>
<p>Comparing the E-Mail account dialog for the Business outlook account B and account C2 (the not default outlook account) they are identical except for the "E-Mail Address" under "User Information". One email address is a business address, the other email
 address is a personal address. I think the idea is when an email is sent using the Business account the recipient sees the business address in the from line, and when an email is sent from the personal account the recipient sees the personal address in the
 from line. So the intended purpose of the nearly duplicate Business account is just for sending out email. On the receiving end, either account pulls e-mail from the same identical comcast login name.</p>
<p>When I reply to an email sent to C2, Outlook has to decide which of these two nearly identical accounts to send the reply through. Are you saying this decision is made purely on header information in the email I'm replying to, and doesn't entail any heuristic
 on Outlook's part to choose among the outlook accounts?</p>

            In general, Outlook will respond using the email account to which the original email was sent. If you send an email to account C2 from any account, Outlook should use C2 to reply. The issue might arise as a result of the forward you have setup from B to
 C2. Is this done with an Outlook rule, or by some feature available at the B account server?&nbsp; My concern would be that a message in C2 might look like its in B as a result of the forward

<p>Thanks, I checked in "Rule's and Alerts" - the only rule in there looks to be one Outlook put in "Clear categories on mail".</p>
<p>The Business server has a forward setup to bounce the mail to C2.</p>
<p>Hmm. I have a thought. Both accounts pull in email from the same identical comcast login. When I hit Send/Receive in outlook, both accounts are used to receive email.&nbsp; What happens if Outlook polls the B account first, before the C2 account ? I bet it thinks
 a reply should go through the B account. And if the polling were swapped, poling C2 first and B second, it would send replies through C2. Is that possible?</p>
<p>If I knew how to remove one of the accounts from the "receive" part of the "send/receive" polling, or if I knew how to swap the order in which accounts are polled I could try this idea.&nbsp; I can verify that B is polled before C2 in the Outlook "Send/Receive
 Progress" dialog. That possibly confirms this speculation. Swapping the accounts in the "Accounts Settings" doesn't change the polling order.</p>
<p>Any idea how I can either change the polling order, or disable the "receive" part of "send/receive" for the B account ?</p>

<p>I'm saying that your third party server has to route the emails to the right places, as long as they send they make it to your email server, and if you receive a email it came from your email server.</p>
<p>If there is a setting that is wrong in outlook your servers email service will have to walk you through these settings, and that (if) there is a setting that is incorrect in outlook, they will have to point it out, because of all of the pop3 going on.</p>

<p>Ug. I can work around the issue&nbsp;in "Tools-&gt;Send/Receive Settings-&gt;Define Send/Receive groups" selecting "All accounts", then selecting the Business Account in the left column of accounts, and then un-checking "Receive email items". Very confusing.</p>

            <p>I have had this problem for Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2007.&nbsp; I still have the problem.</p>
<p>When I compose a new email, it correctly chooses the default account.&nbsp; However, when I reply to a message, it should be replying from whichever account it was sent to or at worst, from the default account.&nbsp; However, it is sending from the same non-default
 account.</p>
<br />
I have tried deleting the wrong account and that did not work.&nbsp; I have tried repairing and compacting the mailbox and that did not work.&nbsp; I have tried making different ones the default account and that did not work.&nbsp; No idea what to do.&nbsp; I am happy that I am
 not crazy and the only one that has this problem but I am also frustrated that it hasn't been fixed though it has been a known issue for years.

            <p>It is actually ridiculous.</p>
<p>I am having the exact same problem but mine goes one step further. </p>
<p>When i select NEW email; it sends via the default account as it rightfully should.</p>
<p>When i select REPLY is when it gets interesting. It replies to "certain" emails via the default account and others via the non-default account. The thing is that both mails are from the same sender. It replies to one via the default account and the other
 via the non-default account. </p>
<p>The theory of Outlook choosing the alternative account when it cannot connect to the default account holds no weight in this instance. I am not sure what thread is in an email that makes outlook revert to the non-default account only for certain email. (yet
 sent via the same person).</p>
<p>I could always choose the account to be used, from the ACCOUNT LIST... but why should i ???</p>
<p>I am going to try upgrading to 2010 to see if this solves the problem.</p>

            I have Outlook 2010 and the problem of bringing up the incorrect email account when I hit reply is worse....The default email account appears when I hit new email but I can not figure out the logic behind which email account is chosen when I hit reply.
 It seems to always pull up the one I do not want to use. I would expect it to pull-up the same email account/address to which the email was sent by that is not the case. Does anyone have a fix to this problem?
<div><br />
<div>It I remembered to check which account is brought up I could of course change the return address to the one I want to use but I usually forget to do this. Help please! Thanks. Karen</div>

<h3> terryspringer1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I receive skype calls in foreign countries&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am going to be living in the Caribbean and travelling around via sailboat. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the Skype subscription options and even the $14 per month option did not have many Caribbean nations listed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - is it possible to send and receive calls when in a country not listed under the subscription package? For example, if I am in Grenada and someone in the US calls my skype number, assuming I am online will my skype number ring?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am online logged into my Skype account - on my PC or phone - and I want to call someone in the US from Grenada or Barbados will it work? If so what is the costs?</p>
<p>

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />As Skype Subscriptions are limited to single countries, and do not cover all countries, your best option is to use Skype Credit to send and receive calls. 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, you can only receive calls to your Skype Number if you are in the country associated with that Skype Number, BUT you can still receive calls from other Skype Contacts via the internet.
<br />
<br />As long as you have Skype Credit and have a stable internet connection, you will be able to use that Skype Credit to call anyone in the world. The costs vary greatly - depending where to and where from you are calling, I cannot give specific figures or a general rule of thumb, sorry.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, if you are calling to the same location whilst you are travelling abroad, i.e. USA, your best option is 'Skype to Go', where you can link your mobile phone to Skype, and it can be found here:-

<p><span>Hi Salvatore,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You are absolutely correct in stating that you would have to add a payment method before you are fully qualified to receive the offer. After you have done this, it can take up to three business days to receive the offer code via email. Also, please
 be sure to check your spam/junk folder for the offer code. More information regarding promotional offers can be found in our

<p>
</p><p><span>Ultimately, it depends on the terms and conditions of the specific coupon you are trying to use. I am happy to look into this for you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have sent you a private message, which you can respond to with a screenshot of the promotional offer you‚Äôre are inquiring about. Please check your private messages.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p>I am happy to announce that I have resolved this problem on both of my computers. &nbsp;Open the Chrome browser, click on the Options menu (Upper Right Hand corner hat looks like 3 horizontal lines) - then click on "Settings" in the drop down menu. &nbsp;On the "Settings"
 page, scroll all the way to the bottom and click on "Advanced Settings", then scroll all the way to the bottom of that page and click on "Reset Browser settings". &nbsp;You may need to go back to your settings to enable some of your plug ins or browser extensions,
 but I would suggest you only do one at a time and wait to see how it affects your system,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure, but I think my problem may have been caused by some conflict between a browser extension "Norton Safe Search toolbar" and Chrome. &nbsp;I have enabled the extension again and I am waiting to see what happens,&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Alternatives to Microsoft Binder</h2>
                    I have several documents that will allow end users to fill in forms in several different formats (primarily Word and Excel).&nbsp; I would like to be able to package these forms together so that the end-user will be able to receive the documents together, open
 them, fill in the required information and then repackage them and return them to my company.&nbsp; I understand that Microsoft Binder was a program that was used in the past, but that it is now unsupported by Office 2007.&nbsp; Is there a viable solution to work around
 this?

<p>Theory: there is no obvious successor to Binder, but both Word and Excel are capable of acting as containers for other objects - for example, you can create a Word document with independent, embedded Word and Excel objects. The embedded Word objects can
 certainly contain protected forms, The user could open the container document, then be guided to double-click on each relevant embedded object, fill it in, and close it, then save the entire container document and return it.</p>
<p>Practice:</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. I think that relies on quite a high degree of understanding from the end user, and even assuming they "get their bit right", it also requires you to unpack the component files in order to extract their contents when the container is returned to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. I would try to find a way to provide a single form using only one of the products and reduce complex interactions to an absolute minimum.</p>

            Thanks. However this did not work. The drafts folder initially shows as empty straight after I delete the email.&nbsp;However if I select another folder and then go back to the drafts folder it reappears.

            <p>This was not effective either. I have tried clearing browser cache, checked other Draft folders on other devices and linked accounts. I have tried dragging the messages to other folders as well. These issues began once Outlook.com updated to the new look.
 I had issues sending emails to business contacts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue being these emails were sent while the account was not connected. When Outlook.com update the domain, it disrupted the connection to my linked account. It "Failed to Update" the linked account, and failed to to so for a few weeks. After reconnecting
 my account (numerous times) I can now send emails. These non-deleting drafts are waiting to be sent.</p>

</p><p>There is no fix and Microsoft does not even acknowledge a problem. I have had this issue myself for many months and have posted my problems to no avail.

<p>
</p><p>Most of the responses are clearing cache, disconnecting accounts, etc. that I have done over and over. The problem lies in a piece of software that Outlook.com uses and as a user you cannot fix yourself no matter what you do.</p>

<h2>            Roll back to straight Win-10 from Evaluation build</h2>
                    How do I roll back Win-10 Eval build to standard Win-10? Using the System tools, the attempts have always restored the Eval Version. It appears that when I did my upgrade to Win-10 when it first came out, my ability to return to Win-7 was deleted as well
 now, the standard Win-10 installation. Will downloading a Win-10 iso be my best option? And will the info stored in the cloud keep modifying the operating system to Eval. Version?

<p>If you have not cleaned it out before doing a clean install or reset do this; copy the Download Folder in File Explorer to a USB or another drive on the disk.&nbsp; Then use it to install the downloaded programs rather than wandering all over the Internet to
 download the programs again.</p>

<p>I have a little problem with my E52. After update (033.002), in my phone appeared 5 photos which I can't see or delete (it says General System Error)...I can still use the phone, it works fine, but this error worries me...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: I tried hard reset and nothing</p>

            hi Abdulrash,<br />
<br />
have you checked if there are any firmware updates avialable for your handset via Nokia Suite? if there are any, please update to the latest version offered. if there isn't any, please perform a three-finger hard reset, but backup all your personal data to
 PC and/or online storage first.<br />
<br />
Failing that, you will need to take your phone to your local Nokia Care for inspection:

<p>
</p><p>In regards with your query, what we can suggest is for you to have the contacts from iCloud be added to your Outlook contacts too. In this way, you'll be successful in having the new contacts added from a certain group list.

<p>Do a little search for UUPDUMP.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a little hiccup on my Insider moving from 18305 to 18309.&nbsp; I was being questioned on my Microsoft Account at the 100% download point.&nbsp; To fill my time I created a 18309 ISO before 18308 was installed on the Insider.&nbsp; Turns out I re-named the PC and
 the install did continue and was finished when I got out of bed this AM.&nbsp; I had the 18309 ISO before I went to bed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, I created my own ISO following the install.&nbsp; Now I can made an ISO before the install is even done or just create the ISO to put on the shelf.</p>

<p>Just a little note of caution here.&nbsp; For 18309, there are 3 downloads being offered.&nbsp; In my case, I go for the "AMD" download.&nbsp; If in doubt, just go the link as provided but a little bit earlier and you will see the "3" choice of download.&nbsp; One is for X86
 and the other one may be "Not AMD".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files being used seem to be the same as those offered by Insiders, just being offered almost immediately after a new release.&nbsp; I got to 18305 directly from public build after 18298 fried by SSD and killing the LCD display.&nbsp; It was a software glick and
 no failure or damage to display driver, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For 18309, I had my ISO in hand before 18309 got to final install.&nbsp; Looks like a keeper.&nbsp; Actually easier to use than UUPTOISO.&nbsp; Just a couple of clicks to begin&nbsp; and go to bed.</p>

<p>UUP Dump gives the Architecture options x64, x86 and arm64.&nbsp; Choose x64 (most will require this one) it is then referred to as

</p><p>It is safe and reliable. As you probably know, the files are fetched directly from MS servers and the author of the script is

<p>They used to. I guess they prefer users to update so they can collect more telemetry. I don't blame them, the update process needs a lot of improvement.</p>

            How obvious ! Why didn't I think of that !!&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Have added the path, but then had permission errors, so deleted the "EDB.log" part of the path - restarted, windows then recreated the log file, and no more errors. Fixed at last. Thanks again.

<p>You do not need to make the log file, just create the two missing directories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Navigate to&nbsp;<span>C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Copying and pasting the path into explorer may not work as you may not permissions by default, so you may have to naturally browse along the path. Once there, just create a new folder named TileDataLayer, and within
 that create a folder named Database. Once the path is created, Windows will create the EDB.log file as well as a few other random files.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is possible that when you update Windows again, you will have to redo this.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Missing Sent items in Cached Exchange Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arthurbl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Sent items in Cached Exchange Mode</h2>
                    <p>After re-installing office on a PC, Outlook was crashing because it could not find some files (personal files I assume). After reading a microsoft help, I deleted the email profile (through the control panel) and re-installed the email on Outlook.</p>
<p>It's an Exchange setup (i.e. email address + password).</p>
<p>The INBOX in syncing but the SENT emails are not syncing (I can only see the email sent since the last install).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I remove the "Use Cached Exchange Mode" in the settings, I can see all the SENT emails ; but outlook is extremely slow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same setup (i.e Exchange + "Use cached Exchange Mode") on 3 other PCs and I don't have the same problem.</p>
<p>Basically, I'd like to be able to Use the Cache Exchange Mode and see all my SENT emails (like on my other PCs).</p>
<p>Could you please help to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>thank you.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Change Office 365 Mail Default Address Book</h2>
                    I have Office 365 Home Premium. In Mail, when I want to send a new email, and therefore hit New Email, and then hit TO: &nbsp; The default address book comes up as Contacts (This computer only ). &nbsp; I would like to change this to another file, simply called
 Contacts, which I imported from Office 2007 off my old machine. &nbsp;Can I make it do this by default ?

                    I have a couple of issues to report with this version, but am unable to use the Feedback app to do this.&nbsp; The

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><div>It is unusual that the feedback app windows has no scroll bars, and even full screen and you don‚Äôt get submit button. We reproduced the issue however, the problem does not seem to occur.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As a basic troubleshooting step, I suggest you to Run the<strong> Apps Troubleshooter</strong>(<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></a>)
 and check if the issue persists. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>An automated troubleshooter is a tool that can find and automatically fix some problems with your computer. These troubleshooters aren't designed to fix every problem, but they're a useful tool to try because they can often save you time and effort.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let us know the result. We will glad to help if you need further assistance.</div>

<p>The scroll bar does appear when opening the Feedback Hub and searching for feedback.</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community. I will provide you the steps to install Office 2010 Suite on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you mentioned, it looks like there are corrupted installation files of Office suite on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us manually remove the traces of Office installation files from the computer. Refer the
<b>Method 2</b> and run the <b>FIX IT</b> to remove Office suite manually from the computer.
</p>
<p><b>Office 2003</b> Suite:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2639197#Method2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2639197#Method2</a><br />
<b>Office 2007</b> Suite: 
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928218#Method2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928218#Method2</a><br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301#Method2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301#Method2</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the FIX IT is run successfully, restart the computer and install the Office 2010 Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this fixes the issue. If issue persists reply and I will be happy to assist you further.</p>

<h2>            Help function not working</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using Office 2010. The help function is not working: Whenever I call help or do a search in help, a Download-File prompt appears wanting to download some XML file.</p>
<p>How can I fix this?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>There were no error messages besides the "Download: Open/Save/Cancel" prompt.</p>
<p>Renaming the help folder as you suggested prompted each Office Application to launch a lengthy install-period including the request for a reboot on pressing F1, but didn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to fix the problem by reassigning the default program for the XML data type: It had been set to "Microsoft XML Notepad", when I changed that to "XML Editor" the issue didn't occur any more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>AngusMac</p>
