<h2>            Emails are being sent and not being received</h2>
                    <p>Hi My emails are being sent (in the sent folder) but not being received. Ive checked this with a couple of email accounts I have (a work outlook account and a gmail account) same thing. There is nothing in the drafts or outxox either. Emails are coming onto

<p>Ive looked through the help pages but none of it makes any sense to me.</p>

    <title>Importing PCV file INTO outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steeboo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Importing PCV file INTO outlook</h2>
                    <p>Isn't it about time that MS brought in to play a simple way of importing and exporting back up files to and from other email clients such as Thunderbird</p>
<p>I use both Outlook 2013 and Thunderbird and to try to convert a PCV to a PST is a joke
</p>
<p>Please MS - join the 2st century and realise that you do not have the sole right to email handling - and offer either a import facility or a simple FREE convertor.......</p>

            You cannot import PCV file format in outlook and there is no free convertor, that is why Deepa asked you to provide feedback so that it can be heard by Microsoft.

<p>
</p><p>There's a very simple solution to this that can be easily resolved by T-Bird (if it isn't already by the addon shown below) - simply provide an export of all T-Bird data in a format supported by Outlook (which in the case&nbsp; of O'2013 would be a .CSV file).&nbsp;

</p><p>Am personally not&nbsp;a user of T-Bird but as far as I'm aware,&nbsp;a .PCV file is a proprietary "backup" file created by MozBackup and not sure why you feel it's MS's responsibility to keep track of that format any time a change is made by Moz. Not up to MS to
 try and keep track of every email client in existence - simply not practical or reasonable.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So&nbsp;the&nbsp;logic is that Microsoft should become responsible for keeping track of every free email client that exists or may come into existence along with every time something changes in those programs simply because of their size and not because it makes any
 business sense - is that what you're suggesting? Because you want to use a "free" email client along with Outlook and then expect everything else to be free? If the conversion is such a relatively simple conversion - then it would be equally simple for the
 folks at Mozilla to provide it with their program. There are many&nbsp;free email clients - T-Bird is just one of them. If those programs want to be compatible with Outlook - their responsibility to provide the functionality to make that possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are lots of inexpensive 3rd party convertors that process&nbsp;the .MBOX format (none that support PCV that I know of) - one such program to get you started that has excellent customer feedback comes from the &lt;Fookes Software&gt; folks &nbsp;(which whom I have
 no affiliation or involvement with - you should do your own due diligence before any purchase is made)</p>

            <p>To the best of my knowledge, file level save password is not encrypted.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For encryption you would need to use a credentials server. Click on the Permissions button on the Review tab of the Ribbon to enable this feature.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can make an encrypted disk image using Mac OS X. That is the way you would provide an encrypted document without using a credentials server.</p>

<p>I apologize for my previous post. What I really meant was that the Office build 16.0.4393.1000 is much newer than 16.0.4266.1001. And the Large Address Aware (LAA) improvement was introduced in 16.0.4393.1000.</p>

                    <p>Original Title: Updated From Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Beta</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the above title suggests, I did the upgrade and now I have lost a couple of things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) My printer is missing - it does not show in Devices and Printers even though I can use it to print through applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I had a second User account on my Windows 7 computer and even though it shows when I log off my primary Windows account (in the log-on page I get both accounts showing), I cannot find anywhere in my primary administrator account where to access/delete
 my secondary account.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

 Is there a new approach that should be followed or is this now unnecessary?</p>

<h2>            Outlook&#47;Hotmail mail delivery problem</h2>
                    <p>I've spent the past six months trying to get email working with Microsoft DUMB filtering system to no avail.. It is now drastically affecting our business and revenue! .. We're a simple photography studio and when people request information from us and they
 are using a @hotmail address then they simply do not get a reply because our emails go into the junk folder or simply never get delivered at all.. We have our server 100% configured as it should be and checked now by four different companies and all tell us
 that the problem is with Microsoft's Screen filter AI nonsense! .. Everything is 100% on our end, we can send and receive emails from any other domain on the planet without ANY issues whatsoever! I feel Microsoft has effectively rendered email useless for
 doing business because of their very broken filtration system that simply DOES NOT WORK!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Why can't my replies to clients just end up in their inbox??? Why is a reply to a email sent from a hotmail account seen as SPAM when the account marking it as SPAM made the initial contact? Microsoft really need to get their act together!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Logs tell me emails are delivered, I don't even get standard mail errors or warning indicating any kind of issue as defined by the RFC's... This is purely a a filtering fault at the other end.. When I reply to any hotmail/outlook/msn whatever domain that
 uses this screening nonsense my emails either disappear completely or get marked as SPAM for no reason! I'm being destroyed by Microsoft and its insane filtering system!

    <title>Problem trying to Share with OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertjohnbenson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem trying to Share with OneNote</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to share a OneNote Notebook with the share function. When I type in his email and share, it appears to work. Unfortunately, he doesn't receive the email but his friend does. When I check the properties it shows his name as the person shared to&nbsp;but
 the email shows his friends email address. I cannot change this. I can only add it to Outlook or Favorites. If I add it to Outlook and correct the address, it still appears incorrectly in OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is OneNote getting this address? I've checked all of my email&nbsp;addresses and they are correct. I believe it has something to do with one of the address books that have an error in the entry, but I would be damned if I can find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had to copy and send the link but I would really like to take care of this issue too.</p>

<p>Hi Robert, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1. By "share function", do you mean click File&gt;Share in OneNote 2016? If not, how and where do you share the notebook?</p>
<p>2. Capture a screenshot for "When I check the properties it shows his name as the person shared to" and a screenshot for "the email shows his friends email address".</p>
<p>3. Where do you store your notebooks, local drive, consumer OneDrive or OneDrive for Business?
</p>
<p>4. Check with that user, if he sets up some forwarding or alias for his email address and his friends'? Could you share with us their email addresses?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sent you a <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
private message</a> to collect the info mentioned above for privacy protection. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>Hi Robert, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to my private message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to confirm if you mean you select and share the notebook with <strong>ril**on@gmail.com</strong>, but when you check email address in
<strong>Shared with</strong> section, it shows the correct user name (<strong>Ril**on</strong>) with incorrect email address (<strong>be**h@gmail.com</strong>). Meanwhile, actually user
<strong>be**h@gmail.com</strong> receive the invitation rather then user <strong>
Ril**on</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you firstly stop sharing with that incorrect user. And then access your cloud storage (OneDrive or OneDrive for Business) with browser, find that notebook and share it with the correct user. Check if at last the correct user receive notification
 and can access the notebook. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct in your description. I have deleted the incorrect user and tried to reshare several times. I've actually created a new Outlook contact Ril*** with the correct email and used that, unfortunately, the wrong user comes up again, the user with
 Ril*** as a username with the incorrect email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I think that when you use the Share routine, OneNote is getting that contact information from somewhere other than the actual contact selected. I know this doesn't sound correct but I think that is what is happening.&nbsp;I know that the original
 incorrect user contact was probably created by my son. I think he had his friends email address associated with his name when using Skype. Unfortunately, I am unable to locate that entry to change or delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both my son and his friend are off at college, his friend is getting annoyed at these emails, though he's being a&nbsp;good sport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to share the notebook with my son but that required me creating a LINK and then emailing it separately to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rob<br />

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check if this is related to OneNote client app, please try the followings to see the result:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; In OneNote, right-click on the affected notebook&gt;Copy link to Notebook, paste the link in browser to open the notebook in OneNote Online, then click File&gt;Share&gt;Share with people to see
 if you can share the notebook with the correct people.</p>
<p>Please also testing sharing a different notebook to check the result.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Navigate to your OneDrive, find the notebook and select it, then click Share button from the top to check if you can share the notebook with the correct people.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; In Outlook 2016 and Outlook web app, create a new email, check if it displays the right display name/email address and check if you can send email to the right person.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; Check if the issue only occurs with this specific account you are trying to share. You can try to share the notebook with a different account within OneNote 2016 to test this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to better understand your situation, please help provide the following information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Is your OneDrive account an OneDrive personal account (like ***@gmail.com, ***@outlook.com) or OneDrive for Business account (such as ****@contoso.com, ***@contoso.onmicrosft.com)?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Please help go to your OneNote File tab&gt;Account to capture a screenshot of your OneNote product information.</p>

 well.

<p>Hi ALMANILIGHTING,<br />
<br />
Did you enter incorrect passwords several times when signing into Office portal? Can you succeed in signing into Office portal after at least 30 minutes?&nbsp; You can wait for 30 minutes and then open a prviate window for signing. After signing, we suggest you
 change your password to protect your account.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists after a few hours, I’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1.The screenshot for the error message. To post a picture, click Use rich formatting&gt;Insert/Edit Media icon in the thread page.<br />
2.Did you get the error message at the first time you want to sign in?<br />
3.Have you configured your account with any mobile device?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Hi ALMANILIGHTING,<br />
<br />
This issue may be related to the configuration of your account with the android app. Is it the app from the pop-up when we sign into Office admin portal (Office 365 Admin app)?<br />
<br />
You can try removing your account settings in this app to check the outcome.<br />
<br />
If it is not this app or the issue persists, please post back with the following information:<br />
1.What is the app?<br />
2.Can you remove the account setting in this app?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim</p>

<h3> homecctv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Temporary account suspension</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this email account set up as part of our CCTV system, to notify us if there is certain movement. It sends an email notification to our own personal email accounts when there is activity. Naturally, this happens quite often and so there are many emails
 outgoing from this address - and every few days this account gets temporarily suspended because it looks like someone is using it to send a lot of spam but this is not the case. Is there any way around this, perhaps a way to recognise an email address that
 this sends to as a contact or something so it doesn't get blocked so often? I can understand the suspension is easily removable and is in the interest of security but it is quite long-winded as it happens so often and we are only sending emails to our own
 accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

    <title>IF Function Returning Wrong Value - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            IF Function Returning Wrong Value</h2>
                    <p>I have a spreadsheet in which column I contains phone numbers and column K contains a unique identifer for that phone number. Not all rows have a column K identifier, but I need them to so that I can delete the phone numbers in column I and have the information
 be de-identified but still keep rows that once belonged to the same phone number together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried two different ways to do this and both return the wrong value:</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF(I35=I34,K34,K35) --&gt; this option returns a 0 if the phone number is not the same as the row above it, rather than returning K35's original value which is what I need it to do</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, then, I copied all of column K into column L so there are essentially two identical columns-- K and L-- and tried</p>
<p>IF(I35=I34,K34,L35) hoping it would return its original value just because its original value is now in L35 in addition to itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This second option works but&nbsp;<em>only</em> if I type in the formula anew-- if I drag the formula down from the previous cell, it only returns K34 (i.e. copies the value from above).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<li>The original IF function is in C3, when dragged down through C6 it works fine.&nbsp;</li><li>Once dragged from C6 to C7, what's returned, as you can see, is C6 instead of D7 even though A7 does not equal A6</li></ul>

</p><p>First, the example Excel file does not duplicate the first problem, to wit:&nbsp; returning zero instead of "K35's original value".&nbsp; None of the values in column C is zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I do not see anything wrong with the behavior of the formula in C7, which is =IF(A7=A6,C6,D7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that A7=A6 is FALSE, since A7 is 7274630105 and A6 is 7274630028.&nbsp; So it should return the value in D7 (454722)
<em><strong>as you expect</strong></em>, not C6 (459123).&nbsp; And indeed,&nbsp;C7&nbsp;displays 454722, which is the same value that is in D7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, the problems that you describe are consistent with&nbsp;the fact that the Excel file is in Manual calculation mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want it to be in Automatic calculation mode, click Formula &gt; Calculation Options &gt; Automatic, then save the file.</p>

<h2>            My Internet Explorer 11 does not load CBS website.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: IE11 didn't load CBS but Chrome did?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, my granddad has a windows 8.1 toshiba and today he was on IE11 trying to get on the big brother live feeds on CBS.com. However, internet explorer wouldn't load it. At times there would be just a white screen and other, it would say an internal server
 error 500 (?). The website still said www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother and did not look like it was trying to redirect us anywhere else. The home page would load most times After refreshing it a couple of times,but trying to get on the live feeds were unsuccessful.
 My granddad didn't like that so we installed chrome and the cbs live feeds worked fine! What is the cause of this? How can I fix it so that he can continue using IE? McAfee security found no threats on the computer. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Sharepoint site &#34;In Limbo&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, once again I have a question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user who created a site about a month ago, but the site has no owners and no members, and she is not sure how it happened. She would like to be reinstated as owner, but attached is the message I get when attempting to add her or anyone as a member.
 Also it was made public, and she would like for it to be made private but I cant even do that, as the site no longer shows up in the admin console, but can be searched for. Very strange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

Go to the affected site -&gt; click the gear on the upper right corner -&gt; site information-&gt; Under Privacy settings,change Public to Private.<br />

                    <p>I can send emails but can not receive emails from my HotMail email account on my Android (4.4.2) RCA tablet.</p>
<p>The same issue exists when I log in using live.com. in a pc. There are no emails in my in box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However on my desktop pc I can receive and send emails using the hotmail icon account..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that the incoming server name and port has changed in the incoming tablet email set-up.</p>
<p>To see the outgoing email server name on the Android, one must first enter the incoming data correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every name I enter a server name I get &nbsp;"error, unfinished, incorrect data."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if I am using POP3 or IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried entering the following in incoming email &nbsp;server names from searches for this problem in the internet:</p>
<p>
</p><p>m.hotmail.com &nbsp;port 43</p>
<p>snt-m.hotmail.com</p>

<p>
</p><p>Fist of all I am still using "hotmail" in my email account in Android and my desktop pc. Should I be using @outlook.com? I don't understand the differences in hotmail and outlook.
</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">same or are they different</span></strong>? I simply click on the hotmail app on my android tablet and my desktop and they open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the hotmail icon on my Android on which I am having difficulty receiving emails. Should I still look for and download the outlook email app in Google Store and set it up? Tell me what server names and ports for "incoming and outgoing mail I should
 use after I elect to use "Exchange" please for set-up. And can you give me an example please?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I am confused about the Sync frequency, Days to Sync, Sync email, Sync Contacts, Sync Calendar, Download Attachments. I have check marks by Sync email, contacts, calendar, download attachments. I have selected "Push" for Sync Frequency, and "Last Day"
 selected for Days to Sync. Do I have these set correctly on my Android set up for my hotmail icon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I have no trouble receiving email on my desktop email. I use a hotmail icon on it also. It will open in Edge and Chrome.</p>

<h2>            OneNote Spamming my Work Shared Drive &#38; all sub directories with &#34;Open Notebook.onetoc2&#34; files</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been scrounging through the internet to find an answer, please help! I use Office 2013 in Windows 7, and somehow one note is filling my work's share drive with all these useless files! I have closed all my notebooks, and made new ones, but every 24
 hours after I erase all these "Open Notebook.onetoc2" files, they reappear!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gotten in trouble with my supervisor over this, and if I can't find a solution, I will have to stop using One Note. Please help!</p>
<p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 will not ask for new password after Office 365 password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 will not ask for new password after Office 365 password was changed.</h2>
                    <p>I had to do a mandatory change of my Office 365 password. Afterwards, Outlook was unable to retrieve e-mails, saying that it needed a password. When I clicked to enter password, a window would pop up briefly (and I assume it entered my old password), immediately
 close, and nothing would happen. I tried to find a place that Outlook stored my password, and could not find anything. So, I removed my e-mail account from Outlook and tried to reinstall. I get the following steps that fail to ask me for my password at any
 point and then gives me a vague error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c57acb7-e0c4-4e84-95ff-61b5651566c3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c57acb7-e0c4-4e84-95ff-61b5651566c3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After this, I uninstalled and reinstalled all of Office. I still get the same results as above. I am out of troubleshooting ideas. What else can I try to get Outlook to ask me for a password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Added troubleshooting steps I've tried: I have been able to login to my account on anything other than this app with this machine. I can login to outlook if I use the online portal. I can login using Outlook and this same process on another machine (I assume
 because it doesn't have the previous, incorrect password stored).</p>

            Hello Wesley,,
<br />
<br />From your control panels -&gt; credential manager, delete all your Microsoft accounts and configure a new  outlook profile. 
<br />
<br />Check if you have multi factor enabled (if yes, create a new app password)
<br />
<br />Let me know I if after steps the issue keep showing.!
