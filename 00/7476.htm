<h2>            How to prevent spam setting from getting changed</h2>
                    <p>I have a user that keeps getting the TrustedListsOnly option set to True in the anti-spam settings. &nbsp;As a result, messages sent from anyone not in her allowed users list get routed to the spam folder. &nbsp;This isn't a setting that she is changing by herself.
 &nbsp;I've tried setting it to False through Outlook, Outlook Web App, and now I've set it through powershell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to stick for about an hour, and then it gets changed from False to True. &nbsp;How can I go about getting this setting to stick? &nbsp;As far as I know, the only client she uses is Outlook on one computer.</p>

            <span>Hi Jvndmrk,<br />
<br />
Firstly, I’d like to confirm that if the ‘TrustedListOnly’ option is the Safe Lists Only option as the screenshot below in Outlook:<br />
</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca1f6a28-6bd1-4da9-98a9-38aa6b3f741d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca1f6a28-6bd1-4da9-98a9-38aa6b3f741d" /></a>
<span>
<br />
If so, I would firstly explain that this option is only for the Outlook client. It is just an Outlook client related option and will not be affected by the settings in OWA (Outlook Web App) or PowerShell.<br />
<br />
Since this user is only using Outlook client on her computer, I would like to consider that there could be some issues in her Outlook client. So I would collect the following information for further research:<br />
1. Did the issue occurred recently or always exist? Did the user update the Outlook client or change other settings?<br />
2. The detailed Outlook client version. You can check this by clicking File-&gt;Office Account-&gt;About Outlook.<br />
3. Which Office 365 plan did you use in your organization?<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been asked to change all emails in a specific outlook account to unread (ie all his folders).&nbsp;However, the user wants to keep all emails sent after the 8th Dec set to read.</p>
<p>How do I go about achieving this?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Mouran,</p>
<p>Apologies for the massively delayed response. I've been waiting for the user to get around to trying this.
</p>
<p>Having tried the above, we've fallen foul of the search limit in outlook (which I've since disabled) but are still unable to search and highlight all his emails (there's about 22GB in total) in a local version of outlook. We tried this through the 365 portal
 too to no avail.</p>
<p>Is there a way to return and select all of his emails without resorting to switching to cached exchange mode and downloading everything? Anything we can do programmatically through powershell?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I’m here to follow up on this case.</p>
<p>Based on my experience and research, it’s not feasible to select all emails without switching to cached exchange mode and downloading everything. For PowerShell commands, we suggest you move forward to
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=winserverpowershell&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>
</p><p>Is this happening if you view your emails directly at Outlook.com? If not, then the problem is with your email client.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can alleviate this issue by either re-configuring your account in Mac Mail or calling their support.

    <title>Wrong sort order on subform when displayed on form on rare but - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill freese  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong sort order on subform when displayed on form on rare but consistent occasions</h2>
                    New to the forum, so if this is an old one, please forgive the interruption and direct me to the answer already given.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a form with a subform. Items on the subform are sorted by an item ID. On 600+ pages, the items on the subform display in the correct order, 101, 102, 103, 104, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 301 . . . On two pages, they display in order, but starting
 at the wrong place. When I hit record 616 on the main form, the subform begins with item 201. Everything is in order, but with the four items in the 100 range at the bottom of the list rather than at the top. When I hit record 640 on the main form, the same
 thing happens except the subform list begins with item 205. This behavior is consistent. Record 616 always begins with item 201, record 640 always begins with item 205, all other records begin with item 101 as they should.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I open the subform by itself, the records corresponding to main form records 616 and 640 are ordered exactly as they should be. That is, the order is correct on the subform alone, but not when the subform is displayed as part of the form. The subform
 item IDs are assigned automatically from a lookup table, so cannot contain odd characters on the two odd records, but just in case I ran a query and confirmed they contain the exact same numbers, that is "101" on record 615 and "101" on record 616 are identical,
 "102" on 615 and "102" on 616 are identical, and so forth.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There is data associated with each item, always a number between 1 and 3. That data has nothing to do with the sort order, but I have confirmed that the data stays with the correct item number, so everything is working perfectly except that on record 616
 and 640 you have to start near the bottom of the list and then pop back up to the top if you want to read the items in the correct order.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any thoughts?</div>

<p><br />
Hmm.&nbsp; I can think of two things to try.&nbsp; First, try compacting the database and see whether you get the ame behavior after compacting.&nbsp; (Make sure you have a backup before compacting, just in case.)</p>
<p>Second, see if you get anything different if you also set the Order By property of the form, with Order By On Load set to Yes.</p>

<h3> davidlundyxr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t take Windows 10 Update after using Recovery Tool</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 535 that came with Windows Phone 8.1. Some months ago I updated it to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I lost WIFI connectivity during a scheduled update and was left with only the blue screen of death with a frowny face on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I used the Windows Device Recovery Tool to restore the phone, assuming (wrongly) that since the current OS for this phone is listed as Windows 10 that this would be the OS downloaded and installed by the tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead it re-installs Windows 8.1 (8.10.14234.375).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fine, I'll just go through with the Windows 10 install again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 Upgrade tool in the store now tells me that my phone can't take Windows 10. That's news to me, as yesterday it was surely running Windows 10, and had been for months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to get Windows 10 back on this phone or is it still effectively bricked with 8.1?</p>

<p>I went to meet with someone and had to get a resource from my e-mail.</p>
<p>I forgot to logout so the cookie still remained in his PC.</p>
<p>I changed my password, it didn't help.</p>
<p>I added a 2nd layer of protection with authenticator for phone, it didn't help.</p>

</p><p>Can i deauthorize all computers from all services and let the authenticator kick in for anyone, even if they still have a cookie with their browser?</p>

<p>For example Facebook can delog me from other devices. I thought MS would have some similar mechanism.</p>

</p><p>Ok, i can't delete their cookie, but the auth must have some ID or something that can be deleted from your login process so it won't recognise their cookie and they'd have to try to login again.</p>

<h2>            Data sort not working properly</h2>
                    
<p>I am performing a simple data sort by using 3 columns. A code column then Last Name then 1st name..&nbsp; for some odd reason 5 names that have the M code are not sorting alphabetically in the M's.&nbsp; I have looked at all the columns, especially the 3 sort columns
 used, and I don't see any spaces or anything different about their formatting to cause this..&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need them to sort properly before printing.. and mail merging..&nbsp; WHAT ARE POSSIBLE REASONS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT SORT, MAYBE SOMETHING THAT ISN'T VISIBLE?&nbsp; IS THERE A WAY TO LOOK FOR INVISIBLE REASONS FOR SOMETHING TO NOT SORT?</p>
<p>I just discovered that I presented this question to the wrong forum, so I wasted 2 hours waiting for an answer... I would really appreciate a speedy solution...Thank you in advance...</p>

<div>&gt;Ok, now that makes sense.. the last name on D301 was Goodson.&nbsp; I didn't go below there because those sorted on a different code with no apparent problem..</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;However, I did just try starting the sequence above A 301, so I entered the formula for A299 down thru A305 to see what happened.&nbsp; here are the results.&nbsp; It didn't seem to matter whether I started on 299 300, or 301 only the 1st one came up with M&nbsp; 77
 and the rest came up with the #Value!</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;M77</div>
<div>&gt; #VALUE!</div>
<div>&gt; #VALUE!</div>
<div>&gt; #VALUE!</div>
<div>&gt; #VALUE!</div>
<div>&gt; #VALUE!</div>
<div>&gt; </div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; #VALUE!</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; so I don't know if this tells you anything, or should I just send the file?</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I received your workbook.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Most likely you only entered $A$300</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Had you analyzed $A$301 - $A$305 you would have seen:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>M&nbsp; &nbsp; 77</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 32</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; #VALUE!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>32 is the ASCII code for &lt;space&gt;.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In other words, there is a trailing space after the M in rows A301:A305 which is why they sort AFTER the other M's.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You should investigate how the trailing space got in there, and prevent its recurrence.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you remove it, your sheet should sort properly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Oh, I am in the Eastern time zone.</div>

<br />
Thanks for posting on Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
<span>We're glad to help. We suggest to try performing the following troubleshooting steps below:</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>1. Try connecting to other internet connection or Wi-Fi.</span><br />
<span>2. Check for Windows updates available for your phone.</span><br />
<span>3. Go to Downloads and cancel all the pending downloads.</span><br />
<span>4. </span>You may try to perform a phone soft reset. This method will not remove anything at all from your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situation.<br />
<br />
To perform a soft reset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your phone is turned on.</li><li><span>Press and hold the&nbsp;</span><strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Power</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>buttons
 until your phone vibrates and restarts.</span></li></ul>
<p>Note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After performing a soft reset, &nbsp;wait for 3-5 minutes before trying to download the application again.</span></p>
<p><br />
Keep us posted. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Not via any kind of automated function. Your option would be to edit the Send/Receive options for the email account to remove the receive option and then reset it back when you want to receive emails again</p>
<p>

<h2>            Why do my Bing search results get redirected to some other website not connected to the site I chose&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I do a search on Bing and get the list of websites to check, when I pick one of the websites I get redirected to some other website not even related to what I was looking for and not the website I picked to look at.</p>
<p>I can, for example,&nbsp;do a search for "how to make a compost bin" and get pages of results. I will pick one and end up on a site for some kind of yellow pages or something, and it even has a totally different web address from the one I&nbsp;originally chose!</p>

IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and Restart IE<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still
<br />
installs it and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other
<br />
possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right.
<br />
Permitted are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about
<br />
it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run -
<br />
not all are bad however some can cause your issue (Toolbars are BHO's).<br />

If needed and you suspect malware :<br />
<br />
Check for malware and when you are sure the system is clean run the cleanup.<br />
<br />
Do a thorough check as often this sort of malware is accompanied by a much tougher to detect
<br />
and remove payload. Better to go overboard now rather than pay the price later.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;them
<br />
in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should
<br />
not check with the other methods below.<br />

            <p>Sorry, the macros can't run on your web server, so the presentation has to be downloaded for the VBA to be operational. You could put your presentation on OneDrive, which gives you an
<strong>Open in PowerPoint</strong> button that seamlessly downloads and opens the presentation on the viewer's computer. The user will also have to enable the macros. If they don't, the code will not run.</p>

    <title>Compatibility with 6.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> superdude2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Compatibility with 6.1</h2>
                    Hi all. I am going to get my first WM phone tomorrow and I just had a question about software compatibility. I plan on purchasing the Samsung Omnia so that has WM 6.1, but as I was looking through different websites for free games, most don't list 6.1
 as a possible OS to run the program. Can I just assume that if it only lists up to WinMo 6 that it should work for 6.1? Thanks.<br />
<br />
Also, do you have any recommendations for good websites that have free games?<br />

            I've recently started using a WM6.1 device and have found that most all the software that I've used on WM5.0 devices, and even some software I use on windows mobile 2003 devices, work just fine on the WM6.1 device.&nbsp; I don't think you'll run into too many
 problems installing software that is confirmed to work under WM6.0 on a WM6.1 device.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I really don't play games much on my pocket pcs, so I can't refer you to any websites.<br />

            As Julie said, most software that runs on WM5 and WM6 will run on WM 6.1 - just check if it is compatible with Windows Mobile Professional or Standard. The Omnia is a Windows Mobile Professional device.

<h3> benjaminsanderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            E-mail...from myself&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I received an E-mail from...myself... as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span><span>Dear user of hotmail.ca!<br />
<br />
I am a spyware software developer.<br />
Your account has been hacked by me in the summer of 2018.<br />
<br />
I understand that it is hard to believe, but here is my evidence:<br />
- I sent you this email from your account.<br />
- Password from account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***: boomer (on moment of hack).<br />
<br />
The hacking was carried out using a hardware vulnerability through which you went online (Cisco router, vulnerability CVE-2018-0296).<br />
<br />
I went around the security system in the router, installed an exploit there.<br />
When you went online, my exploit downloaded my malicious code (rootkit) to your device.<br />
This is driver software, I constantly updated it, so your antivirus is silent all time.<br />
<br />
Since then I have been following you (I can connect to your device via the VNC protocol).<br />
That is, I can see absolutely everything that you do, view and download your files and any data to yourself.<br />
I also have access to the camera on your device, and I periodically take photos and videos with you.<br />
<br />
At the moment, I have harvested a solid dirt... on you...<br />
I saved all your email and chats from your messangers. I also saved the entire history of the sites you visit.<br />
<br />
I note that it is useless to change the passwords. My malware update passwords from your accounts every times.<br />
<br />
I know what you like hard funs (adult sites).<br />
Oh, yes .. I'm know your secret life, which you are hiding from everyone.<br />
Oh my God, what are your like... I saw THIS ... Oh, you dirty naughty person ... :)<br />
<br />
I took photos and videos of your most passionate funs with adult content, and synchronized them in real time with the image of your camera.<br />
Believe it turned out very high quality!<br />
<br />
So, to the business!<br />
I'm sure you don't want to show these files and visiting history to all your contacts.<br />
<br />
Transfer $889 to my Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet: 1ARbihuSkEAojNHgxsgFVKjTJDHXuimB8<br />
Just copy and paste the wallet number when transferring.<br />
If you do not know how to do this - ask Google.<br />
<br />
My system automatically recognizes the translation.<br />
As soon as the specified amount is received, all your data will be destroyed from my server, and the rootkit will be automatically removed from your system.<br />
Do not worry, I really will delete everything, since I am 'working' with many people who have fallen into your position.<br />
You will only have to inform your provider about the vulnerabilities in the router so that other hackers will not use it.<br />
<br />
Since opening this letter you have 48 hours.<br />
If funds not will be received, after the specified time has elapsed, the disk of your device will be formatted,<br />
and from my server will automatically send email and sms to all your contacts with compromising material.<br />
<br />
I advise you to remain prudent and not engage in nonsense (all files on my server).<br />
<br />
Good luck!"</span></span></p>

            Hi Benjamin, well done for being suspicious, you would be amazed how many users fall for this! 
<br />
<br />This is a new form of scam, they have somehow accessed some old passwords from  an online source and are trying to extort payment from users
<br />
<br />You can safely bin that Email, rest assured, they do not have access to your data, PC or accounts

            Dear Benjamin,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />This is a new type of scam. But it is better to change the password to more secure as soon as possible, as account might be under hacking attempt.<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026406/microsoft-account-how-to-create-a-strong-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/402640...</a> Also this article is useful <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12410/microsoft-account-how-to-help-keep-your-account-safe-and-secure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12410/...</a>
<br />
<br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users. Recently they invented new way of spoofing your own email address. This is good explained in this (not Microsoft) article <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/10/15/beware-sextortionists-spoofing-your-own-email-address/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/10/15/bew...</a> If you received such an email, report it and just in case change your password to more secure <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026406/microsoft-account-how-to-create-a-strong-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/402640...</a>
<br />
<br />Additionally there are couple of ways to deal with scammers and unwanted emails ( I am sure that you are aware of some and you are using them, but maybe additional information in support articles will help you ):
<br />
<br />1. First of all check your spam filters and see suggestions on how to keep spam out of your inbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a>
<br />2. Report the phishing, spam and unwanted emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />3. Add emails or domains to block sender list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />4. Create specific rules for subjects or common phrases that are present in those emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a>
<br />
<br />Also read this information about fighting junk emails from Postmaster for Outlook <a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a>

<br />
<br />Hope this will help your email free from Junk!

<br />Now I'm calling his bluff, but the thing is, that WAS my password on my old pc. How did he pull this off, sending me emails from me? and finding my old password?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />This is a running scam that has been going on for a while. The most likely source of your email is from compromised databases from websites that have been compromised at some point (could be years ago so that would explain why the password is not current or one that was automatically generated). This could be something you did years ago.
<br />
<br />What you need to do
<br />
<br />#1 - Make sure that you change your password anywhere that the one included i the email has been used
<br />#2 - Do not use the same password twice especially when involving things like credit/card, banking, PayPal, Amazon, Apple, Netflix sites etc etct
<br />#3 - Ignore any demand for payment
<br />
<br />You can check to see if your email address comes up on a compromised database by checking it on the following website (created by a Microsoft MVP so can definitely be trusted)
<br />
<br />';--have i been pwned?
<br /><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a>
<br />
<br />****While the spammer doesn't have access to your email account, they do have access to the password that was used when you subscribed to the compromise database so make &lt;ABSOLUTELY&gt; sure that this isn't a password that is currently being used anywhere as noted above

            Yeah I didn't think they did, and I learned through my own research that they have old credentials from other breaches. What they used right there was either my old neopets account, tumblr or my old myspace.

<br />
<br />Just for the record, HIBP isn't a complete list of what has been compromised. I now have over 125 such emails over the past 2-3 months with varying passwords from secondary places I subscribed to at one point in my life over the years - some of which would be considered "obscure" for the general public which means the hackers are scouring the universe to pick up lists from whereever they can - both major and minor sites. Fortunately I use a password manager so can go back and check all of this stuff and  make any necessary corrections accordingly - a PITA but a necessary one.

<p>
</p><p>Need help in creating Excel macro to change the font color based on the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blue: Hard-coded values (text or numbers)</p>
<p>Green: Direct link from same worksheet (=A25)</p>
<p>Black: Formulas (example: =VLOOKUP; =sum(B1:B25))</p>
<p>Purple: Link from another worksheet in the same file (example: =Sheet2!D20)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, how to set-up this macro in Excel?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for the help!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey Andreas... I managed to set-up the macro... but for formulas like (E10*E15) or (A1/A2) instead of color changing to BLACK (as black is for formulas) the color changes to "green".
</p>
<p>I just wanted green for direct link i.e if I wanted the value of cell A10 to appear in B10 then in B10 I will type (=A10). Please help!&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Rodolph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your inquiry, Skype Names cannot be changed. </p>
<p>As a workaround, you can either <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA110/how-do-i-change-my-skype-display-name?ps=chang?q=display+name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">change your display name</span></a></strong><strong>

</strong>using an email address. Remember, accounts created using an email address will have a system-generated Skype Name which will show as
<strong>live:whatevercomesbefore@</strong>. </p>

    <title>Temporary files showing 0 bytes even though uch files are present in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jashjoshi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Temporary files showing 0 bytes even though uch files are present in phone.</h2>
                    <p>I am using Lumia 640XL. Today when I opened storage sense to see the memory allocation of my phone there were 840 MB free storage space in my phone and Temporary files were showing 0Bytes of files. But still I went to the temporary file section and press
 delete temporary files button. It took some time. But in fact it should have not even a moment as it was showing 0Bytes of Temporary files. After that when i saw the free space in my phone it bumped to 1.24GB. I am not able to understand why it is not showing
 the size of temporary files. Same issue is faced by my Brother who is using Lumia 525.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this OS problem? Or It is happening in everyone's phone.</p>

            <p>Hi JashJoshi</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>First it is NOT a problem and most definitely do NOT... NOT! hard reset your phone</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This area is NOT accessible by any File Manager as Android is hence zero bytes</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are temporary files created by the phone and phone applications so can be deleted</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should look at STORAGE SENSE in conjunction with STORAGE CHECK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting Temporary files free up those temporary files, allocated here. When you clear Temporary Files in Storage Check, some data is cleared also,
<strong>however when you delete Browsing History in Internet Explorer, that reduces the Temporary Data there</strong> when you check the value after deletion, but does not delete Browsing History when you press clear here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These temporary files do take up storage space, so when deleted your free space is increased, but this is system data, you could not store music / jpegs' here</p>
        </p>
