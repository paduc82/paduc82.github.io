<h2>            Can&#39;t view, send or receive messages. Please assist.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p><p>For the past month I have been unable to view send or receive messages on my Xbox One Console. Here's what I have done so far.</p><p>1. Hard Reset Xbox Console by pressing and holding down the power button.</p><p>2. Factory Reset Xbox One console</p><p>3. Reset Internet Connection</p><p>4. Contact @XboxSupport via twitter.</p><p>For step 4. I received minimum aid from Xbox Support below is the entire message conversation for your records:</p><p><strong>Nov 26</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mark Martin (Crow)</strong><br />This message is for XboxSupport to help assist and fixing my issue with send Messages via my Xbox One Console. The request was for my gamertag = Crow</p>

<p><strong>Xbox Support</strong><br />Thanks for the info. Just to try something really quick, go ahead and remove: <a href="http://xbx.lv/1kQseEQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbx.lv/1kQseEQ</a> &nbsp;your profile from the console and then &gt; power cycle <a href="http://xbx.lv/1ylg26E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbx.lv/1ylg26E</a> &nbsp;the console. Then sign back in and let us know if you can send a message? Also, do you know if you have viewed all your messages? ^JL</p>

<p><strong>Mark Martin (Crow)</strong><br />I am in the process of adding my account back now<br />I haven't been able to see my messages at all for the past 2 week</p>

<p><strong>Xbox Support</strong><br />Thanks for that! The proper teams are currently looking into this. If you see any changes on your end please let us know. &nbsp;^RR</p>

<p><strong>Mark Martin (Crow)</strong><br />I have logged back in and still cannot view messages<br />Same endless ring</p>

<p><strong>Xbox Support</strong><br />Got it. Since the proper teams are looking into this here that is not necessary but you can let us know how it goes. Could you also let us know if you are able to send messages from the Xbox app on your mobile device? ^IS</p>

<p><strong>Mark Martin (Crow)</strong><br />I can't send messages on my mobile device either. Here is a screenshot from my mobile device.<br />Also here is the new message on my Xbox One console. This occurred after I completely master reset my Xbox One Console and the did a Hard Reset before signing back in with my Xbox account.<br />I can see my messages on <a href="http://Xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://Xbox.com</a> &nbsp;I am apart of the Xbox Preview program, which I think entitles me to try out the latest dashboard updates first. This started to occur once I updated my dashboard to the latest version.</p>

<p><strong>Xbox Support</strong><br />Thanks for that info. We will make sure to update you with any updates when they are available. Hope you have a great one. &nbsp;^IS</p><p><a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPICg5ODor9AjKMhvwWB7AJnABQlbyWK8p4x9J4fw14Cfp68q-ydv3I63FUaIB9wA?key=bk9taGR6UWNGdWgxelhZeGpSMTFRZERsZWNOd3B3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Video of my messages section on Xbox One Console</a><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Please assist as this is making for an extremely bad experience for me on Xbox.</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Finding a Purchased Redemption Code and Using It</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased an online code for HomeFront so i can play online as my code had been used, so i bought another one from xbox live. All is good so far, i downloaded it, and then i could not find it again. I saw in my recently downloaded items that it had been
 downloaded so i downloaded it again, but i still cant find it.</p>
<p>I tried playing the game but then it asks me to purchase a code or insert my code, obviously i cant do either as i cant find my code. I thought the game might know that i just bought a code and let me thru without asking? But it wont. So i checked my emails
 and nothing in there, just an email confirming my 100 points i bought to use partly with for the code. So where is my code gone? Ive looked everywhere and cant find it.</p>
<p>Please HELP!!!</p>

<p>When you purchase this access on the Marketplace, you don't get a code, you just get the access attributed to your account. Check in the Memory for this file (System Settings &gt; Memory &gt; [storage device] &gt; Games &gt; Homefront). Do you see anything there that
 looks right? Try deleting and redownloading it. Complete instructions can be found in our Downloading Sticky.

<h2>            Can&#39;t log in to home computer due to security policy setting to show last interactive login info &#42;Solution&#42;</h2>
                    <p>My single user home computer is running Windows 10, upgraded about 6 months ago from 8.1. A few days ago I typed my password and hit enter. A message appeared below the password entry field stating:<br />
<br />
<span>“Security policies on this computer are set to display information about the last interactive logon. Windows could not retrieve this information. Please contact your network administrator for assistance.”</span></p>
<span>“Security policies on this computer are set to display information about the last interactive logon. Windows could not retrieve this information. Please contact your network administrator for assistance.”</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>My first attempt at finding an answer via Google didn't turn up too much. I had an online chat with Microsoft support. They had me run start up repair which did not resolve the issue. The tech suggested starting in safe mode but when I tried I got message
 stating the change could not be applied, please wait, configuring, etc. Then she suggested restoring from a save point. Uh oh, no save points. Apparently, this feature is off by default in Win10 and I never checked it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended the chat and tried to do some troubleshooting on my own. I managed to get into safe mode and created a new account which enabled me to log in. After selecting the account, a log in history screen displayed showing this was the first log in of this
 account. It's the first time I ever saw this screen after logging in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found instructions for resetting a user profile by editing registry values (RefCount and State) for the account entry in ProfileList, but that didn't resolve the issue either. After further Googling I discovered that an option exists that can be set by
 group policy to display log in history. Since this is a single user computer running Win10 Home Edition, the group policy editor doesn't exist so it's nothing I changed. Another Google search and I found a reference to the registry key that controls this option
 which is located in:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The value of <strong>DisplayLastLogonInfo</strong> was set to 1. I set the value to 0 and restarted. I was then able to log in to the "corrupted" account. I have no idea how the value got set to 1. I looked at the update history for Microsoft maintenance.
 Cumulative maintenance was applied on 4/13/2016, several weeks <strong>before </strong>
my log in issue appeared. The next cumulative maintenance was applied on 5/14/2016,
<strong>after </strong>I resolved the log in issue. So how the registry change occurred is a mystery. Hope this helps someone since Microsoft tech support seemed to have no clue and it was not easy to track down all the information needed to resolve it.</p>
<p>

            Really useful and seems to have worked for me. I have no idea what happened to changed the value to 1 but when I set it to 0, I logged on normally. Worrying. You miss out how to log in to change this value when it will not let you log in in the first place.
 Elsewhere I discovered that disconnecting from the LAN, in my case ethernet, enabled me to log in.

</p><p>Now almost a month since my previous post. Same procedure every login still works:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Disconnect the network cable before login.</li><li>Log in</li><li>Reconnect the network cable</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Not other solution known yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also quite funny - subscribed to this thread in order to one day hopefully get a more elegant solution. Got an email today informing me of Rielramos's reply. Guess what happens when I click on the link in the email?&nbsp; Error message "Your organization's policies
 are preventing us from completing this action for you. For more info, please contact your help desk" Workaround - copy the link and paste it in a browser. What tangled webs we weave!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only do I now have an administrator, I also have policies and a helpdesk. My organization keeps on growing! Thanks Microsoft.<br />

<p>The issue has just happened to my laptop which is running on Windows 10 Home. I don't know how it happens. At first, I've turned off the WiFi connection and the error message doesn't appear for the moment. When I've successfully logged on the system, I've
 edited the system registry on the way as you advised. It works! Thanks for your great help.</p>

            Turning off the WiFi connection can solve the issue temporarily. You must repeat the same process when logging on the system every time. You should edit the system registry as the post suggested to have the annoying issue be solved permanently.

<h2>            How to control and limit online access for a child&#39;s adult account on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My son made his own Microsoft account using a fake birth date. He did this to work around the parental restrictions on his Xbox one account along with his Windows accounts. I don't want him to lose the Xbox one account name, or the names he uses for his
 Microsoft accounts, but I want to be able to control his online limitations. Is there a way to do this without deleting his account and losing every username he has?</p>

    <title>Cannot use the microsoft store. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> niko.g  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot use the microsoft store.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, so I got a PC about a year ago and set up a wired connection. I thought it was odd because despite being connected to the internet I've always had the little symbol in the corner telling me I've got no internet connection. Now I definately do because
 I'm using it right now to write this. </p>
<p>I had signed up for the Age of Empires beta and found that when I tried to download the neccessary applications I was greeted with "See "available on" below for devices that this product runs on. It won't run on this one". I tried signing into the store
 on my microsoft account and it says that I'm offline. I have no idea what to do about this, because I have internet and my PC just thinks I don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have to install windows 10 on the PC manually, so if there's something that may have gone wrong I do still have the usb. I know that a few months ago I had to use that usb because my PC had not installed the .Net framework.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really annoying because I want to buy Age of Empires but I can't because the stupid system thinks I'm offline, steam and everything else works fine, but I feel like the streamlined nature of microsofts apps these days leads to so many stupid issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really would appreciate some help here, I can't find any answers on the internet anywhere.</p>

<p>You can also see how in the bottom right corner it says I don't have a connection to the internet, which isn't true. If I go into my network settings it says I have an ethernet cable in, which is what I'm using to recieve internet. I don't have a wifi card.</p>

<p>Thank you for the screenshot you've provided. Error code <strong>0x80072F30 </strong>
is associated with the Windows Store and is an error that basically inhibits the Windows Store from launching successfully. Error code
<strong>0x80072F30</strong> can be caused by anything from a stopped Windows Update service to a corrupted Windows Store cache or anything in between. Here are some of the most effective solutions that you should try in order to resolve error code 0x80072F30
 and regain your ability to successfully open the Windows Store:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Set the right time, date and time zone on your</strong> <strong>
computer</strong><br />
<br />
1. Open <strong>Start </strong>menu. Click on <strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
2. Click on <strong>Time &amp; Language</strong>. Disable the <strong>Set time automatically</strong>. Set the right time and date.<br />
3. Don’t forget to configure the right time zone on your computer on your way out. Save all of your new settings.<br />
4. Restart your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Make sure that the Windows Update service starts automatically</strong><br />
<br />
1. Press the <strong>Windows </strong>key + <strong>R </strong>to open a <strong>
Run</strong>. Type <strong>services.msc</strong> into the Run dialog and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.<br />
2. Scroll down the list of services until you locate the <strong>Windows Update</strong>. If the Windows Update service is not running, right-click on it and click on start to actually start the service.<br />
3. Right-click on the <strong>Windows Update</strong> service again. This time, click on
<strong>Properties</strong>. Open the drop-down menu in front of the Startup type option and select
<strong>Automatic</strong>. Click on <strong>Apply </strong>and <strong>OK </strong>
on your way out. Restart your computer. If it still won’t work after the Reboot, repeat the same steps for the Windows Store service.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Reset the Windows Store’s cache</strong><br />
<br />
1. Press the <strong>Windows </strong>key + <strong>R </strong>to open a Run. Type
<strong>wsreset.exe</strong> into the Run dialog and press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
2. Restart your computer.<br />

<p>I've tried all of these solutions and nothing has changed. I did say that if you look at the images posted you can see that it says I'm not connected to the internet. Scrolling over the icon it says "Not connected - No connections available". I have been
 using the internet on this PC for over a year now. The symbol in the bottom right corner has always been there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that Windows thinks I don't have a connection is clearly why it's not working. No windows services work, the Xbox app is an example of another windows program that doesn't work, which is why a solution strictly for the windows store won't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that my PC thinks it's offline.</p>

<p>None of these solutions worked, not to any surprise. The issue is that the computer thinks it's offline, despite having an internet connection. I am writing this on the computer that is "offline". Microsoft products have an ecosystem of sorts and it seems
 taht rather than just coneecting to the internet, the apps are just asking my PC if it has internet first, to which it replies "No". None of these solutions would work because they are for when you don't have internet, I do have internet but mt PC doesnt realise
 that. This weird problem only affects microsoft apps, such as the store, gamehub, media player etc.<br />
</p>
<p>There's no way I can just buy from the website either, it always links me to the app which won't let me purchase anything.

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Kindly follow quick and easy way of transferring files from  iPad to PC with iTunes: 
<br />
<br />1. Connect your iPad to your computer. Plug one end of your iPad's charging cable into one of the computer's USB ports, then plug the other end of the cable into your iPad's charging port.
<br />
<br />2. Open iTunes on your computer. Its app icon resembles a multicolored musical note on a white background.
<br />If iTunes prompts you to update it, click Download iTunes on the prompt and then restart your computer after the update completes.
<br />
<br />3. Click the "Device" icon. It's an iPad-shaped button in the upper-left side 
<br />
<br />4. Click File Sharing. This tab is on the far-left side of the iTunes window in the "[Your Name]'s iPad" section. Doing so brings up a list of apps that store files on your iPad.
<br />
<br />5. Select an app. In the column of apps in the middle of the iTunes window, click an app to which you want to add a file. The file type doesn't necessarily have to correspond to the app (for example, you could add a Microsoft Word file to the iMovie folder).
<br />
<br />Apple's Pages, Keynote, Numbers, iMovie, and GarageBand apps all have folders for saved projects on your iPad, meaning that you can use them to store literally any file type.
<br />
<br />6. Scroll down and click Add File…. This button is in the lower-right side of the page. Doing so will open your computer's File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac).
<br />
<br />7. Select a file. Click the file that you want to add to your iPad to select it. You may first have to go to the file's folder location by clicking the appropriate folder on the left side of the window.
<br />
<br />8. Click Open. It's in the bottom-right corner of the window. You should see the file's name appear in the app's window in iTunes.
<br />
<br />9. Click Sync. This button is in the lower-right side of the iTunes window. Doing so will add the file to your selected app on the iPad. At this point, you can open the file on your iPad at any time, even if you aren't connected to the Internet.
<br />
<br />You can click Done after the sync completes to return to the main page.
<br />
<br />Kindly refer this site for more ways like iCloud:

<h2>            Slow Internet ONLY on my PC, everything else is fine.</h2>
                    <p>The Internet on my PC'S is running extremely slow and this is only happening to my computer and no one else's devices in my house (normally I have speeds of 700-800kb/s but at the moment I'm only getting 5.6kb/s). I've tried running virus scans, turn off
 a bunch of stuff and tried troubleshooting but I can seem to find an answer anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if someone has any idea about what on earth I'm meant to do to fix this that would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t play certain maps on Black ops&#33;....Help&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason whenever i play online i cannot play a handful of maps. why is this happening? it will allow me to get all the way to the map loading page but then the loading bar will get almost to the end and stop then the loading spinning circle happens
 for minutes after that and i have to go all the way back to the dashboard to play again. I would really appreciate an answer from someone FAST!</p>

<p>Can you try a different memory device, to see if that resolves your issue? I suggest using a USB drive configured for use with Xbox 360.</p>

    <title>Miracast stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Miracast stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is Dell XPS 15 installed Windows 10 Pro build 1703. Miracast used to be working, until today. It can still see that device, but cannot connect to it. I tried to remove the remove display and add it again, but it's not helping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to use my Android device to connect to the display and it worked which proves the remove display is working. So I think the problem is Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea?</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several factors that might cause this concern. For isolation purposes, we advise that you roll back the video graphics driver of your computer and check if the issue persists. You may refer to the steps below on how to roll back the driver of your
 computer:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the device for which you want to roll back to the previous version of the driver, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Drivers</strong> tab.</li><li>Click <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong>.</li><li>In the Driver Package roll back dialog box, click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result and if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

<p>My laptop has two graphic cards: Intel 630 and Nvidia GTX 1050, which one should I rollback?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I clearly remember I was able to connect to my Miracast display a couple of days ago, and there were no driver update or Windows update happened in the last few days. Not that I noticed.</p>

<p>Since Miracast will use a wireless connection, let's deal with your wireless adapter. To troubleshoot your concern, we suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the wireless adapter driver on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we recommend that you download the updated driver for your computer from the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do update us with the outcome and if you need further assistance.</p>

</p><p>Hi Gina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues with Miracast are usually resolved <span>by installing the latest drivers for your PC and the latest firmware for your wireless display or Miracast adapter. To update firmware on your wireless display or adapter, go to the Support section of the manufacturer's
 website, search on your specific device, and follow their instructions to download and install that firmware. You can also check the Windows Store to see if there’s an app from the manufacturer of your wireless display or Miracast adapter that updates firmware.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And, we would also suggest that you try performing the suggested troubleshooting steps on this thread and check if it works for you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards.</span></p>

            Unfortunately, you will have to right click each contact then click View Profile &gt; scroll to the bottom then click Delete contact, you can also report it as abuse at the same time.
<br />
<br />    Sign in to your account in the Skype website.
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com</a>
<br />    Scroll down and click Edit profile.
<br />    Scroll down to Profile settings then disable discoverability
<br />
<br />This will ensure only trusted contacts communicate with you.

<p>Hypothetically speaking, it can. But such an update was not made yet (or atleast public) So currently there is no way to obtain a Dashboard similar to the Xbox One's.

<h2>            Where are &#34;File &#38; Folder Tasks&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    On Windows XP, in My Pictures, the File and Folder Tasks menu, included 'Move this folder/file' and 'Copy this folder/file' options that were invaluable, not to mention critical&nbsp;in organizing pictures. Moving photos from folder to folder was&nbsp;simple and
 efficient.<br />
Where is it on Windows 7? When I right-click on&nbsp; a file, there is a 'copy' option, but when I click on it nothing happens. There is no 'move 'option<br />
Can someone help? Thanks.

            After clicking Copy just navigate to the folder where you want to paste these files and press Ctrl+V or right click and choose Paste.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
About mentioned options 'Move this folder/file' and 'Copy this folder/file'. I don't even remember such a thing. Maybe because I have never use it. But..<br />

    <title>Very specific Elite Controller vibration question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b stanners  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very specific Elite Controller vibration question</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
OK, this question might not make any sense but I feel like I need to ask it somewhere. So I love the elite controller and its functionality. A few months back I replaced my old one (from 2016/2017 or so?) which had the grips peeling off and some stick drift
 with a new one. I primarily play PUBG. I've noticed with the replacement controller, at least for PUBG, the same vibration numbers in-game don't correspond to the same level of vibration of my older elite controller. For example, if I put the vibration to
 10 on the old one, I would feel the trigger vibrating strongly - so I had it on 4.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
But with the newer controller, I have the in-game vibration on 10, and it's definitely not vibrating as much as the old one did on 4. I can tell because I would not have that in-game vibration on 10 if it were the same and definitely not want to raise it further.
 I've checked the Xbox Accessories App and I haven't reduced the max trigger vibration from the max or made any adjustments at all. I've tested the batteries and it's not a low battery thing, the same batteries in the new controller put in the old controller
 produce the high vibration.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
Do I have a defective controller? It's not the biggest deal although it would be nice to have it higher and it's bugging me more than anything&nbsp;</p>

            Not totally sure about it, but the accessories have 90 day to redeem the warranty. So, if you think your controller is defective, then, you should take it from were you buyed. I also, recommend you to ask a friend with a new elite controller if he has
 a strong or mild vibration.&nbsp;

<p>Thinking about it it may be slightly older than I think by a few months and outside the warranty. When I first got it it the vibration was low but I guess I didn't take action because I assumed there was something in-app I needed to adjust or some different
 batteries I needed because why would it be different?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not unusable or anything, so I guess I'll keep it until the new Elite Controller comes out.</p>

            Hi Vipinthakur1 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It usually takes only seconds or minutes for Skype Credit to appear in your balance after making a purchase, but occasionally it can take longer. Try the following:
<br />
<br />First, ensure that your order has been Delivered. Sign in to your account (<a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/account/</a>) and click Show purchase history. You can see the order number and the status (e.g. Pending, Delivered).
<br />
<br />Next, check that your Skype Credit balance is positive. You may need to sign out of Skype for the balance to refresh. Select your profile picture &gt; Sign Out, and then sign in again.
<br />
<br />Note that simply closing the Skype application and restarting again is not the same as signing out. That won't actually refresh your balance.
<br />
<br />Finally, attempt to place a call. In some cases where a balance has not updated after a purchase, making a call can force the update. If your order has been delivered, the call will connect and your balance will then update.
<br />
<br />If you still experience problems calling....
<br />
<br />I recommend you contact chat support and choose Technical problem so an agent can help diagnose whats the problem with your account:

<h2>            pdf thumbnail view in edge&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the features I rely on in the soon to be retired Windows PDF Reader is the automatic tiled thumbnail view on zoom out. This is crucial for being able to jump to another page, e.g. index of the book or paper being read. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What seems more common in other applications (including Edge/Adobe DC/Sumatra etc) is a
<span>strip of thumbnails which is pretty much useless as it requires extensive scrolling.&nbsp;
<span>strip of thumbnails which is pretty much useless as it requires extensive scrolling.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The only two applications that do tiles that I know are Reader and Adobe Touch.
</span><span>The latter won't allow pen annotations, so once Reader is no more I won't be able to read and annotate at once as allowed by reader.</span></p>
<p><span>Any thoughts on how to turn on better thumbnails in Edge? it's a pretty good reader otherrwise.</span></p>
<p><span>thanks,v</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

<h2>            0xc00007b Error occur when i start any game on my Laptop</h2>
                    <p>I recently instralled "<strong>Just cause 2</strong>" it was instralled properly but when i tried to run it, it gave me the error "<strong>JustCause2.exe-Application error</strong>" "This application was unable to start correctly<strong>(0xc00007b)</strong>.
 Clock OK to close the application". I tried as much as i ould. I reinstralled my windows (i am using
<strong>windows 8.1</strong>) and then reinstralled the game but it didn't work out. I tried to instrall other games but they also gave same error.
<strong>Kindly Tell me the Solution</strong>. I shall be very thankful to you.</p>

            <span>Hi Arham,<br />
<br />
1. Does the issue occur only when you open the games?<br />
2. Are you able to open and use all the other programs?<br />
3. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
This issue might occurred due to some third party program or some system file corrupt.
<br />
<br />
If the issue occurs with all the applications, then I would suggest you to start the computer into safe mode. Safe mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the
 default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes. I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists. Refer this link to boot the computer in safe mode:<br />

<br />
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the issue still persists, then the issue also could be due to some third party program causing the issue. Clean boot will
</span><span>eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict
 is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

    <title>Season Pack Dragonball Xenoverse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> inspecthrgadget  say:</h3>
<h2>            Season Pack Dragonball Xenoverse</h2>
                    
<p>i've bought the season pack for the retail xbox one version of Dragonball Xenoverse.</p>
<p>After succesfully downloading and installing, I can seem to find the dlc in-game. &nbsp;None of the extra characters are shown in the roster, no new quests are available, ...</p>
<p>I've already contacted NamcoBandai but they said it's the platform (xbox) store that's the problem!</p>
<p>I would like a solution to this problem, because now I've paid $24,99 for something that doesn't work.</p>
<p>I have already removed my account from my system and logged in again. &nbsp;I've also uninstalled the game and the dlc and re-installed that, but it had no effect.</p>
<p>Please help!!!!</p>
