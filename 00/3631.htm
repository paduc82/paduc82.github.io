    <title>Insider Build Install messed up drive letters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chiefzeke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insider Build Install messed up drive letters</h2>
                    <p>Have a multi-boot system: XP Pro x64 w/SP2, Windows 7 Ultimate w/SP1 v6.01 Build 7601.23807, Windows 10 Pro v1703 Build 15063.447 (Upgraded 8.1), and Windows 10 Pro v1703 Insider Preview Build 16232.1000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer setup has two hard drives divided into four partitions each, as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk 1: Primary Partition = C:\, Extended partition/Logical drives = E:\, F:\, G:\.<br />
Disk 2: Primary Partition = D:\, Extended partition/Logical drives = H:\, I:\, J:\.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Labels for these partitions (As shown in Win7 w/SP1 and Win10 (upgrade 8.1) &gt; Admin Tools &gt; Computer Management &gt; Disk Management):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name 01 - C:\ - Boot<br />
Name 02 - D:\ - Win10 Insider 64<br />
Name 03 - E:\ - Media Stuff<br />
Name 04 - F:\ - Originals<br />
Name 05 - G:\ - Slipstreaming<br />
Name 06 - H:\ - Win 7 w/SP1<br />
Name 07 - I:\ - Win 10 update 8.1<br />
Name 08 - J:\ - XP Pro x64 w/SP2</p>
<p>
</p><p>My original problem was posted her: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/fails-to-update-16226-to-16232/fb2c16fa-794a-4df1-811a-ff0a1664ff7a">

<p>
</p><p>Having no recommended solution I used the Build 16193 ISO to burn a DVD. I then reformatted "D:\Win10 Insider 64" and rebooted the computer. The system booted from the DVD and I selected a Custom Install to "D:\Win10 Insider 64". There were no installation
 problems but drive problems were noticed. I then allowed Windows Update to download and install Insider Preview Build 16232.1000, which installed with no problems noted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive problems I noticed were that the Custom Install resulted in the drives letters being changed, as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name 01 - Now D:\ - Boot<br />
Name 02 - Now C:\ - Win10 Insider 64<br />
Name 03 - Now G:\ - Media Stuff<br />
Name 04 - Now H:\ - Originals<br />
Name 05 - Now I:\ - Slipstreaming<br />
Name 06 - Now J:\ - Win7 w/SP1<br />
Name 07 - Now K:\ - Win 10 update 8.1<br />
Name 08 - Now L:\ - XP Pro x64 w/SP2</p>
<p>What happened to letters E:\ and F:\ and why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did an online search and found this website: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/79064-change-assign-drive-letter-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/79064-change-assign-drive-letter-windows-10-a.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The web site above has four options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I scrolled down to option four and I found 'To Change Drive Letter in Registry Editor' and read the procedure - this, to me, seems to make the most sense as I would want to only change the drive letters for the drives as listed in Win10 Insider Preview -
 not for the other operating systems. I also concluded that changing Insider Preview's C:\ to D:\ and D:\ to C:\ would not be a good idea because of the already installed software and its installed location - more than likely the system would not boot to Insider
 Preview either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, does anyone know how to do a Custom install to a drive/partition of the user's choice without the install routine arbitrarily changing drive letters?</p>

            You are correct, it switched my DVD &amp; storage partition. I used Disk Management ( the MS partition tool) and swapped drive letters back and then hard reboot for Registry to update itself.

<p>The drive letters assigned to the partitions during a clean install of an OS are completely independent of any other OS in a multi-boot situation. This need not matter but it is convenient to rearrange the drive letters so that they are the same for each
 OS. I find it useful to incorporate the drive letter I want to use into the name of the partition. Hence O-W7 OS, P-W10 Insider and Q-W10 Local. The letter C cannot be used as this is automatically assigned to whichever OS is active (booted). To change the
 drive letters, use Disc Management and right click on the partition to be changed. Select 'Change drive letter and paths'.&nbsp; This needs to be done for each OS.</p>

<p>You are incorrect - drive C:\ is not sacrosanct - go back and check my listings - Drive C:\ is shown as&nbsp;Boot and&nbsp;XP Pro is on J:\, Win7 on H:\, Win10 (upgrade 8.1) on K:\ and Insider on D:.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The letters stayed this way no matter which operating system I had booted into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive letters changed during the install of Insider Preview - I've been installing things this way for at least 15 years.</p>

            This is the 1st time I've seen an install change logical drive letters. In my case I had to temporarily assign the DVD drive letter E: (which the install changed to F:) so that I could re-assign my partition to F: (the letter F was originally&nbsp;omitted to
 avoid conflict in the choice menu- the DVD was change to F during install), then I could re-assign the DVD drive letter D. In your case it looks like the change took a linear approach and the E: &amp; F: may have been a conflict at that time.

<p>I followed the instructions in option four 'To Change Drive Letter in Registry Editor' and I got E:\ and F:\ back and the drives in Insider Preview are now listed as:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name 01 - Now D:\ - Boot<br />

<p>

            I admit I didn't read what your problem is very thoroughly, but I can say this: Windows is notorious for "renaming" drives and partitions, and when a Windows OS is installed, or recovery safemode options used, or restore is used or some other innocent
 action is taken, etc etc..it can turn out ugly because the OS resides on a partition that is.. apart from the "MFT" (which is where it actually boots from, as you know I'm sure)and it's even more perilous if you multiboot with linux or run Live Distros too
 blah blah yada yada but aside from all that the most important thing to know is that when you go changing (or restoring..)drive letters for whatever reason, Windows likes to screw things up at times by marking those same partitions and/or drives you just tried
 to rename back to normal as "Raw" &nbsp;or "unformatted" and then it's hell trying to get everything back. Over the past 20 years I've had this happen many times, and used Testdisk or GParted and Linux to recover my data and restore my par

            Oh and for what it's worth, it's a fairly safe move if you just put the desired drive letter as part of your drive name (by right clicking the drive and choosing "rename"...;) ...)and let Windows name it whatever damn letter it wants..for example..actually
 renaming your Drive 04 F:\Originals to "Drive 04 F Originals" or something such as that...it's not beautiful but it works when Windows jacks everything up. Just a thought.

<p>Circumstances intervened - as they sometimes do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Continuing to research the problem I found that I had active partitions on drives C:\ and D:\ and (System) was&nbsp;
</p>
<p>also on D:\. More research, as I knew having two active partitions was not the norm and this (System) label was
</p>
<p>new to me. I then learned that (System) was now normal and would be on an active partition but not necessarily
</p>
<p>the boot partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More checking and I found that I had boot files on C:\ and D:\ (Boot.BAK, boot.ini, Boot.ini.saved, bootmgr,
</p>
<p>bootnxt,bootsect.bak - there my be others I missed - have no idea). I'm assuming here that those on D:\ were
</p>
<p>created during the DVD install of Win10 Insider Preview Build 16193 and the reason i had become a victim of the
</p>
<p>drive letters changing and the ones on C:\ were allowing me the ability to boot to Win7 Win10 (upgrade 8.1) and
</p>
<p>XP Pro x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also a user of EasyBCD 2.3.0 207 and I did notice it has an a BCD Backup/Repair button that leads to BCD
</p>
<p>Management Options &gt; Re-Create/repair boot files and Change boot drive. Reading their instructions and using
</p>
<p>Google I determined that I could probably reformat D:\, and remove the active feature of drive D:\. But how to
</p>
<p>move (System) to C:\ - I had no idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I had corrupted one operating system: Win10 (upgraded 8.1) - so I spent time reinstalling
</p>
<p>Win8.1 and a multitude of updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalling Win8.1 without having drive letter problems lead me to believe I could try again to install
</p>
<p>Insider Preview, also Build 16232 ISO was released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I burned the Build 16232 ISO to a DVD, opened "MiniTool Partition Wizard", selected drive D:\, made it
</p>
<p>'inactive', refornmatted the drive, tried to install Build 16232 - failed - said I had a UEFI system and needed
</p>
<p>GPT partitions - WTF? Opted to reboot the system and successfully started Win7 (and later 8.1 and XP). Did
</p>
<p>notice that (System) was&nbsp;on C:\ and D:\ was no longer 'active'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next test is to try Win10 Insider Preview Build 16232 again, am hesitant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Show Time:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booted to Win8.1 &gt; selected \Souces folder &gt; setup.exe on copy of Build 16232 DVD for Custom Installation on
</p>
<p>drive D:\ - which was successful - drive letters were not changed and everything is back to the way I want
</p>
<p>them. Build update to 16241.1001 also successful.</p>
<p>I must assume here that the problem was created by having two active partitions and having (System) on drive
</p>
<p>D:\</p>

            <p>That's by design. Here is a workaround:</p>
<p>In the Form_Open set the timer to 1 msec:</p>
<p>Me.TimerInterval = 1</p>
<p>In the Form_Timer event set:</p>
<p>Me.TimerInterval = 0&nbsp; 'stop the timer<br />
MsgBox "Eureka!"</p>
<p>The reason this works is that Timer is a low-priority event, and it happens after all other events are settling down.</p>

                    During a Security Essentials full system scan, Exploit:Java?CVE-2013-0422 was found and quarantined.&nbsp; The recommended action is to remove it, but when I try to do that, I get the error message "The RPC Server is unavailable"&nbsp; error code: 0x800706ba.&nbsp; How

</span>is a malicious <span>Java</span> applet that attempts to exploit that vulnerability (<span><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0422" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CVE-2013-0422</a></span>) in the
<span>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</span>, in order to download and install files of an attacker’s choice onto your computer.
<span><span>This Exploit can be </span></span>loaded onto your system whenever you visit a website containing the malicious code
<u>while using a vulnerable version of the </u><span><u>Java plugin</u>.</span></p>
<p>Note, however, that a number of legitimate websites could be compromised or unwillingly host a malicious applet through advertising frames which could redirect to or host a malicious
<span>Java</span> applet.</p>
<p>Please also note that this detection may be triggered when you visit a website that contains the malicious code,
<u>even if you are not using a vulnerable version of the </u><span><u>JRE</u>.</span> This detection may be reported when you visit a website that contains the malicious code, and this does not mean that you have been compromised, but rather that an attempt
 to compromise your computer has been made.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In order to help avoid potential threat exploits like this, MS would surely recommend you keep, not only Windows and IE, but every third-party software always up-to-date. In the case of the Java software, however, it's a known-ongoing issue, that even at
 the latest and current version of the Java plugin <u>you might be still at risk</u>.
<br />
Please see &gt; <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/malware-and-vulnerabilities/21883/there-are-dozen-known-flaws-java" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
There are a dozen known flaws in Java</a> (by Michael Horowitz about the JRE v7u17)<br />
<br />
Since 'This pattern of new flaws being discovered <em>immediately </em>after the release of a new version of Java has been the rule rather than the exception', I would do as most recommended by many reputable security researchers: If you don't need it, stay
 away from it! <br />
Would suggest you do as follows:<br />
- <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260897/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Delete the Contents of your Temporary Internet Files Folder</a><br />
- <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/plugin_cache.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Clear your Java Cache</a><br />
- <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/uninstall.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Remove ALL VERSIONS of the Java Plugin</a> from your Control Panel, AND DO NOT reinstall it back!<br />
- <span>Then, reboot the OS and run a full system scan with MSE. <br />
<br />
Would also suggest you download, install, update its database and run a full scan of
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Malwarebytes Anti-Malware</a> (FREE-Edition <i>ONLY!</i> -&gt; Not the 'Trial' not the 'Pro' versions).
</span><br />
<span><span><i><br />
- </i><u><i>Recommendation:</i></u> If you find out later on that you 'genuinely need' to continuously visit</span></span><span><span><span><span> a 'legitimate website'
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>(for example, your banking website might legitimately use a Java applet) that requires Java to display their content properly, you can always reinstall it (obviously the latest and current version) back from
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Java.com</a>. Enable it <i>only</i> on an alternate 'updated' browser of your choice, which to be used for you to visit those Java-based website(s)
<i>only!</i> And stick to your default Java-disabled main browser for everything else.</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
Please note that this 'story' may continue as long as Oracle don't 'really' fix it (if ever). Their patching is not working completely and/or new holes are almost immediately discovered and exploited (or attempted to) by the bad guys. Here you have some info
 regarding issues pending 'real' resolution &gt; <a href="http://www.security-explorations.com/en/SE-2012-01-status.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Security Explorations - SE-2012-01 - Status Report</a>.<br />
<br />
Further, to help MSE to help you protect your system against these and other threats, please always remember that...<br />
- The Windows Firewall should be ON (enabled) at all times,<br />
- The User Account Control (UAC) must be always ON and not running with elevated privileges.<br />
- You never click on links from unknown sources, and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.<br />
- You never open unsolicited e-mail attachments, even if it 'seems' to come from a known contact.<br />
- The best protection you'll ever have, is not your AV, it's sitting right in front of your PC :-)<br />
<br />
Hope this info is of any assistance.</p>

<h2>            Hacked email, changed security questions, alternative email changed aswell.</h2>
                    <p><span>Microsoft sent a link to my email of a reset password.</span><span><br />
<span>That was weird.... I never clicked on reset my password, so I ignored it.</span></span></p>
<span>That was weird.... I never clicked on reset my password, so I ignored it.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Got another one saying click here to remove account.<br />
Weird... Never clicked on remove my account...</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><font>Keep in mind I was&nbsp;</font><font>receiving</font><font>&nbsp;these emails on my blackberry.</font><br />
<br />
<font>At this point I wanted to play it safe so I did and reset my password using a different link from the sign in homepage.</font></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Tried to sign in with my new password, it would not work... the security questions has been changed, tried to reset it using my alternative email... but that's been changed aswell(security question and password).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Tried to fill out as much information as I could on the alternative way of resetting password, they said I do not have enough information to have someone help me, even though I filled out every single questions except for the junk emails and credit
 card because I dont remember them and dont have a credit card and all the informations are&nbsp;accurate&nbsp;because I have them in my blackberry.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><font>Now I only can send and&nbsp;</font><font>receive</font><font>&nbsp;emails from my blackberry, I dont have the access to both of my email address on my desktop.</font></p>

<h3> davexx  say:</h3>
<h2>            FORMULA&#58;  Array,  CHOOSE&#40;MATCH&#40;      SUMPRODUCT&#40;  &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Update:&nbsp; i have found a partial answer.&nbsp; </p>
<br />
<p>if i can use method of having some 30 work cells in a column..&nbsp; alternate question would be if can use array in a row,&nbsp; where i have in each sequenced cell the next row of record i am using in my formula for eg:&nbsp; =ROW($A$100)&nbsp; in cell R1, as for the formula:</p>
<p>(confess having just the array:&nbsp; $R1:$R7&nbsp; will really shorten things up).</p>
<p>
</p><p>=CHOOSE(MATCH(ROW($A1190),$R1:$R7,1),"H0","HU1","HU2","HS0","HS1","HS2","HS3")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'sumproduct not seem to be needed.</p>
<p>=CHOOSE(SUMPRODUCT(MATCH(ROW($A1190),$R1:$R7,1)),"H0","HU1","HU2","HS0","HS1","HS2","HS3")</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>R1&nbsp; =ROW($A$886)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H0</p>
<p>R2&nbsp; =ROW($A$907)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HU1</p>
<p>R3&nbsp; =ROW($A$916)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HU2</p>
<p>R4&nbsp; =ROW($A$951)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HS0</p>
<p>R5&nbsp; =ROW($A$965)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HS1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (row 1190 above, would register here)</p>
<p>R6&nbsp; =ROW($A$1382)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HS2</p>
<p>R7&nbsp; =ROW($A$1474)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HS3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 1:&nbsp; can i put a series of rows / array of rows, right in the formula cell ?&nbsp; just going to run into a space problem &amp; difficulty in updating rows to a series of cells i cannot have right in front of me as i go down the sheet,&nbsp; So:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 2:&nbsp; is there some other method to store the work row designations.&nbsp; they have to be dynamic&nbsp; (changing as row positions change).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>==========</p>
<p>
</p><p>hi,&nbsp; i a not sure i am going to word this properly or for what technique to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am trying to find the row position of a formula, in an array of rows,&nbsp; if that is possible,&nbsp; using sumproduct,&nbsp; or:&nbsp; choose match, or any method that will work.&nbsp; the following formula works as a short version,&nbsp; the rest of what i need to add, will not
 fit.&nbsp; (thanks)</p>
<p>this eg works as it is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>USING EXAMPLE:&nbsp; GET THIS EG to work with "Main Example" listed below.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(ROW($A1190)&gt;=ROW($A100),"H"&amp;IF(ROW($A1190)&gt;=ROW($A$400),4,IF(ROW($A1190)&gt;=ROW($A$300),3,IF(ROW($A1190)&gt;=ROW($A$200),2,1))),0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>the result for this is easy for:&nbsp; H4&nbsp; (current row:&nbsp; 1190)</p>
<p>i am trying to shorten the formula as much as possible.&nbsp; maybe by any of:&nbsp; SUMPRODUCT ?? etc to remove repeat references to the word:&nbsp; ROW maybe by somehow reference ROW only once, as in an example for:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>=CHOOOSE(MATCH(current row(),list of rows,-1),compare to many rows:&nbsp; 30?,&nbsp; and disired results array? eg:&nbsp; "H4","H3","H2","H1",&nbsp; etc))</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>for a hyperlink,&nbsp; at the end of the second line:&nbsp; "ONE" ROW listing/ label is able to make the second half of this offset work for numerous other row designations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=HYPERLINK("#"&amp;CELL("address",OFFSET(<br />
IF($A1190&gt;2,IF($A1190=4,$A$400,$A$300),IF($A1190=2,$A$200,$A$100)),IF(ROW(<br />
IF($A1190&gt;2,IF($A1190=4,$A$400,$A$300),IF($A1190=2,$A$200,$A$100)))&gt;ROW($A1190)-5,0,0),0)))</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i got this isolated out, but does not help with what need below.&nbsp; </p>
<p>=ROW(IF($A1190&gt;2,IF($A1190=4,$A$400,$A$300),IF($A1190=2,$A$200,$A$100)))</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>is there a way to make an array of rows work.&nbsp; i cannot hit enter on my examples / not all the row locations light up as valid.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>MAIN EXAMPLES THAT HAVE SO FAR:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=CHOOSE(MATCH(ROW($A1190),ROW(VALUE($A$400,$A$300,$A$200,$A$100)),-1),"H4","H3","H2","H1")<br />
=CHOOSE(MATCH(ROW($A1190),VALUE($A$400,$A$300,$A$200,$A$100),-1),"H4","H3","H2","H1")<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>bet attempt?</p>
&nbsp; <br />
<p>=CHOOSE(MATCH(ROW($A1190),VALUE(ROW($A$400),ROW($A$300),ROW($A$200),ROW($A$100)),-1),"H4","H3","H2","H1")&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>older attempts:&nbsp; </p>
<p>=CHOOSE(MATCH(ROW($A1190),ROW($A$400),ROW($A$300),ROW($A$200),ROW($A$100),-1),"H4","H3","H2","H1")<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
=CHOOSE(MATCH(ROW($A1190),ROW(IF($A1190&gt;2,IF($A1190=4,$A$400,$A$300),IF($A1190=2,$A$200,$A$100))),-1),$A$100)<br />
=CHOOSE(MATCH($AE1188,{10;9;8;7;6},0),"M","B","H","D","A")</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------</p>
<p>
</p><p>=CHOOSE(MATCH(ROW($A1190),ROW(IF($A1190&gt;2,IF($A1190=4,$A$400,$A$300),IF($A1190=2,$A$200,$A$100))),-1),$A$100)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
=CHOOSE(MATCH($A1188,{10;9;8;7;6},0),"M","B","H","D","A")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '&lt;&lt;&nbsp; VALID VERSION FOR ITS USE,&nbsp; need to add array of rows in place of:&nbsp; 10 9 8 7 6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>an idea if helps,&nbsp; have seen examples where use of items / functions? in "Quotes" and use of Ampersands?&nbsp; :&nbsp; "&amp;" are useful eg above for the hyperlink formula.</p>

<p>hi,&nbsp; thanks for the reply.&nbsp; i will check those things out..&nbsp; i have been updating my post (pardon if using it as a bit of a research tool while i am trying to figure it out.&nbsp; pardon not see your post not sure how long to reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have run into serious problems before with being told not have enough info,&nbsp; then no replies later.&nbsp; (assuming some were being mean about it).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i will try to shorten it up then,&nbsp; but just trying to put out ideas that might work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i was going to include idea&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp; i would really like to have 1 work cell in header&nbsp; (to allow great ease in going down thru sheet to type in rows as an array?&nbsp;&nbsp; that is similar to my saying to include in each formula cell,&nbsp; but this would be better to have
 just 1 reference in header.&nbsp; kind of the same idea..&nbsp; please pardon my request for what to do is evolving to a simpler way of doing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i already have the basic idea of what put in:&nbsp; "Update" in top post, to put row references in a series of 30, 40, 50 cells?</p>
<p>if i can get all row references into 1 work cell, and let&nbsp; a match? do the same count from there.&nbsp; would be much perferred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>eg if possible in header 1 work cell to reference all desired rows,&nbsp; like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=ROWS($A$100,$A200,$A300,$A400,&nbsp; pretend dozens others: $A$500,$A$500,$A$500,$A$500,$A$500,$A$500,$A$500,$A$500,$A$500,$A$500,$A$500,$A$500,$A$500,$A$500)</p>

<p>i gave what have so far a try.&nbsp; too many cells for an array to put many rows in will make this not work so well.</p>
<p>i have run into a problem witht he formula (recenlty put in top post),&nbsp; not sure if id posted that before or after anything, but this example seems to be maxed out.&nbsp; i cannot enter anymore characters.&nbsp; (my long version of:&nbsp; if(row)&gt;row,"H4",if(row)&gt;row&nbsp;
 has many more outputs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>runs out of space,&nbsp; have many more after MS2 to enter:&nbsp;&nbsp; (this is the best answer i have so far, and have to say it does not do all of what i need it to do).</p>
<p>
</p><p>=CHOOSE(MATCH(ROW($A1190),$V$26:$V$64,1),"A1","A2","B1","B2","C0","C1","C2","D0","D1","E0","E1","E2","F2","G0","G1","H1","H2","L0","L1","L2","L3","L4","M0","M1","M2","M3S","M4","M5","M6")</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i wonder if getting vb udf will make this work.&nbsp; i have had idea for putting references in a remote place for both left &amp; right sides of the CHOOSE(MATCH&nbsp; functions,&nbsp; so can reduce the work necessary in upkeep of large quantities here.</p>
<p>will be signing off soon.&nbsp; back this evening.&nbsp; thanks.</p>

<p>With the Nokia 5070, it being an S40 based phone with limited capabilities, there is no way to block calls or SMS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you had an S60 based phone, there are applications that can make incoming calls from certain numbers not ring at all, or deletes messages from specific numbers as they come in.</p>
<p><br />
With an S40 phone like yours, such applications cannot be written.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, change your number (get a new SIM card), call back or text the other people and ask them to stop calling or sending you messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or ask your network operator, if they have some sort of a blacklisting service, where the network blocks calls/messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also tell the other people who use your phone, that unknown people (assuming they really are unknown) make calls and send messages to you, and you can't stop it.</p>

<p>Hi Petrib,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all I would like inform that I not a person seeking help regarding the subject, still I just went through your above post which I feel is very nicely explained and so useful, you explained it in such a way that even though the persons phone is not
 capable for a solution to his problem and you did'nt told him "NO". You have given him so many options which he will be knowing but your msg have made him to think once again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really appreciate you for such a wonderful post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep it up, Good Job.</p>

            Search for Best Blacklist Lite in Ovi store. Download and install this app to your mobile. Seems good enough for your needs. If this is not sufficient, then contact your service provider and ask them to blacklist the caller

    <title>mac word 2011 file locking does not work on NFS volumes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> osinger  say:</h3>
<h2>            mac word 2011 file locking does not work on NFS volumes</h2>
                    using word 2011 (14.1.2) on mac OS X (10.6.7), file locking only works with volumes mounted over SMB and not over NFS. when opening documents over NFS which are already open by another user, word gives no message that the document is already open. while
 mounting the same volume over SMB (from a netapp filer), file locking works as expected and word presents a warning message, that the document is already open.<br />
<br />
looking with dtrace at the issue reveals that the open system call in the NFS case is issued without any locking request:<br />
<br />
<br />
NFS<br />
11042/0x241b0:&nbsp; 17155926&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 477&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 62 open("/Volumes/mynetworkdrive_nfs/file.docx\0", 0x0, 0x1B6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 21 0<br />
<br />
SMB<br />
11042/0x241b0:&nbsp; 17957926 1148900&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 78 open("/Volumes/mynetworkdrive_smb/file.docx\0", 0x14, 0x1B6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = -1 Err#35<br />
<br />
second parameter to open is the open flag:<br />
<br />
#define O_SHLOCK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* open with shared file lock */<br />
#define O_NONBLOCK&nbsp; 0x0004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* no delay */<br />
<br />
in the call stack deep down in carbon we see that a different call to open the resource fork is used:<br />

<div>What are you saying? &nbsp;The folks in TechNet wouldn't have a CLUE about this one -- this is all about Mac OS X system calls.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Mate, this is Unix, not Windows, and you really need to be aware of the very significant differences :-) &nbsp;Please don't go sending our customers off to the TechNet swamp, because they will only be dumped straight back here with a "That's Mac, we don't speak
 Mac here!" (Only they may not be so polite...)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Osinger: &nbsp;I've passed your details on to the Devs in Microsoft's Macintosh Business Unit.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The answer is "Yes, it is a known issue, and currently there are no patches available." &nbsp;The work-around is "Don't use NFS" &nbsp;:-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know the guys are working on this, but I understand that a full resolution would require fundamental changes to the Office Core that can't be slip-streamed into a dot-release. &nbsp;My information is that the current service pack and the next one can be expected
 to "improve" the situation, but that we would need to wait for the next release for a complete fix.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, please do not bet the house on my information: a lot of things can change between now and the next version.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

                    <p>We get the following error when trying to verify a domain added to our Office 365 account:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>We have confirmed that you own &lt;DOMAIN_NAME&gt;, but we cannot add it to this tenant at this time. The domain is already added to a different Office 365 tenant: &lt;TENANT_NAME&gt;.&nbsp;</em><br />

<p>
</p><p>The tenant name listed is actually the primary account on our Azure services. However, portal.office.com doesn't allow us to sign in using that account. It states that user cannot be found. We have verified it's not a password issue because we can still
 log in to Azure just fine. And when we go in to Azure AD services, no domains are listed.</p>
<p><br />
How do we disassociate this domain from that Azure account tenant so we can get it added to our Office 365 domains?</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never thought about the list with recent documents until installing the lates update of the iPad-app today. Since that moment Word for iOS crashes everytime I open the Recent list by accident. Also some kind of crash-loop starts if the last action was opening
 the Recent-list, Word crashes then by opening because it immediately tries to open the Recent list. I don't need this option and it would be practical to at least clear it or make it inactive. For now the question is: how do I clear the list because at the
 moment Word is not very productive for me right now :-/</p>
<p>

            Yes, it will show the sender image in the header (but not in the message list) - if you have images added to the contacts.

            <p>You can avoid the whole issue by just creating new links. Back up both the front and backend just in case; then open the frontend, holding down the SHIFT key to prevent your startup form from opening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Tables tab of the navigator pane, select all the linked tables, take a deep breath and calm yourself, and press Shift-Delete to delete ALL the links.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then use External Data... Link to create brand new links to the backend. Navigate to the new location of the backend using Network Neighborhood (or your OS's equivalent) rather than mapped drive letters; it's more efficient and lets you use the same frontend
 even if different users have different drive letters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll need to review your startup form's relinking code I presume.</p>

            Have you got an older Intel chipset/video. I had this on the previous build with my Intel 8945G chipset. Provided I was quick on the draw (i.e, I failed on the first two attempts!) I was able to go to device driver and change the driver to Microsoft Basic
 Video Adapter. After a restart (the screen went black when I changed the driver initially) all was well.

<h2>            Office 365 Excel Cannot open embedded Word or Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I opened an Excel worksheet. It contains some embedded documents (Word and Excel documents).</p>
<p>When I try to open any of them, a message box is shown telling "Cannot start the source application for this object".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found several posts reporting the same error message, but most of them are related to embedded PDF documents.</p>
<p>One of these posts reports my same error (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_win10-mso_2016/cannot-open-embedded-excel-object-in-excel-2016/23fbae4f-12d2-4329-82db-acda29a35d85), but it did not receive any resolutive answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional info:</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Home 64 bit</p>
<p>Excel version: Office 365, Excel MSO (16.0.10228.20080) 32-bit</p>
<p>Antivirus software: McAfee Internet Security</p>
<p>
</p><p>Source document having problem: received via email and saved locally; when trying to open it on another PC, the problem does not occur.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even if I embed a Word or Excel document into an Excel document on my PC, I get the same error when I try to reopen it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anybody have this problem and solve it?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

            Hi pawel.skalka,<br />
<br />
The error message <em><strong>"cannot start the source application for this object"</strong></em> is usually associated with a damaged/corrupted file or app. For us to better isolate the issue, we would like to know the following information:<br />
<br />
• Does the issue occur on a specific file?<br />
• Have you made any recent changes to the original file before you encounter the issue?<br />
<br />
For the meantime, we would suggest <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">running your Office apps in safe mode</a></strong>
 and check if you're experiencing the same problem.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, you may try <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">repairing Office program from the Control Panel</a></strong>. This
 will scan or diagnose the root cause of the issue.<br />
<br />
We are looking forward to your concern.

<h2>            Section &#43; Notes Disappeared in OneNote for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Using OneNote for Mac 16.13, I created a new notebook section, renamed it from the default "New Section", and moved a bunch of notes from an existing section into the new section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I did this, though, the section name regressed to the default "New Section" and then the section disappeared... with all my notes!! I hit CTRL-Z a couple times to get the pages back into their original section, and a bunch of "Untitled Page" notes
 appeared, but it has been 30 minutes and they have not resynced...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The notes or the new section do not appear in desktop, online, or in the "delete notes" notebook. The notes are synced to OneDrive, but a backup feature isn't supported in OneNote for Mac, so I don't have any backups of these notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please make this more stable! I may have just lost months of critical business notes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my notes back?!</p>

<h2>            Codecs on PowerPoint</h2>
                    <p>After stopping the screen recorder, I get the message "PowerPoint cannot insert video from selected file. Verify that the necessary codec for this media format is installed". How to verify whether the codecs are installed or not? If not, how to install them?</p>
