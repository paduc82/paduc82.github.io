<h2>            How do I set my screen resolution to 1680 X 1050 when that size is not listed in my display settings&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I had the 1680 X 1050 setting at one time.&nbsp; Now the closest I can get is 1600 X 1200 which leaves a wide black line on each side of my desktop.&nbsp; I have Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; Compaq-Presario with a NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 and a Westinghouse 22 inch
 flat screen.&nbsp; My monitor is listed as a Generic Non-PnP Monitor.</p>

<p>I keep getting irritated phone calls because i cant hear when a person sends a message.</p>

<p>One more thing, when I call someone, the ringtone on my side stops after 1 ring.</p>

<p>Hi there again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that you are using the 12.8 version, which is kind of outdated version as of now. Can you please try to utilize the links that I have provided on my previous reply?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it might be possible that the New Skype version folder cannot be found on the Program files x86. For now, please try to utilize the links that I have provided and download the latest version of Skype and please do inform us if the issue will still
 persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will wait for your update.</p>

<h2>            HELP&#33; My computer is stuck in something that looks like safe mode.</h2>
                    I turned on my computer a few days ago and it appeared to be in safe mode. All my icons are huge and everything in general is&nbsp;over-sized so that it doesn't fit the screen.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I restarted into safe mode and realized that the computer was not actually in safe mode before.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It seems to be booting properly, but something is wrong with the scale. I have also tried several system restores, but the scale issue just happens every time the login screen pops up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Somebody PLEASE! help me fix this. This is a gaming and business laptop that now serves no purpose because everything I do on it is too large to work with.</div>

<span>Change screen resolution</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Screen resolution refers to the clarity of the text and images on your screen. At higher resolutions, items appear sharper. They also appear smaller, so more items fit
 on the screen. At lower resolutions, fewer items fit on the screen, but they are larger and easier to see. At very low resolutions, however, images might have jagged edges.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Things to try (in this order):<br />
<br />
1. Adjust the dpi. Right click the desktop, choose personalize. The option is in the left column.<br />
<br />
2. Adjust the resolution. From the above personalize menu, choose display settings. Adjust the resolution to the right to reduce the scale.<br />
<br />
3. If you are unable to reduce the resolution sufficiently, it's likely because your display drivers have been corrupted and you are running a standard VGA display driver. Go to the website of the display adapter manufacturer and download the most recent (non-beta)
 release and install it, then reboot to finish.

<p>I Have a Gateway P7805 Laptop, with Vista 64 Home Premium, and a Conexant Hi-Def Audio&nbsp;installed into&nbsp;it. My volume control will sometimes start decreasing to down to 0. I pull it back up with the mouse but it will go back down. If I play with it for a while
 it will stay at 100% for a long while.<br />
Has anyone ever heard of this happening before?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check Control Panel - Mouse and Keyboard to see if anything is set to Volume Control such as a middel wheel,<br />
side button, or a key or "Stuck". Does it do it in all programs? If not check those that do to see if they have<br />
programmable "hotkey" or "mouse" activated volume controls.<br />
<br />
There was an issue in XP where older drivers allowed that so Update your drivers (XP or Vista).<br />
<br />
Right Click Speaker Icon - Playback Devices<br />
<br />
Highlight Speakers - Properties (lower right same page) - Enhancements&nbsp; Tab - Check Disable all Sound Effect<br />
Apply - OK<br />
<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
NOTE : Sound driver often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see if the version you<br />
installed is there, if not repeat - reboot until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it<br />
does.<br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            NUKETOWN 2025 DOWNLOAD</h2>
                    
<p>I've currently downloaded Nuketown 2025 as i had a free pass inside of my black ops two game case. Reedemed the code, download was slow but said it downloaded sucessfully, opened the game and it wasn't there. So i thought i'd turn the xbox on and off and
 it might appear, tried this and it still wasn't there. Then i read a few forums and it told me to go into my account settings, then download history and then redownloaded Nuketown, i have done this twice and each time it say it has been sucsessful, and yet
 there is no Nuketown when i play black ops 2! I feel really annoyed because i have purchased something which clearly isn't working. So does anyone have any ideas, or have had the same problem?</p>

<p>As above - go into the online chaos moshpit game mode. It's part of that rotation and the only place you'll find it. It's not in the general maps. The did have it as a 24/7 map but they removed that mode.

<p>Because Nuketown 2025 IS NOT Nuketown Zombies. How do people not know/realize this by now? You had to have purchased the Season Pass or a Hardened/Care Package Edition of the game. Then you will get Nuketown Zombies.</p>

<p>For every one that has trouble, nuketown 2025 is only in the chao moshpit playlist and it will appear once in a while. If you want to make sure you have nuketown 2025, go on a private match and press choose map and go to dlc and see if you have nuketown</p>

            <p>Nuketown 2025 and Nuketown zombies are two separate maps that had two separate codes. If you bought the hardened/care package edition you got both codes. If you pre ordered the regular edition, you got Nuketown 2025. If you bought the season pass you got Nuketown zombies. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Nuketown 2025 is not in regular map rotation and can only be found in Chaos Moshpit under the "Bonus" section. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Nuketown zombies can be found when you enter the zombie menu.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>That is as simple as I can make everything lol</p>

<p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you were asked for an administrator password even if you did not set a password for the administrator account. May we know if you are using a standard account or an administrator account when running an application as an administrator?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when prompted for an administrator password, what happens when you leave the password empty?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if you can provide more information regarding this issue. Please answer these questions for a better understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Is this a custom-built PC? If not, then what is the make and model of your computer?
</p>
<p>2) Did you upgrade to Windows 8.1 or is it a brand-new computer that came with Windows 8.1 preinstalled?</p>
<p>3) What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>4) Did you try any troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue on the computer? If yes, what are they?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to reinstall Windows 8.1, you may contact your computer manufacturer to get the Windows 8.1 installation/recovery media (DVD/USB) and then perform a clean installation of Windows 8.1 on the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Important: A clean installation removes all the data from your hard disk by repartitioning and reformatting your hard disk and reinstalling the operating system. So, make sure you backup all your important data on the computer.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the computer came with Windows 8.1 preinstalled and if you have a recovery partition in it, then you may try performing a refresh and check if that resolves the issue. To perform a refresh of your PC, you may please refer to this article:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to refresh, reset, or restore your PC</a></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Important:</em></strong><em> <strong>The apps that came with your PC or you installed from Windows Store will be reinstalled, but any apps you installed from other websites and DVDs will be removed. Windows puts a list of the removed apps on
 your desktop after refreshing your PC.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to perform a refresh, then you may try the following troubleshooting methods and check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Method 1: Run an SFC Scan</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The “<strong><em>sfc /scannow</em></strong>” command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press “Windows Logo” + “Q” keys on the keyboard and type “<strong><em>cmd</em></strong>” in the search box.</p>
<p>b) Right click on the “<strong><em>Command Prompt</em></strong>” icon from the search results and select “<strong><em>Run as administrator</em></strong>”</p>
<p>c) On the command prompt window, type the following command, and then press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 1in"><strong><em>sfc /scannow</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in">
</p><p>d) Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn’t help, then try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Method 2: Check the issue in Safe Mode and perform a Clean Boot.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Step 1: Boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows, we can start the computer in different advanced troubleshooting modes to find and fix problems on the PC. One of such troubleshooting mode is Safe Mode. Here we start Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. Please refer to the steps
 given in this article to boot the computer in safe mode:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</em></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After booting the computer in Safe Mode, you may restart the computer and check if you still face this issue in this mode. If the issue does not occur in safe mode, then perform a clean boot to check if it is caused by any software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Step 2: </em></strong><strong><em><span>Perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. To perform a clean boot, please refer to the section “<strong><em>How to perform a clean boot</em></strong>” and follow the instructions for “<strong><em>Windows
 8.1 and Windows 8</em></strong>” from this link:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></em></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may please note that performing a clean boot does not fix the actual issue. It just helps us in identifying the root cause of the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not occur in clean boot, then you may determine which application/service on the computer is causing this issue. This can be done by following the instructions for “<strong><em>Windows 8.1 and Windows 8</em></strong>” given in the
 section “<strong><em>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</em></strong>” from the same given link.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Important: After you have finished troubleshooting, refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” for “Windows 8 and Windows 8.1”, to reset the computer to start as usual from the above
 link.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>Hope this is helpful. Please get back to us with the updates.</span></p>

<p><br />
2) Did you upgrade to Windows 8.1 or is it a brand-new computer that came with Windows 8.1 preinstalled?&nbsp; I upgraded from preinstalled Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 8 to Windows 8.1(not a retail version).</p>
<p>3) What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue? I am not sure but this last time this error occurred I ran a scan to remove some malware then I rebooted and the error happened.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you try performing refresh pc as suggested by Rajesh?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're having problems with your PC, you can try to refresh, reset, or restore it. Refer this link to Refresh PC. If refreshing
<span>&nbsp;</span>PC doesn’t helps perform Reset PC.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reset PC disclaimer:</strong> All of your personal files will be deleted and your settings will be reset. All apps that you installed will be removed. Only apps that came with your PC will be reinstalled.</p>

            Hi Tom Callaghan ,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers community.<br />
<p>Which version of driver did you install?</p>
<p>You may install older version driver and check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to boot your computer in clean boot mode then, uninstall the driver for printer and restart your computer. Then reinstall the printer drivers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>Steps to uninstall and <span>
reinstall</span> the printer driver.<br />
1. Click on Start button and select Control Panel.<br />
2. Click on Programs.<br />
3. Click on Programs and features.<br />
4. Now uninstall the printer drivers. <br />
5. Restart your computer. This will automatically install proper drivers for it.<br />
<br />
You can download the driver for it from manufacturer website also.<br />
<a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/SupportIndex.jsp?oid=-10222&amp;infoType=Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/SupportIndex.jsp?oid=-10222&amp;infoType=Overview</a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong>Steps to boot into clean boot mode:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type <span>
msconfig</span> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</a> . Also, see the section on how to return your computer to a Normal startup mode.<br />
If the above methods didn't resolve your problem then perform system restore.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> System restore will take your computer to pervious state when it was not facing such problem, this can be done by selecting the proper restore point.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps: <br />
<br />
1. Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.
<br />
<br />
2. In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.
<br />
3. In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.
<br />
4. Click Finish.<br />
<br />

<p>No, the key which can be used with either 32 or 64 bit Windows&nbsp;8 is only intended for use with 1 of the disk. You cannot use it to install both. 1 license, 1 installation, so choose wisely. If you want to install Windows&nbsp;32 or 64 bit on another partition
 or another computer, you will need to purchase an additional license.</p>

<div>Detailed system info:&nbsp;</div>
<div>PC (Dell Precision M6600) with preinstalled Windows 7 Pro x64 that via paid upgrade was updated to Windows 8 Pro x64 and via Windows store - automatically updated to indows 8.1 Pro x64. Recently found out that my PC supports UEFI for which to work I need
 to do a clean reinstall of windows using Windows 8 Pro x64 retail DVD image from a friend (solution adviced by MS support representative that I contacted because windows.iso obtained from http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only
 using my Windows 8 Pro upgrade key at the installation process returns "This product key didn't work. Please check it and try again." as it turns out due to the fact that installations obtained from the web page are not Pro versions). Now the problem with
 the retail DVD is that it is not recognized as UEFI compatible boot drive!</div>
<div>1) How to make the DVD image UEFI compatible?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regarding dual booting:</div>
<div>Your tutorial is on dual booting Windows 8 on a single disk drive with a single System partition (~100MB). I have doubts that it will work this way when installing to a second disk drive while the first is removed (especially considering that I'm first
 installing Windows XP Pro which doesn't use a separate System partition - see below).&nbsp;</div>
<div>2) Is there a thoroughly explanatory article on these System partitions? (I searched MS Knowledge base and Community threads, but couldn't find)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think there was a misunderstooding regarding upgrading Windows XP Pro "to obtain another license". What i planned to do is:&nbsp;</div>
<div>- write down the Windows XP Pro x86 product key from HP notebook;</div>
<div>- find a Windows XP Pro x86 installation image and install it on the second drive of my PC (removing the primary drive with existing Windows 8.1 Pro x64);</div>
<div>- buy and install a Windows 8.1 Pro upgrade.</div>
<div>3) Is there a way to turn x86 windows into x64?</div>
<div>4) How to check whether the installation on HP notebook is an OEM version? &nbsp;(There is no “OEM” written anywhere in System Properties nor on Windows sticker.)</div>
<div>5) How to check whether the installation on HP notebook is genuine? (MS verification tool at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/exe-validation.aspx doesn’t work: “We are sorry, the page you requested cannot be found.”)</div>

<p>(thorough guide on creating the dual boot system I asked about in post No.1, nor obtaining another licence from the old laptop),</p>
<p>decided to try to create the dual boot system before laying out the money...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Obtained a Windows 8 Pro x64 retail DVD image "from a friend" - searched the internet.</p>
<p>2. Made an UEFI compatible USB flash drive using Universal USB Installer 1.9.5.2 (for reasons unknown to me Windows7-USB-DVD-tool and YUMI 2.0.0.1 crated drives were not recognised by systems UEFI).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Removed all existing partitions from the HDD (Dell OEM, Recovery, Windows8.1ProX64 and DATA&nbsp;partitions), to change drives MBR to GPT that is compatible with UEFI.</p>
<p>4. Installed the OS automatically creating 3 partitions: Recovery (300MB), EFI System (100MB) and OS (Boot, Crash Dump, Primary).</p>
<p>5. Since I'm used to storing my data on a separate partition in Disk Management (press "win+x" then "k") shrinked the OS partition to the max allowed&nbsp; size - turned out to be a half of the initial partition size ~150GB/300GB</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>-
</span></span></span><span><span>Not the amount I expected given that OS installation uses 25GB.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Turns out that you need to</p>
<p>a) disable hibernation (press "win+x" then "a" to run cmd as administrator, write: "powercfg -h off");</p>
<p>b) disable paging file (Control Panel\System and Security\System &gt; Advanced system settings &gt; Advanced tab: Performance - Settings... &gt; Advanced tab: Virtual memory - Change...)</p>
<p>c) disable system protection (Control Panel\System and Security\System &gt; Advanced system settings &gt; System Protection tab: Configure...)</p>
<p>to shrink the partition properly (down to ~100GB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Attached second HDD to the PC, installed the OS. This time (if I remember correctly) there was a single partition created on drive 2.</p>
<p>The result was not what I was looking for: removing drive 1 (simulating failure) resulted in non-booting PC. Furthermore the dual boot was erratic: after booting to drive 2 booting to drive 1 required a "startup repair".</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Removed the OS on drive 2 from Windows Boot Manager:
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>pressed "win+x" then "a" to run cmd as administrator, wrote: </p>
<span>
<p>bcdedit /delete {730ab459-b062-11e0-84f1-fa307df851c2}</p>
<p>where the part in {} - operating system identifier (checked by writing "bcdedit").</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Removed drive 1, reinstalled the OS <span><span><span>on drive 2
</span></span></span><span><span>that automatically created 3 partitions as in step 4.</span></span></p>
</span>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>
</p><p>a1) Turned off PC. Plugged in drive 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UEFI entries:</p>
<p>Windows Boot Manager (WBM1- drive 1)</p>
<p>File Systen List - PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x2)/Sata(0x1,0,0)/HD(2,GPT,DAC5A8AE-...)</p>
<p>File Name - \EFI\Boot\BOOTX64.EFI</p>
<p>Windows Boot Manager (WBM2- drive 2)</p>
<p>File Systen List - PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x2)/Sata(0x0,0,0)/HD(2,GPT,30FEAAB9-...)</p>
<p>File Name - \EFI\Boot\BOOTX64.EFI</p>
<span><span>
<p>Set UEFI to boot form drive 1</p>
</span></span>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>(i.e. WBM1)</span></span></span><span><span>- Everything OK</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to <span><span>Control Panel &gt; Windows 7 File Recovery</span></span><span><span><span>and created System Image.</span></span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p>a2) Restarted PC. Set UEFI to boot from drive 2</p>
</span></span>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>(i.e. WBM2)</span></span></span><span><span>- Everything OK, except for the fact that there is no drive 1 - explorer, Disk Management and cmd
 diskpart show no traces of such drive though it is attached to the sata port on the mainboard.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to <span><span>Control Panel &gt; Windows 7 File Recovery</span></span><span><span><span>and created Windows Backup.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>b1) Turned off PC. Unplugged drive 2 - Everything OK.</p>
<p>b2) Turned off PC. Plugged drive 2, unplugged drive 1</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>- Boot failure:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>"The boot configuration data for your PC is missing or contains errors"</p>
<p>Windows Boot Manager (WBM0)</p>
<p>\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD</p>
<p>0xc000000f</p>
<p>After automatic boot repair via USB installation drive a new UEFI boot entry:</p>
<p>File System List - HD(2,GPT,30FEAAB9-...)</p>
<p>File Name - \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\Bootmgfw.efi</p>
<p>was created and set to primary.</p>
<p>Booting to this entry (WBM0) resulted in Windows logo flash screen (the black one with blue logo and turning circle) that changed into a black screen with no visible HDD action.</p>
<p>Turned off the PC (10 second press of turn on/off button).</p>
<p>Booted to the WBM2 - same results.</p>
<p>Turning off the PC and booting back to WBM0 resulted in "It looks like Windows didn't load correctly". Looking for repair options got me to a basic looking login where I was asked for my windows login pasword that led me to the F8 menu with the Advanced
 - Automatic Repair that resulted in "Automatic Repair couldn't repair your PC" and "Root cause found: Boot status indicates that OS booted successfully" in Srttrail.txt</p>
<p>Running chkdsk at Command Promt reported everything to be perfectly OK.</p>
<p>Running sfc /scannow /offbootdir=c:\ /offwindir=c:\windows ar Command Prompt reported "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations".</p>
<p>Running bcdedit at Command Prompt returned info corresponding to WBM0.</p>
<p>But restarting in "Safe Mode with Networking" once again resulted in the same black screen with no action from HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>c1) Turned off PC. Plugged both drives. Set UEFI to boot from drive 1 </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>(WBM1)
</span></span></span><span><span>- Everything OK, exept I can no longer explore drive 2</span></span><span><span><span>using windows explorer</span></span></span><span><span>:
</span></span><span><span><span>"</span></span></span><span><span>Access is denied</span></span><span><span><span>"</span></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><span><span>(Can
 edit folders in cmd)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c2) Restarted PC. Set UEFI to boot from drive 2 - Boot failure.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"The boot configuration data for your PC is missing or contains errors"</span></span></span></p>
<p>Windows Boot Manager (WBM0)</p>
<p>\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD</p>
<p>0xc000000f</p>
<p>Restarted PC, plugged USB installation drive run Automatic Repair: "Automatic Repair couldn't repair your PC. Log file:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " - there were no lines added to the Srttrail.txt.</p>
<p>Running bcdedit at Command Prompt returned "The requested system device cannot be identified due to multiple indistinguishable devices potentially matching the identification criteria"</p>
<p>Wonder why it is not possible to acchieve the same UEFI functionality on HDD drives running windows as on the USB flash installation drive that is imediately recognised and booted to when plugged at startup of the system!?</p>
<span><span>What is the difference between System Repair Disk and Retail DVD Image?
<p>How to make UEFI compatible System Repair Disk without burning DVD?</p>
</span></span><span><span><span>
<p>
</p><p>I still gonna try some workaround's:</p>
<p>1) remove drive 1 and try to restore drive 2 to a System Image (created when running on drive 1 - see a1) cause Windows Backup created when on drive 2&nbsp; (see a2), if I'm not mistaking,&nbsp; has created&nbsp; a backup of the OS partition, not the whole drive;</p>
<p>2) install Ubuntu 13.10 and try GRUB 2 instead of Windows Boot Manager.</p>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>
<p>
</p><p>but to sum up: it looks like it is not possible to create the dual boot system stated in post No. 1 using MS products.</p>
</span></span></span>

                    I turned the computer on and it goes to the boot screen it says I cannot start the computer without the Windows disk. I bought a premade computer and don't have a disk. I am getting the error Oxcoooo14c. Is there any way to restore it how it was without

<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>

You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>

It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>

<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />

    <title>What did I do&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> creeperking  say:</h3>
<h2>            What did I do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So on July 29 I logged into my basic user account on my computer. I checked the windows 10 app and it said windows 10 was downloading. I clicked on view download progress and it wanted me to enter my admin password. I did then it brought up the windows update
 but there was nothing about windows 10 downloading. Later that day I logged into my admin account and checked the download, and then and only then did it start to download. Hours later the download finished and in the windows 10 app it said upgrade ready.
 Later on I opened the windows update to check something by searching update then clicking on windows update. Then when the windows update came up a new window came up saying Great, we will get the upgrade started and it had a license agreement. I did not want
 to upgrade then so I just clicked the x button to get out of it then it&nbsp; said cleaning up. Less then 60 seconds later it closed and the windows 10 app now says windows 10 is downloading again when it did say it was ready and the downloaded files for windows
 10 are still on my computer. Today I logged into my admin account and I did not do anything but that Great, we will get the upgrade started window came up again and the windows 10 app still said it was downloading and not that it was ready. Again I clicked
 the x button because 1 I don't know if I want to upgrade yet and 2 I don't know what is going on with the stuff I just posted about above. What did I do? Have I broken the upgrade? Is the upgrade ready for me or not? What is going on? The windows 10 files
 are still on my computer I know that because 1 the memory is still taken up on my computer and 2 there is a folder on my computer called $Windows.~BT and it has a bunch of files in it that I am sure are for installing windows 10. So what is going on?</p>
<p>What did I do? Also do I need to worry about backing things up before I upgrade because I tried to back up some of my most important stuff by copying it to my USB Flash Drive and it only would copy some of the files not all of them.(All the files I need
 to backup are in my User account folders, if I need to back them up but if I don't then I wont have to worry I have read a review that said the guy didn't even bother backing up and every thing was still there when the upgrade was done.)</p>

            <p>Thank you for helping me. Let me give you some info about my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using windows 7, I did as you said and on windows update it has this. 4 canceled updates from July 29 and 30. I think because when I the window came up that looked as if it were going to upgrade my computer I clicked the x button because I did not want
 to upgrade yet.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc0cc991-75b1-431a-a6f8-14db4d1c7376" />After I clicked to close it both times both times it said cleaning up then closed. But the windows 10 files are
 still on my computer and If I were to log off and go into my Administrator account right now I bet that the same window will come up again even though I don't want to upgrade right now. So how I know the files are on my computer is there is a file on my computer
 with these files inside.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/639a87a7-ad0f-4d40-b77c-41ee826b984a" />These files look like they would be for setting up a new operating system.
</p>
<p>Something else, I have my update settings set to check for updates but let me choose to download and install them. Could this be part of the problem? Also if I log on to my Administrator account and the window with the windows 10 license agreement comes
 up again should I click accept then be able the choose to upgrade latter or will it begin to upgrade then and if I don't want to upgrade yet I will have to click out of it again? Would that do anything to help the problem?</p>

<h2>            Inaccessible boot device error resetting Windows 10. Just get black screen.</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 a little over a week ago, and was experiencing a few issues, so I decided to do a reset, choosing the option to keep files yet remove apps and settings. The reset reached 100% and the PC restarted, but I got an "invalid
 boot device" error saying that the system must restart. After restarting, all that appears is a black screen, with no options available. I've tried numerous keys but nothing happens. The computer just sits on a blank screen. Any help would be appreciated.<br />
</p>
<p>I have a Gateway SX2110-UB25 that is merely two years old, that came with Windows 8 but upgraded to 8.1 prior to upgrading to 10.</p>

    <title>Slow Boot, Disk 100&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kushenthimira  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow Boot, Disk 100&#37;</h2>
                    I installed Windows 10 pro yesterday on my brand new laptop (Acer E5 576G). After using it for several hours I realized that sometime Disk on task bar goes uptup 100% and laptop becomes a little bit sluggish (Highest disk usage service was superfetch -
 don't know whether it's every time). And the boot up is very slow it's taking almost 1 or 2 minute/s to boot up. Please help me fix this I already did the StorAHCI.sys fix that mentioned in here (&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3083595/task-manager-might-show-100-disk-utilization-on-windows-10-devices-wit

<p>(1) It's been the same from Win 8.1 to Win 10, 1809. I see 100% disk activity at boot. It gets there, recedes to zero, gets there again, recedes again, &amp; may do so a few more times with much lesser highs. I let it have its way until the 3rd time I see zero.
 Then all seems well to me the rest of the session usually. Things are quick. This may take as little as 3 minutes to complete &amp; no more than 5. If interrupted, I think Windows may try off/on throughout the session to get that job done. Let it finish to have
 low numbers the rest of the way...</p>

<p>You should update drivers &amp; firmware, if any. Then, let Windows have its way at each boot until you see disk activity at zero at least twice. That could happen within 3 minutes. After that, I think you will not see 100%'s the rest of your session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you got <strong>fast startup</strong> set at "<strong>Control Panel</strong> (ask Cortana),
<strong>Power Options</strong>, <strong>Choose what the power buttons do</strong>"? I think it's a tad better that way...</p>

            Yeah.. So I realized as | PCR Just PCR | said they're is no method to fix this. Not there system wait for good 3 minutes. Problem solved. I hope windows will fix this in the future although it's not problem.<br />
<br />
Note : Disabling Superfetch service made boot up little bit faster.

<h2>            HP printer  on printer preferences</h2>
                    When we open up printer preferences on our HP envy 4520 printer, there is nothing there to let us pick either color or black and white or grayscale for printing.&nbsp; Even though printer has printing color enabled , it will only print in black and white.&nbsp;
 It was working a few weeks ago, so not sure what changed on our pc.&nbsp; Tried just about everything from update drivers, deleting printer and starting over.&nbsp; We are on Windows 10 version

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Once you open preferences click on Advanced and you can select greyscale or black ink only.&nbsp; Colour print is&nbsp; the default setting. Right click on a page and click Print and then click more settings and from here you can choose colour or other options.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c83a6883-0c02-4179-a556-b151c409ccfd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c83a6883-0c02-4179-a556-b151c409ccfd" /></a></p>
