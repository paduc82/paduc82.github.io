            <p>This is what I would find useful. &nbsp;Instead of one thing at a time, you would get an actually useful view of your posts, emails, etc. &nbsp;As long as they were scroll-able, clickable, and ability to click a post read to make it disappear and de-clutter&nbsp;</p>

    <title>What setting for the Execute Disable bit in bios - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silverpulser  say:</h3>
<h2>            What setting for the Execute Disable bit in bios</h2>
                    <p>When updating from build 10122 to 10130 the update failed resulting in an endless loop of Bios/ Automatic repair. I tried installing from the MS ISO burned to DVD but that too ended the same way. In the end I wiped the HD, partitioned and formatted it and
 installed from the build 10074 ISO/DVD. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is what bios setting should I have for the Execute Disable Bit in the bios. At the moment it is set to Disable and 10074 is up and running. I want to make sure that I have the correct setting before I once again attempt an upgrade to a future
 build (I think I will give 10130 a miss after all the aggro I and others have experienced with this install). My cpu is a Core 2 duo T7200.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you could help me with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For years I have been using Skype and for years I always try to delete my messaging history and it never gets deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, when I delete the conversation from Classic Windows Skype, I can still see the conversation in Windows 10 Skype app and my mobile phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Numerous times I deleted history yet still Skype keeps saving them, causing me privacy concerns</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you please tell me why Skype does not protect its users? If I want to delete my messages, why is it so bloody hard to do so?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I need to delete all messages on all my devices and it is not working - those same messages keep coming back!</p>

<p>We have users that have been setup as Delegate to their manager's mailbox.&nbsp; We do this by going into the manager's Outlook, File\Account Settings\Delegate Access\Add.&nbsp; Enter the Delegates name and give them Editor permission to Inbox, Calendar, Contacts.&nbsp;
 Then, in the Delegates Outlook, File\Accounts edit the account under Advanced Settings to open additional mailboxes - the manager's mailbox.&nbsp; The manager's mailbox appears in the Delegate's Outlook but all email folders are fully accessible including Sent,
 and all Sub-folders.&nbsp; We only want the Delegate to have access to the Inbox, Calendar and Contacts.&nbsp; Why are they getting full permissions?&nbsp; In the manager's Outlook, I have checked the permissions in the sub-folders by right clicking\Properties\permissions
 and the permissions say None.&nbsp; I have checked the O365 admin portal for the managers exchange properties and the Delegate is listed as Send on Behalf, not Full Access.</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated.&nbsp; </p>

<p>hi mitchell,<br />
<br />
i checked your post and found that you just want the users to view and edit the inbox folder of the manager. however, what you have done to delegate the inbox in outlook client is to delegate the entire mailbox to these users. you can first disable the delegate
 access by clicking file\account settings\delegate access\add and then follow the steps below to only let the users access the manager’s inbox folder without other folders or subfolders in their outlook client. in the test below, i give the editor permission
 of the inbox folder in user test9’s mailbox to user test7.<br />
1. in outlook client, right click on the mailbox name, and then click properties-&gt;permission. set default permission of the manager’s entire mailbox to reviewer.<br />

2. assign editor permission of the inbox folder in user test9’s mailbox to user test7.

3. add test9’s inbox folder to test7’s mailbox by clicking file&gt;accounts&gt;edit&gt;more options&gt;advanced &gt;open additional mailbox. only the inbox folder will show up.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Word Push in a line.</h2>
                    When reading a book, and a new line begins it will often be pushed in a few spaces to mark that a new line isn't just a continuation of an old line. I'd like to know if there is a way to do this automatically or if I'm forced to add a few spaces before
 every line manually?

<p>You can modify the style used for your text (usually Normal style, but it could be Body Text style or something else) to have a
<strong>first-line indent</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click in any paragraph of that kind of text.</li><li>Look at the Styles gallery on the Home tab of the ribbon. The style applied to the paragraph you clicked in will have a gray box in the ribbon.</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc596a91-0438-4b37-b513-d26d678d19af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc596a91-0438-4b37-b513-d26d678d19af" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click that box in the Styles gallery and click on <strong>Modify</strong>&nbsp;in the menu.</li><li>In the Modify Style dialog, first click the "New documents based on this template" option to make the change apply to all new documents as well as the one that's now open. (It won't change anything in existing documents.)</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a631b0ce-1d27-4426-8102-27598f7e43db" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a631b0ce-1d27-4426-8102-27598f7e43db" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Next click the <strong>Format</strong> button and click <strong>Paragraph</strong> in the menu.</li><li>In the Paragraph dialog, in the Indentation section, set the <strong>Special</strong> box "First line" and set the box to its right to &nbsp;the amount of indent you want, such as 0.25" or 0.64 cm.</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8a629bd-e0e9-4e65-b5f2-533b132470d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8a629bd-e0e9-4e65-b5f2-533b132470d0" /></a></p>

    <title>Printing multiple Shared Calendars - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yahhr857- &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing multiple Shared Calendars</h2>
                    
<p>Since I cannot reply to the forum question about this, I will start a new thread.&nbsp; There are several folks on this and other forums who have repeatedly asked Microsoft for a solution to printing multiple shared calendars over a domain.&nbsp; Calendar Printing
 Assistant (CPAO) does not work with Office 64-bit regardless of the version. I had hoped 365 would provide this valuable printing ability and yet it is still put on the "not a priority" list.&nbsp; Even an individual who asked about it in January of 2015 was asked
 to submit feedback to the team.&nbsp; Here it is another year later, another new product, and this valuable resource is still not addressed.</p>
<p>So my question is this: Does Microsoft have any intention of adding printing multiple shared calendars to 64-bit systems or 365 so those of us who rely on printed calendars don't have to stand on our heads to get it to work?&nbsp; It is not feasible here to place
 all calendars into one mailbox, which has been offered as one solution. If I can see all these calendars in my outlook calendar, I should be able to print them off.&nbsp; The people I work with have given me permissions to do so, I should be able to do so.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>At this time, I do not expect to see it available in a 64bit version. Still you need to submit the feedback. There is no release to support on Outlook (64-bit), and haven’t heard of such release plan.</p>
<p>You may check this workaround for printing multiple calendars, see <a href="http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/combine-outlook-calendars-print-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.slipstick.com/.../</a> </p>
<p>- it's a macro that will copy everything to one calendar for printing. While Outlook doesn't have the range of templates the CPAO has, if you just need basic calendars, it works well.
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>here's is the scenario i need help with. i have a mailbox in the on-premise organization. the user adds a calendar of the mailbox from the exchange online&nbsp;organization. here it comes.&nbsp;when the on-prem user&nbsp;adds&nbsp;the calendar of the online user&nbsp;to his outlook,
 it constantly prompts for credentials. what's even weirder about this,&nbsp;when the user clicks on the "cancel" button the free/busy informations&nbsp;display anyway. that means the authentication process works well. i've discovered that the outlook is sending http
 requests to this url: <a href="https://autodiscover-s.outlook.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://autodiscover-s.outlook.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml</a>.&nbsp;i suppose this is&nbsp;a standard behavior. the question is why&nbsp;the outlook is unable to authenticate? when i add credentials manually everything works fine.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fforums%2fgetfile%2f736241" /></p>
<p>i wasn't lazy and i installed a new environment with the clean installation of exchange 2013 sp1 cu9. i've configured hybrid configuration with a new o365 tenant. the topology should be all the same. everything works just fine without any prompts or problems.
 even though i'm not able figure out where the problem is.</p>
<p>any idea?</p>

<p>Hi Dusan,</p>
<p>I understand that you have set up Exchange hybrid with Office 365, when opening the user of cross- premises’ calendar in Outlook, the Outlook client prompts for credentials. Please let me know if I’ve misunderstood anything.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue, I’d like to let you know that it’s a un-supported scenario since it requires additional cross-premises permissions while currently only Free/Busy lookup works in cross-premises scenario (even though sometimes it may work but it’s officially
 supported).</p>
<p>For the Free/Busy features provided in hybrid deployments, it’s recommended that we use the “scheduling assistant” in both the Outlook client and OWA (Outlook Web App), which is served by the availability services provided in the hybrid servers and doesn’t
 require mailboxes or folders to be opened.</p>
<p>Given the situation, to improve our services and ensure your valuable voices are heard, it’s recommended that you submit feedback about the feature to our relevant team via:

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>you understand correctly. I'm not really happy with your answer :) The only reason I'm trying to solve is that When I move a half of mailboxes to Exchange Online, the other half starts receiving a request for credentials. I'm afraid these users will not
 be happy about that. Are you trying to tell me there is nothing I can do about it?</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer :)</p>

<p>Hi Dusan,</p>
<p>About the issue “When I move a half of mailboxes to Exchange Online, the other half starts receiving a request for credentials.”, I’d like to confirm with you if you have set any additional permissions for these users?</p>
<p>If so, it’s a expect behavior that the on-premises user will be prompted for credentials. Currently mailbox permissions between on-premises and Exchange Online/Office 365 (cross-premises permissions) won’t work since they belong to two Exchange organizations
 and the permissions can only exist under one organization. Therefore, to avoid the similar issues occur, it’s recommended that you remove the existing permissions between the on-premises mailbox and the mailbox which will be moved to Exchange Online. so that
 the on-premises user won’t be prompted for credentials once the mailbox is moved to Exchange Online.&nbsp;</p>

            What language is applied to the text? Using your sentence example, the word 'your' (without the quotes) is not flagged in either UK English or US English, when using Word 2016 here. However, when checking your message text, "your", surrounded by quotes
 as shown, is flagged as a potential error. 'grammer' is correctly flagged as incorrectly spelled.<br />

<h2>            Windows Defender Full Security scan</h2>
                    Imagine the scene, mid afternoon, I start a Windows Defender Full security scan. OS Windows 10. I continue to use the computer, time passes. It's getting late, I need my beauty sleep! I close progs I'm using and see that the scan is still running, with
 about a seventh of the percentage bar left to fill. I click on the gear wheel Settings Icon at the lower left off the Windows Defender Security Center window, hoping to find a ShutDownComputerWhenScanFinished option but there is not one. I GoBack expecting
 to return to the scan window but that does not happen. I can not tell if the scan is still running. Has my clicking GoBack stopped the scan? I am aware off other ways to shut down after scan that you choose before starting the full scan, but why is there not
 the option once the scan is running? If there is a way and I've missed it? Thanks for any help you can give me.<br />

<h2>            low battery alarm app&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all -</p>
<p>I have a Nokia N8, and find that the warning tone that the N8 gives when the baattery is low is far too quiet. Does anyone know of an app that can provide a (much) louder notification when the battery is dying - perhaps 2 or 3 loud&nbsp; warnings as most other
 phones do?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>It's unlikely you'll find something, as the last thing you want when the battery is about to go is for a couple of loud alarms using up your last drop of juice, try NokiaBots it will give you a visual warning in a widget when your getting low on juice.</p>

<p>I AGREE. The simpler phones my friends (and all the ones I've had before) have<font color="#800000"> let the user know of low batteries</font> long before the phone dies. With my N8 I have less than 5 minutes to get my phone plugged in after I hear the
<font color="#800000">quietest battery notification ever </font>made. It's got me very disappointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe there NEEDS to be an option to turn on a low battery notification; something that bothers the user to get their phone chargered long before it just dies (and something that is NOT an app but a firmware update). In general, I can't belive the number
 of things that are missing from this phone. I swear, the next phone that rivals the camera &amp; xenon flash of the N8, I'm buying it; esspecially if it's Android OS!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goodness Nokia.......the little things in life can break-up relationships. The N8 is on thin ice with me.</p>

<br />
That "sounds" smart, but it turns out I "miss" the battery notification feature on the N8. At LEAST it should be an
<font color="#ff6600">option</font> to enable. A loud beep every 30 minutes would do me so much more good than harm. Especially on those days we forget to make sure to have charged the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More over, it's not as if anyone can get annoyed over an additional "option" (in the firmware of course, because I wouldn't be happy with an app fix. Apps need to be always running and unfortunately the N8 restarts itself or closes apps on it's own, albeit,
 rarely.) .</p>

            T-reminder is one such application available on the OVI Store.Other than reminding for low battery it also reminds missed calls, missed messages and also when the battery charging is full. The main issue...I am not sure if it works on Nokia N8...

<h2>            Excel Conditional Formatting Top 1 exclude 0</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've seen numerous posts and answers online but no one seems to actually just answer this formula question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a column using two conditional formats:</p>
<p>- One to highlight every other row for easier visibility</p>
<p>- One to highlight the maximum value in that column, but exclude cell values of 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't just add another formatting to exclude those cells with that value because that messes up the every-other-row highlighting. I just need the working formula for the top 1 conditional formatting that excludes cell values of 0,
<em>so that the whole column isn't initially highlighted when everything is at 0</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :)</p>

    <title>New Update, Now Can&#39;t print envelope correctly through Feeder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jkc5  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Update, Now Can&#39;t print envelope correctly through Feeder</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 just updated.&nbsp; I am now trying to print an envelope through the feeder, like always.&nbsp; Using Word 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The envelope will go through the feeder, but it prints like it's on a sheet of paper.&nbsp; In other words, the print is not horizontal with the envelope, but vertical to it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have the same and correct Feed Method under Printing Options selected.&nbsp; No, I haven't done anything else to word.&nbsp; Big problem, though.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Using a Brother MFC-7440N, with the latest driver installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edited again:&nbsp; Word seems to know it, too.&nbsp; It gives me a warning that says, "Your margins are pretty small.&nbsp; It's possible some of your content will be cut off when you print.&nbsp; Do you still want to print?"&nbsp; Never received that warning before because if
 it went correctly, it wouldn't be cut off.&nbsp; The way it's printing on it though, of course it's cut off.</p>

<p>
</p><p>All updates and drivers were up to date.&nbsp; There is no print preview for envelopes, only the selection of feed methods, which was correct and hadn't changed from before the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent two hours with MS taking over my computer, but they couldn't find a problem.&nbsp; All settings were correct, but it wouldn't print properly.... Which means, it was the update that caused it to work improperly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to uninstall the update and go back to the previous build to get it to work properly.&nbsp; I was told by the tech (the third, btw) that devices (device drivers to be exact) don't always work with updates and that MS would try to work it out on another
 update.&nbsp; Well, no time for that.&nbsp; I have an office to run, and printing envelopes is a necessary part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope they work it out, but I can't wait around for them to do so.&nbsp; What bites is I now can't keep my computer up to date and have to turn off updates.&nbsp; Perhaps I'll try again next year and hope they have fixed the problem.</p>

            Do you have your photos set to get uploaded to your SkyDrive account? &nbsp;If that's enabled, "Settings" -&gt; "Backup" -&gt; "Photos" -&gt; auto upload on, then you can either install the SkyDrive desktop app for XP (if there is one) o just login into skydrive.live.com
 and access those files from there.

<p>
</p><p>I've&nbsp; tried to add a shape but it "moves" behind the video as soon as I play it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>

            While it's possible to crop a video from a file, that doesn't extend to online video. You would have to download the video as a file and insert it in PowerPoint.

                    <p>I've created this once before accidently but can't figure out how to do it again. I'm not talking about the drop-down lists but rather a sort of grouping of text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>looked like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">&gt; Name of drop-down</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">and if the arrow was clicked whatever was written/pasted there would show, it meant i could have 10+ pages on one page and simply open the one with what i was interested in. Please help!</p>

<p>What you're showing is what Word does when you apply one of the built-in Heading styles to a paragraph. The little triangle at the left end of the paragraph (when the mouse hovers over that paragraph)) expands or collapses all the text and lower-level headings,
 down to but not including the next heading of the same style. If you right-click in a heading paragraph, the popup menu has an Expand/Collapse item that does the same thing.</p>

            The My Phone service has been discontinued by Microsoft and Microsoft is currently migrating your contacts and some of the other data that is currently stored in your My Phone account to your SkyDrive account.&nbsp; The migration should be completed by October
 6th, when the service will be terminated and the My Phone website will go dark.<br />
<br />
There is no way you can download your contacts directly from the My Phone site to your computer, so you'll have to wait until Microsoft migrates your data to your SkyDrive account.&nbsp; Once the contact data is migrated to your SkyDrive account you can download
 the contacts to your computer. <br />

            <p>Download the ISO file from here, and windows will take care of everything.<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/preview-iso</p>
<p>
</p><p>open the iso,no need of pendrive or DVD..<br />
</p>
<p>you should not proceed if you don't want to reinstall all the softwares after the upgrade!</p>

            No. I did need a USB pen drive as I had to use the boot from usb bios option to recover my system. I would suggest that anyone using Beta versions of windows has the boot priority set to usb first as they may need to do what I did.

            <p>If you can boot from the current os..you should be able to just open the windows10 ISO file...</p>
<p>windows will store your system status,and will restart to upgrade!</p>
