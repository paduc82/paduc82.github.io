<h2>            Business Contact Manager &#40;BCM&#41; and Office 365 without Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi All.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing problems getting BCM to work correctly with Office 2013 (Office 365) with data migrated from BCM on another system running with Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Customer has been using BCM with Outlook 2010 on their Windows 7 laptop. </li><li>Customer has a new Windows 8.1 laptop and is now using Office 365 Business Premium with the desktop applications installed including Outlook 2013. Note that Outlook 2010 is not present on the new laptop.</li><li>BCM was installed on the new laptop using the package at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36513</a>.</li><li>Installing the update&nbsp;<span>from&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://products.office.com/en-NZ/Outlook/download-business-contact-manager-for-outlook-2013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://products.office.com/en-NZ/Outlook/download-business-contact-manager-for-outlook-2013</a>&nbsp;was
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>unsuccessful</strong></span>. <br />
The install package did not run because it could not find a suitable required application (Outlook 2010?) on the system.</span></li><li>BCM appears in Outlook 2013.</li><li>BCM data was migrated from BCM in Outlook 2010 on the old laptop using the backup procedure and the restore procedure on the new laptop.</li><li>All the original BCM accounts and contacts were restored.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem #1:</span></p>
<p>The restored BCM contacts fields are incorrect. For example, e-mail addresses that were in the Email field with BCM + Outlook 2010 now appear in the Email2 field in BCM with Outlook 2013. A<span>ttempting to change the
 fields results in wrong and unrelated fields appearing. E.g. Selecting Email will result in the data being stored in some other field.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem #2:</span></p>
<p>Linking between BCM accounts and contacts has been lost. (Probably related to #1).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem #3:</span></p>
<p>Adding a new contact record manually, the default fields are incorrect (eg. Email2 instead of Email),&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I expect these issues have resulted because the update to allow BCM to run with Outlook 2013 couldn't be installed, so the data fields don't match.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Questions:</span></p>
<p>How can the required update be installed when Outlook 2010 is not present?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to 'fool' the update into running by installing Outlook 2010 temporarily?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice will be very appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scott</p>

</p><p>Hi Scott, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with the update not getting installed. BCM 2013 with Office 2013 is broken. Microsoft is aware of the issue. but there is no ETA on when it would be fixed.

<h2>            Warning at top of some Microsoft pages.</h2>
                    On some Microsoft pages, I've begun getting an announcement saying "You are offline waiting for your internet to reconnect", also one in a blue field saying "If you are having trouble connecting to the internet try right clicking Start then Restart not
 Shut Down for your computer". My WiFi is working perfectly and my computer is connected to the internet. On those same pages, when I try to sign in with my Microsoft account, I get sent to the sign page then back to the original page but I'm still not signed
 in.

            Norton has had some issues with the latest preview builds, don't know if Norton has updated to the newer builds as of yet, as I don't run any other 3rd party programs except Malwarebytes, be interested if Norton was Removed and if the issue is still there
 it can always be reinstalled as this is what the Program is about.

<p>I've used Malwarebytes in the past with so-so results. I used McAfee previously but it doesn't work at all with Preview builds; Norton had an issue with some earlier Preview builds so I did remove it for awhile but the problem is fixed now. I will try Malwarebytes
 but I really don't expect anything from it.<br />

<p>I haven't seen this problem for a bit now so hopefully it resolved itself. Perhaps there was an issue with my internet provider? Not sure at this point.<br />

When you open the file using the "Recover Text From Any File" converter, do you see any readable text? In that case, you should copy it over to a new document and reformat. It may be the best you can do.

            I have a Word XP/2003 file that opened without problem in Word 2007, in Vista. Then I upgraded to Windows 7. Now I cannot open that file anymore, it's reported to be corrupted.
<div><br />
<div>However, on a different computer (Windows 7/Word 2007) the same file opens without problem. The mysterious ways how Windows/Word can fail are numerous.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>

<h2>            Missing Dialog Box for Symbols</h2>
                    
<p>When I started up Word today,&nbsp;the&nbsp;drop-down dialog box that allows you to select various sympbols&nbsp;was missing.&nbsp;If I&nbsp;click on the Symbol icon I see a dropdown menu that has a few symbols in it and a More Symbols selection.&nbsp; Clicking on&nbsp;More Symbols does not&nbsp;do
 anything. &nbsp;I have tried resetting the toolbars and I tried starting from a fresh normal.dot template.&nbsp; Neither restored the dialog.&nbsp; The Dialog box still works when I use Excel but not Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do to get it back?</p>

<p>Thanks for your replies.&nbsp; I took both of your suggestions - but no success.</p>
<p>I tried to repair the office suite.&nbsp; When it got stuck at the printer, I reinstalled the printer driver.&nbsp; That didn't work to restore the symbols.&nbsp; Nor did it allow the repair to progress.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I removed the printer completely and ran the repair.&nbsp; The repair
 was able to complete its process this time.&nbsp; But when I went back to Word, there were still not symbols showing up!!!</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on the Symbol icon in Word, the drop menu appears with a few select symbols.&nbsp; But when I click "more" it seems like it is looking for something for a few seconds and then nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand you're having issue opening a shared Excel file on your OneDrive account. We appreciate all the information you've provided together with the screenshots on this thread.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask a few questions that will help us on analyzing this concern. Can you please verify if you're having this issue on other
<strong>.xlsm </strong>files that was shared to you?&nbsp;Does&nbsp;the same issue occur when you download the file, upload it on your OneDrive account then open the file? How about opening other file types, do you get the same issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>3&nbsp;things I forgot to mention in the original post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) All users trying to access the file that are receiving this error&nbsp;do not have a Microsoft/onedrive account.&nbsp; Do all users attempting to access the shared file need one of these accounts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) When getting these users Microsoft/onedrive accounts the error no longer continued (work around)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) the original *xlsm has a unique Marco embedded in it as well.&nbsp; Possible issues stemming from that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please verify if you're having this issue on other <strong>.xlsm </strong>
files that was shared to you?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-No other .xlsm files open normally</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does&nbsp;the same issue occur when you download the file, upload it on your OneDrive account then open the file?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-No, due to the fact that I'm using a Microsoft/onedrive account (see above)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about opening other file types, do you get the same issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>-No other *.docx and *.pptx open fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm thinking either the users need an Microsoft/onedrive account to open the file, or the file is possibly corrupt.&nbsp; Any other thoughts?</p>

<h2>            Rollback Does Not Work</h2>
                    Need to roll back my production PC to the last public release. Am on 17025.1 and it is causing issues with some of my other programs. I tried doing the optout thing under Insider Tab of settings and security but nothing happens. Readings recommend fresh
 install of windows 10 but that seems extreme and complicated. Can I wait for the next public release then simply stop updates or opt out then? Hopefully there is a less complicated option&nbsp;

<p>It sounds like you are in the Slow ring</p>

            The simplest solution is to opt out now.&nbsp; You will continue to receive Slow Ring builds until version 1803 releases to the public next Spring, at which time your device will be automatically returned to the release channel.&nbsp; That is the graceful method.&nbsp;
 This is why it is inadvisable to use preview builds on a production device.

<p>The way it looks things could get better with new builds but things could get worse also.</p>

</p><p>Things you should do to prepare for the worse case scenario if you did not make a system Image to an external drive of your system when it was working good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back up all of your files and images that are important to you on an external device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have the installation software to reinstall your apps maybe you can get that online.</p>
<p>But if it is possible to download your software to reinstall it's not such a bad thing to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are totally prepared you can go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>and download the Media Creation Tool and start fresh and only have to reinstall your software plus retrieve your files and images from your backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At that time if you enjoy testing Insider builds you have many safe choices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The safest is buy a used computer that already has Windows 10 installed and Activated then join it to the Insiders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next so I hear is run windows 10 on a VM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last would be like I do and that is multi boot.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do that is if you have a desktop add a couple of drives then Install Insiders on one and backup everything on the third.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you Joe, CrazyKatz, Colin &amp; Cal54 for your quick support. I appreciate it very much. I believe the most conservative thing I will do is wait for the April public release and then opt out of further updates on my regular machine. Have managed a work
 around on needed software and all that remains is the inconvenience of not being able to update iCloud or reinstall iTunes. it appears files are not being recognized or missing for that but present versions are working so not a show stopper. These issues are
 outside scope of this forum so no worries on further discussion</p>
<p>

<p>Actually 17025.1000 has been great on my machine and I beat the crap out of it, from open source programs to favorites like notepad++ and irfranview64. Perhaps check your programs for updates, there isn't much that

    <title>Auto-tagging bug for Broad Match Modifier keywords - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dericglp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto-tagging bug for Broad Match Modifier keywords</h2>
                    <p>I believe that stats about +broad +match +modified keywords are being tagged/sent to Google analytics incorrectly. I think the plus character is being used directly in the "utm_term" field, rather than being url encoded. I see no keywords with plus symbols
 in Analytics, but all of my exact match keywords are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>E.g. My Bing keyword +bing +keyword is generating the following url (as seen in server side logs):</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.mysite.com/page.html?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=My-Campaign&amp;utm_term=+bing%20+keyword</p>
<p>
</p><p>But shouldn't it be as follows, with the plus character url encoded??</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.mysite.com/page.html?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=My-Campaign&amp;utm_term=%2Bbing%20%2Bkeyword</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: A quick test shows this is the case. Can we get this fixed?</p>

    <title>SharePoint 2013 online mark a list item - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint 2013 online mark a list item</h2>
                    <p>I have a SharePoint site collection list which is used by external&nbsp;providers to&nbsp;bid for jobs.&nbsp; Once they have bid the package stays live to allow other bids, however, some providers are occasionally bidding on a job again as they have forgotten they have
 already bid on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way within a SharePoint list that a provider could some how mark a list entry as bid on, this would not be able to be edited by other providers (or seen if possible)?&nbsp; But the list entry would need to allow multiple providers to mark it as bid
 on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The providers have read permissions to the site collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed description.</p>
<p>Based on your description, you want to find way to show the providers whether they have bid or not. And the providers only have read permissions to the list which means they can’t edit items in the list.</p>
<p>As my experience, the possible solution is that you can create a multiple choice column or a managed metadata column in the list, and preset providers’ names as the options or term set. After they send email to your company, your list admin can manually
 change the information to the column to show the provider’s name to remind that they have bid for this job.</p>
<p>For how to create and use the choice column or managed metadata column, please refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/List-and-library-column-types-and-options-0d8ddb7b-7dc7-414d-a283-ee9dca891df7?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
List and library column types and options</a>.</p>
<p>You also can follow some suggestions from community members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

    <title>Office 365 Forms Loading Screen Hangs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kamakinto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Forms Loading Screen Hangs</h2>
                    <p>I am developing a solution for students to be able to use either their phone or computer to fill out an Office 365 Forms form.</p>
<p>there is a setting to only allow people in my organization (students) to fill out the form. When this setting is enabled, a link to the form is created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to access this link from a mobile device, the browser hangs on a Loading screen, and the user never gets to the form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enable "Anyone with the link (sign-in not required)", I am able to access the form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to believe that the form cannot be filled out from a mobile device unless we open up the form to the entire world. ie: I have to select "Anyone with the link" in order for users to fill out the form on mobile devices. &nbsp;is this indeed the case
 or am I doing something wrong? and if it is indeed possible to fill out an Organization-specific form on a mobile device, is there any work-around to allow users to authenticate to Office 365 from a mobile device?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really trying my best to utilize these products, but it is difficult when we cant even implement a basic form from desktop and mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very Respectfully,&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Yes, I have done some tests. For my test results, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and Android 6.0.1 works fine, however, just as you mentioned, iPhone 5 did not work as expect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given the situation, I’d like to invite you to submit feedback via the steps: click more options (<strong>...</strong>) on the upper right corner of the forms -&gt;click
<strong>Feedback</strong>. This is best way to perfect our products.</span></p>

<p><span>Glad to hear that it worked in your iPhone 6s. This will also indicate that the issue may due to the specific mobile phone(your iPhone 5).</span></p>

</p><p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting popup warnings originating from Windows 10 mail app telling me: "Your Outlook account settings are out of date".</p>
<p>When I click on "Fix account", I get: "Something went wrong. Error code: 0x80070525"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I don't even use that built-in app since I prefer Outlook desktop client. I have no problem whatsoever logging to my Outlook account or sending/receiving mail with my desktop program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plz tell me how to fix this pb as those constant messages popping up on my screen are terribly annoying.</p>

            You should be able to remove the account from within the Windows 10 Mail app without changing your PC's login. Do you even see the Delete Account option in Windows 10 Mail?

<h2>            Insider 15048 - Forward&#47;Back gestures no longer working in Edge</h2>
                    <p>Hello all - just installed 15048 via the Slow Ring on my new HP Spectre x360 w/ Synaptics touchpad. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two-finger swipes to go Forward/Back in Edge are no longer working.&nbsp; I've confirmed that the touchpad is registering two-finger swipes in other programs just fine, and vertical two-finger scrolling still works in Edge.&nbsp; So apparently it's something in
 Edge itself rather than a touchpad/driver issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2013 home and student powerpivot option</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask if there is a possibility to activate powerpivot option in Excel 2013 home and student version. I know that originally this feature is not available in Excel 2013 h&amp;s nevertheless I heard that it is possible to upgrade this version to
 Standalone and get powerpivot active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I it true that this kind of upgrade can be done</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes, you can buy and install Standalone Excel to get PowerPivot.&nbsp; Then you could simply install it over the existing Office installation to get access to the new feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, your problem is that MS no longer sells any 2013 products, and I think it will be very difficult to find Excel 2013 anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, apparently MS is "improved" the 2016 installer so that it automatically uninstalls all older versions.&nbsp;&nbsp; IF you have the MSI installer of Office 2013 (rather than CTR/Click to Run), in theory you could install Excel 2016 first, then do a custom install
 of Office 2013, excluding Excel 2013.&nbsp; But, mixing Office application versions will probably break the functionality that allows you to link content from one file type to another ...</p>

<h2>            How to reinstall my office 2013 &#40;Office Home and Business 2013&#41; on my laptop again.</h2>
                    Hello Dear All,<br />
<br />
I got the problem on outlook 2013. Incoming mail is working, Ok. But outgoing mail doesn't go out from outbox. And try so many ways. There are not work. Therefore, I uninstall my office (Office Home and Business 2013) which brought on line (24, Feb, 2012).
 Now I could not reinstall again anymore.<br />
I have tried so many ways to reinstall on my laptop.<br />
&nbsp;But I always got error messages like below<br />
<b>1.&nbsp; "This Product Key has already been redeemed. A Product Key can only be used once to set up your Microsoft account. Please go to www.office.com/myaccount to sign in and install Office. If you continue having problems, please contact support"</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<b>&nbsp;2.</b>&nbsp; <b>"</b> <b>Windows cannot find 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\ClientX64\integratedoffice.exe'. Make sure you've typed the name correctly, then try again."</b>
<br />
<b>3.</b>&nbsp; <b>"We're sorry, we had a problem installing your Office program(s).<br />
Is your internet connection working? Do you have enough free space on your main hard drive?<br />
Please try installing again after you've checked the above."</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>Please help me how to reinstall again.</b></u><br />
Now I have reinstalled to use &amp; work my office 2010 again. Because, I have to work everday.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

<h2>            Outlook for Mac</h2>
                    
<p>just installed O365 for Mac. &nbsp;How do you set up the standard view &nbsp;in Outlook (similar to Windows) that displays email, calendar, Lync, tasks, etc. all on one 'pane of glass'? &nbsp;as an example, folders on the left, messages in middle and calendar and upcoming
 events on the right. &nbsp;Currently i only see mail and i have to switch views to get to calendar and tasks.</p>

<p>hi rob,<br />
<br />
firstly, i’d like to confirm whether your required scenario is like the screenshot below:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=07936f7f-1fc4-47c7-8cd8-ab80592e0201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d07936f7f-1fc4-47c7-8cd8-ab80592e0201" /></a><br />
if so, based on my tests in outlook for mac client, there are no options to set the view like above. given the situation, you can submit feedback regarding this feature via the link below:<br />
