<h2>            If I don&#39;t have a working copy of Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010</h2>
                    <p>I have an over abundance of Microsoft Office Pro Plus 2010 security updates. The program came with my PC as a trial and I wasn't about to buy a yearly program so I have never used it.&nbsp; I do have the Microsoft Office starter.&nbsp; Can I remove all these updates?
 Also if I take the Pro Plus off my computer will that also remove my Microsoft Office starter? I mean I need some kind of word processor in order to send messages and use my notepad right? Please be kind I am blonde and Microsoft is not really blonde friendly.&nbsp;
 I am running Windows 7 32bit.&nbsp; The reason I ask this question is because the last update for Micro Office Pro March 17th was 78 updates and now it seems my Paintshop Pro has a glitch if freezes every 5 minutes for one minute and then unfreezes only to freeze
 again in 5 min. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any wise information to my problem</p>
<p>Marilyn</p>

<p>They have different installer and if you remove Pro Plus, you will keep starter.</p>
<p>Just make sure you have two separate installer file one for Starter and another for Pro Plus.</p>

<p>First, thanks for adding your comments to the thread "Unable to install Paintshop Pro 2019 on win 7 computer."&nbsp; Your advice should be helpful to the person who originally asked the question there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your PSP glitch may or may not be related to all of those Office updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Office Starter was a free add-on installed by some computer manufacturers.&nbsp; Microsoft never made Office Starter available as a separate product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A trial version of Microsoft Office Pro Plus 2010 may also have been installed by the computer manufacturer.&nbsp; Usually Office Pro Plus 2010 was a "buy it once and have it forever" product, but Microsoft started Office 365 (its "subscription" version of Office)
 with Office 2010, so it's possible that your trial version may be Office 365, which does require an annual fee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2010, by the way, reaches "end of support" in October 2020, about 9 months after Windows 7 has reached "end of support."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you uninstall all versions of Office, you can still use Notepad and WordPad (although WordPad is a very limited word processing application).&nbsp; You also can install LibreOffice (<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.libreoffice.org/</a>)
 or OpenOffice (<a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.openoffice.org/download/</a>), both of which are free suites of productivity applications similar to and compatible with the applications included in
 Microsoft Office.&nbsp; Both include a word processor (like Word), a spreadsheet application (like Excel), a presentation application (like PowerPoint), etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start, type appwiz.cpl into the Search box, and press Enter to show the list of installed applications.</p>
<p>Scroll down and look at all of the lines that start with Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>What versions of Microsoft Office do you have?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that, rather than reply with that information here, you start a new question in the Office section of Microsoft Community.&nbsp; I think you'll get better help from the Office experts there.&nbsp; Include the answer to my question in bold above in your new
 question and copy/paste your question from this thread and/or provide a link back to this thread.</p>

<p>If you didn't get a product key for Office 2010 Pro Plus you might as well uninstall it. It does not make sense to waste the space for a version of Office that is not working and to waste download capacity for Office updates you do not use.&nbsp; The Office 2010
 Pro Plus update should not have any effect at all on Paintshop Pro. That is a totally separate program, nothing to do with MS or Office. If it has problem, you should find their website to ask for help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pro Plus and Starter are separate installations, so uninstalling one does not affect the other.&nbsp; But, if you have Office 2010 starter installed, after uninstalling Office Pro Plus you should do an Office Repair of Starter to reset all of the pointers in
 Windows to point to Starter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2010 Starter was a factory installed "free" version that was a replacement for "MS Works" that used to be bundled for free with new computers. 2010 Starter is functionally similar to the free Office Online applications that you can now use as part
 of your MS email account. &nbsp; Because 2010 Starter was factory installed, the installer file was very hard to find. If you do happen to have the installer file, "in theory" you are not allowed to install it on your computer because according to the license terms,
 only the factory was allowed to install that version. But MS doesn't check ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Notepad is a very simple text editor bundled with Windows. It is only intended to be used for text only files like DOS Batch files</p>
<p>
</p><p>WordPad is a simple "word processor". Think of it as a dumbed down version of Word. It is adequate for simple documents.&nbsp; Word online has more features than Wordpad.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want more "full function" Office type applications there are a number of free or cheap Office alternatives. If you are interested I can give you some links to reviews and download for these alternatives.&nbsp; They are not identical to the MS applications,
 but they do have most of the same features, you just have to figure out the new names for the features.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2007 files downloaded from intranet - cells do not recalculate automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I post Excel 2007 files on a webserver on my corporate intranet. When I download and open these files using Office 2016 for Mac (v16.9) all formulas are calculated when the file is opened. My users generally use Windows, and on Excel in Office 365, the
 formula cells just show 0 until the user edits the cell and hits enter. This is a real nuisance for them. What security settings do they need to change to make the behaviour the same as on the Mac? NB this only affects those users who now have Office 365.
 On earlier versions it works as per the Mac.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the issue only happens when the file is generated via PHPExcel, I would suggest you also contact PHPExcel support to see if they have any updates about the issue. In the following link, a user shared his solution about the issue. you may try it to see
 if it works for you.</p>

<p>Hi WillSpencer,</p>
<p>To clarify the scenario and find the root cause, could you confirm the following details?</p>
<p>1. Could you share with us your detailed steps to disable MFA for these users in Azure AD so that we can try to reproduce the issue?
<br />
2. A screenshot about the error message will be appreciated.<br />
3. Does the issue occur to other global admins in your organization?</p>

<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>I'am having the same problem too. My problem appeared after my test to enable and disable MFA via powershell. I repeatedly enable and disable MFA on my test account in a short time until this error apear. Via portal is the error same as for WillSpencer and
 Marchelo. In powershell the error is:</p>
<p>Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName "&lt;my user upn&gt;" | Set-MsolUser -StrongAuthenticationRequirements @() -Debug</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.Online.Administration.Automation.UniquenessValidationException,Microsoft.Online.Administration.Automation.SetUser</p>
<p>I don't known how to correctly repair this error. On my test account only helps, if I delete account and remove them from recycle bin and create new one. For real account this step is unusable, because all user data in office 365 will be deleted.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>In order to narrow down this issue, could you let us know the following information?</p>
<p>1. Does this issue happen to all users with MFA enabled?</p>
<p>2. Do all global admins meet the issue?</p>
<p>3. Could you confirm if the error only occurs in the Azure portal or it happens in
<a href="https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/UserManagement/MultifactorVerification.aspx?culture=en-US&amp;BrandContextID=O365&amp;ruO365=https%3a%2f%2fportal.office.com%2fAdmin%2fDefault.aspx%23ActiveUsersPage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
O365 portal </a>as well?</p>
<p>Besides, the tenant information is also needed for further investigation. If you are not a tenant administrator, either check with your workplace/school tech support team for updates on the status of your service or have them engage with us on this thread.
 Would you please let tenant administrators contact me via Private Messages to provide this information by clicking on the link below:<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Frank</p>

<p>Hi Frank</p>
<p>1. This issue didn't &nbsp;happen to all users, but only to some accounts on which I enable and disable MFA repeatedly in short time via PowerShell.</p>
<p>2. Yes all Global admins</p>
<p>3. This error occur in O365 portal and via PowerShell. In Azure portal I didn't test this, by I hope, result will be the same. Something are wrong saved on MFA for this account, if I change state form enable to disable and vice versa in short time.</p>

<p>Hi antongarden,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If for whatever reason a download or install fails this may cause an incomplete change to the phone filesystem. It may be a good idea to perform a reset when this happens and you suspect something is not working right afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>First create a backup in <a href="http://nokia.com/nokiasuite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Suite</a> (Tools/Backup) but when asked deselect inclusion of settings in the backup.
</li><li>Reset the phone by dialing *#7370# and the security code 12345 (when asked). </li><li>After the reset check for and install any updates in Nokia Suite. Re-install the latest system software if offered.
</li><li>Restore the backup from Nokia Suite (Tools/Restore). </li><li>Re-install Maps as required using Nokia Suite. </li><li>You can now reinstall your apps from&nbsp;<a href="http://store.nokia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Store</a>. Paid apps can be found in your&nbsp;<a href="http://store.ovi.com/mystuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">personal section.</a>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Kosh</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought C6-01 in Nov'11. Eveything was fine till a few weeks back, when I updated the software. First, the application download "OVI Store" went off so no additional application for me. Tried reformating and restoring factory setting as well. Still no solution.
 Now, even the map upgrade is not happening. I also noticed a few instances to the instrument getting stuck forcing me to remove battery to do anything...even restart. Dunno, what to do with this m/c now???? ANy help would be of great help.</p>

            Any solution from anybody??? While trying out all suggestions from the discussion board, lost two external disks as well with a message as "memory card corrupted". Visited Nokia Care but to them problem is external memory card?? Shall try convincing them
 once more. Seems it is a super complicated issue without solution. Frankly loosing faith over NOKIA...high price for poor quality and poor after sales service..

<p>Hi Jessica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an article about how to change the proofing language:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/check-spelling-and-grammar-in-a-different-language-667ba67a-a202-42fd-8596-edc1fa320e00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check spelling and grammar
 in a different language</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the <strong>Review </strong>tab, in the <strong>Language</strong> group, click
<strong>Language</strong>, and then click <strong>Set Proofing Language</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using OneNote for Windows, there is no Review tab and the setting is in Settings &gt; Options. The OneNote for Windows 10 only has basic proofing functions:&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t see contacts and conversations from my old Facebook-created - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haikuheard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t see contacts and conversations from my old Facebook-created account</h2>
                    <p>Well...might as well add mine to the pile. I have, as requested, downloaded the new version of Skype for Mac, and gone through the 'transfer' process, but none of my contacts have been copied across from the old Facebook-created account. Given other people's
 complaints and the lack of adequate response to them, it seems maybe the old info is now gone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the text from the email about this in December. As this didn't seem a big deal, I didn't make it a priority to sort it out. If you had, on the other hand, said you would be deleting all my contacts, I probably would have done something about it
 quite quickly (e.g. transferred contacts myself while it was still possible). Silly me thinking MS might make it a smooth experience for me! I think you might agree this was quite a misleading message though. I am hoping there is a way to fix this, please!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help much appreciated.</p>

    <title>SharePoint O365 Calendar Double Booking Feature - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slwhite2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint O365 Calendar Double Booking Feature</h2>
                    When setting up a calendar for the booking of conference rooms&nbsp;I want to make sure users cannot double book the rooms. I have read a bit about this, but is there a way to do this without setting up a bunch of resources. For instance we have over50 conference
 rooms. It sure would be nice to be able to click on a button which says don't allow double bookings on this calendar. Any ideas?

    <title>IE 11 Temporary files are missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pbike908  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE 11 Temporary files are missing</h2>
                    <p>Helllo, I am using Windows 8.1 and have installed all updates.&nbsp; IE 11 was working fine a couple of days ago until I ran the Windows app troubleshooter.&nbsp; I recall a message informing me that temp files were installed in the wrong location and I answered "yes"
 to correct it.&nbsp; Upon completion, my IE 11 no longer worked properly.&nbsp;Visited Hyperlinks will no longer "show as marked."&nbsp; And when I try to download files in IE 11, nothing happens--no yellow box, no attempt, no error message etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I traced the problem down to missing IE 11 temporary files confirmed my clicking the Internet Options, General Tab, and then clicking settings down by browsing history.&nbsp; There is no path or file name.&nbsp; I have tried clearing history files, deleting history
 files, resetting internet options and nothing will recreate the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have another user on the computer, and it behaves similarly. If I create a new user, IE 11 works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no other issues with IE or windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have traced the problem down to some sort of corruption in the User accounts.&nbsp; Is there&nbsp; away to correct this short of "cleaning up user accounts?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Chrome Browser of course works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Well, I fixed my problem. &nbsp;For some odd reason Windows App Troubleshooter thinks that my internet temporary files are located in the wrong directory and if I tell it to fix the problem it moves them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this link for how to edit the registry. &nbsp;After doing this, problem solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason Windows App troubleshooter wants to relocate my internet temp files to a long since deleted user account. &nbsp;Ironically I think it wants to relocate them to the original account I created on my computer--an account I long ago deleted. &nbsp;Furthermore,
 Windows App Troubleshooter relocated internet temp files from MULTIPLE USERS on this laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows App Troubleshooter does prompt whether or not to relocate the files, but common sense would tell any user that if App Troubleshooter thinks they are in a wrong directory they probably are. WRONG!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 is such a tease. &nbsp;I bought it early on and have suffered through all the trials and tribulations. &nbsp;I keep thinking each update is gonna finally bring stability, only to find out another silly issue is always lurking around the corner. &nbsp;One would
 think after 25 years of Windows Microsoft would finally figure it out.</p>

    <title>Can I change my Input tool to previous Win mobile ver&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jedchin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I change my Input tool to previous Win mobile ver&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>With Win Mobile 6.1,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;I am forced to accept the&nbsp;auto-suggested word (when pressing space or enter) although it may not be correct. With previous version, I&nbsp;can pick up the word from the auto-list only if I need it.</p>
<p>2. I am required to press enter or space after each word. Failing to do it, I will have 2 repeated words. For eg, I key in "cat" and move my cursor to another field, the word "cat" stays in the memory. So if I continue typing "dog" and press
 enter, I will see "catdog". </p>
<p>3.&nbsp;"catdog" furthermore automatically gets stored in my auto suggestion dictionary, although I know how to reset this memory. I still prefer the "+" feature, where I can voluntarily add any word into my auto-dictionary.</p>
<p>4. choosing the&nbsp;suggested word no longer has auto spacing. It is quite common that if a complete word is choose, a space is required. The probability of keying comma or full-stop is much lesser than having space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would appreciate guidance in eradicating the above problems, which I believe can be altered easily through registry.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, but sorry to say that I have tried your suggestion before writing in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, the settings are not as sophisticated as it can be. They are just basic settings. Back to my problems again. I will clarify more i you do not understand my queries:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;I am forced to accept the&nbsp;auto-suggested word (when pressing space or enter) although it may not be correct. With previous version, I&nbsp;can pick up the word from the auto-list only if I need it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- auto-suggested words are still necessary, but I hope to have previous function where I only use it when I pick it. With this ver6.1, the system just selected the words automatically when Enter or Space is pressed. So many times, I have to
 use backspace just because the suggested words aren't the one I need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. I am required to press enter or space after each word. Failing to do it, I will have 2 repeated words. For eg, I key in "cat" and move my cursor to another field, the word "cat" stays in the memory. So if I continue
 typing "dog" and press enter, I will see "catdog". </p>
<blockquote>
<p>- This seems like a system fault and there is no way I can do anything with the simple settings you suggested.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.&nbsp;"catdog" furthermore automatically gets stored in my auto suggestion dictionary, although I know how to reset this memory. I still prefer the "+" feature, where I can voluntarily add any word into my auto-dictionary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- this again is system fault, as I didn't ask it to input another non-dictionary word I keyed in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. choosing the&nbsp;suggested word no longer has auto spacing. It is quite common that if a complete word is choose, a space is required. The probability of keying comma or full-stop is much lesser than having space.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- this feature is not important as long as all the above are solved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make simpler, I wish I can have the input system of possibly Windows mobile 5 or earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also encountered many other problem such as phone pad, which I wish to voice out. Sincerely hope you can solve my problems above first.</p>

    <title>Chat commands have been killed off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ojlord  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chat commands have been killed off</h2>
                    So I recently got off Discord to a bit to use Skype, and I created a pretty big group chat... Only to sincerely regret all of my life decisions. There is now NO way to configure the chat options, except for a few lousy settings. Even those were only the
 bare minimum - being able to prevent others from joining the chat and seeing the chat history. If you haven't figured it out from the title, my question is WHY has the Skype team removed all the configurability of group chats? Is it just because it wasn't
 used by many people? Is it too resource-intensive? Or maybe I'm just being stupid and there's some hidden way to access these features. But for someone who has enjoyed the luxury of the many options Discord provides its users, this was a huge shock to me.
 Obviously, I'd like to see the chat commands return. Thoughts?

<p>I agree all commands should return. Especially ones to diagnose Skype issues to see where you're logged in at and force logouts. I use Skype Classic as almost all features broken or ripped from UWP versions are there and it's regularly updated. I don't see
 this as a solution though as critical functionality should be in all versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get this from the Skype download page if you change the dropdown option.

<p>

Generally speaking, if we change the credentials, we should re-run the&nbsp;AAD&nbsp;sync&nbsp;wizard with the new admin account.

<h2>            Image Compression in Word 2011 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to include a screen shot grab in Word.&nbsp; When I view the image in the "crop" scenario it is full resolution, but when I close out of the crop setting it gets blurry.&nbsp; It's not very drastic, but it is still clearly being compressed.&nbsp; The second
 image is after I have gone to "Compress" and changed it to "Keep Current Resolution" but it still does not give me the image quality you can see during the Crop.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a code online and followed a download link which i burned to a disk for backup so the original install was from a disk using the code and i then went on to activate my office via my microsoft account. i have attempted reinstalling using the same
 disk and code. It says that this product is not associated with my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no other versions or multiple instalations of office on the computer. having just reinstalled windows it running smooth with little software on yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm starting to worry that i may have been given a fradulant key although it activated fine and all appeared genuine. I can send you images of the notices i'm reciving if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>David</p>

    <title>Nokia E61 Date and Time settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarfarazic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia E61 Date and Time settings</h2>
                    I have Nokia E61, and not sure if I am the only one facing this issue...<br />
<br />
Whenever I switch off and switch on the phone. it asks for time and date each time. (I am not removing/touching the battery)<br />
<br />
I also have Good client installed and works perfect, only issue is, if I dial out any number it close the GPRS (Data) connection. I checked with my GPRS service provider, they say that its handset feature to have both simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Please suggest any help on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks...

I think that you have to set up your current time zone. Check it please. To set it up go to Clock application -&gt; Settings -&gt; Time Zone.<br />

            Hello,<br />
In this case please bring your phone to nearest Nokia's Service Center. I guess that is the internal battery failure.<br />
