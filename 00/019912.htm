<h2>            eMail Notifications of Shared Document Change for personal office 365 onedrive</h2>
                    I note that it is possible to get alerts when there has been a change to a shared document with the business version, but cannot find anything for a personal copy. Is it possible to do this with a personal copy either for individual document or on all
 one drive documents in office 365. Thanks

    <title>Installing Office Mobile 6.1 on SMT 5800 Fails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installing Office Mobile 6.1 on SMT 5800 Fails</h2>
                    
<p>I downloaded WM Office 6.1 in an attempt to install Mobile Office on my verizon&nbsp;HTC SMT&nbsp;5800.&nbsp; (I have the document viewers on the phone and can read office files (if they have been saved in pre-2007 format)).&nbsp; When
 I go to install Office on the phone I get an error message:&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cannot copy the file.&nbsp; Make sure the mobile device is connected, that the mobile device has space available and is not write protected and that all setup programs on the device have been completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device is connected.&nbsp; I have plenty of memory.&nbsp; The installation dialogue says the software takes 3 megs and I have 32 megs available.&nbsp; I am able to move other files to the device.&nbsp; I looked at tasks and there were
 no setup programs running.&nbsp; So, I am stumped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas and thanks in advance.</p>
<p>KCGUY</p>

<p>Greetings KCGuy!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Total Access forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, WM Office is included with WM5 &amp; WM6 (and WM6.1), but is not sold seperately...
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just out of curiousity, where did you get your copy from?</p>

            Your device must have a version of Office mobile prior to 6.1 for the installation to be successful. Since your device only has a viewer, the Office 6.1 upgrade does not apply.

            <p>Yes. For example if you are using Windows you have these three alternatives:</p>
<p>A) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=51237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Suite 3</a></p>
<p>B) <a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_PC_Suite_ALL.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PC Suite 7</a></p>
<p>C)&nbsp;<a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/Nokia_Connectivity_Cable_Driver/Nokia_Connectivity_Cable_Driver.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connectivity Cable Driver</a>&nbsp;(and then configure the Modem via the Device Manager)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you face any issues with one of these approaches? In that case, please, post</p>
<ol>
<li>your concrete&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?sFreeText=XpressMusic&amp;sMakers=1&amp;sOSes=5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">phone model</a> and</li><li>which Windows version/edition you use.</li></ol>

<h2>            CAN&#39;T RSVP TO CALENDAR INVITES ON MOBILE PHONES.</h2>
                    I send calendar invites to all my vendors just as a courtesy that they have an upcoming event with us. Some receive the invite but they do not have the option of accepting it, for the operations of our company it is imperative that we receive their RSVP.
 &nbsp;Is there a setting I can use to ensure that all vendors, regardless of the phone they have, are able to accept my calendar invitation?&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>When creating an event in Outlook.com, ,make sure to click the <strong>Request responses</strong> box. Also, your main calendar needs to be used in order to tally the responses. Refer to the screenshot below:</p>

    <title>Problem with Mail Merge, Word 2010, and Attachments - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heather t.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Mail Merge, Word 2010, and Attachments</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have Word 2010 installed on my computer. One of my responsibilities has always been an e-mail merge and instead of HTML, we send the Word document as an attachment. For reasons I won't bother boring you with, it is important that what we send is an attachment,
 not embedded into the body of the email message in HTML.&nbsp; This has always been done in the past (e.g. from Word 2007) by creating the doc in Word (this would be the doc that would show as a file attachment in the emails), going through the steps to merge it
 with the data source, insert fields, etc., then on the Mailings tab going to Finish &amp;&nbsp; Merge and selecting Send Email Messages. From here I would select the Mail Format of Attachment (not HTML) and off it would go. I needed to click an "Allow" button two times
 for each message it would send, but it worked just fine.<br />
<br />
I have done this for years in 2003 and also 2007. Now I have Word 2010 installed and it doesn't work. When I follow through the process, it makes it look like the program is sending (I have to click the "allow" button, but only once...), but when I look in
 my Sent folder (I use Outlook 2010), the message is not there. Nor is it in my Outbox. It's like it just disappears. It definitely does not send, as I am testing this and nobody is getting any of the test docs I'm sending.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking there must be some security settings that changed in this version that is keeping this from working, but I can't seem to find where that setting is.&nbsp;Does anyone have&nbsp;some suggestions of where to look??<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Heather</p>

<p>This sounds like a completely different question to do with creating labels, not to do with merging to email.</p>
<p>If it is to do with labels, presumably you are</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. specifying that it is a label merge</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. choosing the label layout</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. attaching the data source</p>
<p>&nbsp;d. inserting fields into label 1 in the layout you need</p>
<p>&nbsp;e. "propagating" that layout to the other labels</p>
<p>&nbsp;f. merging to a new document (or perhaps to the printer)</p>
<p>If not, maybe you could say what you are doing differently. And if you are using ADDRESSBLOCK fields, you may need to "match fields" (although in many cases it seems to be simpler to insert the fields you need individually).</p>

 the characters which do not exist in Turkish alphabet (such as q,w, x) when needed. Does this sound feasible for Microsoft? Because when using MS Word in official writings, this always constitutes a problem for Turkish users. Is such an arrangement possible?</span></p>

    <title>Outlook 2010. Printing search results in Table View - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ferdowsi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010.  Printing search results in Table View</h2>
                    <p>I receive several hundred emails daily which are filed in various folders using rules.&nbsp; So far, so good.</p>
<p>With Outlook 2003, each day I would do a search for "sent today" and print the resulting list&nbsp;in Table View for a very useful daily log on two or three pages.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In Outlook 2010, there are two problems.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>First, after the search produces the listing, I can't disable the "preview" feature: I don't need it and it locks up my computer.&nbsp; How can this&nbsp;feature be deselected or disabled?&nbsp;</li><li>Then, when I have carefully selected "Table View" and hit Print, Outlook automatically resets itself to "Memo View" and starts printing 200-300 pages of emails instead of the 2-3 page list.</li></ul>
<p>(My "workaround" is to go to my old computer with Office 2003 and XP.&nbsp; But I need a fix, not a workaround.)</p>

            <p>You are using the instant search and searching inplace or using Advanced Find?
</p>
<p>Preview: you can't disable print preview but if you select all, it won't render the pages. However, it won't really help you since you want to print a list of messages stored in different folders. If the messages were in one folder you could print a list.
</p>
<p>Workaround: select all, copy and paste into notepad or Excel then print. </p>

<h2>            NOT RECEIVING EMAILS AT HOME ONCE CHECKED ON PHONE OR WORK COMPUTER</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought and downloaded Office on my home HP lap top computer (NOT an Apple computer).&nbsp;It's the $89 AUD a year subsription, so I think it's Office 365 in July this year 2017.&nbsp; My lap top supports Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I bought and downloaded this package, I could check my emails at work through the internet at Optus Webmail. I could also check on my Samsung phone through Optus Webmail (NOT the Optus App)&nbsp;and when I got home and checked Outlook 2010 I belive it
 was on my laptop, the emails were there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now all of a sudden, when I check my emails at work or on my phone, I open Outloook 2016 on my laptop, and the emails aren't there and they aren't recieved. I haven't changed&nbsp;any passwords or done anything different in the last two months or anything&nbsp;like
 that. I worked for the first month or so, but now it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am VERY, VERY unsavvy when it comes to tech stuff. So for the love of God, please, I beg you ---- PLEASE do not ask me overcomplicated tech stuff because I probably won't be able to answer you. I tried to ask this question a week ago and the person who
 responded wanted to know a thousand different tech questions. If I knew the answers to these tech questions - I WOULD NOT BE EMAILING MICROSOFT!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft make BILLIONS of dollars, please, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLLLLEEEEEASSSSSEEEEEE give my very easy to follow, step by step, instructions, even if it's five different things to try on how to fix this problem. Don't ask me technical questions that there
 is no way I will be able to answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated above, Microsift make BILLIONS of dollars, so I am hoping the person who gets this query will take their time and give me all of the ways I can fix this without having to email back seven hundred times with technical questions I won't be able to
 answer, just give me the ways to fix this problem step by step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, please refund my money and I will send you a bill for the new laptop I have to buy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Frustrated beyond belief consumer who is helping Microsoft make as much money as they can.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand from windows file explorer you can switch the photos by left key and right key, but you can not switch using file managers like&nbsp;Total Commander.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default file managers do not provide this feature and &nbsp;more over this is not related to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further information about this please contact the third party vendor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps, for further Windows related problems please reply.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;We have a folder with multiple photos/images. For example,</p>
<p>D:\Photo\1.jpg</p>
<p>D:\Photo\2.jpg</p>
<p>D:\Photo\3.jpg</p>
<p>D:\Photo\4.jpg</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Open "D:\Photo\" in <strong>Explorer</strong>. Click, for example, on "1.jpg". Start
<strong>metro Photos</strong> app with <strong>enabled </strong>slideshow button,&nbsp;<strong>arrows</strong> on the sides (to switch for another photos in folder) and<strong> possibility</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span>to
 switch for another photos in folder from keyboard (key "&lt;-" and "-&gt;") too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;Open "D:\Photo\" in <strong>Total Commander</strong>.&nbsp;Click, for example, on "1.jpg". Start
<strong>metro Photos</strong> app with <strong>disabled&nbsp;</strong>slideshow button,
<strong>without&nbsp;arrows</strong> on the sides and&nbsp;<strong>without possibility</strong>&nbsp;to switch for another photos in folder from keyboard (key "&lt;-" and "-&gt;") too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Old viewer works good—é I advise everyone to take the time and switch to it.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t access my bigpond emails.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.&nbsp; I need help. LOL When I log in to my&nbsp; bigpond webmail account it lets me type in my email addy and password but then sends me to my hotmail login.&nbsp; I can't access my bigpond webmail. So is anyone else having this experience? Maybe I missed any updates
 that were sent or have I lost all my emails from my bigpond account? Not very computer savvy so not sure what to do.
</p>

<h2>            Blank email in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am receiving blank emails for registration from one website in my outlook and hotmail accounts. The emails are delivered, but they are empty/blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to open the email in outlook, thinderbird, web version, mobile application and it is showing blank every time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I tested to receive the same email in other email providers and they are receiving it and its not blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked the website why the emails that I receive from them and they responded that this problem happens only for outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How this problem can be fixed?</p>

<p>Hi, this is not the reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the email in - outlook, web version, thinderbird and mobile application outlook, and it was blank everywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The website responded that outlooks changes the html code of the email and that's the reason why it is not displaying.</p>

<p>Maybe a line from freezing panes, it‚Äôs odd if not. Migrate your data except the LINE into a new workbook. The easiest way can do.</p>

            There is nothing to unfreeze or to do with split panels. My file is quite large with numerous charts and linked tabs. I am afraid migrating will cause issues.

            I downloaded the beta-version and started it without any problems. But now, a few days after, Finder tells me that the software can't be removed because it is running. The problem is that it's not running; I closed it after I checked it out. Now the **rn
 software won't work and i can't delete it either. So, the question is: how the h*ll do I get rid of it??<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />

<br />
some parts are still running even through the software isn't 'active'. for example, there is a plugin that provides a digital camera interface to your nokia from within iphoto.<br />
<br />
these extra components are stored in the application bundle, which apparently is in your trash can. apps are not allowed to be run from the trash, but macosx uses a journaled filesystem which shows the app in the trash even before it can be moved there physically.
 you cant empty the trash, because this app was running when it was moved to the trash.<br />
<br />
the fix: logout. or reboot if you want to be certain NO APPS are running. if it appears to be in the trash, then it will definitely be in the trash as soon as any active processes no longer depend on it - so logging out or rebooting will kill those processes
 and allow it to actually move to the trash.<br />
<br />
after this, just empty the trash as usual.<br />
<br />
note: you should experience the same with any app if you move it to the trash while it's running -- you can't empty the trash until it is no longer running. apps with background processes require that you shutdown those processes before the app is truly not
 running (you could do this by selectively killing tasks with "Activity Monitor.app" but that is more alborious than just logging out, imho)<br />

            Hi, I am using Leopard and a E65 handset and unfortunately the new version of Nokia Multimedia Transfer 1.3 (NMT 1.3) does not seem to work...<br />
As fvidal wrote, once the NMT 1.3 downloaded, nothing happened. A double-clik on the icon was fruitless.<br />
Could we please (re-)get an access to the previous version (1.2) in the meantime (the NMT 1.3 be fixed)?<br />

            I am not sure this will resolve your problem but you could try with this.<br />
1. Remove Previous NMT version from User(Admin rights)/Library/Application Support/ Nokia multimedia Transfer<br />
2. Remove files from Library/Application Support/ Nokia multimedia Transfer<br />
2. Remove chaches from System/library/chaches<br />
3. Download and install Nokia Multimedia transfer<br />
<br />
Make sure you have installed all available updates from Apple using Software Update and your phone firmware is updated.

    <title>Major ActiveSync Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> days12365  say:</h3>
<h2>            Major ActiveSync Issues</h2>
                    
<p>I have ActiveSync 4.5 running on XP Pro. I'm trying to sync it to my Exchange email account (the link on the getting started page for either synching through air or through pc doesn't work by the way), and&nbsp;I keep getting error 85020006 which simply says
 to "check" my settings. Since I can find nowhere where it says what the settings should be, I have no idea what I should be checking for.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also trying to sync my handheld with a laptop using Bluetooth which I have never been able to do. The device keeps telling me that I don't have a partnership with a Bluetooth device that supports ActiveSync. This is not true because I've used the USB
 a lot to sync to the laptop, and I believe I have created a Bluetooth partnership between the two devices. (I followed the "Help" steps at least.) I've messed with COM Ports and the whole bit, but I can't make the handheld sync with the laptop using Active
 Sync.</p>

<p>Hi days12365</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've never run into that error 85020006 and I do not use Exchange but what I usually do if I have an issue with Active Sync is go to Chris DeHerra's Pocket PC FAQ site.&nbsp; He has an incredible knowledgebase there on Active Sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if you go here: <a href="http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/activesync/tshoot-as4x-85010014.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/activesync/tshoot-as4x-85010014.htm</a>&nbsp;you might see the help you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second place I go for active sync issues is Bev Howard's site.&nbsp; Check this link:
<a href="http://bevhoward.com/bhhpj.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bevhoward.com/bhhpj.htm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that helps somewhat ... if not, get back to this post and we will try to find a solution.&nbsp; ("try" is the operative word here ... and I will try ... lol)</p>

            the sync through the phone and direct push work well. the issue is when i am trying to sync with a direct connect to my laptop.&nbsp; the laptop is logged into the work network via ethernet.&nbsp; it syncs the favorites just not the item on the exchange server and
 gives the error as described above.

            With regard to the folders, I don't think that WP8 is geared up to using folders on the device itself or handle lots of documents.&nbsp; Microsoft is wanting us to be more cloud-based, and SkyDrive does offer the ability to create and use folders.&nbsp; Sharepoint
 is also an option if you have that.

            <p>1. It is not possible to organize documents in folders on the phone memory. I know it is odd but that is just how it is :( You have to group all of them together.</p>
<p>2. Fortunately, you CAN organize everything just the save you want on SkyDrive, which is integrated beautifully both to the desktop and the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I would suggest that switch all your files to SkyDrive which can be done easily by getting the

    <title>Textbox Bug &#40;All Excel versions&#41;. Setting New Default Font - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> msd1405  say:</h3>
<h2>            Textbox Bug &#40;All Excel versions&#41;. Setting New Default Font doesn&#39;t work when pasting txt. Help please</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Is this a Bug?</strong>&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Scenario: </strong>When I create a <strong>Text Box</strong> on a worksheet and the set the default Font to<strong>ARIAL 16PT</strong>.&nbsp; I then set this as the
<strong>Default</strong> for all Text boxes (by right clicking on the Border of the box).&nbsp; All is well and any typing in the text box will be<strong>Arial 16</strong>.<strong>
</strong>Great.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> If I cut/paste any text&nbsp;within the Textbox it defaults back to Excels built in default &nbsp;<strong>Calibra (body 11).<br />
</strong><br />
In short, regardless of setting the default to a new font/size, anything copied from within the Box and then pasted back in, will default back to<strong>Calibra.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
If however I copied something from&nbsp;eg an email or even a Cell in excel,&nbsp;into the text box, then&nbsp;everyting is fine and will paste in as<strong>Arial 16.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Why can't I copy and paste data already held in the text box and for it to hold the Arial 16?&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Hope that makes sense</p>
<p>Any suggestings would be appreciated as I use text boxes for descriptions in my Invoices and I often copy/paste around the box?&nbsp;</p>

<p>No it's by design rather than a bug.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately when you copy and paste within a text box, Excel by default formats the pasted text using&nbsp;'body font'&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Fonts Theme set for the workbook, and the standard font size that is set in Excel options,
 rather than keeping the format of the source, which is annoying.&nbsp; Calibri is&nbsp;body font in the default built-in Fonts theme called 'Office'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easist way to&nbsp;change this behaviour, assuming you only want all text boxes to use Arial, is to create a special theme with the font you want.&nbsp; Do this from the Page Layout ribbon, select Fonts under Themes, and 'Create New Theme Fonts'.&nbsp; Edit the Body
 font, then name and save the Theme.</p>
<p>Now select any of&nbsp;text box&nbsp;and apply the customised Font theme.&nbsp;The font in all text boxes should adjust to the theme font.&nbsp; Copying and pasting within the text boxes will also use this font.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regard to the font size, this is based on the default font size set in Excel Options.</p>
<p>If you want to use this customised theme for all new workbooks, then you can create a customised template&nbsp;with the your customised theme pre-selected:</p>
<p>Open a blank workbook, apply your custom Fonts&nbsp;theme and then save is as a template called Book.xltx, in your XLStart folder:</p>
<p>Save As, Select Save As Type - Excel Template (*.xltx) type, change the name to Book,&nbsp; and locate it in the XLStart folder.&nbsp; In my PC (Vista) this is:C:\Users<em>\UserName</em>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\</p>
<p>All new workbooks created will then be&nbsp;based on this template.</p>

<p>Mmmm.........seems silly as Word doesn't have this issue only Excel so will still assume it is a bug.<br />
Thanks for the response and work around though.&nbsp; Wonder if there is a easier way just like it "works properly in word"&nbsp; Can MS supply a fix?<br />
<br />
<strong>Addition:</strong> I have since found when pasting into the text box there are 3 options (when right clicking):</p>
<ol>
<li>Use destination Theme (which would be the sheets default <strong>Calibra (body 11)</strong></li><li>Keep source formatting (which I believe picks my required <strong>Arial 16pt</strong> as source was is the text box itself)</li><li>Keep text only (which I assume&nbsp;pastes in using current settings) <strong>Arial 16pt</strong>
</li></ol>
<p>It seems strange that the default is <strong>No 1</strong>.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
You suggested that&nbsp; "<em>Excel by default formats the pasted text using&nbsp;'body font'&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Fonts Theme set for the workbook"</em>.&nbsp;I don't believe this is the case. Reason: if I copy the content from a Cell or even another document/email etc and paste it
 into the text box then <strong>No 3</strong>&nbsp;seems to kicks in".<strong>The problem only occures when copying text within the Text box and pasting it back!</strong></p>
<p>My question now is, how do I set the default to <strong>No&nbsp;3 </strong>?&nbsp; I certainly don't want a standard CTRL-V (Paste) to use destination (Worksheet)&nbsp;Theme.&nbsp; Obviously I would want it to be<strong>No2</strong> as that is the format I set the box to be!</p>
<p>Anybody any idea how to stop the text box from using <strong>No1</strong> as the default setting?</p>

            I'm having this issue as well and is bugging the **** out of me that I can't find a solution. I have a couple of text boxes I use for text I have to edit a lot. I keep forgetting to right click and paste with source formatting, which seems so stupid.

<p>Thanks, but I have now stumped Apple!! After much reading I was advised to delete the exchange account (Outlook 2011 for Mac). Which i managed to do, then re-install, which I have! I cannot now add the account, it fails saying cannot add account. I was somewhat
 confused so tried adding through MAC mail, same response, it also won't add the account. Getting more confused, I tried another MACBook Pro (my Dads) same result again, won't add the exchange account. (Side comment here - his exchange account, which is same
 domain as mine is still working fine on his Mac) I then &nbsp;tried a Windows based PC, guess what it worked!!! Therefore by elimination the issue is with MacBook Pro, for some reason after 8 months of seamless working function, today at 1257 GMT, something changed
 and now no-one knows what!!</p>

            <p>A couple of things could lead to these sorts of issues, but the most likely by far is that Web Services (used by Outlook for Mac and Mail to connect to Exchange server) is unreachable.</p>
<p>Outlook for Windows uses MAPI to connect so it's not affected.</p>
<p>I would contact the server administrator and ask them to check their server, but it's, by ffaaarrrrr the most likely explanation.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 and Windows 10TP dual boot. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hristoforhristov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 and Windows 10TP dual boot.</h2>
                    <p>So far, I've been testing Win10 as a virtual machine. I read the forums every day and I see that people who installed the TP on their machines have a lot of issues, so I decided to install it on my PC as a dual boot with Win 8.1 to see how it interacts with
 a real hardware. I created a new partition and installed the TP there. The dual boot works just fine, it lets me to choose a default OS, but I was amazed to see that in Win 10TP, I have a Windows.old folder which has more than 20 GB of data in it. This usually
 happens when you upgrade from one OS to another: the old OS is compressed in a Windows.old folder and you can find all of your old files in there, but you cannot use the old OS. As I said, I installed the TP on a new, completely empty partition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My question is: Why did this happen and is it safe to remove it? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everyone who answers that!</p>

            <p>The Windows.old folder might be due to upgrading from an older build. They recently introduced a feature to roll back to previous builds and, AFAIK, it needs this folder to restore the old build. In my opinion it is safe to delete it.</p>
<p>As an aside, if you are using Hyper-V for the virtual machine, you can directly boot to your Win10 in your virtual disk using Native Boot. I'm currently testing Windows 10 this way because I can always go back to Win8 and update/delete the guess OS.</p>
