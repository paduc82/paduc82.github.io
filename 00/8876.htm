<h2>            Nokia Lumia 520, Cyan update and stuck flight mode</h2>
                    <p>Good evening, everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are a lot of posts everywhere - as here, as on the WPCentral - but anyway, I'd like to have a reply from Microsoft Community directly.</p>
<p>I have Nokia Lumia 520, with Cyan update (official); updated in time, according to the delivery of this update to my carrier. Never had the developers preview installed on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the details of my phone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS version: 8.10.12393.890</p>
<p>Firmware revision number: 3058.50000.1425.0001</p>
<p>Hardware version number: 1.5.0.1</p>
<p>Software version: 2.0.242037.8</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have the flight mode stuck. Even though, Wi-Fi is working.</p>
<p>It happened two days ago, when my phone has gone out of battery charge. When I came home to charge it again. After I turned my phone on, it has been found that I can't call or receive calls, or send SMS due to the fact that the flight mode is activated.
 When I tried to deactivate it, using the quick access menu, the icon of network/flight mode started to blink, showing that the flight mode is actually activated and deactivated endlessly and very-very fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I found that this issue is not very common, but happened with some phones with Cyan update.</p>
<p>I tried soft reset, hard reset, I tried to change SIM-cards (different carriers, different extent of wear, if it's applicable to SIM-cards) - nothing happened. Unfortunately, I cannot use Nokia Software Recovery tool as it cannot download the needed software
 to reinstall it - it just goes up to 100% and then moves back to 0, and starts to download 1,5 Gb again and again, endlessly.</p>
<p>Besides, if it is a software bug, then there is no point to reinstall Cyan due to the fact that, sooner or later, I will face the same issue one day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found a decision from Nokia support: they recommended to update some Nokia apps that cannot be found directly in the Windows Store, kindly provided the asker with QR codes. Some apps, like SMS+Call spam filter, actually, required update, but it didn't
 work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While using this phone, I activated the flight mode once, a month ago, when I was actually on the airplane. This flight took only an hour, therefore I don't think it is somehow related. After the deactivation of the flight mode, my Lumia worked perfrectly
 until I got this issue two days ago, on 19th of October.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep trying to download software to recover my phone. Yet I believe this is a software bug, that should be resolved as soon as possible, even though it affects probably only 2-3% of phone owners.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your attention, responses and probable help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alexander</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPD 1:</strong> Found a new theme on this issue. The recommendation was to try to call someone, as the phone will ask to deactivate flight mode. Didn't work for me.</p>
<p>As for Nokia Software Recovery tool, I counted 12 attempts so far to download the software, so I could consider this method as totally unreliable. Didn't work for me either.</p>
<p>14 people saw this post, no answers. I am patiently waiting for someone to help me.</p>

            <p>Hi Alexander</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for all the information that you have provided, this is all more than
<br />
sufficient to answer your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you are comming across might not be actually software related, and in that case your should exercise your devices warranty. This is based on the fact that you have performed a factory reset of the phone. The only step that you have not executed
 is another reset with the usage of Nokia Software Recovery Tool and I would strongly recommend trying it.</p>
<p>I understand that you have problems with the actuall software instalation.</p>
<p>Please use the link provided, for the latest version of the Nokia Tool:</p>
<p><a href="https://expertcentre.nokia.com/en/articles/kbarticles/Pages/Nokia-Software-Recovery-Tool.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://expertcentre.nokia.com/en/articles/kbarticles/Pages/Nokia-Software-Recovery-Tool.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be good workaround, to try and create a new user profile on your computer as a way to install the software. If you still have difficulities with installation, I would recomend trying it again on another PC. It seems from your description that there
 might be Operating System related reasons for the installation not going through properly, possibly corrupted installation file, lack of free space, antivirus software preventing the installation process from completing.<br />
<br />
In my opinion,&nbsp;reseting your phones software with the use of Nokia Tools will resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please post back with an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

<p>
I have essentially the same question. We use *** Email address is removed for privacy *** address as a shared mailbox to collect HelpDesk requests. We are developing web application which will send email from this address. We tried to use another user mailbox, but then emails are
 tagged as coming from that user and it doesn't allow us to speficy different From: address. Is there a way to solve this?</p>

<p>Hi Vilius,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned, since shared mailbox is not a normal mailbox (no Exchange Online license), we strongly do not recommend (not support) you use shared mailbox as SMTP relay or add shared mailbox to Outlook directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

            OK, I know the 8800 Sirocco. I've just never seen it referred to as an 8800D.<br />
<br />
Anyway, these Series 40 phones sometimes go and corrupt themselves. The only thing you can do yourself is a restore factory default settings. It won't delete any of your data, you'll just have to set up your theme, ringtone, wallpaper etc. again. Enter *#7780#
 from the standby screen and provide your security code when prompted (it'll be 12345 unless you've changed it).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't put it right you'll have to take the phone to your nearest Nokia Care Point because it'll either be something that requires a full reset (and the end user can't do that on a S40 phone) or it'll be a hardware fault anyway.

<h2>            After printing, Word does not go back to the same page</h2>
                    <p>UPDATE: Solved...turns out, when she was scrolling, she was not clicking on the page she wanted to print. Therefore, the insertion point was still at the top of her document - so, it makes sense that Word brought her back to the page where her insertion
 point was placed.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user with an unusual problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When she opens a document, scrolls to a specific page, then prints just that page (by using the "Print Current Page" setting), when Word returns to the Document, it jumps her back up to the first page - it does not remain on the page she just printed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if she uses the "Go To" dialog box to jump to a specific page, then prints just that page, when Word returns to the document, she is brought back to the page she just printed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She is working on a very large document, and there is a reason she is printing only specific pages, so to continually be brought back to her first page is very inefficient. Using the Go To dialog box just to work around this annoyance should not be the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why this would be happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any suggestions,</p>
<p>Tammy</p>

<h2>            AutoFilter Arrows on Just Some Columns</h2>
                    <div>In an Excel table, how can I show autofilter arrows on just <i>some</i> of the columns?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It seems that I can place autofilter arrows on <i>all</i> the columns or <i>
none</i> of the columns, but I can't autofilter on just <i>some</i> of the columns.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Example: A table of expenses consists of 4 columns:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Date</li><li>Category</li><li>Memo</li><li>Amount</li></ul>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'll never need to filter based on the contents of the Memo field, but the table puts an autofilter arrow on that column header anyway.</div>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 mark all read not working the 1st time on imap...</h2>
                    <p>So I have outlook 2013 and for about a month or two when I go in and mark read on emails they will pop back up as unread 1 second later. This is the byproduct of a recent update I believe that changed something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when I right click a folder full of unread mail and mark all read it doesn't take the first time. I have to do it a second time, and sometimes a third to make them marked read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have an idea?</p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This issue may arise due to the IMAP account issue or a corrupt Outlook Profile. In order to resolve this issue we shall try
 configuring your IMAP account in a new Outlook 2013 Profile thereby we can check both scenarios - IMAP account issue and corrupt Profile.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these steps to create a new Outlook Profile:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We shall create a new Outlook Profile. Please follow these steps from the article below.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After creating the new Outlook Profile, setup your IMAP email account again in the new Profile.</span></p>
<p><span>To setup the email account in the new Outlook profile you may refer to the section
<strong>How to</strong> <strong>set up an email account</strong> in the above article.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After setting up your IMAP email account in the new Profile, make sure to follow the step:
<strong>Turn on or off profile prompt </strong>from the instructions in the above mentioned article and make your new Profile as the default Profile (on the same window follow the steps
<strong>Set a default profile</strong>). After these steps are completed â€“ close and reopen Outlook 2013. It should open in the new Profile.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now check if you are able to mark as read single and group emails normally in the new Outlook Profile.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the above steps and let us know the result.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>You cannot specify which image to use as the thumbnail.&nbsp; Sway will automatically pick the first image in your Sway, if it is big enough.&nbsp; If the image you used in your title is too small, it will skip it and choose the next one.</p>

<p>I have seen this briefly at times.&nbsp; Sometimes CTRL-ALT-DEL will bring up Task Manager and you can then try to launch Explorer.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or at the login screen, use the power icon at bottom right.&nbsp; Hold SHIFT while clicking on Restart to get a boot menu and try booting to Low Resolution mode or Safe Mode.</p>

            Control although delete does nothing and I do not have a log in screen it goes to black before I get to a windows log on screen. It goes from the Asus start up to black before the windows log on shows up. No start menu no launch explorer just black.&nbsp;

            You can try to roll back to the previous build. On power-up, once you see swirling dots, hold power button in for 5 seconds to power off. Do this twice. On 3rd boot it should go into repair mode, where you can select to go back to previous version.

<p>It's possible that this is the fast startup bug. Restarts are OK, but power off uses fast startup.&nbsp; Try booting from USB Windows 10 install media. From the first setup screen, use SHIFT-F10 to get Command Prompt. Enter wpeutil reboot to restart and bypass
 fast startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it works, disable fast startup in power settings or run powercfg /H OFF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not that, the second screen of setup has repair your computer link, where you can choose rollback to previous.</p>

<p>There will be a specific key to tap at power-up, which will take you into BIOS settings, where you can change boot order to USB first.&nbsp; Tapping another key might let you choose what you wish to boot from, without changing the boot order in BIOS.&nbsp; Some brands
 use the ESC key.&nbsp; Dell uses F2 for BIOS and usually F12 for selecting what to boot from.&nbsp; Look up what your make and model uses on the manufacturer's website for the computer or motherboard.&nbsp; It will probably be a function key or ESC.&nbsp; PCs used to use the
 DEL key to enter BIOS settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need a bootable Windows media on USB or DVD to boot from. The USB is formatted differently, depending on if the PC is UEFI or Legacy BIOS mode.&nbsp; UEFI has to be FAT32 format and for Legacy the USB stick would be formatted NTFS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a bootable USB using the media creation tool.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you already have an ISO file downloaded for Windows 10, you can use a utility called Rufus to create the bootable USB stick from it.</p>

<p>Hopefully you can get a hold of a friend with a computer and make a bootable flash card for you as per Don's instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you not even make any kind of recovery option at all? Insider program is the testing of beta software, and as you have unfortunately found out, things can and will go wrong with these builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is highly recommended to not use these builds on your main system, unless you are using dual boot, or virtual machines. Most of us use either those options or have other computers to test these builds with.</p>

    <title>Password protect first page only in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrishza  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password protect first page only in Word 2010</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I hope someone can assist me with this.<br />
<br />
Recently we underwent a major internal document rebranding process and had to insert a logo in the bottom footer and top left corner of the header on the first page of each document. The graphic designers are the only people who may modify the branding, since
 they are the experts on the company's corporate identity.<br />
<br />
We made templates for my company's academic department who has to create exam papers with questions and whatnot. We have to restrict editing of the header and footer on the first page ONLY, because the people who will be setting up the exam papers have to be
 able to insert their own footer from the 2nd page onwards. We're not using a header for the 2nd page onwards. We cannot put the 2nd page footer content outside the footer, because they will move things to undesirable locations.<br />
<br />
So, 1st page header and footer must be locked. 2nd page footer must be editable.<br />
<br />
How do I go about this? Is this even possible?<br />
<br />
I tried to use continuous section breaks, but the 2nd page footers still stay locked after I specified which sections to protect and which to leave unprotected.<br />
<br />
Any help would be massively appreciated!<br />

            There is a better way to do this, without macros.<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Open a template. If it currently has only one page, insert a page break at the end to create a temporary second page.</li><li>If you haven't already enabled "Different first page" on the Header &amp; Footer Tools tab, open the header and check that box.</li><li>On the Review tab, click the Restrict Editing button to open the pane.</li><li>Under Editing Restrictions, check the box for "Allow...". Leave the dropdown set to "No changes (Read only)".</li><li>Click in the main text and press Ctrl+A (select all), then check the Everyone box in the Restrict Editing pane.</li><li>Open the footer on the second page, select the whole paragraph(s), and again check the Everyone box in the Restrict Editing pane.</li><li>If you added a page break in step 1, delete it. Although the second-page footer won't be visible, it's still in the template and still marked as allowed for editing; it will reappear when a document based on the template grows beyond page 1.<br />
</li><li>Click the "Yes, Start Enforcing Protection" button. Enter and re-enter your password and click OK. Close the Pane and save the template.</li></ol>
<br />
If anyone tries to edit the first-page header or footer, or the header on remaining pages, nothing will happen except that the status bar will say "This modification is not allowed because the selection is locked". Everything that you marked as available to
 Everyone will remain editable.<br />

    <title>How does one use the OnError macro in Microsoft Access &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p m jugwunth  say:</h3>
<h2>            How does one use the OnError macro in Microsoft Access &#63;</h2>
                    I have not succeeded in getting an answer to the above in Access Help and over the internet. The Help in Access and the internet mention a "macro name" column but Access 2007 and 2010 do not have any columns in the macro interface. I believe that Access
 2003 and before had columns in the macro window. The OnError macro is supposed to be included at the beginning of the main macro, so that if there is any error in the main macro the error could be handled by the OnError macro which affords an option to name
 another macro that must be run automatically if there is any error in the main macro. I did create another macro containing a simple message for test purposes and duly entered its name in the OnError part of the main macro. Thereafter I created an error in
 the main macro by referring to a non-existent field in a form. When the main macro is run it generates an error message to the effect that named macro does not exist. Does anyone perhaps have a solution ?

<h2>            Office 2007, failed installation</h2>
                    <p>My old laptop expired.&nbsp; I had Office 2007 Standard on it.&nbsp; I had the product key but&nbsp;had lost the&nbsp;disk.&nbsp; I struggled to download the program on to my replacement laptop with my product key.&nbsp; A very helpful supervisor at Answer Desk took control of my computer
 and downloaded Office 2007 Professional on to my laptop with a new product key.&nbsp; Unfortunately I had an unconnected issue with the laptop and had to start again almost immediately with a clean install.&nbsp; I didn't see this as an issue as the new product key
 was also emailed to me with instructions on how to download the program again if I ever needed to.&nbsp; This was all less than three weeks ago.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enter the key and download the program installer.&nbsp; However the installation fails near the beginning every time.&nbsp;
<em>"The installation of this package failed"</em>.&nbsp; Answer Desk have since taken over my computer several times and have confirmed that there is a problem with the file.&nbsp; In addition, the top of the failure box says
<em>"Microsoft Professional Plus"</em> so I am not sure it is even trying to install the right program.&nbsp; On getting in touch with Answer desk again just now, they advise that technical support is no longer available for Office 2007 and I must post the question
 here.&nbsp; This is after about 5 hours of chat with answer desk and 2 hours of phone calls during the last 10 days to rectify something they sent me in the first place less than 3 weeks ago.&nbsp; I cant say I am very optimistic.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Original key wont validate.&nbsp; No idea why. The original program was Microsoft Office Standard 2007.&nbsp; Maybe it isn't available anymore?&nbsp; &nbsp;It was after I did this that I contacted answer desk the first time.&nbsp; They looked in to it and came back with another
 product key.&nbsp; I do not have office installed at all at the moment.&nbsp; That is the problem; trying to install it.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message trying to install office from the new product key is below.&nbsp; However the receipt from Microsoft of 2nd December 2015, says that the product key they gave me should download MicrosoftÂ® Office Professional 2007 (FPP).&nbsp; That is why I wonder
 if I am even getting the right program from Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            Startup of Macro Enabled Excel Files Takes Longer</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Concerned,</p>
<p>I work for a entity wherein, we work on Excel files with Macro enables with almost 40 Tabs linked to one another and sometimes have external links too.</p>
<p>Generally we work on some standard Templates and update them with our own analysis.</p>
<p>The Problem I face is whenever I open a new Template (which already have External Links and Macro) My Excel file turns white just as it opens. Later the whole Excel cannot be accessed. So after a long time (almost 15 mins and higher) I My Excel Pops up The
 External Links that should be promt up.&nbsp;Later I change the setting saying do not load for next time... (This thing can be found in Data Ribbon --&gt; Connections --&gt; Edit Links)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me with this regard since it takes me longer than anyother people on the floor</p>

<p>Hi Sy_hk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check if this issue is related to Office, please follow the steps below to remove all keychains about Office then activate your Office again to see the outcome:</p>
<p>1. Quit all Office apps.<br />
2. Open Keychain Access.app.(Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Keychain Access.app or type Keychain into Launchpad search)<br />
3. Search All Items for OneDrive, Office, outlook.<br />
4. Deleted all keychains you find by steps 3.</p>
<p>5. Restart your Mac and activate your Office again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this issue still exists, please uninstall Office then install it again to activate your Office again. You can follow this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-office-2011-for-mac-issues-by-completely-uninstalling-before-you-reinstall-ba8d8d13-0015-4eea-b60b-7719c2cedd17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> to uninstall Office 2011 for Mac.</p>
<p>
Besides, I'd like to explain that Office for Mac 2011 client mainstream support ended on October 10, 2017. Continued mainstream support requires upgrades to Office 2016 for Mac applications as part of Office 365 ProPlus or Office 2016 for Mac. If you want to
 learn more about this, you can go to this site: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Support-is-ending-for-Office-for-Mac-2011-559b72b1-e045-4c73-bad3-d7f1841b9e8c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thank you for reading my comment. This is the same license key I was using when it was installed on my older hard drive. The files themselves came from my Time Capsule backup when I reinstalled everything on my new drive. I still have the old drive available
 if need be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The license is for one computer, which is why I deleted it from the older hard drive. Iâ€™m not sure I can access those files on the old drive, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, that helps a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An Office 2011 product key can not be re-used. If you change the startup volume's drive, it looks like a new computer to Office and it won't let you activate your old license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can purchase a new license on sites like eBay.com for about $20 US. They're cheap, now, because the product is discontinued.</p>

<h2>            Reply All not working on Calendar invite on outlook.office.com</h2>
                    <p>Starting yesterday when I click the Reply All or Reply option from a calendar invite nothing happens. I use this frequently so I know it just started sometime after Monday (Oct 8, 2018), and it's super frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's the same whether I'm viewing an invite in the detail modal overlay on top of the calendar or in a pop-out window.
</p>
<p>
I've tried in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. All latest versions.
</p><p>
</p><p>I've had co-workers try on both Windows and Mac machines and it works for them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Forward option still works as expected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a corporate account. My IT department tried re-licensing my account, but that didn't do anything. Everything still works fine in desktop version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
Any suggestions?<br />

<p>We have actually added tenant.sharepoint.com to the "Local Intranet" and "Trusted Sites" in IE and set this as a group policy so all users should be the same. The users are auto logging in when they access via the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What other options to we have to make this work consistently? </p>

<h2>            What causes divert problems</h2>
                    
<p>Two issues with an old phone - any idea what the cause could be...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When I dialled a number selected from contact list, the phone dialled a different number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.When I was called, the call diverted to one of my contacts, even though the phone was not set to call divert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firmware issue has been suggested -- any thoughts anyone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Call diversion is actually a network function. Contact you network and get them to check your divert settings for you.</p>

<p>Any time I have ever had call diversion problems, it has been caused by the network. The last time I had problems was when I changed my tariff. For some reason switching tariffs resulted in the call diversion policy changed on my account. I contacted my
 network and they promptly returned it to what it was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some handsets have the facility to allow the user access the settings on their phones and change them, but the settings are not on the phone. The phone is only used to connect to the networks settings. This is why, your call divert settings do not change
 when you change phones. I switch between 4 different phones all the time.</p>

<p>Have a look at the link below. Basically to set up call diversions, you can either contact your network and tell them what you want, type the code manually on your phone and send to the network or finally some phones have embeded utilities to automatically
 send the codes to the network. The basic control of the call diversion is with the network. That is why you can change phones and the call diversion is still on and that is also why your calls still divert if your phone is powered off. It is all done and controlled
 by your network. The link below explains all this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When things go wrong, it is either the networks fault unless you accidently send the wrong code from your phone. Example, if you dial #21# and send, your network will receive this code and cancel all call diverts. But, if you didn't do anything then it is
 your network.</p>

<h2>            Photos Missing from OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Hell<span>o</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I got a windows phone last month and have set up my photos to auto sync with onedrive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Today I checked the onedrive one my pc and find that not all photos have been backed up. WiFi is on regularly on my phone and some recent photos are backed up while some older ones are not, I.e the omissions are random.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The same photos are also missing from the onedrive app on my phone and when I try to refresh the sync it shows the dots moving accross the top of the screen for a few seconds and then stops, but no more photos appear.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas?</p>
<p>

            <p>The Onedrive app will show the same onedrive contents as the PC - they are missing from your One Drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>as Solene R suggests, did you turn off the option at all? I understand it only syncs new photos after being turned on, not syncing your entire camera roll everytime it is switched on and off</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sync only happens over WiFi. make sure you are connected to a functional WiFi network. check that sync is enabled, then go to settings &gt; Email and accounts - press and hold on your windows live account, and select 'sync'</p>
<p>
</p><p>transfer your existing photos to your PC via USB and then delete (or just copy elsewhere), the onedrive copies, and monitor the situation, to see if you can pin down specifically something in common with the photos that are missing (eg, connected to a bad
 hotspot in a certain location)</p>
