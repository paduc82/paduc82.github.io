<h2>            Managing multiple email addresses tied to one account in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Because of a system crash, I recently moved from Outlook 2007 over to Outlook 2010 on a new laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium. My old setup was running Windows Vista.&nbsp; My email account is&nbsp;with an ISP who allows several alias addresses to the account
 - so I have 3 email addresses, all of which are actually hitting a single account.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my Vista/Outlook&nbsp;2007 setup, I could have 3 POP mail accounts set up in Outlook, all of them hitting the same InBox folder. I had rules to move emails addressed to&nbsp;one or
 the other of the 2 aliases into separate folders.&nbsp; Under that old setup, if someone sent something to my email address #1, or email address #2, or email address #3, I received only one copy of the message (and, if it met the rules conditions, it was moved
 to the appropriate folder).&nbsp; I could also choose to Send using any one of these 3 addresses.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried for a couple days to replicate this setup, but can't seem to get it.&nbsp; If I have 3 POP email accounts set up, each to receive and send, and each hitting the same data file, then I get 3 copies of messages coming through.&nbsp; If I instead set each
 of the accounts up as IMAP accounts, that is very confusing, as there are then multiple InBoxes to have to manage, and multiple data files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is my old configuration something that is possible with Outlook 2010 and Windows 7?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Susan</p>

            I found the solution to this - it took me a while to figure things out, but it's working now. I had confused things by setting up the email accounts on my new laptop as IMAP accounts. That resulted in multiple data files and multiple In Box hierarchies
 within Outlook, which I understand is just the way IMAP works. Then I switched them to POP3, directing all to the same data file, but started getting 3 emails for each one received on the server. &nbsp;The solution was to set all three email accounts up as POP3
 accounts, but have only one of them (my main account) set to receive mail (through the File...Options...Advanced...Send/Receive dialog, which allows you to Edit a Send/Receive group and tweak which addresses participate in that). The Outlook rules then handle
 moving anything specifically addressed to one of the alias accounts to the correct folder, and I can "send" from any of the three accounts.&nbsp;

<h2>            Messaging Skype Users from Teams</h2>
                    <p>I have been setup with the coexistence of "Teams Only".&nbsp; The problem I'm having is that most people have both teams and skype for business, but almost no one uses or even launches their teams.&nbsp; When I look up someone, in teams, to contact them it always
 sends to their teams but I need to be able to choose to send to their sfb instead.&nbsp; If someone messages me first from sfb I can message them back but I can't figure out how to start a conversation with someone on sfb.</p>

<p><span>Hi JordanMK,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When the Teams Only users send messages to the people who have both Teams and Skype for Business (Island mode), the message will be received by Teams instead of Skype for Business. This is expected behavior by design.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/327a9cf0-42d7-4d60-9851-af4635d25ead?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/327a9cf0-42d7-4d60-9851-af4635d25ead?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, we are unable to choose to send to Teams or Skype for Business.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>More information about this topic, please refer to the article Coexistence with Skype for Business:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/coexistence-chat-calls-presence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/coexistence-chat-calls-presence</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Given this situation, I suggest that let the Skype for Business (island mode) initiate the conversation with Teams users (Teams Only mode). Then the Teams only user's message will send to Skype for Business.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3534640d-8560-4771-a23f-7270fa786be1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3534640d-8560-4771-a23f-7270fa786be1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Besides, since Microsoft is intended to replace Skype for Business with Microsoft Teams.</span><span>&nbsp;Almost all features in Skype for Business are available in Teams. Also,
 you can feedback in</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Teams UserVoice</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span><span>website to share your experience or suggest
 a new feature to help us improve Teams. It's highly appreciated for your time and understanding.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Loren,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Default permission level of the users’ calendars for internal users is set to Availability Only. If the user has not assigned any additional permission to specific users, it’s expected that only free/busy information is accessible
 by other internal users.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you don’t want the users to share their calendars specifically, I suggest you change the Default permission level to Reviewer to let all the internal users can access other users’ calendars with full details. You can achieve that via
 PowerShell. Try the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell">Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a>.</span></li><li><span>To change the Default permission level for a single user, please run:
<em>Set-MailboxFolderPermission *** Email address is removed for privacy ***:\Calendar -User Default -AccessRights Reviewer
</em>(replace with the user’s address)</span></li><li><span>To change the Default permission level for all the users’ mailboxes. You can try this command:
<em>foreach($user in Get-Mailbox -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox) {Set-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity ($user.alias+':\calendar’) -User Default -AccessRights Reviewer}</em></span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please let me if anything is unclear,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<h2>            Issues with domain OWA</h2>
                    
<p>Let me begin with apologizing if the post seems to go all over the place, I've been so deep into trying to solve the issue I'm not sure where to begin.</p>
<p>Ever since an outage of our storage that the ADFS VM runs on we have been unable to use the OWA function for the domain. We use a Federated Identity set-up and have the ADFS server linked to the ADDS.</p>
<p>The main issue seems to be with Event ID: 364 in the ADFS event viewer.</p>
<p>"Encountered error during federation passive request. <br />

I tried to perform a Directory Sync using DirSync but received the generic error "DirSync encountered an unknown error, please try again, if the issue persists contact technical support". After the error started a re-install of DirSync and Microsoft online
 services sign in assistant. I was able to install the sign in assistant again but received another unknown error on the installation of DirSync.</p>
<p>There are a few other things I checked which i can't remember of the top of my head.</p>
<p>It feels I'm missing something obvious, would anyone be so kind to point me in the right directions?</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>As I understand it, your post includes at least an ADFS issue and a DirSync issue. Let’s focus on the ADFS issue first. (You can always post another thread in our forum for the DirSync issue.)</p>
<p>According to the fact that the <strong>Event ID 364</strong> can be found in the
<strong>Event Viewer</strong> log, the root cause of the ADFS issue should be related to an incorrect passive request. As my first suggestion, please try to update the password for the ADFS application pool in IIS or reset the password for both the service
 account and the application pool. You can refer to <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2270.update-the-ad-fs-2-0-service-identity-password-in-a-federation-server-farm.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update the AD FS 2.0 Service Identity Password in a Federation Server Farm</a>. (Let us know if it is actually
<strong>ADFS 3.0</strong> that you’re using.)</p>
<p>And if the issue and the <strong>Event ID 364</strong> persist, I’d like to collect more relevant details then:<br />
1. As mentioned above, are you using <strong>ADFS 2.0</strong> or <strong>3.0</strong>? In other words, you can just tell us the version of your ADFS Windows server.<br />
2. What are the exact symptoms when your users try to access their OWA? Please provide a screenshot by clicking
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> (under the reply box) -&gt;<strong> Insert/Edit Media</strong>.<br />
3. Can you find any other abnormal Event IDs other than <strong>364</strong> in the
<strong>Event Viewer</strong> log?<br />
4. Does the issue just happen recently or it started ever since you deployed your ADFS configurations?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>We ended up resetting the password for the service account and wanted to do the same for the ADFS App pool but couldn't discover on which IIS server the pool was located. Unfortunately the environment was setup by someone no longer with the company, thus
 we are currently going through all the servers trying to find the one with the ADFS settings.</p>

<p>hi gary,</p>
<p>the issue is still persisting after a reset of the password on the service account.</p>
<p>apologies for skipping over your questions allen.</p>
<p>we are currently working with adfs 3.0, i think i've seen that this version is not dependant on iis, is that correct? as that would explain our inability to find the adfs app pool, perhaps it wasn't used when the environment was set up.</p>
<p>the exact symptoms for the users are that when they try and log in using the owa they get redirected to the adfs server at adfs.domain.com as they should however on the what is supposed to be the login page they receive the message that an error occurred,
 contact your administrator for more information and then in the more info box the following information:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=182b119b-ea04-4816-94fd-ffe00f4128a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d182b119b-ea04-4816-94fd-ffe00f4128a2" /></a></p>
<p>when checking the servers error log we see the event id 364. this is the only event id we see in the ad fs event log, however as mentioned we do seem to have an issue as well with dirsync and the sso assistant software, although this could of course be unrelated
 to the issue we are currently seeing with the owa.<br />
the issue itself only started recently, we had an issue with the raid storage and due to this the vm that runs the server with ad fs went down for a few days after which we started seeing this issue. at first to get around the storage issue we assembled a new
 ad fs server and connected it to the existing sql database, this restored e-mail functionality at that time however we did immediately see the issue with the owa. after a days or so the old ad fs server came back on line with the same settings as it had when
 it was working however we were still seeing the issue with the owa.</p>
<p>thank you all for all the help so far, it's much appreciated.</p>
<p>regards,</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>I’m Neo from the support team and I will further assist you in solving the issue.</p>
<p>Since we’re still not very clear about the issue, can you please provide the following information for troubleshooting?</p>
<ol>
<li>You mentioned the issue occurs in OWA, do you mean only specific OWA pages are not working or all the Office 365 web pages are not working properly?
</li><li>To verify if the ADFS server is running fine, please check if the federation service metadata can be retrieved using the URL:
<a href="https://sts.contoso.com/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://sts.contoso.com/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml</a> (please change the FQDN to match your environment).
</li><li>To verify if the sign in page is working normal, please check if you can authenticate by navigating to the URLs:
<a href="https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.htm</a> (please change the FQDN to match your environment).
</li><li>On the webpage <a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/?tabid=o365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/?tabid=o365</a>, please perform the
<b>Office 365 Single Sign-On Test </b>using one of the problematic users, then expand the entire test results and provide it to us.
</li></ol>
<p>I have sent you a private message to request the test results, please read and reply it by clicking the link below:</p>

<p>Thank you all again for the help so far.</p>
<p>As requested I have tested the previously mentioned steps.</p>
<p>1. I apologize if my explanation sounds vague, the issue occurs after the redirect from O365 login page to the " Customized" login page of the ADFS server.</p>
<p>2. The <a href="https://sts.contoso.com/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sts.contoso.com/.../federationmetadata.xml</a> &nbsp;link is working and offers me the .xml file when going to the page.</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sts.contoso.com/.../idpinitiatedsignon.htm</a> gets me to the ADFS login page with the message "You are not signed in, please sign in on the site" (It might be slightly off as we have a different language pack on the server). After clicking on "Sign In" i get
 redirected to the same login page error as we are seeing coming from outside the LAN (Activity ID: 00000000-0000-0000-4807-0080000000e7</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Sorry for the typo in my previous post. I only want to collect the SSO test result you performed on the testing website. Please provide the SSO test result to us via the PM I’ve sent to you before.</p>
<p>Also, please perform the following steps to update the ADFS settings on the server to check if the issue persists:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module. </li><li>Run&nbsp;<b>$cred=Get-Credential</b>. When the cmdlet prompts you for credentials, type your cloud service administrator account credentials.
</li><li>Run&nbsp;<b>Connect-MsolService –Credential $cred</b>. This cmdlet connects you to the cloud service. Creating a context that connects you to the cloud service is required before running any of the additional cmdlets installed by the tool.
</li><li>Run <b>Set-MSOLAdfscontext -Computer &lt;AD FS primary server&gt;</b>, where &lt;AD FS primary server&gt; is the internal FQDN name of the primary AD FS server. This cmdlet creates a context that connects you to AD FS. If you have installed the Microsoft Azure Active
 Directory Module on the primary AD FS server, then you do not need to run this cmdlet.
</li><li>Run <b>Update-MsolFederatedDomain –DomainName &lt;domain&gt;</b>, where &lt;domain&gt; is the domain for which you want to update properties. This cmdlet updates the properties and establishes the trust relationship.
</li><li>Run <b>Get-MsolFederationProperty –DomainName &lt;domain&gt;</b>, where &lt;domain&gt; is the domain for which you want to view properties. You can then compare the properties from the primary AD FS server and the properties in the cloud service to make sure they match.
 If they don’t match, run <b>Update-MsolFederatedDomain –DomainName &lt;domain&gt;</b> again to sync the properties.
</li></ol>

<p>Hello Neo,</p>
<p>First off an update regarding DirSync. We were able to fix it by removing it completely including SSO assistant and remnants in the old installation directory and then re-installing in a different location than the standard C:/Programfiles/. The default
 location was causing an unknown error.</p>
<p>Regarding ADFS, i have send you the results of the Single Sign On test in the PM you send me, It was successful although as mentioned in the previous post it gave a possible warning about the certificate chain.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

                    <p>My efforts to add a particular sender to my "never block" list have failed--apparently because the sender's domain changes with each mailing. The part before the @ sign is always the same. Can I add the address with wild cards to the "never block" list?
 Or is there some other way of adding this sender to that list?</p>

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Try creating an inbox rule where you bypass spam filtering for all emails that include an specific word in the sender address, that specific word would be that name that never changes before the @. In Outlook 2016 go to rules and then advanced options, there you're going to see the option.
<br />

            Pedro, I don't see any "advanced options" for rules in my Outlook. There is an option--which I've used [not for this issue]--to "stop processing more rules"; but this could not help here, as what I want to do is have Outlook display images upon the message's
 arrival, and that display is not stopped by any "rule" but by my Trust Center setting.

<h2>            Microsoft Word 2013 Documents keep opening in Word Starter 2010</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I installed Office 2013 Home &amp; Student earlier today. It worked fine until I saved a document and tried to re-open it only to find that the document opened in Word Starter 2010. I had Word Starter 2010 before Office 2013 and now all my Word 2013 documents open
 in Word Starter 2010 by default. I have tried setting my Office programs as the default programs but this appears to have no effect. I am not sure if uninstalling Word Starter 2010 will fix this but I am worried that I may lose all my documents if I do so.
 Also, Word Starter was part of Office Starter 2010 that also came with Excel Starter. What should I do?<br />

            Yes, you should uninstall Office 2010 Starter (it would have gone easier if you had uninstalled 2010 before installing 2013). You will not "lose all your documents" -- uninstall removes only the program files, not the document files. Of course, it's a
 good idea to do a regular backup before changing any program.<br />
<br />
There's no particular reason to keep any of the Office 2010 Starter programs once you have Office 2013. The Starter programs are all reduced-function versions of the full Office programs (sometimes uncharitably called "crippleware").<br />
<br />
After you uninstall 2010 Starter, run a repair of the Office 2013 installation (<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/outlook-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/outlook-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx</a>)
 to make sure all the registry entries point to the right places.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2013 crashes when outlook.com account added</h2>
                    <p>I have a new PC with Windows 8 x64 and the Outlook 365 trial.&nbsp; It works with mail accounts from Google and iCloud, but the minute I add my outlook.com account, Outlook 2013 crashes and continues to crash on startup even in safe mode.&nbsp; I have to use control
 panel to remove the outlook.com account to make outlook 2013 work again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I originally added the outlook.com account successfully when it was an empty account except for a few emails from Microsoft.&nbsp; However, when I went only to the Outlook.com account and imported some calendar events that were exported from Google calendar,
 it started crashing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the fact that Win8 Calendar and People Apps can't work with Google due to the end of EAS support by Google, and the fact that Outlook.com can't import Calendar events without crashing Outlook, I find I can't complete my move to the new PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>jfa_123 - I had an identical problem. It turned out that one of my calendar entries was corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went into Hotmail calendar and exported each calendar to an ICS file, deleted all the calendars, then started outlook 2013 and no problems... Then just re-import the calendars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stupid that Microsoft would allow Hotmail to store corrupted calendar entries.</p>

            I also find it interesting that Outlook 2013 can't work with a calendar that works find in hotmail.com (outlook.com).&nbsp; Since the same outlook.com calendar works fine in the Win 8 calendar app, I really don't have a need for outlook 2013. I only needed
 a few different calendars within my mail app that can be shared with other users.&nbsp; outlook.com calendar supports this feature.&nbsp; The only issue I've found that needs solving is that the Win 8 calendar app does not support reoccurring meetings that have an end
 date or repeat every other week or month.&nbsp; Hotmail supports this, but the mail app does not.<br />
<br />
I've solved my problem for now and have uninstalled Office (365) 2013 Trial.&nbsp; My personal use of the features does not justify the cost.&nbsp; Office is more of a business app.<br />
<br />
I have stopped using google calendar and contacts and have switched to outlook.com.&nbsp; Once I can forward my gmail to outlook.com mail, I'll be done.<br />

            <p>I figured out that Outlook crashes while trying to sync my miscrosoft account only if I have a google calendar subscribed via the web calendar app.</p>
<p>The google calendar shows fine in my windows phone and in windows 8 calendar app and on web calendar app but it causes outlook 2013 to crash.
</p>
<p>If I remove that subscription outlook 2013 works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The google calendar I imported is via private link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please fix this :|</p>

            I am also having the same exact issue. I have 4 google calendars which I subscribed to via the private ics link. Both the outlook.com calendar web app and the windows 8 calendar app were happy. But when I opened the outlook desktop it crashed shortly after
 starting the sync process and kept crashing every time I opened it since. Fixing the problem involved not only removing those subscriptions but also deleting the outlook ost file and syncing everything from the scratch.
<div><br />
<div>Later I also did some experimenting and found out that this doesn't happen with every google calendar subscription. In fact subscribing to my calendars one at a time, 3 of them synced perfectly without crashing outlook (I'm now using these on a daily basis
 without any problems). It was the 4th calendar subscription which suddenly reproduced the crash and ost file corruption. So evident there is something particular to this calendar which causes the issues.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Likewise very much looking forward to a fix/work-around.</div>

            <p>Unfortunately I haven't had any success finding out the culprit entry. I did download the calendar as an *.ics file and had a look using notepad, but there is way too much data to try and make sense of using visual inspection and I don't even know what I'm
 looking for. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hoping may be one of the moderators or MS staff might have some suggestion&nbsp;or tip as to what to look for.</p>

            <p>I don't think you can configure this. Not to say it can't happen, but you don't have much control. Voice (phone connections) work over the Headset/Handsfree Protocol, and music goes over the A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Protocol). These are independent.
 If you have a device that supports both, and connect it with your phone, it will connect both protocols, and you can't change that. If you then connect another device with both protocols, it will disconnect both on the first device.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you connect a second device with only one of those protocol options, it will (should) only disconnect that one.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a car system that supports both music and phone, connect it. Then go into BT and select connect on a BT headset device, that does not support music (A2DP) and it should leave the music connected to the car system and connect the voice to the
 headset/handsfree device. If both devices support both protocols, and there is no way to shut one off on the device, you can't split them from the phone.</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to save macros created in Excel 2007 to a flash drive so I can use them on other computers&#63;</h2>

 the macros will not work .&nbsp; Is there a way I can save these macros and worksheet on a flashdrive so that I can take them wherever I go and use them on other computers?</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep having this weird issue where I will get an "anyone can share" link with no expiration and share it with co-workers. Some of the co-workers will experience issues right away where it says they&nbsp;don't have permissions. And sometimes all co-workers will
 have no issues, but then a few days later permissions will randomly stop working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone ever experienced this? Is there a better way to share or collaborate that maybe I'm missing?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<br />There are a number of ways for sharing work between people. As for the best way it depends what you are working on. In the mean time, I suggest you try making a OneDrive folder and granting users access by their accounts rather than a direct link. This could be done for the files directly, but depending on how often you share files and whether they are with the same people. It might make the most sense to attempt this with folders. Unfortunately I can't give you a clear answer on why it happens, only that I've seen this issue before. But there are so many factors its difficult to narrow down.
<br />I hope that helps.

<h2>            OneNote&#47;Outlook tasks</h2>
                    Is the function to create an outlook task ever actually coming back? I like the new version of OneNote better, but I'm not using it if I can't create outlook tasks from inside OneNote. That's such a simple and important feature, I can't imagine any reason
 it should have been eliminated in the Windows 10 version. <br />
<br />
I've voted on all the suggestions related to it, but is this feature ever ACTUALLY going to be reconsidered? Or should I make my peace with the legacy version and no updating?&nbsp;

            It's my understanding that they are looking into it, as they know the lack of outlook integration will keep users on the win32 version. 
<br />
<br />You can have both versions installed. I use the win32 version for outlook integration but use the UWP version for pretty much everything else.

<h2>            User is assigned a license, but still receives error that they do not have a license</h2>
                    
<p>i added a new user to our subscription of office 365.</p>
<p>their account under admin-&gt;users-&gt;active users shows that they have a license of office 365 business.</p>

<p>they are able to log into portal.office.com but receive the following message.</p>
<p>"you don't have a license to use office 365 with the user id assigned to you by your work or school. ask your admin to assign one to you. if you're an admin, you can assign one to your account."</p>

<p>i have tried to removing and then reassigning the license already and they still receive the same message.</p>
<p>the other users on our account are able to log in and see that they have a valid license.</p>

<p>To help anyone else that is having this issue, the solution that worked for me was to do the following.</p>
<p>Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName <em>UserName</em> | Remove-MsolUser</p>
<p>Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName <em>UserName</em> -ReturnDeletedUsers | Remove-MsolUser -RemoveFromRecycleBin</p>
<p>After verifing that the account was removed, I forced a sync of the user accounts again. Once the user account reappeared, I reassigned them a license.</p>

<h2>            linking between files and now it creates an array</h2>
                    
<p>I often link a range of cells between workbooks.&nbsp; It was easy to do before, just copy and paste.&nbsp; Now when I copy and paste, in the new file, I'm not able to edit the newly pasted cells because it says I can't change part of the array.&nbsp; I need to be able
 to manipulate the copied cells.&nbsp; How do I?</p>
<p>Also, now it seems whenever I open a file with linked information from other files, it has to open the other files to update.&nbsp; Is that true?&nbsp; Unfortunately if it is, it means that other people don't have access to those files because I'm using a file that
 is linked to it.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
