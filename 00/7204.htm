<h3> mykeldl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Requery&#47;Form_Current Not Working for the First Record</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm working on a personal profile form. The form displays information for one person (a minor), and a subform displays information on the multiple, related guardians. Basically, everything is working exactly as I want except for one thing, which fails only
 in one circumstance.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Deeper Dive</span></p>
<p>I have multiple combo boxes to search for either a minor or a guardian (by minor name, by minor code, by guardian name, by guardian&nbsp;email). When I make a selection from any combo box, the main form record&nbsp;updates, the subform record updates,&nbsp;and as part
 of the code for Form_Current (on either the main and subform) all of the combo boxes all update to reflect the record being displayed. (e.g., me.cboSearchName = me. txtMinorID).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, there is an unbound list box on the main form that shows all of the linked/associated records of the guardians for the minor, so that I can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a specific guardian to view their data in the subform, and <strong>most importantly</strong>,</li><li>Undertake an action (e.g., create a new order) for that particular guardian.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Everything works just fine. If I use the navigation buttons, everything works, for every search combo box, all works as expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EXCEPT&nbsp;FOR ONE THING:&nbsp;</strong>When using any of the search combo&nbsp;boxes to select the first record displayed on the form when it originally loads, none of the unbound controls update to reflect the current record being displayed. Therefore, I cannot
 add a new order for the proper guardian for that first-loading record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select anything BUT the first record works just fine. Using the programmed (not built into form) navigation buttons to go to the first record also works as planned. There's a quite a lot that goes on when going to a new record, and I've stepped through the
 code, but cannot see any difference in what's happening for the&nbsp;1st record that's different from any other records. None of the combo boxes displays headers, BTW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the combo boxes are sorted ascending (e.g, alpha-last name first). The main form is "Order By" minorlast, minorfirst. "Order By On Load" is Yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm flummoxed. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(UPDATE: In submitting this, I realize I haven't tested removing the "Order By" or "Order By On Load" to see what the behavior is. I'm going to test that now, but leave this up as background.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(UPDATE2: The answer is, No, removing the "Order By" and changing "Order By On Load" to No does not correct the aberrant&nbsp;behavior.)</p>

<p>This is going to be very hard to trace without stepping through the code in the debugger and watching exactly what happens every step of the way.&nbsp; I notice you use DoCmd.SearchForRecord, which is context-dependent and could possibly be operating on the wrong
 form/subform.&nbsp; You might use one of the other mechanisms for searching for a record, such as Me.Recordset.FindFirst, instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your usage of TempVars in the code snippet you posted puzzles me, since there seems no reason in that code to get TempVars involved.&nbsp; Are there event macros that would fire, that would be dereferencing TempVars!lngTraveler?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you by any chance create a cut-down version of the database and post it for investigation?&nbsp; You'd want to obfuscate any private data, of course.</p>

                    ... but please be gentle with me (as I'm a lady)<br />
<br />
Just upgraded my phone to a Nokia 6234 and haven't a clue how to download photos - do I need to buy additional software, can it be done by bluetooth (bearing in mind I don't know anything about bluetooth and how it works!) Please help - my previous phone I
 never got to grips with downloading and have 2 years worth of photos on it!!! <br />

Thanks

            (I am a lady too so let's not apologise that:))<br />
<br />
What is your PC's operating system ? You need to have PC with Windows 2000 or better, Windows XP in it.<br />
Hopefully you have an icon "my computer" in your PC's desktop, right click on it with mouse and check from "properties-general" what is your system.<br />
<br />
If system is OK, then you need to decide how you want to connect the phone and PC, you have 3 alternatives:<br />
infrared, Bluetooth, USB cable.<br />
<br />
USB cable is fastest to move pictures and it is the most simple one, because I am sure your PC has USB port(s) in it.
<br />
<br />
With Bluetooth you can easily go wrong is you have XP and you don't have an inbuilt Bluetooth hardware in your PC and you go and try to buy a Bluetooth USb dongle that actually for real will support Nokia PC Suite...well, just forget it.<br />
<br />
Infrared ? Very slow and you may not have a infrared eye in your PC even.<br />
<br />
You need to go and buy Nokia CA-53 cable (do not buy other models, there are plenty of different cables, they look the same, but do not work. That will cost you some money, you can also try to buy a non-Nokia version, it will be cheaper, but you take the risk
 of the cable not working. Your call.<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, now you have phone(with pictures in it), CA-53 cable and your PC.<br />
<br />
Now you need to install Nokia PC Suite from <a href="http://www.nokia.com/pcsuite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.nokia.com/pcsuite</a><br />
<br />
Follwo the download wizard and when a questio pops up that "run" or "save" choose "save" and save the PC Suite package to your PC's desktop.<br />
<br />
Once the download is finished, locate the downloaded Nokia PC Suite.exe from your desktop, double click on it with mouse to start the installation, follow the instructions and you are connected (you will be asked to connect the cable at certain point DO NOT
 ATTACH the cable to your PC before PC Suite asks you to do that.<br />
<br />
Once you are connected, open PC Suite, select "store images" to move your pictures to PC (store images organises your pictures to your PC per shooting date or per moved date, what ever you choose)

            Thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
I have Windows XP and going by your suggestion I shall buy a USB cable - once I've done that I shall follow the rest of your suggestions (if I can!!).<br />
<br />
I may be back if I have furher problems.<br />
<br />
Thanks again

<h2>            Is there any way to get in touch with a human being in this thing&#63;</h2>
                    I seem to have 2 accounts, one left over from 2013 or something.<br />
<br />
How do I:<br />
<br />
Combine my 2 accounts<br />
Change/add a profile picture to the new one (the procedure on the help(?) page does not work. Clicking on the profile picture does nothing.)<br />
Get onliine with this thing? It didn't work last time either! (2013)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ask a question?<br />
<br />
Like, do I absolutely have to have a microsoft account for this thing?<br />
<br />
Are there any human beings still involved with this "Customer support"?"<br />

            Isnt it an absolute nightmare..... I always used to rave about how great skype was, now its so overy complicated and difficult to use becaues its somehow integradted with microsoft, i have the same problem that i now have two accounts, when i try to change
 the password it then kicks me out of my emails, then i try to sign in and it doesnt accept my password, even this dam question and answers you try to ask a question it takes you to another new page all together then you dont know if its microsoft or skype,
 then you sign in it takes you to email instead of skype and you lose the page you were on....... &nbsp;why do people have to mess with something that already works, now its a mess. I am going to move onto a pkatform thats more user friendly as Skype has past its
 day........ 😖😐☹️

<p><span>Working in MS Office 2007 the normal function of Excel when creating link to anther workbook (another file) is to return in the destination a link with absolute cell references
 for example with both files open linking between the two will result in a formula:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>=[Book3]Sheet1!$F$11</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>What my user wants is to have the formula return:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>=[Book3]Sheet1!F11
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I understand that removing the “$” or using the<strong>F4
</strong>key to change between relative and absolute cell references.<span>&nbsp;</span>What my user is wanting is for it to
<em>default</em> to creating <strong>relative </strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">instead of</span> absolute references.<span>&nbsp;</span>We just upgraded from 2003 to 2007 and our user is
<em><strong>adamant</strong></em> that this worked differently for her in 2003.<span>&nbsp;</span>Our software distribution solution does not upgrade the install (we are enterprise license org) and Office 2007 would be installed like a full installation.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When researching this I looked through the application help for both Excel products and can’t find the<em>switch</em> that turns off absolute references, and Google
 it to no avail.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Am wondering if there is a registry hack or something that could do this, or something in VBA that could run from PERSONAL.XLS hidden worbook.<span>&nbsp;</span>Thought I would check here
 before reinventing this wheel.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks!<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p>Well, as I remember it in XL2003 and earlier, you got relative addresses if you were refering to a range within the same workbook (possibly on another sheet), but absolute references when you were refering to another workbook, so I don't think that behaviour
 has changed. I'm not aware of any change you can make to this default action.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<h2>            Skype rings forever after answering a call on another device</h2>
                    <p>My Dad called me on Skype and I refused the call on my Lumia 920 because I was busy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He called back a few minutes later and I answered and had a brief conversation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could hear my PC with two Skype rings going on - they continued for at least 15 minutes before I was able to finish what I was doing and go dismiss the calls on that device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Preferably, Skype calls should only ring on devices I'm around - such as my phone - or a computer I'm actively using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I answer a call on one device, it should stop ringing on all other devices.</p>

    <title>Group Policy not populating IE11&#39;s compatibility sites. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Group Policy not populating IE11&#39;s compatibility sites.</h2>
                    <p>We normally do not allow IE updates, but we got a pallet of new computers with IE11 preinstalled on them from Dell. &nbsp;I figured now is a good time to get this working in our environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that under our group policy settings are not putting the websites we need in compatibility mode. &nbsp;I have verified the group policy is applied to my computer using rsop.msc and I verified the settings in there. &nbsp;However when I try to visit our
 loan application which runs at http://192.168.1.9 it shows a browser not supported message and says to use IE 5.5 or later. &nbsp;Well if one were to manually add the site in compatibility mode, then it would work. &nbsp;So we want to avoid the calls to IT Support on
 how to add sites to compatibility mode and just control it from our end via Group Policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So under User Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Internet Explorer &gt; Compatibility View : we have these set:</p>
<p>Include updated Web site lists from Microsoft - Enabled</p>
<p>Use Policy List of Internet Explorer 7 sites - Enabled</p>
<p>&nbsp; Show:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;http://192.168.1.9 &nbsp; &nbsp;(our lending application)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;https://another website</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;http://192.168.1.15 &nbsp; (our lending application test site for new upcoming releases)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ok this is not working so am I doing this in the wrong place?</p>

<h3> charleebangs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell XPS 13 9360 DPC and CPU Throttling issues</h2>
                    <p>I've been using my XPS to DJ since Feb 2018 without any issues. Since the 28th of June I keep losing sound after 20-30 mins of Djing. I can no longer play for more than 30 mins without having to re-plug my DJ controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After speaking to Serato support and implementing all their <a href="https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/articles/203057850-PC-Optimization-Guide-for-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PC performance improvements suggestions</a>, I downloaded LatencyMon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time that I run LatencyMon after 2-3 mins it gives me the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks. You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops. One or more DPC routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be
 executing for too long. One problem may be related to power management, disable CPU throttling settings in Control Panel and BIOS setup. Check for BIOS updates"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've disabled everything related to Turbo Boost from the bios, but it still happens. I also followed the suggestion posted on Twitter by&nbsp;
<a href="https://twitter.com/maknelly90/status/1133748571818385408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nelson Mak</a> but still no fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also tried to disable ACPI.sys from the device manager, as it's the driver that causes the highest delay, but it still seems to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make things even worse for Dell, my Lenovo&nbsp;Yoga 2 13 from 2014 and the same version of Windows 10 runs fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue appeared with Windows 10 Home 1903 release. I've joined the Insider program to see if a newer release fixes this but no luck :( I currently have Windows 10 Home 1903 (18362.10000) installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone in the community that is a producer or DJ has the same issue and found a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>What settings do you show for Sleep, display turn off, hibernation and any other power timing events both on and off battery?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice my XPS 13 9365 is giving me static with sound when on battery but stops when it is plugged in.&nbsp; This also just started recently.</p>

<p>I watch my system by leaving the Task Manager open to the performance tab.&nbsp; When something starts up, like the CPU or drive, I can see it.&nbsp; For instance, when I get static in the sound, the processor is down around .6 GHz and when plugged in it seems to
 run around 1.4 GHz but can drop down to .8 GHz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never used some pf the settings you show above, so I will have to check mine.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I can't remember the exact apps. I went to the Add/Remove programs screen, typed Dell and started removing one by one the Dell apps while testing the results on Serato DJ. Try and remove first any apps that mention 'Power' eg. Power management.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes the switch on a screenshot is disable at all so I can't switch between on and off (but i solved that problem by disabling-enabling wifi adapter&nbsp;</p>

            When my laptop suddenly showed no ssid's , fix was remove battery, remove ac adapter, hold the power button for 30 seconds or so.. then walk away for a couple hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; Push the switch a few times before re-installing the battery and ac .. and bingo, it
 worked.

    <title>Reserved Domains and Account Aliases - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexei.rozmas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reserved Domains and Account Aliases</h2>
                    <p>I created an alias (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) on my domain (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***), I then made that alias my primary, before deleting my original reserved domain name (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question one: What happened to my original reserved domain name and why can't I remake it it my primary alias?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question two: What happens to the emails that are sent to that original domain (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question Three: How do I regain access to my original domain (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see my concern, I have many important emails being forwarded to that account which I can't get access to. Does the original domain still exist, and is it still receiving my emails? And if it doesn't, what's happening to those emails and how am
 I supposed to manage all of my accounts that are associated with that original domain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am awed at how this one flaw in Microsoft's alias/domain system can create such a huge, complicated impact in the simple notion being able to receive one's email.</p>

<p>Hi Alexei,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you remove an alias that's an email address from a Microsoft domain like @hotmail.com, it cannot be added again as an alias for any Microsoft account. However, you can try to access your Hotmail account and let us know if you're able to log in. If not,
 you can go to this <a href="https://account.live.com/ACSR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and recover your account so you can gain access and check your email on your Hotmail account again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            How do I run a SQL query in Mac Excel&#63;</h2>
                    I made a QueryDef within an Excel workbook. This works without any problems with my Windows Excel but my colleague's Mac Excel returns a security warning message (maybe Firewall) and blocks my script. Any ideas how to get this script running? Note: I have
 only experience with Windows Excel.<br />

<p><span><strong>Hey Seamouse,</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that this is frustrating. Please answer the below questions so that it would help us in assisting you better?<br />
<br />
a. How long did you have this issue?<br />
<br />
b. Did you make any changes on your computer?<br />
<br />
c. Do you have history in the address bar or is it missing only missing from the Favorites center?<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>To narrow down the issue, I would suggest you to follow the below methods:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In Internet Explorer, the Auto complete feature enables you to record the history of sites that you visited and prevent your form retyping the web address while browsing the same webpage in the future.
<br />
<br />
It can be enabled or disabled from <strong>Tools -&gt; Internet options -&gt; Content -&gt; AutoComplete (Settings).</strong> For your current situation, you might check the box before Browsing history option under the Address bar.<br />
<br />
<span>Also make sure the under General tab, the option that say ‘Delete Browsing History on exit’ is unchecked.</span><br />
<br />
</span><span><span><strong>Method2:
<br />
<br />
</strong>If you still come across the issue, you may the try below step:</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Copy these instructions into Notepad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. Close all instances of Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3. Open Windows Explorer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>4. Press the Alt key on your keyboard to show the menus, click the Tools menu and choose Folder Options.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>5. On the View tab, enable "Show hidden files, folders and drives" and uncheck "Hide protected operating system files".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>6. Click the OK button.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>7. Type this (exactly as shown) into the Windows Explorer address bar and press Enter on your keyboard</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows<br />
<br />
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>8. Delete the hidden system folder called "History".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>9. Open Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>10. You should now have a new [working] History folder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method3:
<br />
<br />
</strong>I hope the above methods should fix the issue. If that doesn’t, then you may try to reset the Internet Explorer settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Access the below link and try the Fix it Tool mentioned in the KB article to automatically carry out the steps to reset Internet explorer settings:
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</span></a><span><span>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Disclaimer:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental
 control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope the above information helps you. Give a shot.</span></p>

                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me get back control of my Windows Insider updates. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now in Settings-&gt;Update&amp;Security-&gt;Windows Insider Programme it says the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Another Administrator has set up this device to successfully receive builds. If you want you can take control of which builds this device receives". See screenshot for further info.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a34198ce-4adc-44b3-a557-7c0fcca335f1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a34198ce-4adc-44b3-a557-7c0fcca335f1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Take Control" button does nothing when pressing it. I am not part of a domain and this is my home system, so nobody should have control over when and what build I receive except me. I assume MSFT has done this. How do I get control back so I can&nbsp; choose
 which track I am on and what builds to receive? This has been going on for two weeks now. I have looked everywhere I can think of for an answer. Search engines, this forum, feedback hub, etc. I have checked all my settings in Update which are normal. Developer
 settings are correct, etc. I have posted this issue numerous ways in the Feedback Hub and have had no responses. I am getting VERY frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device setup is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface Pro 3&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intel I7</p>
<p>256 SSD</p>
<p>8 Gb memory</p>
<p>Win 10 pro version 15063 rs2_release</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help on this matter.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Powerpoints not visible on OneNote App</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While on my PC, I inserted powerpoint slides to my onenote notebook on the full version. However, when I try to view the same notebook via the app on either my Android tablet or on the app version on my PC, the images are replaced with a blockout. Is there
 a way to fix this? I have attached screenshots for reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance !</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Christine19,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, the PowerPoint file doesn’t display when you open the notebook in your Android tablet and the OneNote app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try using manually sync the notebook and check the result. Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>File</strong>, click <strong>View Sync Status</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7a06ce1-3331-4fae-8bc6-f7da0911e94a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7a06ce1-3331-4fae-8bc6-f7da0911e94a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In the <strong>Shared Notebook Synchronization</strong> window, choose the problematic notebook then click
<strong>Sync now</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6b43e9f-b25a-4eb8-a58d-fc9cd70d60ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6b43e9f-b25a-4eb8-a58d-fc9cd70d60ff" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I found you are connecting to a wireless network, please try changing to another network then wait for loading the PowerPoint file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>

<p>Hi Tisky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I cannot see the presentation when I insert it into OneNote 2016 &amp; try to view on the OneNote app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) On the PC: OneNote 2016; </p>
<p>Android App is version 16.0.8269.1769 (I just downloaded it from the play store a few days ago)</p>
<p>On PC app: App is version&nbsp;17.8269.57841.0</p>

<p>Since I haven't been able to view my powerpoints within the one note app, I decided to export it to a PDF to see if that would work. In a notebook with 20 pages, 3 ppts per page, it worked for the first 5 pages and the rest look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/948e394d-3d32-4e06-9edd-2e47f8a9d58a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/948e394d-3d32-4e06-9edd-2e47f8a9d58a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried making the pdf via both the 'export' and 'print to pdf' option and both yielded the same results. I would really just like to be able to view the ppts + my notes I've made in OneNote 2016 on my android tablet. What else can be done for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi Sky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. After checking that it was set to sync all files &amp; images, the problem persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Notebook is stored in Personal OneDrive.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/173565f3-baf8-4469-9f8c-bf0ce1dce054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/173565f3-baf8-4469-9f8c-bf0ce1dce054" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have uploaded the powerpoint file to the link as requested. The error persists whether I do 'insert file printout' or print -&gt; send to onenote from powerpoint. Please note that this error occurs for all of my powerpoints, not just this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Here is the link to one of the affected workbooks. They actually all exhibit the same issue.</p>

<p>Can you try opening the notebook via OneNote Online and see if the behavior is the same?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is, please try inserting a Word/PDF printout via OneNote 2016 &amp; OneNote Online (please test both) and see if you also get the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also shared you a notebook from my end via private message. Please try opening it on your end and see if you get the same issue on my notebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Sheen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried with OneNote online it was the same at first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I converted the ppt to a pdf and then inserted on OneNote online, which was then visible on OneNote App &amp; OneNote 2016 ! So that's great news, I will be doing that for all my future ppts, but I wonder if anything can be done for my existing ones? As
 I have already typed in extensive notes on OneNote with them... if not that is okay I will make do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The notebook you shared with me on the message does not exhibit any issues, I am able to see it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you help,</p>
<p>Christine</p>

<p>Hi Christine19,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glad to hear you can find a workaround now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you could see the pictures in the notebook Sheen shared, the issue should be related to your Online notebook other than the OneNote client. As this category mainly focus on Office 365 for Business
 (Such as Notebooks stored in OneDrive for Business, SharePoint) and your notebook is stored in personal OneDrive, we would suggest you post to
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_drive-mso_other?sort=lastreplydate&amp;dir=desc&amp;tab=question&amp;status=All&amp;status=all&amp;mod=&amp;modAge=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;threadType=all&amp;isFilterExpanded=true&amp;tm=1500571109712">

<p>When you download the same file again, it will not overwrite the original file. Instead, it will give you the same file name with a number on it. Regarding your concern, there’s no option to change the limit of downloading a file
 with the same file name. We would highly appreciate if you could provide a feedback about this using our Feedback Hub app. This will help our developers improve the functionality of every application. To do this, refer to the steps below:</p>

            For Nokia 701 there must be the official Nokia social app available built in the firmware or via software update client on your phone. Or still if you need some other app, you can get it from within the Facebook mobile site. The latest 3.01 version is
 quite satisfactory.

            you can also use third-party clients such as Gravity, or fMobi, available in the Nokia Store.

    <title>Keypad lock in Samsung Omnia &#40;and other features&#41; driving me - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cj4mensd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keypad lock in Samsung Omnia &#40;and other features&#41; driving me crazy&#33;</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to change the settings on the keypad lock that pops up every 2 seconds when you are on a call on the Samsung Omnia 910?&nbsp; Then you have to release it by pushing ONLY the mouse button and then it pops back before you have a chance to
 do what you need to do (enter digits, turn on speaker phone, etc.)&nbsp; I guess I understand the purpose of the thing so you don't dial with your face or chin, but the way they've made this thing is crazy.&nbsp; Also, I'd love to know if they'res a way to turn the
 speakerphone on BEFORE starting to make a call.&nbsp; Also, is there a way to tell which apps are running without opening the task manager?&nbsp; I find that I think I've closed an application but in fact it's still running in stealth mode.&nbsp; I am looking for something
 like the taskbar in MS Windows to tell me what's open.&nbsp; Also, is there a way to add a shorcuts link to the today page?&nbsp; I am in my 30 day trial period with this machine from Verizon and it looks like it will most likely be getting shipped back to them if I
 can't get the simplest things in the user interface to work.<br />
Thanks to anyone who can help before I chuck it in the Pacific!

To kill the pop up lock please visit <a href="http://www.samsung-omnia.org/how-to/howwhatwherewhichwhywhen/60/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
To&nbsp;answer a call with&nbsp;the speaker phone in advance, that would be great...but isn't possible<br />
<br />
to have a visable&nbsp;active task bar you can look into the Wisbar application <a href="http://www.lakeridgesoftware.com/products/pocketpc/WisBarAdvance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Enjoy. The great thing about Windows Mobile is that it is possible to tweak
