You will probably get a better answer if you post to the Project Server forum at, http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/projectserver2010general. This forum is dedicated to questions/issues about the stand alone versions of Project.<br />

    <title>Minimum OS installation option - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mdvlhllspwn999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minimum OS installation option</h2>
                    May I suggest a minimum "must have" OS install option and not include any fluff applications. &nbsp;I find myself uninstalling a lot of applications after the initial OS install which causes much wasted time. &nbsp;Users who like to customize their PC should not
 have to spend countless numbers of hours uninstalling components before they add on their personal flavor of applications to their liking. &nbsp;Not to mention that the uninstall is never clean and leaves much reminiscence of the old product.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello MD</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really want a tiny OS <a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
click on this link</a> for an OS that's only 50MB in size.&nbsp; Here is a quote from their website:</p>
<p>
<strong>Damn Small Linux is a very versatile 50MB mini desktop oriented Linux distribution.<br />
<br />
</strong>Damn Small is small enough and smart enough to do the following things:
</p><ul>
<li>Boot from a business card CD as a live linux distribution (LiveCD)</li><li>Boot from a USB pen drive</li><li>Boot from within a host operating system (that's right, it can run *inside* Windows)</li><li>Run very nicely from an IDE Compact Flash drive via a method we call "frugal install"</li><li>Transform into a Debian OS with a traditional hard drive install</li><li>Run light enough to power a 486DX with 16MB of Ram</li><li>Run fully in RAM with as little as 128MB (you will be amazed at how fast your computer can be!)</li><li>Modularly grow -- DSL is highly extendable without the need to customize</li></ul>
<p>I hope this is useful to you.</p>

            Metro Applications are the prime examples of fluff that needs to be options. &nbsp;Applications that are included such as news feed, sports, stock ticker, weather, social media, etc. &nbsp; These applications aren't bad if you use them but all the people I know;
 none of them ever use them and they take up resources.

            <p>'metro' is what the 'WinRT" or similar "apps" were called back in the pre-8 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has morphed that into 'Universal' but they're still:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) single instance</p>
<p>b) 2D flat ugly</p>
<p>c) "phone application" style</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Example, any of the live tile "apps" in W10, the 'Settings' screen, and so forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of the back-end and the way that they are written, they are MUCH SLOWER than native application counterparts. &nbsp;They take LONGER to load [my experience, a minute or more back during the beta portion of the insider program], typically consume 100%
 CPU the entire time they're running, and on 8 machines, take over the entire desktop in full-screen mode, regardless [like a phone OS would do].</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of their ugly look, gross inefficiency, and (in essence) LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY, these "the METRO" apps(sic) are VERY VERY BAD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have YET to see one that's worth downloading or running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And since MANY of us *immediately* customize our W10 systems to REMOVE as MUCH of this GARBAGE as possible (weather, sports, news, people, all live tiles HITTING THE INTERNET TOO OFTEN and WASTING BANDWIDTH and SHOVING MOVING TILE GARBAGE IN OUR FACES),
 and DISABLE it running in the background [so it's not constantly "updating", particularly important if you pay for bandwidth or have limited capacity and want OTHER THINGS/PEOPLE to be able to use that bandwidth that you don't have a lot of], there should
 be an OPTION for "minimum install", or at LEAST remove ALL of the "the METRO" 'apps(sic)' from the system WITH A SINGLE OPTION DURING SETUP.</p>

<h2>            Something Went Wrong, Sorry we ran into a problem</h2>
                    For the last couple of hours I've been trying to install office 365, but everything I do no matter what I get the same error "Something Went Wrong, Sorry we ran into a problem." Instead of telling me what went wrong, it just sends me to a forum page with
 a bunch of angry people who have the same problem and no solutions. I'm just tired of dealing with this and I'm probably just going to unsubscribe unless somebody can figure out how to fix this.

            Hello Anthony, I totally agree with you. I have tried installing the older versions and can't get them so I decided to try the new one "Office 365" but I'm getting the same as you are. I'm trying to learn all about using Word for a career, but I'm not
 getting any luck on it none what so ever. I put in my credit card info, the least they can do is tell us something. This is rediculous! If I don't get an answer by tonight, I'M DONE with it thisa way! Hopefully we will get something soon!

    <title>Alternative Simple Dual-Boot Setup for Testing Insider Preview Builds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don cuthbert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alternative Simple Dual-Boot Setup for Testing Insider Preview Builds</h2>
                    <p>The advantage of using dual-boot for Windows Insider builds is that if a build causes your PC to quit functioning, you can always boot to the current public build so that you can keep using the PC.</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________</p>
<p>This method allows you to create a partition for Insider Builds, copy Windows 10 to it and easily change the BCD to boot to the new install from within your current running Windows 10 public build.&nbsp; The usual dual-boot setup requires booting from Windows
 10 install media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First decide how much disk space you want to allocate to Insider Preview Builds.&nbsp; This document suggests a minimum of 20GB to upgrade to Windows 10 64-bit.
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications?OCID=win10_null_vanity_win10specs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications?OCID=win10_null_vanity_win10specs</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Disk Management or Diskpart to shrink drive C: by the amount that you have chosen for Insider Builds.&nbsp; Create a new Primary partition/Simple volume.&nbsp; Quick-format the new volume with NTFS and give it a drive letter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mount your current public build ISO for Windows 10.&nbsp; Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the \Sources folder on the mounted ISO.&nbsp; Now use DISM to apply the files from \Sources\Install.wim to the drive letter of your new volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below uses drive F:\ for the new volume that was created:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">DISM /Apply-Image /ImageFile:Install.wim /Index:1 /ApplyDir:F:\ /Verify</p>
<p>
</p><p>After DISM finishes copying Windows to the new volume,&nbsp;run this command to create the dual-boot entry in your BCD:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">bcdboot F:\Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb9692d8-440e-469a-b015-c62cda075297" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb9692d8-440e-469a-b015-c62cda075297" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you type bcdedit, you will see that F:\Windows is now {default} and C:\Windows is {current}.&nbsp; It is important to leave the new install as {default} until Windows finishes installing, as it will restart before is complete.&nbsp; To change the description of
 the new install, you can enter:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">bcdedit /set {default} description "Insider Preview"</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8438374a-e0a7-4f11-aca9-c7c6bed8bc37" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8438374a-e0a7-4f11-aca9-c7c6bed8bc37" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your computer and Windows will setup a second install of Windows 10 on the new partition.&nbsp; You can then sign-in to Windows&nbsp;using your Insider Microsoft Account and join that install to the Fast Ring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a new Insider Build is released, set the Insider install to be the default boot using msconfig or Advanced System settings, so that during upgrade of that partition, the reboots work properly.</p>
<p>

 C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources\Install.esd.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You will need to select that option before entering the above text so that it is into the First Page Header that you enter it.&nbsp; It's probably easier to start with a second page already in your document and then you can go straight from the First Page Header
 to the Primary Header (the one that repeats on the balance of the pages in the Section of the document) without having to leave the header area to add the second page to the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can enter the text for the Primary header and then click on the Different First Page option and the Primary Header will disappear from view and the First Page Header area will appear and into that you can add the text as above.&nbsp; When a
 second page is later added to the document, the text that was entered into the Primary Header will automatically appear.</p>

<h2>            Formatting a Code to coordinate a color to a cell based on name. Thanks&#33;</h2>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In B57:B96 I have names. In G57:G96 are the same names, but in a different order. When I activate (click) one of the names in G I want the background color of the&nbsp; B-cell with the same name to become yellow but only so long as the G-cell is activated.</p>
<p>Even better would be that the B-cell background is yellow as long as the cursor is over the G-cell with the same name (so without having to activate that G-cell).</p>
<p>Please help me with the code I need. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><br />
Here's an approach that uses a variant of a function that is not often useful but is perfect for this scenario.&nbsp; The code support is minimal and maybe you can even do without it.</p>
<p>The key is to use the CELL function as part of a conditional formatting formula.</p>
<p>My test: Highlight the data in C1:C20 that contained the same value as a selected cell in the range G1:G20.</p>
<p>So, select C1:C20 and create a conditional formatting formula</p>
<p>=IF(CELL("col")=COLUMN(G:G),C1=CELL("contents"),FALSE)</p>
<p>For the c.f. format I picked a background fill color.</p>
<p>Now, click on any cell in G1:G20 and press F9, which calculates the worksheet.&nbsp; The cells in C1:C20 with the same value as the selected cell in G will have the background fill visible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To skip having to press the F9 key, add the code below in the worksheet's code module:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option Explicit</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.Calculate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Sub<br />

            I wasn't originally thinking of a multiple selection in G57:G96, but that should be accounted for. Here is a multiple selection modification to my originally posted snippet.<br />
<br />
<div>Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Range("B57:G96").Interior.Pattern = xlNone<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If Not Intersect(Target, Range("G57:G96")) Is Nothing Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Each gc In Target<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Each bc In Range("B57:B96")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If bc.Value = gc.Value Then bc.Interior.Color = 65535<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next bc<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next gc<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've edited by original&nbsp;response&nbsp;to reflect this modification.</div>

<p>I can't seem to get the syntax right to make this query work in Access 2007. The error message I'm getting now is Microsoft Access database engine cannot find input table or query 'Cus_Address_Detail'. Make sure it exists and the name is spelled correctly.<br />
<br />
The tables are linked tables so I'm not sure if I need to have something in front of table name so it knows what ODBC connection to use. If so, what would the syntax be for something like that? I've tried PPRO.dbo.Cus_Address_Detail with PPRO being the name
 of my ODBC connection, but it does not like that either. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know what I need to change to make this work?</p>

    <title>Corrupt pictures on the N86 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smilecentre  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt pictures on the N86</h2>
                    I have had an N86 for several months now. It was an upgrade from the N96, and in almost every way I like it. However, when I restored the backup from the N96 onto the N86 a number of pictures became corrupted. I can't delete them. I've tried everything,
 including resetting the phone in several different ways. As far as I can see, the pictures DON'T EXIST - not in file manager, not anyway - but they are there in the gallery. That means that slide shows don't work unless I laboriously select all the photos
 that I want, which is a right pain. Any suggestions?

<p><span><strong><span>NOTE: In front of the hash key ( #) there is also a STAR key that people often miss and state that the

 newer <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>nokia</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> phones at least n series, e series and s60 based phones have udp - user data preservation so not ALL data may be lost. still it is a good idea
 to always do a back up of your stuff.)3. This you perform as a last resort. Nothing else is working.If the phone is not showing any activity, proceed with
<strong><strong>hard</strong></strong> formatting , turn off your phone, hold the following buttons while pressing the power button. (the default

 those buttons until you see the <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Nokia</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> boot up screen. once you feel the phone power up you can let go off the power button while still holding all three buttons
 ( for <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Nokia</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> 5800XM - use the following buttons to do a
<strong><strong>hard</strong></strong> <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>reset</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>, /<span>GREEN/<span><span><font color="#993300">RED</font></span><span>/<font color="#0000ff">CA</font><font color="#0000ff">MERA</font><span>&nbsp;keys
 pressed all at once on power up. this will only work on 5800's that have firmware version 20... and up. ) For
<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Nokia</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>&nbsp;<strong>N97</strong>&nbsp;(unofficial version but works) is&nbsp;</span><font color="#0000ff">SHIFT /SPACE BAR / BACKSPACE</font><span>&nbsp;while

<p><span>If these <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>codes</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> are not working the only thing for you to do is contact your

 with that, I get just a still image of the banner (.swf file). I have also watched 2 separate You Tube videos which explain the process shown above and see that it works in the videos. But I can not get it to work. I am at a point of thinking there is some
 sort of glitch in my copy of Power point and perhaps I need to repair or uninstall it and start over.

            <p>More than anything I am less then impressed with Microsoft support options for product(Office 365), one which I really don't own, but will continue "renting" for $10 a month ...forever. Quite a scheme really. Chat support says the issue is above their pay
 grade, and when you call in, you get a call center in India I believe and it takes 2-3 tries before they can hear you on the phone even. Then they proceed to read off the instructions, which are widely available on the web &amp; I have copied here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found multiple webpages saying that it will not work because I am running a 64-bit system, as TonyBatt suggested. I do not fully accept this explanation though, because I have Adobe flash on this machine and can properly run the same .swf files, which
 display perfectly. To me this indicates a bug within installation or the program. I have tried repairing my installation and also uninstalled and then reinstalled Office, to no avail, which I think narrows it down to a glitch in the program.</p>

            One scenario that would fit the symptoms involves that word being marked as some language other than English.<br />

Select the word, go to the Review tab of the ribbon, click the Language button and choose Set Proofing Language. Which language is selected?<br />

            This makes no sense.&nbsp; Yesterday Word/Outlook did not complain about "awhile".&nbsp; Today, the language is still set as U.S. English but it is complaining about "awhile" again.

            The answers to the following may or may not help...<br />

In File &gt; Options &gt; Proofing &gt; Custom Dictionaries,<br />
<ul>
<li>what file is selected as the default custom dictionary, and are there more than one?</li><li>is the path and filename listed for that file the same as the one you said you edited in a text editor?</li><li>what language (or "All Languages") is listed in the Dictionary Language dropdown for that file?</li><li>is the Edit Word List button enabled or grayed out?</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another thing to consider: What program did you use to edit the dictionary file? If you don't use the Edit Word List button in the Word dialog, then it's best to use Notepad because it's least likely to make unwanted changes in the file; but when you save
 the changes in Notepad, use the Save As command (but save to the same filename) and

            It may be worth changing the Dictionary Language dropdown to "All Languages" (it's the entry at the very top of the list) and clicking OK.<br />
<br />
The difference as far as the Custom.dic file is concerned is that for English (U.S.) the line<br />
<br />
#LID 1033<br />
<br />
is inserted at the beginning of the file (1033 is the language ID for English (U.S.)), while the "All Languages" dictionary has no LID line at all.<br />
<br />
If you change the Dictionary Language setting, it will remove the LID line from the file but won't change anything else.<br />

            <p>That is an excellent question.&nbsp; I don't remember my exact usage but based on your question I looked closer.&nbsp; Word likes "He jumped awhile" but does not like "He jumped for awhile".&nbsp; Now I would still consider that "awhile" is being used as an adverb in the
 second example.&nbsp; But maybe I am incorrect.</p>

            Like I said, it is confusing. The second instance it is being used as the subject of a preposition, thus as a noun. Proper usage (according to the Grammar Girl) is for a while.<br />

Sometimes, Word really does know what it is doing.<br />

            You may be seeing Outlook.com because your account was automatically upgraded from Hotmail. Hotmail customers who were upgraded automatically to Outlook.com were notified in advance via email.<br />
<br />
Why was my account chosen to be upgraded automatically?<br />
<br />
When we launched Outlook.com preview, we shared plans to eventually upgrade all Hotmail customers to Outlook.com. To help ensure a smooth transition, the upgrade will be gradual. Your upgrade is part of the process.<br />
<br />
Can I switch back to Hotmail?<br />
<br />
If you were automatically upgraded to Outlook.com, the option to switch back to Hotmail isn't available.<br />
<br />
To see if you have the option to switch back, check for the Switch back to Hotmail link in Outlook.com. Go here for steps on how to check for the link.<br />
<br />

<br />
For more information about the automatic upgrade and Outlook.com please click here.<br />

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/auto-upgrade-outlook-FAQ<br />
<br />
Some accounts that are "co-branded" are not currently eligible to be upgraded to Outlook.com. This includes accounts that were offered through companies like Bell Canada and Telstra, as well as some MSN accounts.

<br />
This will be addressed soon, so please be patient. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you want to try it out, then I suggest creating a new email address and temporarily forwarding your old mail to the new inbox. But, keep in mind that you won't be able to "merge" these accounts later. &nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>Seriously!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just typing an important document and I had auto save set for every 10 minutes.&nbsp; Word shut down and did not recover my document, it only recovered my original... What the heck!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft is supposed to improve their products,
 but every time my computer upgrades, the quality of the programs/apps gets worse.&nbsp; This was 15 hours of work, gone, gone, gone and everything I read says it should have auto saved....&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate Microsoft and its poor performance!!!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Mr. Mayor's information is correct and his advice is sound. The Add-In is free, people can choose to contribute for its production if they want. If you rely on the autorecovery feature, you will be disappointed eventually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr. Mayor's advice is based on decades of experience not only using Word but assisting others in their use of it. I have personally observed him assisting people with this problem at least since Word 97.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>"AutoRecover and Backup Copies</strong><br />
"Hate losing work? I do. That's why I keep a very short leash on AutoRecover. I also tell Word to always make a backup copy. At this point in my life I have more disk space than I have time to re-create lost work.<br />
</p>
<p>'To set the AutoRecover interval, choose File &gt; Options and click the Save tab. Under 'Save AutoRecover information every,' choose an interval that reflects your work habits. If you're a fast worker you might want to set it to as little as every minute or
 two. For most users the default 10 minutes seems a bit too infrequent. Note, however, that AutoRecover is not the same thing as automatic save. AutoRecover comes to the rescue only if Word crashes or you otherwise forget to save something. It does not automatically
 do a normal save of your document. Saving your document is up to you.<br />
"To enable backup copies, select File&gt; Options and click the Advanced tab. Under Save, enable Always Create Backup Copy.<br />
"Even with both of these settings enabled, I still do frequent saves - every time I press the enter key and certainly every time the phone rings. It's extremely frustrating to see Word crash while you're on the telephone. I have been known to utter some rather
 colorful comments on such occasions."</p>

    <title>Utilizing Resource Usage as a resourcing heat map - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom nathan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Utilizing Resource Usage as a resourcing heat map</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We have a very good resourcing tool that is based on an SSRS report for resource forecasting and heat-mapping (figure 1)</p>
<p>However, this functionality is very similar to using the Resource Usage report within MS Project itself (figure 3)</p>
<p>Also, the update time for SSRS reports can bog down due to the sheer number of project we have running so having this as live report in Project is desirable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Don't look at the actual data as it is from different times!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway of:</p>
<p>1. creating a new cell type being "Capacity" - ie how many hours in that week or day a person is available</p>
<p>2. conditionally formatting cells - ie 0 - 85% load is orange (underutilized), 85 - 100% is green (utilized), &gt;100% is red (over utilized), blue for if a task is pending etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like the Resource Usage in Project is completely underutilized as a planning tool!</p>

<p>To answer your questions, no, additional timescaled fields cannot be added, and the field cells of the timescaled data cannot be separately formatted.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive &#34;Activity Center&#34;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Trying to pause OneDrive synching until I can clean-up some files and folders, then I will set the synch back on.&nbsp; However, the instructions state to "...select OneDrive blue or white icon and click on Activity Center.&nbsp; Do not see "Activity Center".&nbsp; Is
 there a step missing??

            Hi Barbara
<br />
<br />Right click the OneDrive icon 
<br />
<br />Click 'Close OneDrive'
<br />
<br />That's It, OneDrive will now be closed and syncing stopped until you open the OneDrive app again . . .
