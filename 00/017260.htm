<h2>            Nokia Lumia 1020</h2>
                    <p>How can I upgrade my nokia 1020 to Windows 10? My Messenger for Face book app no longer works?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will other apps on my phone slowly start not working at all in the future?</p>
<p>I may have to upgrade to a different phone if these problems continue.</p>
<p>I definitely will consider going with another brand of phone other than Windows.</p>

            <p>A Lumia 1020 is not supported for upgrading to windows 10 mobile. And also not getting any windows 10 mobile builds</p>
<p>That means you can't upgrade your phone.</p>

            I may have to consider upgrading to another phone. But I am comfortable with what the apps do for me. I absolutely love the camera on it and it is so easy to navigate.

            <p>About the Facebook Messenger App, you might adress your complaints to Facebook.</p>
<p>They have decided to drop support on various older OS'ses incl WP8.1 and also some Android and IOS versions.</p>
<p>MIcrosoft is not responsible for that Messenger App, its Facebook who has developed that app.</p>
<p>That also means Microsoft can't don anything in this matter.</p>

<p>All 3 have been up and running and I am using 1 right now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The only thing I timed was my 8 year HP Pavilion (E7500 CPU, 6 GB, SSD).&nbsp; After that I got busy making an ISO and starting updates on my other 2 desktops.&nbsp; The first part of the update on the HP took 95 min. which seems about the same as with 16241.&nbsp; It
 sure beat the h*ll out of the SSD between 75% and 95%.&nbsp; That seems consistent with what Jason said about the design of UUP to move things from the latter stages to the first stage so we'd be able to do other things for longer (since we can't use the PC between
 the first reboot and when it finishes).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;4 out of 5 updates from 16241 to 16251 went flawlessly, but the update on my Dell Inspiron 660 (4 years old I5, 8 GB, 1 TB HDD) ran into a problem after rebooting and reverted back to 16241.&nbsp; In the process it disabled my dual boot disabling me from getting
 to my Windows 7 partition.&nbsp; While that gave me a few tense minutes, I ran BCDEdit, made the Win 7 partition the 1st boot device, and Win 7 came up normally.&nbsp; I had a backup, but was glad not to have to fool with it.&nbsp; I haven't had time to chase down what the
 problem was, but will pursue that tomorrow.&nbsp; I swear PCs are female!&nbsp; Funny though, I can't get any women to agree about that.&nbsp; :)</p>

<p>1. Clevo D900f was updated outside of active hours, waiting for sign-in and 16251 was installed successfully first go.</p>
<p>2. Surface Pro 3 (SP3) I updated myself due to it being turned off, when I started the update, installation went fast, got to 77% then it bogged down, it went like this until 94% then zoomed along once again, rebooted and 16251 was installed successfully,
 first go.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I found out what happened on my Dell desktop.&nbsp; The old bugaboo of not clearing out the SoftwareDistribution\Download folder bit it.&nbsp; This time I cleaned it out &amp; retried, again using the ISO I made yesterday, and the 1st reboot took place in 25 min.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The problem with the dual boot going away was caused by a failed restart; apparently the update process turns off the switch to show the boot menu for the 1st reboot.&nbsp; All I had to do was go into EasyBCD and turn that back on, and voila, dual boot is back.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Update:&nbsp; Start to HI screen on Dell desktop <strong>44 minutes total!</strong>&nbsp; (config above).</p>
<p>By all means if you have more than a couple of upgrades to do, making the ISO will save TONS of time.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Try it with fewer resources.&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt; &nbsp; FWIW I found a 40 GB VM presents challenges to the update process that they have thought about but not really given a smooth path for.&nbsp; The biggest problem IMO is the lack of obvious diagnostics for us to consider. &nbsp;
 For example, one of my failures made Windows Update troubleshooter (including flushing the downloads) a reasonable guess but it still seemed pretty hit or miss both doing it and retrying the update afterwards.&nbsp; One surprise was that WindowsUpdate.log generated
 well!&nbsp; I was anticipating a whole bunch of broken messages because this is a preview build.&nbsp; I'd say overall the Update process is improving.</p>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been practising how to calculate a lot of data with excel formulas but I am still the dark. In most cases I am given a lot of data in different columns and asked to calculate for example how many customers who are different in classes
 bought a certain product in different countries. So my problem is that I do not know how to identify all those customers in different categories using a formula. Please give me an activity with a memo so that I can see were I went wrong, I am using Excel 2016

<p>For any programming I always like to start simple and build up.&nbsp; Start with just one part of the forumula, if you need multiple conditions, then add one more condition at a time, to build up to the desired result.&nbsp; Start with small datasets with only a few
 rows and simple data so that you can calculate expected results in your head. </p>

Ever seen a formula like =SUMIFS(Sheet1!B2:B3923, Sheet1!C2:C3923, A1, Sheet1!D2:D3923, A2) and wondered what it is really doing?!?<br />
Formulas written with cell references tend to look complicated and clunky. What if we could write formulas in plain English? That is what Structural References do. When using structural references in formulas, your focus will be on your data, not on which cell
 ranges the data takes up. For example, you can write formulas like these:<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SUM(mySales[no. of customers]) to find how many customers we had.<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SUMIFS(mySales[no. of customers], mySales[product], “FastCar”) to find how many customers bought “FastCar”</span></p>

<br />
<strong><span>We all know that using named ranges is a good practice.</span></strong> So you went ahead and created names for every value in your complex workbook. But now, what about those formulas which still refer
 to cells by their addresses? Here is a quick tip to make your formulas readable by replacing cell addresses with the names in one go.<br />
<br />
<strong>Retroactively apply Names to existing formulas <br />

</strong>Suppose you already have a bunch of formulas in your worksheet, and they already reference cell A5 instead of WidgetPrice? You could, of course, select each formula and
<a href="https://davescomputertips.com/tag/edit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">edit</a> them to refer to WidgetPrice instead of A5, but that could certainly be a long process with a wide margin for errors. The solution is to allow Excel to do the editing for you.<span>&nbsp;

</span></strong><span>by Dave Bruns | July 10, 2018<br />
One of the most important skills of building useful formulas is creating criteria – the part of a formula that decides what to include or exclude in a calculation. However, it can be surprisingly tricky to build effective criteria because it requires a good
 understanding of how Excel handles data. If you've ever spent an afternoon troubleshooting a formula that seems like it should "just work", you know what I mean :)<br />
This guide aims to help you build formulas that work the first time. </span></p>

These people probably have their worst days ever: They made fatal errors in their spreadsheets. But they are not alone: According
<a href="http://panko.shidler.hawaii.edu/SSR/Mypapers/whatknow.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
to a study</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/88-of-spreadsheets-have-errors-2013-04-17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">88% of all spreadsheets have errors</a>. The reason – of course – is that every Excel file is created by a person – and people do mistakes.
<br />
The larger an Excel model gets, the more opportunities for mistakes&nbsp;exist. Many errors&nbsp;don’t really matter as they are not having an impact on the final results. But there are others which are quite grave. Let’s have a look at the 5 biggest Excel fails.<br />

            If you are on a none released build (you are) the only way to stop insider builds is to re-install the previous OS then upgrade to the released build.&nbsp; The last release build is 10586 released back in November.&nbsp; There will be another release build Aug
 2 and you might want to wait for that and then stop getting insider builds.

<h2>            Reading mail in Outlook</h2>
                    Something has changed in my incoming mail. When I open an email there are no pictures. I have to click on the option to view somewhere else to see anything other than words/letters/numbers. Never had to do that before. What happened.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Skype name cannot be changed.
</span><span>You only have an option to change the display name of your account and not the Skype name.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Skype name is the
</span><span>username you created when you first joined Skype, other than your email address or phone number. If you are using an email address or phone number when signing in on Skype, then you have a default
 Skype name that has the word “live:” </span></span></p>

<p>When I registered for a Skype account, I was not given the option to create a username. Now, my Skype account is just associated with my personal email address. This is inappropriate, as I use my Skype account for work and have to give everyone my personal
 email address in order for them to find me on Skype. This violates a lot of workplace culture surrounding the use of Skype, especially as we are an international organization and this is the main way to connect with employees in other countries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to create a Username to associate with my account that can be used to search for me on Skype, alternative to my email address?</p>

AlexandraBlackwell</a> -- I don't want my personal email address to be visible. To make matters more complicated, before I updated Skype for Mac I had the user name tlemel (which it appears to be still), when I sign on online it's live:tashalemel and on my
 iPad it's my personal email address -- I use my iPad for Skype calls 99% of the time. I could not sign on to my iPad account using my original username and all of my Skype contacts have disappeared as well. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but
 that didn't work. Now I have no contacts and I have no idea what to tell people to use to find me.

<p>Hi Van,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email address is displayed, it says so directly in my profile. Next to "Accounts" it shows my email address and that it is "public" and does not allow me to change this because I don't have a username. I would like to establish a username or Skype ID
 so that the username is associated with my public facing account info rather than my email address. I was not given the option to make a username when I first registered my account, it automatically took my email address.</p>

<p>It says ********, which was assigned to me, I did not choose this.&nbsp; Is this the only information I can give to contacts who are trying to find me?&nbsp; That is ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why Microsoft changed the username process when registering for a Skype account. No one I have talked to thinks this was a smart or efficient move, and you have made this substantially less convenient and personal for everyone using Skype. It's
 truly a shame.</p>

<p>Skype ID is not the sole option you have to be searched in Skype. People who wants to add you can search you from the directory by your Skype Name (Skype ID), email, phone number or your display name. But the most efficient way of finding a contact from
 the directory&nbsp;is by searching with a user's Skype Name (Skype ID). </p>

</p><p>Microsoft removed the option to create a unique username <span>to foc</span><span>us on&nbsp;allowing you to login-in with a single sign-in to Microsoft services with just one p</span><span>assword.</span></p>

<p>So given this information, my options are to have contacts search me using my full name, which often does not work efficiently, or for them to search me using my email or my phone number, which is why I asked this question on the first place - because I
 don't want to have to give out my email address in order for someone to find me on Skype. You say the most&nbsp;<span>efficient way of finding a contact from the directory&nbsp;is by searching with a user's Skype Name (Skype ID), and
 yet Microsoft removed this option for single sign-on, and I don't have a Skype Name (Skype ID). So in a very indirect and circular way, you are telling me that I can't get around this issue.</span></p>

            <p>What exactly is the problem? If its super tiny, your zoom is messed up. Set it to 100% using the Zoom button then close the window and reopen it. Zoom is the only way to enlarge the font in HTML messages for reading - you&nbsp; can change it for plain text in
 Stationery and fonts.&nbsp; For more information and screenshots, see <a href="http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/adjust-outlooks-zoom-setting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Caller ID For Japan - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agentkddi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Caller ID For Japan</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to enable Caller ID on my Skype account, in order to (hopefully) stop my calls being junked into the 1572 system when I try to call UK numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The number that I want to use as my caller ID is Japanese, but in the drop-down menu on the ‘Caller ID’ page, there is no option to choose ‘Japan’ as the caller ID country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this just some oversight on Microsoft’s part, or is there some other reason why I can’t set up a Japanese number as my Caller ID?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

    <title>Microsoft solitaire error 124 using an Android Smart Phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garyhuberym  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft solitaire error 124 using an Android Smart Phone</h2>
                    <p>I was getting an error code 124 when I started my Microsoft Solitaire app.&nbsp; I tried removing it and reloading it.&nbsp; That did not fix the issue.&nbsp; What did was to stop my wireless internet and sign on via my phone connection.&nbsp; It asked me to sign in and when
 I did it worked.&nbsp; No error code 124.&nbsp; I closed the app and restarted my wireless connection.&nbsp; By the way I am keying in to this forum with my computer using the network, so the network is working.&nbsp; I can also access the internet with my android and it works.&nbsp;
 That said, I again could not connect to Microsoft.&nbsp; It tried to connect, but would not give me the opportunity to sign on.&nbsp; &nbsp;I again signed off and no error 124.&nbsp; I also did not have to actually key in my password again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the question is why does Microsoft Solitaire work when I wireless is off and it does not work when wireless is on???????????&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also have this issue. When I am connected to my WiFi network, I get error code 124 when the app launches. When I disconnect from my WiFi and use my LTE connection, the error goes away. I do not get any option to use the app offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the troubleshooting steps listed on the MS Solitare for Android page by going into settings and clearing both the cache and app data. This did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also followed the steps Jack provided. I uninstalled the app, restarted my phone, then reinstalled the app. This did not resolve the issue.</p>

            Ughhh the waves, it is so bad now I cannot take a good photo except by luck. Video has it too. I have the same thing. I think it started around may and then went away then now it came back. Not sure if it is hardware or software though.

            <p>Unfortunately it isn't software. I was unlucky to have cracked my screen recently and therefore wouldn't be able to use the warranty, since I've read that a cracked screen voids the warranty. My camera wasn't working prior to me cracking the screen. So I
 decided to look for a replacement camera part and I was lucky enough to find someone selling it for $25 on eBay. I replaced it and the problem is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think if you are still under warranty, you should open a ticket.</p>

            <p>Mine has done it since new, can not get it fixed, the only option i have is to use the phone so the bottons are facing the ground and i can take a pict with out it jumping around, on videos you can hear the accelerometer (I am Assuming) jumping around as
 it bounces up and down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as i live in Victoria, Australia and the only store for repairs is 1000km away in Sydney I have to post it and be with out a phone for 2 weeks just for them to look at it &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Brian. My accounts are POP3. The actual name of the folder is "Sent Items" and it is under every profile. When I send a message from any profile, the sent message ends up under the default profile and I would like to have it saved in the profile from
 which the message is sent.<br />

            <p>An Outlook Profile only contains the mail accounts you have added to that Profile</p>
<p>I think you are confusing the term 'Profile'</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have added multiple pop mail accounts you will have the single set of default folders ie Inbox, Sent Items Tasks, Calendar, Contacts etc All mail will be in these folders, by default</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want each mail account to use a separate set of Personal folders you create a new data file for each mail account, then in Outlook 2007 you would need to create rules in order that the mail is sorted to its relevant Personal Folder set folder when
 sent/received&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Palcouk, what I did is create 2 new profiles and deleted the Personal profile. Under those 2 profiles (Data files) I created a new email account in each one - 2 new email accounts. Under each POP profile is a folder called "Sent Items".</p>

</p><p>What I want is when I send a message from profile1, I want the message to be saved in Profile1 &gt; Sent Items and the same for Profile2. If I receive a message, it automatically goes into the correct profile because I set it up that way, but I do not see an
 option for "Sent Items".</p>

<p>
</p><p>Each of the "Data Files" has a different e-mail address. <br />
</p>
<p>My question is: How do I send a message from DataFile2 e-mail address and have that message saved in "DataFile2 &gt; Sent Items" instead of "DataFile1 &gt; Sent Items"?<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Since they're POP accounts, there can be only one Sent Items folder that all the accounts will share, unless you create outgoing rules that will move the messages to the Sent Items folder based on the sending account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm curious why you have DataFile1 listed twice.</p>
