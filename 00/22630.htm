<h2>            Outlook.com emails not showing the replied to arrow anymore</h2>
                    <p>About 2 weeks ago, I noticed that emails weren't being marked as "replied to". If I checked the sent folder, I clearly see that I replied to an email, yet the email list doesn't show the arrow next to it, indicated it had been replied to already. I really
 need that, because I can't keep checking the sent folder every time. I tried deleting all my accounts and reentering them. Still no arrows. I have several accounts that I forward to my live.com account, then have the other email accounts as send only for responses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I missing? Where did the reply and forward arrows go after replying to or forwarding an email?</p>

            <p>I use Outlook.com mostly on a Windows laptop, but also on a Surface Pro and Android phone. This is why I use Outlook.com, to see all the emails no matter what device I am on at the time. I have not made changes to the account prior to this issue, but I have
 reset my external accounts many time since then hoping that would fix something. I need all my external accounts to track which emails I've replied to and to show the "replied to" arrow next to emails I've responded to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I currently have my external email accounts forwarded to my live account, then the external accounts added to Outlook.com as send only accounts, so they I can can send and reply to mail using the various external addresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other suggestions for having external accounts in Outlook.com track responses better?&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 not user friendly</h2>
                    <p>I'm having problems with Windows 10. Examples: My picture files keep closing. Games that were stored on my desktop are no longer accessible. It&nbsp;took a lot of effort to locate recently opened&nbsp;documents&nbsp;that used to be readily located with Windows 7.

<p>Also, there is no longer a start button. With&nbsp;Windows 7 I was able to locate programs using the start button.

</p>
<p>The first day I&nbsp;found an option to return to Windows 7, but it's lost now.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't find it any easier searching on the internet than it was with Windows 7.&nbsp; Another major problem is that windows close on their own, especially when I'm playing my online

            <p>I had downloaded and installed the free windows 10 but I soon found out that it is worst than windows 8. &nbsp; &nbsp;It took a while to locate the control panel, &nbsp;I could not access microsoft office 2007 and there were lots of other problems.</p>
<p>I searched for ways to roll back to windows 7. &nbsp; Go to you tube and &nbsp;find out how to roll back windows 10 to windows 7 or windows 8.1 only if you have accepted the free upgrade. &nbsp; You have 30 days in which you can do that.</p>

            <p>I started using Windows 10 Preview in Dec 2014</p>
<p>There is a huge long list of problems with Windows 10 on various computers I have installed it on.</p>
<p>Number one issue BSOD (Black Screen Of Death) that Microsoft thinks is a improvement over the old</p>
<p>Blue Screen of Death. First off the old BSOD allowed F8 SAFE MODE. New BSOD does not.</p>
<p>Instead like the 1970's TV you have to bang on the power button over and over to get a response.</p>
<p>If you get lucky and I do mean LUCKY! The trouble shooter will fix the problem, ONCE! And I do mean</p>
<p>only once on many different computers has the Trouble shooter ever worked. I have installed Windows 10 on</p>
<p>Dell, HP, Sony, Apple, Custom built MSI and others. Microsoft has this thing called Driver Certificates to combat</p>
<p>bad drivers, actually the problem is Windows 10 not the drivers. You want proof?</p>
<p>Ok Windows 7 driver on a device works on Windows 2000, Window XP and Windows 7, but not Window 10?</p>
<p>So what is going on? Well Windows 10 wants a verification on the Driver even though it works fine.</p>
<p>Number of issues with Windows 10 are just to many to list and you can find thousands on the Web.</p>
<p>Recently a FORCED UPDATE driver from Microsoft on Windows 10 disabled my mouse wheel so I spent 40 minutes&nbsp;</p>
<p>fixing this problem, then 3 hours later it again downloaded a driver for that model of mouse, again forcing me to adjust the mouse setting to work as desired.</p>
<p>Microsoft has the unmitigated gall to call this USER FRIENDLY?</p>
<p>Do not even get me started on how to fix problems when something goes wrong, very User Unfriendly.</p>
<p>Today it deleted a Adobe Reader after I attempted to delete a shortcut on the desktop, but on Microsoft&nbsp;</p>
<p>site said it would not do this.....whoops! </p>
<p>Again User Unfriendly!</p>

            <p>I don't know know what all the fuss is about, I already have Windows 10 and besides losing a picture of my newest and last grandchild, at 5 minutes old, looking straight up at her mother, like she understands everything she is saying.&nbsp; Actually she, the
 granddaughter, spoke with her eye for a long time. She would look at something and someone would go get it for her.&nbsp; She is my daughter's daughter.&nbsp; Lauren had 10 yr and 13 yr old boys,&nbsp;when she found out about her little surprise.&nbsp; And I was greatly surprised
 when I saw the sonogram and realized that "I can't see it, where is it" that there was nothing there because it was a girl.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My daughter and son-in-law never allowed anyone else in the delivery room, just the two of them but Joey always had his phone, Lauren said that they "just threw her' up on her stomach.&nbsp; Joey took a picture of Ava when she was 5 minutes old looking up at
 her momma while her momma was looking at and talking to her.&nbsp; Ave looked at her as if she understood every word.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joey took a picture with his phone, sent it to his mother's phone, which was really just one room away in the waiting room and Virginia, sent it to my email address.&nbsp; I printed it out but when Windows 10 was put on as a replacement of Windows 8 and or Windows
 8.1 I didn't think about her pictures still in my Saved Mail, email folder.&nbsp; I had printed it out when I got home and the picture has&nbsp;been misplaced and of course there is no way to get another copy unless Joey copied it on computer but I doubt it.&nbsp; They don't
 really have a good copier.&nbsp;&nbsp; They usually just put them on facebook. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want to do right now is just get the website of the pop up tent bed for Kerri to see if it might be good for Will when he comes home to spend the night.&nbsp; Can any one help me do that?</p>

            I too signed up for new Windows 10,and it is awful,its almost impossible to resize photos,all the normal folders like my computer and photo gallery are so slow to operate,and the right hand click drops down a completely different set of commands, I much
 prefer Windows 7, and if I could, I would change back in an instant.

</p><p>Windows 10 is NOT USER FRIEDLY! It is designed to be User Hostile!</p>
<p>Example I&nbsp;have in my home several computers all on the&nbsp;3 different&nbsp;Comcast&nbsp;Cable Modems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With out to much trouble Windows XP or Vista or OS X can find another computer and but now Windows 10!</p>
<p>You first must REBOOT Windows 10 to see the other computer then use the only workable answer I have
</p>
<p>ever found on this problem Windows 10 will not see other computers on network:</p>
<p>http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-enable-network-discovery-and-configure-shar.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>Odd that Microsoft does not even explain why this is set up this way in Window 7, 8 and 10?</p>
<p>For some insane reason you have to reboot Windows 10 at the drop of a hat on anything, so I can see why they bragged about speeding up the Reboot. You are going to be doing for EVERYTHING!</p>

                    <p>Recently I had problems with my Lumia 920. The only option available was using the Nokia Software Recovery Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone is working now, but it seems that impossible to restore my pictures. They are stored on OneDrive and I'm able to download them.</p>
<p>But when I try to place them on the phone, they all get the&nbsp;timestamp that I restored them and that's not the date and time that the pictures and videos were taken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get those pictures and videos back on the phone in the original date so they are shown correctly in the photo app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw: When I copy the files using the Windows Phone app for WIndows 7 and open the destination folder in explorer, they do have the right timestamp. Then when I disconnect and reconnect the phone to the PC the timestamps are suddenly different.</p>

<h2>            General Slicer Settings</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(180, 95, 6, 1)"><span>Slicer Caption:</span></span></p>
<p>
Slicer Caption is an option to change the Slicer name. By default Slicer took the field's name as Slicer name. For example if you use the command Insert | Slicer then it will show a list with all the present field names and you have to choose which field you
 want as Slicer. After choosing a field by Marking, Slicer will insert with that field name.
</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-muYzdN5y0JA/WJhtFQQcCyI/AAAAAAAACEU/QHN_l9k5Y7UhuPqD8ka_YGPtrH3RuNH6QCLcB/s1600/slicer_Caption.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2f4.bp.blogspot.com%2f-muYzdN5y0JA%2fWJhtFQQcCyI%2fAAAAAAAACEU%2fQHN_l9k5Y7UhuPqD8ka_YGPtrH3RuNH6QCLcB%2fs1600%2fslicer_Caption.png" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Image 1: Slicer Caption
</em></p>
<br />
If you want to change the Slicer name, just Click the Slicer to activate it. Now go to Options menu and edit the Slicer Caption as "Area Wise" from Slicer group and press Enter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(180, 95, 6, 1)"><span>Slicer Settings:</span></span><br />
<br />
Slicer Settings allow you to Show or Hide the Slicer name by marking or un-marking the Display header option. You can change the Caption from here too.
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m1VfbU4biD0/WJhtrJepaMI/AAAAAAAACEg/oAx_cLEpmKEirHOjNQib6tm42BcUjKUXgCLcB/s1600/slicer_setting.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2f4.bp.blogspot.com%2f-m1VfbU4biD0%2fWJhtrJepaMI%2fAAAAAAAACEg%2foAx_cLEpmKEirHOjNQib6tm42BcUjKUXgCLcB%2fs1600%2fslicer_setting.png" /></a></p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p><span><em>Image 2: Slicer Settings</em></span></p>
</div>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
By choosing the Ascending (A to Z) radio button you can sort the Slicer buttons from A to Z or Descending (Z to A) for Z to A. You can use the Use Custom Lists when sorting option for custom arranging list. I'll discuss how to create custom list for data sorting
 later. It is nothing but your own defined characters, dates, numbers, days, quarters etc. set them how will they follow your list for sorting. You can create a custom list by importing or creating it.
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
</div>
Sometimes while you use two or more Slicers, then it often happens that, you select a slicer button from a Slicer and few items are grayed out from others Slicer. That means there is no record found after the first filtering (clicking on slicer is one kind
 of filtering data). If you wish you can hide the grayed out Slicer buttons from Slicer by choosing the Hide items with no data. If you want to show the grayed out items, then you need to use the Visually indicate items with no data. And the Last option Show
 items with no data last will allow you if there is a grayed out button found in your Slicer, then Slicer will automatically move the button to last of the not grayed out product list. That means Slicer usually follows a sorting order rules A to Z or Z to A.
 If there is a button grayed out, then as per sorting order rules it will stay on where it to be as sorted. But this is not a good looking reporting. And it can disturb the report viewers. That is why if Show items with no data last option has selected, then
 it will move the grayed out button to the end of the active button list in the same slicer.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(180, 95, 6, 1)"><span>Slicer Styles:</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
From Options | Slicer Styles group you can change the visual formatting of your Slicer. There are 2 categories of Slicer auto formatting. Light and Dark. You can choose any style from here. Another thing is that, if you wish, you can create a custom Slicer
 style based on your reporting color. So that, you can create a beautiful report. This option you will find from New Slicer Style.
<div style="text-align: center">
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NkBk8MYbqa8/WJhvxCfqtSI/AAAAAAAACEw/fhEzbYf-Xjcw1XS2zSfSV0ziFaBHY8RAgCLcB/s1600/slicer_setting.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2f4.bp.blogspot.com%2f-NkBk8MYbqa8%2fWJhvxCfqtSI%2fAAAAAAAACEw%2ffhEzbYf-Xjcw1XS2zSfSV0ziFaBHY8RAgCLcB%2fs640%2fslicer_setting.png" height="408" width="640" /></a></p>
<p><em>Image 3: New Slicer Style option</em></p>
</div>
<p>
After clicking the New Slicer Style... the below dialog box will appear. Select Slicer Element and Click on Format button each time you select any Slicer Element.<br />
<br />
Then type a name in Name box. This will show in the Slicer Styles list. If you wish you can set the custom designed Slicer as the default Slicer format by marking the Set as default slicer style for this document option.

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>From the Arrange group of Options menu, there are few settings are available by which you can arrange Slicer, hide or show slicer, group and rotate the slicer. These are discussed as below:</p>
</div>
<span style="color: rgba(180, 95, 6, 1)"><br />
<span>Bring Forward:</span></span>
<span>Bring Forward:</span></span>
<p>Select the Slicer and choose this option to bring the Slicer one step forward if 2 or more Slicers are in very close.</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<p><em>Image 4: Bring Slicer forward or in front of all slicer</em></p>
</div>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(180, 95, 6, 1)"><span>Bring to Front:</span></span><br />
By selecting this option, will allow your Slicer to bring in the front of all other Slicers as the option icon said it clearly.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(180, 95, 6, 1)"><span>Send Backward:</span></span><br />
Select the Slicer and choose this option to bring the Slicer one step backward if 2 or more Slicers are in very close. It is the opposite of Bring Forward.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(180, 95, 6, 1)"><span>Bring to Back:</span></span><br />
By selecting this option, will allow your Slicer to bring in the back of all other Slicers as the option icon said it clearly.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(180, 95, 6, 1)"><span>Selection Pane:</span></span><br />
By clicking on this option, it will activate the Selection Pane. Again clicking on it, it will deactivate the Slicer Pane. You can see a list of all the Slicers name in the current worksheet. This pane helps you to easily select a Slicer or you can Hide or
 Unhide Slicers from this pane.<br />
<br />
You can show or hide all the current worksheet's Slicer at once by single clicking on Show All or Hide All button. There is an Eye icon in the Image 8 which is orange oval marked. By clicking on this icon you can hide the specific Slicer and again clicking
 on it, it will show you back the specific slicer.<br />
<br />
You can also move the Slicer's name from this list by clicking on Upper Direction Arrow icon or Down Direction Arrow icon which are located immediate upper of Eye icon.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(180, 95, 6, 1)"><span>Aline:</span></span><br />
You can arrange the Slicers by clicking on Aline option and then choosing these options: Snap to Grid, Snap to Shape and View Gridlines.
</p><div style="text-align: center"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7J7z6AQ9FFg/WJhx0_nuAsI/AAAAAAAACFI/MswL_drBROM3RRkg1f8m25f1Z39D53GdQCLcB/s1600/sliv.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2f4.bp.blogspot.com%2f-7J7z6AQ9FFg%2fWJhx0_nuAsI%2fAAAAAAAACFI%2fMswL_drBROM3RRkg1f8m25f1Z39D53GdQCLcB%2fs1600%2fsliv.png" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: center"><em>Image 5: Buttons and Size</em></div>
<br />
Another important settings. You can define from Button that, how many columns do your Slicer buttons will use, what will be the height and width. And from the Size settings you can tell the Slicer about the Height and Width of the Slicer.<br />
<br />
I think the above discussion will help new users about Slicer Settings and hope they will use it for making beautiful reports.

<h2>            Images do &#42;not&#42; show up when inserted from file</h2>
                    <p>Before I start, because someone will inevitably ask:</p>
<p>MacOS Sierra 10.12.6</p>
<p>Microsoft Office 2016 15.37 (I think my install is 4 days old tops)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I insert an image from file into a document, I cannot see it. I can see a placeholder, but I cannot move the placeholder into the appropriate spot (it doesn't matter where the cursor is, the placeholder goes to the same spot every time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in Print View, my settings are set to show background colors/images and to show drawings. I've tried the "Macro" fix and it doesn't do anything at all - whether you say True or False at the end. I even tried converting the document to the latest Office
 .docx file type because it was coming up in compatibility mode. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see what I mean here: </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e7f8adb-02ca-4463-a899-e280a8171c92" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e7f8adb-02ca-4463-a899-e280a8171c92" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The "bounding box" or "image placeholder" shows where my name is. It doesn't matter that the cursor was in the white space under "About Me" - it popped up where it wanted. It cannot be moved, nor can I see the image. I can only delete the image from the
 document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noted that the setting to show image placeholders or not does not appear to be under the Preferences &gt; View menu any longer... in fact, it doesn't appear to be under any of the Preferences menu options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, there was a fix posted previously to these forums that said to add and run a particular macro, however, adding/running that macro did not do anything to address the issue. If anyone has a proper fix for this, I would love to know since I am at
 a standstill at editing this file as it requires a picture that I cannot place into it.</p>

<h2>            Office Starter 2010&#58; Word, Excel, or both missing from start menu on various computers</h2>
                    
<p>I have a cluster of 12 Windows 7 Professional computers recently set up, all came with Office 2010 Starter.</p>
<p>I have gone through choosing to "Use Starter", and all PCs have a "Microsoft Office Starter (English)" Start Menu folder. That folder always contains the "Microsoft Office 2010 Tools" subfolder.&nbsp;Then on some PCs it contains Word and Excel, on others only
 one of those, and on others neither.</p>
<p>On all the machines opening files works fine, so the software is installed, it's just the Start Menu shortcuts that are missing.</p>
<p>How can I make the shortcuts appear?</p>

<h2>            Folder&#47;file recovery after delete</h2>
                    
<p>I had accidentally deleted a folder in my Windows Mobile device (the folder was saved in the Storage Card).</p>
<p>The folder contained files with important and sensitive information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way that I can retrieve it? (similar to the Recycle Bin in Windows XP?)</p>

<p>I am assuming the USB card reader you used was old?&nbsp; Current card readers seem to work on all size cards that I have been using (the largest being an 8 GB card).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Any ideas what can be causing this error?" I assume it is a bad tag.&nbsp; There really is not an easy way to tell.&nbsp;&nbsp; I might try a different card reader and use Prof Julie's suggestions ... they are good programs and often bring about success.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 keeps asking for my password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenmayer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 keeps asking for my password</h2>
                    
<p>I have Office 2016 Pro Plus through Office 365 that I got through a community collage where I am going to school and ever time I go into Outlook 2016 desktop app on my one computer it asks me for a password even after I have tried to use the office 365 troubleshooter
 to try and fix</p>
<p>also it has been working fine up until now and earlier this month I got a notification from exchange server saying my password had expired and asking me to create a new password</p>
<p>I do on the other hand have the same version of office pro plus running on a surface 3 and a developer computer and those both work fine</p>
<p>it is just my primary computer that is giving me this error message</p>

<p>and all of these computers are running windows 10</p>
<p>any help would be much appreciated</p>

<p>Hi Stephen J. Mayer,</p>
<p>From your description, your account works fine on both your surface 3 and the developer computers with Windows 10 OS. This indicates that the Office 365 service has no problem.</p>
<p>For “your primary computer asks for a sign-in password request while you use the Outlook 2016”, the issue should be related to the Outlook 2016 client in your primary computer. You can run

<p>are you saying your phones calls are blocked ?</p>
<p>try&nbsp;&nbsp;a reset this is not a common problem to my knowledge or maybe its could have something to do with the operator</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>With all these operations I recommend you <strong>
<em>TAKE OUT MEMORY CARD</em></strong> and <em><strong>DO A BACK UP OF YOUR STUFF!!!
</strong></em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>NOTE: In front of the hash key ( #) there is also a STAR key that people often miss and state that the
<strong>code</strong> does not work. </span></strong>1.<font color="#0000ff"><strong><span>
</span><span>*#7780#</span></strong></font> - <strong>
Restore factory settings</strong> - <strong>resets</strong> all the settings to the default ( you will not lose any data) Make sure you back up your data as you will lose all of it when you perform option 2 or 3 on this list. The default
<strong>code</strong> for ALL operations listed here is 12345.<span>
</span><strong><font color="#0000ff"><span>*#7370# </span>
</font></strong>-<strong> Reformat </strong>your phone (out of the box, tho keep in mind that most newer
<strong>nokia</strong> phones at least n series, e series and s60 based phones have udp - user data preservation so not ALL data may be lost. still it is a good idea to always do a back up of your stuff.)3. This you perform as a last resort. Nothing else is
 working.If the phone is not showing any activity, proceed with hard formatting , turn off your phone, hold the following buttons while pressing the power button. (the default
<strong>code</strong> is <font color="#ff0000"><strong>12345</strong></font>)<strong>hard
<strong>reset</strong></strong> - hold the following buttons</span><span><font color="#339966"><strong><span>
</span><span>* (star key),</span></strong></font></span><span><font color="#339966"><span><strong>
</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>3

</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>talk/green</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong> key</strong></span></font>. turn on the phone and do not release those buttons
 until you see the <strong>Nokia</strong> boot up screen. once you feel the phone power up you can let go off the power button while still holding all three buttons

<p>I am looking at a 6085 for someone at this moment which can receive SMS messages however can not send or receive TEXT messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This very phone was able to do both types w/o any issues previously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Powered the phone/off, pulled the battery, left off, restarted etc..etc..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These doesn't appear to be any software updates available for this phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hoping I don't&nbsp;need to "master reset" this phone to get this to work again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know "something" about this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thnx&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>External business-sharing site in SharePoint Online is different from public website. It is a site where anyone you choose outside of your company can have

<p>Hi RosaLam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go to Windows <strong>Store</strong> and from the menu, you can tap on
<strong>Settings</strong> and toggle <strong>OFF</strong> "<strong>update apps automatically when I'm on WiFi</strong>". Another way to do this is by typing
<strong>"background apps"</strong> from the search box from <strong>Settings </strong>
app, and it will show all apps with its corresponding toggle buttons. Scroll down to Store app and toggle it
<strong>OFF</strong> as well. When a software is updated or upgraded, all apps installed needs an update as well. As previous app version fits the previous OS version you have working on the phone. For all your existing apps which was working prior to this
 update, we would suggest pulling up its official page on the web to see if Windows 10 is part of the system requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
