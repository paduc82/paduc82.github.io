<h2>            scrolling text box, is it possible in Word for MAC 2011&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to insert a scrolling text box into a word template but cannot figure out how. &nbsp;It needs to be within MAC Word 2011 so that I can put in a bunch of text within a table in Microsoft Word and be able to scroll up and down with arrows on the right
 side. &nbsp;

            I don't think you can do it on Mac Word, except in the sense that you can do Insert-&gt;HTML Object-&gt;Text box (say), save as a Web Page, and have the text scroll when you open in a web browser.
<div><br />
<div>If you were doing this on Windows Word, you may have been using the old Active-X controls (which supported scrollbars) or maybe using VSTO to put a Windows form control on the document surface? Neither of those possibilities is available on Mac Word. As
 far as I know, all th other options on either platform behave rather more like dropdowns than scrollable areas.</div>

            Thanks Peter. &nbsp;If I use Microsoft Word for Windows, can it be setup there?
<div><br />
<div>Are there any other programs that you suggest that allow for this feature to be used like google docs or smartsheets? &nbsp;We are trying to create a template with a scrolling box which can be modified often.</div>

            Before taking my word for it, it's worth seeing if anyone else comes up with a bright idea. But...
<div><br />
<div>The ActiveX controls on WIndows Word are regarded as "legacy controls" - although they still function it's probably not such a good idea to use them for anything that needs to be maintained longer term. These days, you probably need to save as a .doc/.docm/.dotm
 (i.e. a macro-enabled document) to use them. As far as I know, Word for Windows is the only environment where these ActiveX controls will actually do anything useful (e.g. scroll or modify the text). Everywhere else they just don't work or just display text
 or a graphic.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The same would in fact be true if you tried to use Windows Word+VSTO+Windows forms controls. You also have to create a .NET project (e.g. in Visual Studio) to do that. They would only work on a Windows platform with Word present. They actually rely on
 the same mechanism as ActiveX to function, but being a .NET-related technology that doesn't purport to be cross-platform, they probably aren't regarded as quite such a "legacy" option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for other software, nothing I know is an obvious choice. If it has to be "a feature of a word processor", I'd probably be looking at just the same options as you. Personally, I don't think the IT industry has ever managed to come up with a truly standard,
 rich (in the sense that it could do stuff that word processing packages do), preferably open, set of forms standards and technologies - we still seem to be in the "hire an individual who knows how to do the right things in HTML5/XML territory".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope that sparks some constructive disagreement!</div>

            Strange. I call non-Active-X controls "legacy" controls because they existed in Word before Active-X controls were introduced. No matter. Active-X is open source and so far hasn't been ported to the Mac, so Active-X doesn't work on Macs.
<div><br />
<div>And since there's no Microsoft Windows, Windows operating system features are not on the Mac.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You might be able to accomplish your objective in a future version of Word. There's a new feature in Word for Windows called Agave that lets you embed web page elements into Word documents. That feature may or may not find its way into the next version
 of Office for Mac. This is not available in Word 2011 for Mac, however.</div>

<h2>            Team Site&#58; Notebook won&#39;t open from Navigation Pane</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a SharePoint Online plan with Yammer (Plan 2) for our network. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've enabled the Site Notebook feature from Site settings, and the Notebook link came up on my left navigation pane. A notebook is also created in Site assets library. But the problem is that clicking on the Notebook link from navigation pane does not open
 notebook on OneNote Online. Instead, the Home page of my SharePoint site is opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, Excel and Work Online work just fine. Also, the notebook opens and works fine when opened from site assets library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried editing the link on the navigation pane and gave the address of the page from when I open the notebook from my site assets. But this does not get saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            <p>Hi Aravinda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With respect, that link was not helpful. I have the exact issue Ananth mentioned, but the community hasn't seemed to address this problem. Unless "Fat Dragon's" response saying, "<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/sharepoint/en-US/f7be5f88-8c98-464e-8596-60956b5e98fd/sharepoint-2013-office-web-apps-problem-unable-to-openviewedit?forum=sharepointgeneral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 I flipped the Default zone to use HTTPS, and removed the Extranet zone.</a>" is the right answer for this too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other direction? Or did you get this figured out Ananth?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 can provide generic drivers for devices such as printers to run. However, most of the specific features of a printer can be activated by installing a specific program/application from the manufacturer of the device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would advise checking the package of the device to see if there are any installer needed to be installed for the features of the printer to be activated. If there is none, we advise contacting the manufacturer to get the specific software/driver to activate
 all the features of your printer. We also need to make sure that those programs/drivers are fully compatible with your current version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Gibbster,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Usually, we create the custom DLP policy in the following steps:<br />
1. Login to EAC (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange admin center</a>) &gt;
<strong>compliance management</strong> &gt; <strong>data loss prevention</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the plus icon (<strong>+</strong>) &gt;
<strong>New custom DLP policy</strong> as the picture shows below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/070f9fb9-796a-4108-8c16-b12f9a307db7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/070f9fb9-796a-4108-8c16-b12f9a307db7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Type and choose the information needed and then click
<strong>Save</strong>.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/587d1762-5709-4680-ae5a-417e065de56a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/587d1762-5709-4680-ae5a-417e065de56a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After that, we can configure rules by editing the DLP policy. Since your UI of creating the custom DLP policy is different from the normal situation, could you please provide your
 detailed steps with screenshots like my example for analysis?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Larry</span></p>

            <p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not testing the DLP for email but rather the ability to restrict data types from being saved within SharePoint and OneDrive locations. In particular I would like to interrogate the value of document properties&nbsp;to ascertain their content type.&nbsp;For example,
 if a document has a 'Protective Marking' custom property that is set to Confidential, we would like to set a site policy to prevent this type of content from being saved within a public facing site...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Based on my experience, this error can be caused by the RBAC version. For this situation, I want to collect the RBAC version via private message.</p>
<p>To get the version, please <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect to PowerShell</a> and run the following command:<br />

<p>Hi Karl, my old account was setup as an imap account?</p>

<p>
</p><p>In a nutshell.............</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you only had the one email account in OL'2007 - then you will also have had 2 data files. One that contains the default folders for contact/calendar items and the other will contain your email items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do nothing else but add the new email account - regardless of type, the location of the default contacts and calendar folders will not change. If you want all your email items to be in a single location, then move the email items from the old folders
 to the equivalent new folders. Once those items are copied - you can close the PST file related to email items from your old email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What data files (PST files) belong to your old account will be found in your account settings under the data files tab. Your IMAP data file will not have any contact or calendar folders in the tree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following article describes what files you're looking for (the article is intended for those wanting to copy files from one Outlook config to another but the information regarding data file identification is equally relevant in this case)</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open a link to a javascript doc</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded to Windows 8 but now I cannot open a link to a java script doc on my employers website. If I click left or right mouse button nothing happens! Several other work colleagues have the same trouble. This was so easy in Windows 7.&nbsp; Its got to
 be an easy fix but they hide it well - like the system tools??</p>
<p>Alternatively, is it possible to easily revert back to Windows 7?</p>
<p>Any help will be gratefully appreciated&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

    <title>Duplicate user - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivettmiramar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate user</h2>
                    Hi, please, I would be very grateful if you could help me in some way to find users, aliases and distribution groups that are duplicates in my Office 365 organization, since I am trying to add several users and I am receiving duplicity errors. I have worked
 in Power Shell, but I can not find a way to create a script to determine duplicity.<br />
How can I do?

            Hello
<br />
<br />A pleasure to help you.!!
<br />
<br />Having the confirmation that you work or know how to work using the PowerShell Module, I can recommend the following commands to identify users / aliases / distribuxion groups, duplicates.
<br />In the following script you should only substitute in the variable $ Duplicateuser = "user who wants to validate their duplicity".
<br />Start-transcript
<br />$ Duplicateuser = "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"
<br />get-contact | where {$ _. WindowsEmailAddress -match "$ Duplicateuser"} | ft identity
<br />get-msoluser -All | where {$ _. ProxyAddresses -match "$ Duplicateuser"} | select UserPrincipalName
<br />Get-MsolGroup | where {$ _. ProxyAddresses -match "$ Duplicateuser"} | ft displayname, emailaddress
<br />get-mailbox -Result unlimited | where {$ _. EmailAddresses -match "$ Duplicateuser"} | fl Name, RecipientType, EmailAddresses
<br />get-DistributionGroup | where {$ _. EmailAddresses -match "$ Duplicateuser"} | fl Name, EmailAddresses
<br />get-user -ResultSize Unlimited | where {$ _. WindowsEmailAddress -match "$ Duplicateuser"} | ft identity
<br />Get-Recipient -ResultSize Unlimited | where {$ _. EmailAddresses -match "$ DuplicateUser"} | Select -Expand EmailAddresses Aliases
<br />Get-msoluser | Where-Object {$ _. AlternateEmailAddresses -eq $ Duplicateuser}
<br />Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited | Where-Object {$ _. WindowsLiveID -eq $ Duplicateuser} | select userprincipalname, identity
<br />Stop-transcript
<br /> 
<br />I hope it is very helpful and can identify the user or user that may be duplicated in your organization.

<h2>            Can&#8217;t drag Word application windows between multiple desktops</h2>
                    <p>I’m using Office 365 Word (15.21.1) on OS X 10.11.4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all other applications, I can drag windows between adjacent desktops by dragging them to the edge of the screen until desktops switch. Alternatively I can drag the window to the very top of the screen until Mission Control is activated. I can then drag
 the application window to the desired desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not seem to be working with my version of Word, however I seem to remember it working in the recent past. Excel and PowerPoint work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>**Update**</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange! It started working properly after I opened PowerPoint and Excel.</p>

                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried to bring PDF which I created using BlueBeam (and Adobe when the BlueBeam version didn't work. The Adobe file didn't work either). I had used the BlueBeam Mark up capabilities to flag some minor changes. When I tried to add c copy to my Notebook
 I got the following message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The file you have selected cannot be inserted as a Printout. There may be a problem with the file, or you may not have the right program installed. You must first install a program that can open and print this file type, and then try again"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I scan the hard copy to PDF and try to bring it into the Notebook it works.&nbsp;The PDF file I create and markup from either BlueBeam or Adobe can't be brought in.
</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea why I can't can't?</p>

            <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm using NoteBook 2010 and I have tried to use the select OneNote as Printer. I get the same message. I did check out the thread you suggested. I'm wondering how do I associate a PDF file with BlueBeam when I created the file using BlueBeam?</p>
<p>It's like Alice in Wonderland. Crazy logic.</p>

<h2>            Can not sign in Skype Application with password sent by function &#34;Forget my Password&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
From Skype for Window, I used function "Forget my Password". I input Microsoft account and follow the steps given by the system. Then I have new password to logon to Microsoft mail (xxx@.outlook.com), then I changed the
 password. But when i key in password for Skype Application, system said that it is incorrect.
</p>
<p>From Microsoft web page, I found that the Skype is linked with Microsoft account, but actually, the contact list is empty&nbsp;and I think it is not the Skype ID that I use.<br />
Is the Skype linked correctly or not?<br />
How can I get correct password for my skype for Window now?</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your help!</p>

    <title>Camera no longer works from lock screen and screen turns off when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snake hollywood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Camera no longer works from lock screen and screen turns off when making calls</h2>
                    <p>OK so in the last 2 weeks 2 problems have appeared on my nokia Lumia 930, which I assume has been caused by an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The camera can no longer be accessed from the lock screen as it could before. Holding the button down used to open the camera, &nbsp;now does nothing at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>when making a call, the screen is immediately turned off, and it takes several presses of the power button to get it back on, and after a few seconds it turns back off again. this is highly annoying when you are trying to use an IVR menu, or use the phone
 while on a call.</p>
<p>Again, it never did this before, this is a recent change. </p>

<h2>            Word document keeps defaulting to the same page on opening</h2>
                    I have a document that was created by someone else.&nbsp; There are lots of styles and formats in the document, but whenever I open the document, or click back into it from another document, it keeps returning to page 58.&nbsp; There don't seem to be any macros
 or bookmarks in this document.&nbsp; What could be causing this and more importantly, how do I get it to STOP IT!

            Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; It turned out there were hidden bookmarks in the file that was causing the problem!&nbsp; Removed them and it worked fine.

                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi I tried calling 3 different land line numbers (3 different countries) and 2 seconds after the call goes trough it drops and I get charged a full call minute in each attempt. Why are my calls disconnected after 2 seconds? I have
 the latest version of skype and have no problems doing skype to skype calls or viceo calls. I few years back I used the skype credit quite often and then I stoped using it for a while, needles to say my old credit disappear (don't know why) and I greatly regret
 charging new credit in my account as it appears the service to call land lines has became unusable and worthless... I want my credit back</p>

                    I have just uninstalled anti virus software "Quick Heal Total Security". Now I am facing a problem to turn on windows defender. Windows defender says it is controlled by some other antivirus program. But I have no antivirus program installed on my computer.
