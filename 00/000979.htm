                    How do I stop loud ping sound when I&nbsp; empty " delete" and "junk" folders in Outlook 2013 without turning off sound&nbsp; for whole computer?<br />
It's probably something simple but i just got Outlook 2013 and windows 8 and I can't seem to find on off button within the Outlook properties.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help<br />

            This feature is a windows feature associated with any exclamation sound on the system. Moderating the system sound is the only option that i am aware off.
<div>I am not aware of any registry values that control this behavior in Outlook.</div>

    <title>Deleting Old Windows Live Mail and Use Outlook Only - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> camilleh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting Old Windows Live Mail and Use Outlook Only</h2>
                    <p>Have old Windows Live/Hotmail &nbsp;Mail and converted to new Outlook/Hotmail email using same user names. &nbsp;How do I delete old Windows email account without deleting new Outlook/Hotmail account? &nbsp; &nbsp;The old "Windows Live" email account is still active and also
 receives duplicate emails from my other email accounts which I have incorporated into Windows Live and Outlook. &nbsp; &nbsp;When I delete emails from Outlook they do delete from Windows Live but would like to just use Outlook ONLY. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone explain or help me out? &nbsp;This is driving me crazy. &nbsp;The other issue is that I am wondering if having both email accounts is slowing my computer down????</p>

<li>Can you please confirm if you're pertaining to the Windows Live Mail installed on your computer? &nbsp;<strong>NO. &nbsp;INSTALLED WINDOWS LIVE MAIL AS PART OF WINDOWS LIVE ESSENTIALS. &nbsp;HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS. &nbsp;THEN OUTLOOK WAS RELEASED AND I AM NOW
 USING OUTLOOK. &nbsp;IN THE WLM (ESSENTIAL) I IMPORTED OTHER EMAIL ADDRESSES THAT I HAD. &nbsp;I'VE ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM WITH GMAIL AND COMCAST WITH THE DUPLICATE AND SOMETIMES TRIPLICATE EMAILS FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS. &nbsp;I JUST LIVED WITH IT BUT IT WAS AND IS RATHER FRUSTRATING
 BECAUSE IN ALL REALITY I WOULD HAVE, LET'S USE THIS FOR AN EXAMPLE - I WOULD HAVE 100 NEW EMAILS IN MY UNREAD FOLDER (INCLUDES ALL EMAIL ACCOUNTS). &nbsp;BUT BECAUSE I WAS RECEIVING DUPLICATE AND TRIPLICATE EMAILS FROM EACH ACCOUNT MENTIONED ABOVE, THE UNREAD EMAIL
 FOLDER WOULD LIST 300 UNREAD EMAILS INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL 100. &nbsp;AND IT STILL DOES. &nbsp;FOR EXAMPLE, RIGHT NOW MY OUTLOOK ACCOUNT LISTS 5390 NEW EMAILS (BETWEEN ALL OF THE EMAIL ACCOUNTS I HAVE IMPORTED WHICH ARE THE SAME AS WINDOWS LIVE MAIL. &nbsp;HOWEVER, WINDOWS
 LIVE MAIL LISTS 17,661 UNREAD EMAILS - ALL DUE TO DUPLICATES AND TRIPLICATES OF THE SAME EMAILS. &nbsp;THAT IS THE FIRST PROBLEM AND THE MAIN REASON I SWITCHED OVER TO OUTLOOK EVEN THOUGH I LOVED WINDOWS LIVE EMAIL.</strong></li><li><span>Do you have another email account configured on Windows Live Mail email application? &nbsp;<strong>NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN. &nbsp;WILL ANSWER BEST I CAN. &nbsp;YES. &nbsp;I HAVE GMAIL, COMCAST AND HOTMAIL ACCOUNTS INCORPORATED

 WINDOWS LIVE MAIL MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE DUPLICATE/TRIPLICATE EMAILS. &nbsp;ALSO, BECAUSE I HAVE THE SAME EMAIL ACCOUNTS INCORPORATED IN WINDOWS LIVE EMAIL AND OUTLOOK, WHEN I DELETE EMAILS FROM OUTLOOK THEY DO GET DELETED FROM WINDOWS LIVE ACCOUNT AS WELL. &nbsp;IT
 JUST BOTHERS ME THAT THERE ARE SO MANY EMAILS IN THE WINDOWS LIVE ACCOUNT - OVER 17,000!!!! &nbsp; THAT IS A LOT OF EMAILS. &nbsp;AND HAS TO BE AFFECTING MY COMPUTER IN SOME WAY - LIKE SLOWING IT DOWN, TAKING UP SPACE, ETC.</strong></li><li><strong>SO I WANT TO TOTALLY GET RID OF THE WINDOWS LIVE EMAIL ACCOUNT AND USE OUTLOOK ONLY. &nbsp;I DO NOT GET DUPLICATES IN OUTLOOK. &nbsp;IN MY OUTLOOK ACCOUNT I AUTOMATICALLY GET HOTMAIL AND ALSO HAVE COMCAST, AND GMAIL INCLUDED AS WELL - THE SAME ACCOUNTS

 who successfully exploited the vulnerability could override Windows Writer proxy settings and overwrite files accessible to the user on the target system. In a web-based attack scenario, a website could contain a specially crafted link that is used to exploit
 this vulnerability. An attacker would have to convince users to visit the website and open the specially crafted link.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Important for Windows Writer when installed on all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection,&nbsp;<strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>,
 in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way Windows Writer handles URL parameters. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for

            <p>Hi Camille,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We greatly appreciate your time and effort for the details that you have provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you have posted, it appears that you are referring to Windows Live Mail and Microsoft Office Outlook which are both mail clients that you use to add and manage all your email accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To set your expectations, if you have configured your accounts as EAS (Exchange ActiveSync) on your Windows Live Mail and Microsoft Office Outlook, all your emails, contacts and calendars will automatically sync and any changes that you will make on those
 mail clients will automatically reflect on the web and vice versa because EAS is a two way connection. So when you delete an email on your Microsoft Office Outlook, it will be deleted on the web too. And since your account is also configured on Windows Live
 Mail (which also pulls up your emails from the web), the emails that were deleted will be deleted from it too. This means that even though you will uninstall your Windows Live Mail, as long as you are seeing the same emails or your emails are still intact
 in the web, they will stay in your Microsoft Office Outlook. Take note that this behavior only applies if your account was configured as EAS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if your account was not configured as EAS and it was connected as POP, only emails from your inbox will be downloaded / automatically sync and it will be deleted from the web unless you have enabled the option to "Leave a copy of messages
 on the server". In this case, we highly recommend that you back up your emails first before you uninstall your Windows Live Mail to make sure that you will not lose any of your emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We still advise that you back up all your emails or files before you remove or uninstall Windows Live Mail from your PC to avoid losing any of them. Also check the connections of your accounts and also check them on the web and make sure that your emails
 are still intact in the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/mail-import-backup-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>article</strong></a> to learn more on how to back up your emails on Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any questions or clarifications, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards.</p>

            <p>Hello Camille and others,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you ever find a solution to this problem? I just discovered it today and am going nearly out of my mind. ALL of my emails are accessible to my husband on his computer, at least the ones until I changed my password several months ago. It's not about hiding
 anything. It's about dignity and privacy. Like you, Camille, I absolutely want to keep the emails on my hotmail (I've had it since 2001) but want to do away with WindowsLive completely. I don't know if this makes a difference, but my hotmail is on a Mac and
 my husband's duplicates of my emails are on a PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, please help. Thank you so much in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>J.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the message I left on the message board today. I made a mistake about 2012. It's 2016:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I received quite a shock today when I went into my husband's computer to retrieve our tax return and found that, when typing in the search box at the Start prompt, all of my hotmail messages were there,
 seemingly stopping in 2012 or so. What is going on there? I have tried to access them so that I can delete them--they don't belong on his computer!--but I can't seem to do so. When I click on one to open it, it opens right up, no password required, using Windows
 Live. I tried to uninstall Windows Live, but that was not an offered option. I believe he is running Windows 7--he didn't want the one with the touch screen, so whatever is before that one. I'm pretty much freaking out. Any help would be wildly appreciated.
 Thanks so much.</span></p>

<h2>            How to store macro in Personal Macro Workbook in Excel 2013&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Excel 2013. When I create a macro, in the pull-down menu of Macros in, I can only see the following options:</p>
<p>All open workbooks</p>
<p>This workbook</p>
<p>Book1</p>
<p>There is no option called 'Personal Macro Workbook'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon closing Excel, it asked me if I want to save Book1. No question about whether I want to save the workbook as PERSONAL.xlsb. So I'm kind of stuck.&nbsp;</p>

            Yes, that is the way! I figured it out myself right after I posted my question😠. Before that, I repeatedly inserting module to create my macro even though all the tutorial videos did say 'record macro'. Didn't except any difference, especially because
 I did it successfully on MAC. Seems to me a bug. Thanks for posting the procedures. Good for other readers and for me in future in case I forget again.

<br />
Is it correct to say...<br />
&nbsp;x = 1<br />
&nbsp;xy = 1<br />
<br />
Are upper and lower case characters treated the same?</p>
<p>Will there be any other text / numbers / other characters in the cells?<br />

<p>
</p><p>2 Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1: If you want to do a case-sensitive count which will count only an UPPER "X" or "Y", then use below formula:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMPRODUCT(LEN(A2:A10)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A2:A10,{"X","Y"},"")))*0.5</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Option 2: If you dont want a case-sensitive count, so that it counts both Lower &amp; Upper "X" &amp; "Y":</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMPRODUCT(LEN(A2:A10)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(UPPER(A2:A10),{"X","Y"},"")))*0.5</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note:</p>
<p>The formula is valid for and counts multiple occurrences of "X" &amp; "Y" in a cell and covers the range A2:A10. If you want to count in a single cell only then change A2:A10 to just A2: =SUMPRODUCT(LEN(A2)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A2,{"X","Y"},"")))*0.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each cell can have other letters also besides "X" or "Y".</p>

            Unfortunately this is a limitation of OneNote on MacOS (rather a limitation of MacOS itself). The reason is, that the attached excel file is a copy of the original one, stored in OneNotes "own" file space. Now MacOS (like iOS or Windows UWP apps) does not allow to write data into the storage space of another app. But this is exactly what Excel would have to to after you edited the file: save it back into OneNotes storage space. I talked to the OneNote team about it; they are aware of the limitation and are thinking hard about a way to override that. 
<br />So your only option for now is:
<br />Open the excel file from the notebook in excel, make your edits, save it under a different name to a folder where you have access rights, delete the embedded file in OneNote and replace it (re-attach) with the edited version you just saved.

                    <p>(Replace&nbsp;Ø with @ in this mail)<br />
<br />
I want to change ("Update email") my old account (Removed PII) to (Removed PII), but I get the message "(Removed PII)isn't available.</p>
<p>I want to keep my old hotmail account, but with the new login, because this is where I have all my data and my 25 GB quota.</p>
<p>During some testing I added the domain nicesurprise.com via domains.live.com, and created the account (Removed PII).<br />
After my tests&nbsp;I deleted the domain from domains.live.com.<br />
After that I&nbsp;closed&nbsp;the (Removed PII)account (which was completely empty).</p>
<p>How long must I wait before I can "update email" on my old hotmail account to (Removed PII)?<br />
Or do I need to do something else to reuse the ID?<br />
<br />
(I own the domain nicesurprise.com and have access to the mail account (Removed PII)?<br />
on another mail system.&nbsp;Later I plan to move the mail domain to outlook.com using domains.live.com.)</p>

            <p>Hi Luise,</p>
<p>The account I want to rename to I accessed and deleted a few days ago. Later I read in this forum in several other threads that there needs to pass 270 or 360 days before the account can be reused (too bad, I guess some Microsoft people are working hard
 to find a smoother way to handle such caces, which many seems to be struggeling with.)</p>
<p>So, in the meantime I decided to choose a brand new e-mail address to rename to, one that has never been in use anywhere. However, that also dosen't work - although I get a confirmation e-mail of the rename, the account is never really renamed. I have described
 this problem in another thread here:</p>

<p>What we need for you to do is&nbsp;to rename your account once more,&nbsp;since you've&nbsp;said that&nbsp;upon renaming your account&nbsp;you&nbsp;received&nbsp;a confirmation e-mail.</p>
<p><br />
Please try and rename your account then in order for it to be a successful rename you just have to click on the link in the confirmation e-mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>(It's&nbsp;still Silke K.F. here - I had to sign in to this forum with&nbsp;a friends&nbsp;account, as neither the original name nor the renamed name can sign in after the procedure below.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, I tried to make the renaming once more. Renaming now returns this message at the web page:</p>
<p>"There's a temporary problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later."</p>
<p>A few seconds later I recieve four sms'es (text messages) and four e-mail at <strong>
[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong> : (a secondary address at the hotmail account):</p>
<p><br />
• Two sms'es saying (in Danish, something like:) <em>"</em><strong>[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong>
<em>was added to </em><strong>[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong> <em>. Visit account.live.com/confirm and give the code xxxxxxx"</em> (the codes are different in the two messages)<br />
• Two sms'ses saying (in Danish, something like:) <em>"The account </em><strong>[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong>&nbsp;<em> was renamed to
</em><strong>[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong> <em>. If this is wrong, you may go to account.live.com"</em><br />
• Two e-mails saying in english: Your Microsoft account has been renamed. <em>We just wanted to check with you that it's okay.<br />
&nbsp;- Old account name: </em><strong>[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;- New account name:
</em><strong>[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong> <em>If this is correct, you don't need to do anything.</em><br />
• Two emails saying in english: <em>It looks like you added some security info to your Microsoft account (</em><strong>[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong>
<em>): <br />
Alternate email address: </em><strong>[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong>
<em>You can use this info to reset your password if you forget it. <br />
Confirm</em><strong>[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong>&nbsp;<em> (This is a blue confirm button in the e-mail)<br />
&nbsp;If you didn't make this request, click here to cancel.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(As far as I remember,&nbsp;all the above&nbsp;was exactly the same which happend the very first time I tried to rename the account.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I click the blue confirm button in one of the two emails, and the live web page writes:<br />
"Sign in with <strong>[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong>&nbsp; to manage your password reset information."</p>
<p>Then I clik Sign In and signs in with the new address, <strong>[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong> , and my usual password.</p>
<p>But the Live sign in page writes:<br />
"That Microsoft account doesn't exist. Enter a different email address or get a new account."</p>
<p>As a last test I sign in with the old address,<strong>[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong> , but I get the message:</p>
<p>"Sign in with <strong>[Removed by moderator for privacy]</strong> to manage your password reset information."</p>
<p>So I am stuck again, and now can't sign in with either of the two addresses.<br />

<h2>            Is there an alternative for &#39;ActivePresentation&#39; in PowerPoint 2007&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a 'OnSlideShowPageChange' macro and when I have the presentation containing it open but press F5 in another PowerPoint it still runs the code.</p>
<p>This is annoying as it looks for a particular shape on slide 1 and, if it can't find it, it will close PowerPoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way of it only running for the presentation the code is actually in?
</p>
<p>ThisPresentation or NamedSlideShow sounds promising</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to be able to simply replace 'ActivePresentation' with something else with the 'Replace' option</p>

<div><br />
<div>Yes, because it's an *application-wide* event.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In your event handler for the PageChange event, you'll want to add some code to have it do nothing unless it's a show that you want to work with.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That could be any number of things. You could test for the presentation name, or some other property. &nbsp;In most cases, I'd use tags applied to the presentation. &nbsp;So your event handler might do:</div>
<div><br />
<div>If ActivePresentation.Tags("MyTag") = "Yes, this is really my presentation" Then</div>
<div>&nbsp; Do your stuff</div>

<h2>            Help sorting in Excel following a hyphen.</h2>
                    I have many lists that use a set of numbers, often alphanumeric, that are then followed by a (-) dash/hyphen and more numbers.&nbsp; I am looking for a way to sort these with the last set of numbers included, so to speak.&nbsp; For instance:<br />
<br />
Currently in Excel<br />
<br />
567A4567-1<br />
567A4567-10<br />
567A4567-11<br />
567A4567-2<br />
567A4567-21<br />
567A4567-3<br />
<br />
What I want is<br />
<br />
567A4567-1<br />
567A4567-2<br />
567A4567-3<br />
567A4567-10<br />
567A4567-11<br />
567A4567-21<br />

I have read quite a few questions and answers already but either I didn't understand how the methods applied to my situation or this situation wasn't covered.<br />

<p>Hi Wayne,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, there is a duplicate group appears in your group list in OneDrive, and you cannot enter the group site. We'd like to confirm some information to clarify your situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you done any operation before the duplicate group appear?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Please try letting your admin delete you from the original group of the duplicate group and then add you back to the group to see whether the duplicate group still persists in your OneDrive group
 list. And please make sure that the original group disappear from the list then add you back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Does the duplicate group appear when you use different browsers? You can try cleaning the browser's cache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Would you please provide a screenshot of the group list? Note that please mask your private message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>

</p><p>Hi Wayne,<br />
<br />
The 2 duplicated site names are the "Title" of the sites actually (Site settings &gt; Title, Description, and Logo &gt; Title). Here, I'd like to explain that two different sites can share the same title.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>May I request the full URLs of the two "</strong><span><strong>duplicated"</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;sites?&nbsp;</strong><br />
(You can click "<em>More sites</em>" link as your screenshot shows, hover over the site names, the site URL will appear in the bottom of the page. ) To protect your privacy, I have sent you a&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox?tm=1512554064282">private

            Hi Wayne,<br />
<br />
From the private message, we know that under "Following" there're 3 Contract Administration groups but with different site URLs:<br />
<br />
***.sharepoint.com/sites/C******Administration2 &nbsp;- &nbsp;Produces 404 FILE NOT FOUND<br />
***.sharepoint.com/sites/C******Administration11 - Produces 404 FILE NOT FOUND<br />
***.sharepoint.com/sites/c******administration35<br />
<br />
The 404 FILE NOT FOUND error means the group is deleted. Please following these steps and check if the first 2 sites are still listed:<br />
<br />
a. Download and install the SharePoint Online Management Shell from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this article</a>.<br />
<br />
b. Launch SharePoint Online Management Shell (search and right click the "SharePoint Online Management Shell" and choose "Run as Administrator"), connect to SharePoint Online via the following commands using your Office 365 global admin account:<br />
<br />
<strong>Connect-SPOService</strong>&nbsp;<strong>-Url https://</strong><em>contoso</em><strong>-admin</strong><strong>.sharepoint.com</strong><br />
(replace contoso with your tenant domain)<br />
<br />
c. Check whether the 2 sites are still listed in deleted sites:<br />
<br />
Run&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Get-SPODeletedSite</strong><br />
<br />
d. Remove the 2 sites from deleted sites:<br />
<br />
Run&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Remove-SPODeletedSite -Identity https://</strong><em>contoso</em><strong>.sharepoint.com/sites/****2</strong><br />
<strong>Remove-SPODeletedSite -Identity https://</strong><em>contoso</em><strong>.sharepoint.com/sites/****11</strong><br />
<br />
e. Wait for 24 hours to see the result.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
James

<h2>            Understanding customUI vs. officeUI files in Office 2010</h2>
                    
<p>In Office 2007, customization created .QAT files. Now that the Ribbon is also customizable, the files are customUI and officeUI. Unable to find an answer on the differences between, for instance Word14.customUI and Word.officeUI. PowerPoint has 2 files like
 these but Excel doesn't. Any clarification would help especially for backing up user preferences, etc.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>After som search, it appears that the .officeUI files are text files in XML format for storing Quick Access Bar configuration - like the "old" .qat files, and the modifications in the UI (new groups only).</p>
<p>.customUI files are files in the OOXML format (zip files) to add in PPT and Word a button
<strong>Linked Notes</strong>, in the <strong>OneNote</strong> section of the <strong>
Review</strong> tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strangely, this customUI files cannot be open with the <strong>Custom UI Editor For Microsoft Office</strong> tool, or I missed one (or many) episode(s)...</p>
<p>Hope this can serve...</p>

<h3> kenneth myhre  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE9 Beta&#58; http&#58;&#47;&#47;microsoft.com&#47;genuine do not work in IE9.</h2>
                    
<p>I have tried this on three different computers now, and it's still don't work. If you try to validate Windows from<a href="http://microsoft.com/genuine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://microsoft.com/genuine</a> in IE9, it's only stops at: Windows Validation in process.
 I let one computer stay with that page running for 24 hours, still nothing happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://myhken.info/div/ie9_beta_002f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here is a picture of where it fails.....</a></p>
<p>I have tried the following setup, all with the same results:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Enterprise 64bit with IE9 64bit</p>
<p>Windows 7 Enterprise 64bit with IE9 32bit</p>
<p>Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit with IE9 32bit.</p>
<p>I have tried Norwegian IE9 on Norwegian Win7, and I have tried English IE9 on English Win7. Still the same problem.</p>
<p>How can I get IE9 to validate my Windows version? And why do Microsoft release a beta without the possible to check if Windows is genuine?</p>

<p><strong>Problem:&nbsp; How the genuine site handles the browser in validation page.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Result: Windows Genuine site is not designed for IE9.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Symptoms: Page hangs forever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fix: If you are at Genuine Advantage site go to top of tools and select the compatabily mode and refresh.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another way is at right hand side pick the drop down Tools menu and select compatabily mode settings then refresh page.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A bit like magic the validation will now work. I am assuming a valid copy of windows 7 or any other windows.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Resolution: The web master for the Geniune site needs to redesign how the scripts are done.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal&nbsp; experience:</strong></p>
<p><strong>I spent two days working out why my validation would not work after installing IE9 Beta. I verified my WGA using MGADiag all was ok.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I then verified WGA worked at MS Download Center for Windows 7 patch download.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I then loaded up Fiddler2 and Wireshark and tracked what was happening with request traffic at Genuine Site. The site page generates http failed requests and just hangs. I changed security settings for IE9 beta and no changes made any difference.
 It was not until I set compatabilty mode everything worked.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I hope this helps worries about being validated in IE9 beta.</strong></p>

            <p>I want to insert hyperlinks, but not the traditional kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Word and Excel, you can reference other documents in the same directory without having to enter the full path.&nbsp; You can even reference other documents in subdirectories without having to enter the full path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the same functionality available in OneNote?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I want to do this is because the path to my OneDrive folder is not the same on my Work Computer as it is on my Home Computer, and I want to link to documents that may have a slightly different path up to the OneDrive folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, on my Work Computer, the path to a document might be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\MG\OneDrive\Documents\Work\Filename.docx</p>
<p>
</p><p>whereas on my home computer, the path might be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>E:\OneDrive\Documents\Work\Filename.docx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this makes sense.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update keeps trying to install build 10049 - but its already installed</h2>
                    <p>I installed build 10049 (clean install of latest build ISO, then Windows Updates to build 10049), and since then build 10049 still appears under available updates. When it tries to install, normally it would just disappear like it installed with no error
 (since it was already installed), but now it is giving this error:</p>

</p><p>According to my computer and the Windows Insider app, I am already on build 10049</p>

            It goes away eventually. Small comfort, but when it happened to me it lasted for a 3-4 days. If you don't run windows update manually, you won't see it. Win Update runs on its own every time you reboot. &nbsp;Make sure you reboot at least once a day.&nbsp;

    <title>Outlook 2013 _ Inbox Sub folder dissapeared - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suzidavis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 _ Inbox Sub folder dissapeared</h2>
                    I had an Inbox sub-folder, created 2 or 3 weeks ago, which contained 10-15 emails in it. While creating another Inbox sub-folder, the first one disappeared along with the emails which it contained. I have searched for the emails in "All Outlook Items"
 and none are found. They are not in the Deleted items either. Also, it is odd that on the Home Tab, the folder is an option to be a quick step destination for 'read emails.'
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I find the emails that were in the folder?&nbsp;</div>

            I am having this same issue. I have my office 365 outlook acct set up on imap. &nbsp;When I view email online and not in outlook I can see the subfolders and items inside. The other weird part is subfolders I've moved to archive are still in my online email
 but just greyed out do they never disappear? &nbsp;This is so irritating. The only time I can find an email is when I do an entire mailbox search. &nbsp;Also my folders stopped syncing. &nbsp;I have this same outlook acct set up on two computers and all of the sudden all
 the new subfolders i've created aren't populating to my laptop but they are online.

<h2>            unable to activate Microsoft Office Home &#38; Student 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased this back in November and have not been able to get this to activate, I have had to go through the process every time I want to use it of trying to activate and then resulting in Skip for now. Now the message has changed to a pop up telling me
 I don't have an activation code or that i'm using it on multiple computers!</p>
<p>When I press the try again it says No License found!</p>
<p>I have followed the steps for uninstalling and removing all background files and reinstalled to find the same issue.</p>
<p>Very unimpressed with this and how there is no way to directly talk to your support via IM etc</p>

<p>Hi Verity,</p>
<p>You can firstly try removing the three folders below to check if you can reactivate Office 2016 for Mac (the path is &lt;YourUserName&gt;Library &gt; Group Containers ). These three folders are related to the activation.<br />
UBF8T346G9.ms<br />
UBF8T346G9.Office<br />
UBF8T346G9.OfficeOsfWebHost<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: You may back up these three folders, and then remove them. They contain some files related to Outlook.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, as our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business Online services, we suggest you get further support<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this page</a> (<strong>Contact Answer Desk</strong>). It's a specific channel that handles
 Office Home &amp; Student 2016 for Mac related issues and questions.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Printer always last printer used</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi,<br />
<br />
End user is running windows 10 pro 1511 and office 2013 (via office 365)<br />
<br />
I have disabled in windows 10 "Let Windows manage my default printer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user prints to 2 printers &nbsp;printer 1 is set to the default the other printer 2 he selects when he wants to print to it</p>
<p>
</p><p>When he prints to printer 2 (which is not the default printer) and he wants to print again it will display printer 2 instead of the default printer printer 1 (printer 1 still remains the default printer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially the user would like the default printer printer 1 to be the printer that shows up when he prints even if the last printer used was printer 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Stuart</p>

<h3> melinda nam  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do i reinstall microsoft office 2010&#63;</h2>
                    I installed microsoft office 2010 in my computer previously using the product key card. However, my computer was sent for repair and the system was rebooted. Hence microsoft office 2010 was removed. I still kept the product key card i purchased from a
 retail store. But when i follow the steps to install it to my computer again using the previous product key, the following message appeared&nbsp;
<span>
<span>
&nbsp;The Office 2010 Product Key provided is already associated with another user on this site. Please log in with the user information originally used with this Office 2010 Product Key.&nbsp;</span> I am certain that I used the same product key previously and logged
 in with the same account when installing for the same computer. What do I do?

<p>Or were you trying to convert the preinstalled trial with your Key?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS Not to make to much a point, but re-boot is what you do when you simply restart your PC.</p>
<p>Restoring to factory state is what was done.</p>
<p>Like wise you download from the internet, and install from a cd or installation file.</p>

            <p>Do you mean when the PC was returned it had a trial version of Office installed? If so you need to uninstall the trial before attempting to reinstall the 2010 version.</p>
<p>Haveing reinstalled Office 2010 use phone activation, do not enter/say anything untill you get the option to speak to a real person.</p>
<p>BTW You are aware the keycard version license lives &amp; dies with the first PC its installed on, its not transferable to a new PC, niether can you install it on a second PC, which you can with a full retail version.</p>

<p>You need to login iwth the original email account that was used when you first&nbsp;downloaded the PKC Office installer. Without that, you will be unable to re-download and re-install.</p>
<p>There is a "Contact Us" link at the bottom of the page if you need to call or email Microsoft for assisitance. But you will still need to know what email address was used. On that note, you should still have a confirmation email with instructions to download
 as well.</p>

            When you sent the computer in for repairs, was it sent back to the manufacturer?&nbsp; If you don't know, you should go back to the store and ask.&nbsp; I suspect what has happened is that instead of changing or fixing parts in 'your' computer, it was sent to the
 manufacturer who simply gave you another one of the same model.&nbsp; Often it turns out to be cheaper and faster for them to do that.<br />
<br />
IF you did get a different computer, you are out of luck.&nbsp; Product Key Cards are only good on the first computer they were installed on. You will have paid to learn the disadvantage of the PKC. You have to buy a new license. YUP!&nbsp; It sucks!&nbsp; Hopefully this
 time you will "splurge" and buy the "retail' or "FPP" license, either as the boxed CD (the BEST deal) or as an online download of the "2-computer" (or "3-computer") license rather than the "1-computer" one.<br />
<br />
You can fight with the store and the builder to replace the product key, but unless you are really loud and obnoxious, they won't.<br />

<h2>            Automatically created 2nd skype account on same email</h2>
                    <p>I have had a skype account for a long time on my main outlook email. With the chat function having been created on outlook.com, a new account seems to have been created there. I know it isn't the same account because the username there is my full name rather
 then the username I had created for my normal skype account, and it does not have any of the history of chats which is still there when I connect normally to Skype with the account I actually created.</p>
<p>I want to get this automatically created account closed, but I don't know how to do that without risking closing my main account considering it has the same email address.

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/d4b687f3-e7b7-418a-85b0-6ad3d27552b4" title="Redonnat">
<p>
</p><p>Since Skype migrated to Microsoft, the option to sign up and in to Skype using a Microsoft credential is now possible. Also, you will no longer have an option to create your Skype name because the new simplified account sign-up method only requires an Email/Password
 or Phone Number/Password as minimum requirements for sign-up. This new method aims to reduce the sign-up effort by presenting a faster and more flexible experience for new users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that being said, if you signed up in Skype using your MS credential, it will generate a new account with pre-defined username. Since this account follows your MS account, deleting the generated Skype account will also close the associated MS account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, you can link your existing Skype account to a different MS account or avoid signing in using your email address as much as possible. In a few years of inactivity, the generated account will be closed automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, it's not possible to consolidate the generated Skype account and your existing Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further questions and clarifications.</p>

<h2>            OneNote 2013 Desktop not showing all sections</h2>
                    I have a notebook that I am using for college. It has a general section (when you first open it) and then has two section groups (Semester One &amp; Semester Two) .When I opened it today all my notes on the top where there but when I went into the section
 groups it says they were empty.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now one of the section groups has gone and the other one is still empty.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Its weird because online and the onenote metro app everything is there. I have tried closing and reopening the notebook both from my computer and use the open in onenote button on the web app.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any Ideas?</div>

            Reopening the notebook from the web app should have fixed it. Seems to do something with the notebook. Can you create a new notebook, then sync to web app. If it works, copy the sections from the corrupted notebook to the new notebook.
