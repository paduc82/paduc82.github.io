    <title>Access 2013 setproperty macro accent 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajblasio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2013 setproperty macro accent 1</h2>
                    I have a macro that sets a button on a form to have a specific color. The macro uses the SetProperty action to do this with the RGB() function based on a setting in a table. What I would like to do is use the Theme "Accent 1" instead of hard coding the
 color. This would allow the highlight color to match whatever them was selected for this database.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this possible to do with the SetProperty macro and if so what should the expression be? I would like to keep this as a macro and not move it to VBA at this time.</div>
                </div>

            <p>I don't think it is possible to use Access 2013 macros, or VBA, to automate the changing of a theme.&nbsp; As I understand it, you would need do one of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[1]&nbsp; Change the Access 2013 theme manually, using the component properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[2]&nbsp; Change the Access 2013 theme manually, using the ribbon buttons.</p>

            <p>After you set the color, hit Ctrl+G to go to the Immediate window, and enter something like:</p>
<p>?Forms!myForm!myButton.BackColor</p>
<p>It will return a value like this:</p>
<p>-2147483607 </p>
<p>That seems like an odd value until you look at the hex value:</p>
<p>?Hex$(Forms!myForm!myButton.BackColor)</p>
<p>80000029</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In other words: these theme colors are special values outside of the normal RGB range. You can set them just like any other RGB value:</p>
<p>Const MY_THEME as Long = &amp;H80000029</p>
<p>Forms!myForm!myButton.BackColor = MY_THEME</p>

            What I am hoping to do is have the macro set the color of a control to "Accent 1". I use different themes in different databases. Accent 1 may be set to any color depending on which theme was applied. Is there a way to set the backcolor to "Accent 1" in
 a macro?

            <p>It think what Tom was saying is that after you manually set the color to Accent 1, use the immediate window to find out what special color code was used.&nbsp; Then you can use that color code in VBA or a macro to set the BackColor property.&nbsp; The color codes
 will use the color associated with that code in whatever the current theme happens to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure you have a point where you can reset the BackColor to whatever it was before you changed it.</p>

<p>It is interesting that you can still see the C: partition. At least that means that if you upgrade to a newer build than 17046, you will regain access to your data. Also, if you were to install the public build 16299.15, you would also regain access to the
 other partitions, although C: would be replaced with the older OS version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might consider abandoning the use of a Dynamic disk. There are some utilities available online that claim to be able to convert to a Basic disk without data loss. Windows does not have this ability though, as it requires the partitions to be removed
 prior to converting a Dynamic disk to a Basic disk. I would still wait for a newer build to be released first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your disk is an MBR-initialized disk, you can use an Extended partition to enable more than 4 logical partitions. On a GPT disk, there is no practical limit to the number of partitions. So if you can run in UEFI BIOS mode, you would have to use a GPT
 disk, also removing the limit of 4 primary partitions that a MBR disk has.</p>

            In my humble opinion, as Don said, the easy path would be to wait for the next build coming this Wednesday or Thursday or maybe next week, same days.&nbsp; If you need access to that data right away, I'd do as Don suggested and install 16299.15 over the current
 17046 build, then make the adjustments in Settings, Update Settings, Advanced Options to pause updates afterwards.&nbsp; Hang there for the next build, watch for the release announcement and read the announcement carefully first to see if the fix is included in
 the next build before restoring your settings to normal.&nbsp; If you have to wait longer there are other settings you'll need to change to avoid going back to 17046 while you wait.&nbsp; I'd also watch this Forum daily for further advice, and browse it carefully for
 related posts and solutions.&nbsp; Just my humble opinion.&nbsp; Your needs may dictate differently.&nbsp; I do hope you had all that data backed up?&nbsp;

<p>You are the only one that can answer that question. We have no idea what kind of data you placed in all those partitions. My question would be why are you using dynamic disk if you only have one in your system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you made a backup image of your C: that you could revert to. Have you backed up any or all of your data or are they buried in your partitions that you cannot access?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned previously by Don, you could wait for the next build that may or may not have this issue corrected, or you could revert to release build, but this issue was also on 17040 as well as 17046, so if you want to remain in Insider you would have to
 revert to 17025 or 17035.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically, if you cannot afford to lose any of the data on your other partitions, best to go to release, backup all your important data and follow Don's advice and change your disk back to Basic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or just wait till next Insider build and hope that MS has this resolved for you. Either way, you are going to have to sit down and decide how you ultimately want to setup your system. Heck, if you can afford it, might be a good time to purchase a SSD and
 install release so you can do whatever to the other hard drive. You have many options, just wish I could help you on this but it is your call.</p>

<p>If you clean your hard disk with diskpart, you will lose everything in all partitions, unless you have another copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be able to install 16299.15 on your C: partition, since you still have access to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possble, but tediously slow, to boot Windows installed on a USB stick. So if you did that, as a temporary measure, you could regain access to the Dynamic disk partitions. This would make the USB stick appear as C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems likely that you will have a new Insider build this week. This might get things back to normal without doing anything except upgrading to that new Insider build.</p>

    <title>Word 2007 pauses when typing. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 2007 pauses when typing.</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows xp and word 2007. Word every 10 to 15 seconds pauses and hour glasses. Nothing is lost in typing but it is frustrating. I noticed that everytime it hour glasses that winword.exe appears in the task manager screen. Something in Word itslef
 must be delaying the typing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried stopping various programs in startup and updating the graphics drivers but to no avail. Word itslef must be polling or checking something for it to appear in the task list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help please?</p>

            <p>No it's for all documents even new ones just created (Blank).</p>
<p>I've updated the graphics driver, pointed the default printer to a different printer in case that was causing the issue. Examined all of the add-ins stopped anti-virus. Logged on as a different user.</p>
<p>I have as yet tried re-installing word to see if this fixes it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note this doesn't occur in excel just word. The user doesn't use outlook, but I'm guessing it would alos be affected as it uses word as the editor.</p>
<p>I've got loads of other installations using this combination, but only this one machine has this problem.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            More information on failure</h2>
                    Hello, I was able to get Ovi suite working on an Xp machine. I found out that the information provided regarding error is too much generic E.G.: i entered a wrong date in my phone after an update and then I tried to update my apps using OVI. It said that
 nothing was installed due to an "internal error" but it did not saoid anything about the error. Trying to launch a Sis install on my phone i discovered that installer claimed that I had a expired certificate on my phone (that was due to the wrong date inserted).
 i think that is a good next version of Ovi suite to be more specific regarding errors and failures in the future and providing detailed error information. It will be easier for users and techs to investigate on the error. Thanks in advance, Mattias

</p><p>I have an msn.com email address and set up an outlook.com address a while ago also in my name.
</p>
<p>I'd now like to use this outlook address for stuff relating to me and my partner and so would like emails to come from my name and her name when they in someone else's inbox.</p>
<p>I've changed the profile name and account info names to my name / her name, but when I send emails it still comes up in the the recipients email inbox as coming from just me - Steve Smith.
</p>
<p>How can I get it so it appears as from my first name / her first name.</p>

<p>When you send an email to someone that you have never sent an email, the display name is the name sent with the email.</p>
<p>After the recipient saves your email and display name in their address book, the display name will come from the address book when they receive more emails from you.</p>
<p>For the new display name to display, you would have to send using a new address.</p>
<p>However, an email sent with a&nbsp;new address will probably end up in their Junk folder.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft&#39;s authenticator app won&#39;t install on my WP7.8 device</h2>
                    <p>I've turned on two-step authentication on my Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then thought that I'd install the Authenticator App on my Nokia Lumia 800, which is running WP7.8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded it from the Store, and it appears in the list of Apps on my phone, but the icon is darkened, and it says "attention required" beside it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try and run the App, it comes up, with a message "Attention required. Press here." So I do.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then get an error message saying:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There is a problem with your Live ID. Try again or sign in with a different Windows Live ID." There are two buttons: retry and close. Pressing Retry or Close&nbsp;takes me back to the opening screen of the app, with "Pending" and then the "Attention required.
 Press here." message returns. Pressing Close just takes me back to the opening screen with the "Attention required. Press here" message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only have one Windows Live ID on this phone, and it's the one I used to turn on two-step authentication with. What's going on?</p>

            <p>Hello Geoffc1,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in the community forum,</p>
<p>This Problem is because the windows phone store does not accept security codes so you will have to generate an app password for it. go to account.live.com and tab to security info. Go to app passwords and click generate an app password. You will get a meaningless
 string of alphabets as your app password. Once you have got that enter it as password&nbsp;into your windows live account on your windows phone by going to email+ accounts. You should then be able to use the store as normal.
</p>
<p>cheers!</p>

<h2>            How to unlink 2 email aliases without losing either&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I don't quite remember how, but i have an outlook.com and hotmail.com alias which are linked together. I want to have them as 2 disjoint accounts (i use one for work and 1 for private communication). How can i unlink them without losing either email address?
 Any option to do that in settings warns me that i will lose that email address?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case that is not possible, i want my outlook.com one to be primary (i have set it to primary in my settings page). However, the inbox view still shows all the hotmail folders before the outlook one. Even a "Create new email" sends it from my hotmail by
 default (shouldn't my primary alias be the default option)?</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Srishti, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use your alias&nbsp;as a separate email account, you have to delete it first and wait for 30days until it is available again for registration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folders created are not specific to an email address and they are arranged in alphabetic order.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary alias should be the default send from option, if this pattern is not being followed, please refer to the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click the <strong>Options icon <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%2f2012-win8ga%2f978d981c-a380-4f87-aa7b-f85c072a788a_34.jpg" /></strong>, and then click
<span><strong>Options</strong></span><strong>.</strong></span> </li><li>Under <span><strong>Managing your account</strong></span>, click
<span><strong>Your email accounts</strong></span>.</li><li>Under <span><strong>Default "From" address</strong></span>, select a<strong> default account.</strong></li></ol>

                    <div>Hello,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am trying to import a text file that is 10 millions of rows into excel.&nbsp;</div>
<div>When I import the file, it loads the first 1,048,576 rows. I have tried to import the rest of the file via the From Text Wizard under Data into both a new worksheet and the same worksheet, but the same entries are displayed that were in the original 1,048,576
 rows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Basically I am wanting to get the next 1,048,576 rows of information. How can I do this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

<p>Hi Trent,</p>
<p>I’d like to confirm something clearly about the current situation. How did you migrate the user mailboxes? Is this an Exchange hybrid deployment?</p>
<p>Please be aware that cross-premises mailbox permission is only supported in an Exchange hybrid deployment, and only the Full Access permission works. If this is indeed a hybrid deployment, and the granted permission is indeed Full Access, I then would like
 to know the following details:<br />
1. Does the issue occur to calendar only? Can the on-premises users access the migrated user’s inbox?<br />
2. Does the issue occur to every migrated user?<br />
3. Besides the credential prompt, are there any other error messages?</p>
<p>Looking forward to your updates.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>It is a hybrid deployment.</p>
<p>It is only an issue for on-prem staff that access the calendar free/busy information of Online users. They do not have Full Access they just want to see free/busy information.
</p>
<p>It impacts all on-prem users that try to view a calendar of an Online user.</p>
<p>No error messages, just keeps prompting for credentials.</p>

<p>Hi Trent,</p>
<p>Sorry for my previous misunderstanding. Now I see that this is a Free/Busy information sharing issue in a hybrid deployment.</p>
<p>Is it a one-way issue then? Can the online user view the on-premises users’ Free/Busy information? Moreover, have the affected users tried both Outlook client and Outlook Web App (OWA)?</p>
<p>If the issue occurs to both Outlook client and OWA, please use the <a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Remote Connectivity Analyzer</a> to do a test. Select <strong>Office 365</strong> -&gt;
<strong>Free/Busy Test</strong> -&gt; <strong>Free/Busy</strong>. Specify the email addresses of the source mailbox and target mailbox, and then run the test. If the test result is failed, please provide it for further investigation.</p>
<p>I have sent you a private message to collect the test result. Please see it at
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>Hi Trent,<br />
<br />
Thanks for providing it.<br />
<br />
From the test result, we can see that the entire Free/Busy test is failed. However, regarding the Autodiscover part, although some errors can be seen,
<strong>“Autodiscover was tested successfully”</strong> is listed at the upper part of the test. In order to make sure of it, you can use the
<strong>Remote Connectivity Analyzer</strong> again to run an Autodiscover test. Select
<strong>Exchange Server</strong> or <strong>Office 365</strong> (which depends on where the tested mailbox is hosted) -&gt;
<strong>Microsoft Office Outlook Connectivity Tests</strong> -&gt; <strong>Outlook Connectivity</strong>.<br />
<br />
If the Outlook Connectivity test is successful, let’s then focus on the organization relationship. Please run the following PowerShell command from Exchange Online side and provide the output:<br />
<strong>Get-OrganizationRelationship -Identity "Exchange Online to On Premises Organization Relationship" | fl</strong><br />
(Please refer to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee332343%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get-OrganizationRelationship</a> for details. The <strong>Identity</strong> parameter can be
<strong>Canonical name</strong>, <strong>GUID</strong> and <strong>Name</strong>.)<br />

<p>Hi Trent,</p>
<p>So we can determine that your <strong>Outlook Autodiscover</strong> service is working fine. Also, according to the output of
<strong>Get-OrganizationRelationship</strong>, the relationship should not have anything that may cause the Free/Busy sharing issue.</p>
<p>Please let me know the answers to the following 2 questions then:<br />
1. Is this a <strong>2010</strong>-based hybrid deployment or <strong>2013</strong>-based?<br />
2. Have you deployed <strong>OAuth</strong>? You can tell it by running <strong>Get-IntraOrganizationConnector</strong> and see if you can find
<strong>Enabled = True</strong> in the output.</p>
<p>Our next troubleshooting steps would depend on these 2 questions. And I’m looking forward to your updates.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Allen</p>
        </p>

    <title>My Excel table &#43; formatting doesn&#39;t display all the content - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanwilliams8  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Excel table &#43; formatting doesn&#39;t display all the content correctly when pasting through as &#39;Paste Special - Paste Link&#39; in Publisher</h2>
                    <p>When I copy a data table (with formatting) from Excel and paste into Publisher, it loses the formatting from a few of the bottom cells of the table. The data table is pasted in using 'Paste Special -&gt; Paste Link -&gt; Microsoft Excel File' so it will auto-update
 the data.</p>
<p><br />
This is the screenshot of Excel table:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/16111f55-3c7d-4f45-9e8e-acc2571afe7c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/16111f55-3c7d-4f45-9e8e-acc2571afe7c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the screenshot of it pasted into Publisher:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/848a0462-012f-4f1f-9305-676aae9f0f9b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/848a0462-012f-4f1f-9305-676aae9f0f9b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As you can see, the bottom rows lose the conditional formatting even though they are working correctly on Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be greatly appreciated :)</p>

            Okay it looks like it's the size that is causing the issue - when I make the row lengths smaller (10 pixels) and remove the blank rows, it all fits in and it keeps the formatting on the lowest cells

            It's not an issue with my Wi-Fi as most of my apps are updating, It's just a selected few that aren't. After looking into it I have found the issue and the issue seems to be with my SD cards its just the apps that are currently saved there. I have changed
 my settings so that all new apps are download onto my device which has done the trick. At some point all my existing apps saved to my SD card I will transfer to my device and see if they will then update successfully.

            <p>I am having this issue as well. This issue started yesterday with updates required for apps stored on my removable card on my windows 10 tablet. Apps affected are Dropbox, Wunderlist, Facebook, and two other apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running current Windows OS, updates are pushed automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to yesterday, these apps have updated without a hitch on my d: drive card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked/performed the following steps:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Tested my WIFI strength for my home network, working great up and down. Took my tablet to work to use fiber internet... same error.&nbsp;<br />
2. &nbsp;Verified my removable SD card shows properties are functioning properly in settings (it is... and is hosting a wealth of other apps and files without a hitch).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Verified my time settings were correct - they were. I then changed my time setting to another time zone, then back to my correct time zone as recommended by one tech guru and restarted computer... same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has found a viable option for fixing this error, <strong>other than</strong> moving all of these memory hog apps back to my internal memory to update, then moving them back to my removable drive (which I think will fix the problem) every time they
 need updating, <strong>please advise</strong>.** My internal memory is limited and I had rather not have to do that when a company such as microsoft might just have the resources to determine how to update apps stored on sd cards; I'm sure android techs can
 offer them much advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>** Please do not advise resetting my device back to factory and/ or reformatting my card (for obvious reasons - as it is holds approximately 18 GB of important programs and data). This is not a viable option for this error code for my situation. This is
 obviously not a device or card issue since all else is working fine - except for microsoft and/or the app store's inability to update (certain) apps hosted on removable cards.**</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance! I've already spent way too much time on this issue, I sincerely hope someone has a quick fix, or microsoft will get it together.... soon!</p>

            none of the solutions above solve my problem on a Dell inspiron 3000 two in one Windows 10 tablet... I cant even reinstall apps on my SD card.... what crap Windows 10 and Windows store has been for an expensive enough tablet with low main drive space that
 obliges SD card usage...

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for the solution. It has solved my problem. But Microsoft needs to address this issue as the external memory cards will have to be installed and used as existing 8GB (Default) memory is very less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also quality of Apps on Windows Stores needs to be at par with Google Play &amp; Apple-Store.</p>
<p>

            Windows 10 is truly pitiful garbage. I've used MS for over 20 years, why they've tanked like this is beyond me - not even having the store work! &nbsp;I'm back again after searching for a solution the last time it blew up. Every time I try and install an app
 it &nbsp;breaks and I have to Google a solution. The only reason I use it now is for the printer driver.

    <title>How do I sync the page numbers in the TOC with the actual page in the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I sync the page numbers in the TOC with the actual page in the document&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to sync my page numbers listed in my TOC with the actual page number that it is in the document.&nbsp; Some Headings may be more than one page, so each heading will be a different number.&nbsp; And can it auto-sync if we move something around or change
 the order? We might be changing the parts in red but the title will always be the same, so if the page number can follow the header title?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example:&nbsp; Right now i have this table of contents </p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69647a40-4f13-4d1d-83e1-b21b6733c1e6" /></p>
<p>Everything shows pretty much page 7 right now.&nbsp; When technically the page number for S-1a is 6, S-1b is 8, S-1D is 11 and so on.&nbsp; I hope this is making sense, its hard to explain.&nbsp; i have tried doing plenty of research and cant find anything on what im talking
 about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help if you can....</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            If all else fails, you can post a copy (after removing any sensitive information, ie use =rand() to generate safe filler ) on skydrive and give us an edit link to look at it.

            <p>Are you tracking changes? In that case, updating the TOC may lead to unexpected results.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you are not tracking changes, and the TOC "goes out of whack" on update,&nbsp;you will have to carefully verify that the correct heading styles are applied to the appropriate paragraphs.</p>

            No you do not HAVE to uninstall 2003.&nbsp; The terms of the 2010 license are totally independent of 2003, so you do have the "legal" right to run both at the same time.<br />
<br />
I found it handy to have 2003 in place for times when I "just have to get something done" and am P.O.'d hunting for features in 2010. If you are comfortable with 2010, then you might as well get rid of "duplicate" 2003 apps to free up HD space.<br />
<br />
If you do decide to keep both, there are a few extra steps you have to take to make the "play well together". Office is designed with the assumption that there is only one version installed. There are 2 main issues: Windows default file associations and "re-installing"
 office each time you start an app in the "other" version.<br />
<br />
The first one is a windows problem. You can only have one app selected as default. So you have to make a choice. The only difference is that for the non-default one you have to use the File Open dialog to open files.<br />
<br />
If you want to keep both, here are the tips I used to make them work:<br />
<span>Dual Install - Working with Multiple Versions of Office<span>&nbsp;
</span></span>
<p><span><a href="https://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/keep-earlier-versions-of-office-programs-when-installing-office-2010-HA102597134.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/keep-earlier-versions-of-office-programs-when-installing-office-2010-HA102597134.aspx</a>
</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<span>This tip describes the specific steps and choices during the 2010 custom install. After you have the multiple versions installed you still have some additional steps to do. They are described in this tip:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=762</a>
</span></p>
<p>With multiple versions installed, there is one issue you can’t avoid, Default Windows File Associations. Only one app can be used to open the files by double clicking in Windows Explorer. You have to pick which one.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<span>Personal Supplemental instructions</span>
<p>MS tends to put everything in separate folders and with long wordy names.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I decided to consolidate things somewhat.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I navigated to the “Start” menu and edited folder and shortcut names to be more concise.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I created a single “Microsoft Office” folder and migrated all of the shortcuts into it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I created shortcuts to the 3 “2003 to 2007 Interactive Command References”. Then I started renaming the shortcuts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In my case I had Office 2003 and Office 2007, so I renamed them as follows:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>“2003 Excel”<br />
“2003 PowerPoint”<br />
“2003 Word”<br />
“2007 Excel”<br />
“2007 Excel 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”<br />
“2007 PowerPoint”<br />
“2007 PowerPoint 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”<br />
“2007 Word”<br />
“2007 Word 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”<br />
etc…</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Word 2003<br />
Word 2007<br />
Word 2010<br />
Word 2003 to 2010 Mapping<br />
Excel 2003<br />
Excel 2007<br />
Excel 2010<br />
Excel 2003 to 2010 Mapping<br />
etc…</p>
<p>As well, I decided to keep both sets of ``Office Tools`, so I kept one folder and renamed the shortcuts using the same pattern, ie starting with the year.</p>
<p>I also do custom installations, specifying unique installation folders to further separate the installations. It isn't completely successful, some common folders are still used, &nbsp;but it seems to help.</p>
<p>Microsoft's recommendations are incomplete regarding Word - see
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm</span></a> for further recommendations with regard
 to shared resources that are better not shared.</p>
<p>Office apps also work better also if their startup folders are not shared.</p>
<p>In the case of Excel I would relocate the contents of the (Excel 2003) XLSTART folder to a new sub folder of the existing XLSTART -The start-up folder location is stored in the registry at<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Common\Xlstart</p>
<p>Set the value to match the sub new folder name e.g. Office11XLSTART. That should sort out Excel 2003. Create a similar sub folder and registry entries for Office 2010 i.e.Office14XLSTART and at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common\Xlstart</p>
<p>The same idea applies to Word’s startup and template folders.</p>

                    <p>Some time ago I tried the outlook mobile app for android and got stuck in the mess of the scheduled folders. From reading here, there are all kinds of issues with these, but now I cannot get rid of the folder. I have tried deleting it on my current email

            Can’t delete a calendar?
<br />Is the Delete command grayed out, like this? This means you can’t delete this calendar.
<br />
<br />Delete command is grayed out
<br />
<br />Is this your primary Outlook calendar? If so, that’s the reason you can’t delete it. If you have another calendar open, you can instead close it or hide your main calendar. It’s not deleted, but it’s out of the way. If you want to remove all the items from your primary calendar, see the next section, Delete all items from the primary calendar.
<br />
<br />Delete all items from the primary calendar
<br />Although you can’t delete the primary Outlook calendar, you can delete all the items in that calendar.
<br />
<br />Warning:  The following steps will delete all items in your calendar, including holidays that were automatically added. See Add holidays to the calendar to make the default Outlook holidays that were deleted available again. All other calendar items are permanently deleted.
<br />
<br />In Calendar, click View.
<br />
<br />In the Current View group, click Change View, and then click List.
<br />
<br />Click in the item list, and then press Ctrl+A to select all of the items in the list.
<br />
<br />Press Delete.
<br />
<br />Remove shared, team, group and SharePoint calendars
<br />When you open these calendars in Outlook, they’re added to the folder pane in the Calendar. This lets you quickly view the calendar with only one click.
<br />
<br />To remove shared, team, group, and SharePoint calendars:
<br />
<br />Right-click the calendar, and then click Delete Group or Delete Calendar.
<br />
<br />Outlook asks you if you want to remove the group or calendar, and move its contents into the Deleted Items folder.
<br />
<br />Click Yes to confirm the deletion.
<br />
<br />The calendar is removed from the folder pane and no longer appears in the Calendar. Because you were viewing a copy, the source calendar remains intact and only your copy gets deleted.

<p>This is not related to the calendar at all. </p>
<p>On the Outlook mobile app (Android) there is an option to "schedule" emails to deal with later. When you schedule an email, you must select a "Scheduled" folder to store the email until it is time for it to appear again. There is not an option to change
 the Scheduled folder, and the folder that I originally assigned to be the Scheduled folder can not be renamed or deleted from any application, including the Outlook.com website or the Outlook mobile app where it was originally set up.&nbsp;</p>

            Verify that your email account is synchronized with the server via IMAP, if it is synchronized, to permanently remove a folder, remove it directly from the server.
<br />
<br />To do this, access your email via webmail, remove the folder and then test the outlook.

            Yes, I understand that. From your reply, I understood to go directly to webmail and delete the folder from there, and then sync Outlook. But as I have said, I am already using Outlook webmail, as direct to the server as I can get, and there is still no
 option to delete this folder.

<p>In the first screenshot, I choose a regular folder. When I right click through Outlook.com webmail, I have the option to Delete Folder.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the second screenshot, I right click on the assigned "Scheduled" folder that was assigned from the Outlook mobile app (there are no webmail or mobile app options to alter the scheduled folder). This folder has no option to Delete Folder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>In addition, the Outlook mobile app for Android displays this folder differently than the rest. There is not an option to alter or delete this folder within the app where it was assigned either.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This has been an issue for many users, but there is no documentation on this "feature" of the mobile app, and no way to reverse it once you try it, as well as no options for it anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want to delete this folder.</p>

            This has finally been resolved. I installed a free version of Windows 10 on VirtualBox (since I don't use Windows), and while I was waiting for my Office365 trial to load so I could use the solution from
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/all/how-to-undo-a-scheduled-folder/25426a3a-5d6b-4cb8-bc93-49e4b539896c?page=4" title="everyone has this problem">
this thread</a>, I tried setting up the Windows 10 Mail app. I was able to delete the folder from there, but an important thing to note, since others mentioned the same thing, is that the folder MUST BE deleted from the trash also or it will not only show up
 in 3rd party programs still, but will move back to the inbox folders. While using the Mail app did not work for some users, I am glad that it finally got rid of this ridiculous folder.&nbsp;

    <title>Cannot see build 10122 after rollback - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot see build 10122 after rollback</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my PC to build 10122 as soon as it became available, but after about an hour of use, the computer shut down on its own and rolled back to 10074. I'm not sure why this happened, although I have been assuming it is the INF store issue people are
 seeing elsewhere. I ran this command in cmd:</p>
<p>
</p><p>rundll32.exe pnpclean.dll,RunDLL_PnpClean /DRIVERS /MAXCLEAN</p>
<p>
</p><p>and ran Disk Cleanup, which is supposed to help with that issue, but the problem now is that Windows Update no longer sees build 10122. There is no error code, it just says my machine is up-to-date. I have tried toggling the Automatic/Manual and Fast/Slow
 settings, and have verified that the ThresholdRiskLevel key in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability is "low". Still no updates visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help with this, and also on any way to make sure it does not roll back again? Thanks.</p>

            I had the same problem, its very easy to fix. &nbsp;If you right click on the start button and then click run type in&nbsp;regedit.exe when your registry opens scroll down until you see &nbsp;the folder WindowsSelfHost &nbsp;click on it and then you will see a folder that
 says RecoverdFrom. &nbsp;Delete that folder in the registry and then go back to the windows update and it will now pick up on the new build.

            <p>Get a good graphics program, such as the free <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
IrfanView</a>. Copy the artwork in Word, and paste it into the graphics program. Go to the program's Resize dialog (in IrfanView, it's on the Image menu) and set the 300 dpi resolution, as well as the correct size in pixels needed to keep the image at the desired
 size. When the picture has been resized/resampled, save it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no need to pass through the PDF intermediate file in this method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's no specific requirement for a JPEG file, you'd do better to save the image as a PNG file. The JPEG compression algorithm is "lossy" -- every time you edit and resave the file, it loses some information and can eventually become blurry. In contrast,
 the PNG format uses a lossless compression algorithm.</p>

            I had the same thing. When I followed the instructions it put me on the slow ring with no option to change to the fast ring. In the end, I booted up from my backup and it went straight into the 15055 download. No problems since.<br />

<h2>            Motorola Q9c gets hot while My Phone is installed.</h2>
                    
<p>Has anyone experienced their phone getting extremely hot and battery draining fast while My Phone is installed? I am running Win Mobile 6.1 and installed the oringal My Phone app and was prompted to upgrade to the new version, I let it do it's thing and
 something is running in the backgournd that heats the phone and drains the battery. I have removed the My Phone app from the phone and it's operating normally, not hot at all, and it is holding charge.</p>
<p>Any ideas? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?</p>

<p>Hi, IamMightyThor.</p>
<p>Does this happen when you sync your phone for the first time with Microsoft My Phone? If so, then this is not abnormal. The first sync, depending on how much content you have, can take up several minutes to complete. During that time, a permanent data connection
 is always active which, on some phone models, will cause them to heat up. This would also happen if you used your browser, for example, for a long period of time.</p>
<p>After the first sync is over, you shouldn't have this problem going forward. Simply installing My Phone will not cause it to do anything unless you set it to automatically sync periodically.</p>
<p>Marco.</p>
