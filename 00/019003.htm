<h2>            Outlook drops connection</h2>
                    
<p>I am the only user of 8 in our configuration that consistently drops connectivity in Outlook for office 365. I have tried the troubleshooting technics using Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365. I get Office 365 service endpoints from
 this device since we found name resolution failure for outlook.office365.com. I have to wait till the next day to recover&nbsp;and use Outlook. Driving me crazy. No other user is encountering the error. Any help would greatly be appreciated. Thanks...</p>

<p>hi jerry,</p>
<p>based on your description, i learnt that the outlook client was disconnected from server from time to time and you are the only person affected in your organization. as multiple factors would lead to this kind of issue, i’d like to collect the following
 information to better understand the situation first: <br />
1. are you using outlook for windows or outlook for mac when the issue occurred? please provide the detailed version of the program then.<br />
2. are you and your colleagues working under the same network environment? does the issue persist in a different network environment (like your home network)?<br />
3. also, could you try logging into your colleague’s computer to check the issue so that we can identify if the issue is related to the specific account?<br />
4. by saying ‘we found name resolution failure for outlook.office365.com’, do you mean you cannot log into
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook web app</a>? if not, please further clarify it.
<br />
5. are there any error messages when the outlook is disconnected? please capture some related screenshots and upload them if any. to upload pictures, please click<strong> use rich formatting</strong> and
<strong>insert/edit media</strong>.</p>

6. as you’ve run the <a href="http://diagnostics.office.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sara tool</a>, i have sent you a private message to collect the detailed analysis log. you can access the private message via the link below:<br />

<p>Sam:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks for getting back to me. To answer your questions. I am in a Windows 10 environment and yes my colleagues work under the same network environment. This only happens to me as we are all located in the same office. I am using outlook 2016 on my windows
 desktop computer and I have no problems with the Outlook Web app. My version is MS Outlook 2016 MSO (16.0.6528.1017) 64 Bit. Your question number 4 comes from running the SaRA tool. The only error I ever receive when disconnected is on the bottom left of Outlook
 that states it's disconnected. THanks... </p>

<p>Hi Jerry,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates in the private message.</p>
<p>Since the issue re-occurs, I have created a workspace to collect the pdf file and the SaRA analysis logs. You can click the private message link above again to access the workspace.</p>
<p>Moreover, let’s further troubleshoot the issue with the following details:<br />
1. When did you notice this issue? Was everything working fine before?<br />
2. I noticed your Outlook client is not up to date, so please upgrade it to the latest version and check the issue. (In
<strong>File</strong>&gt;<strong> Office Account</strong>&gt; <strong>Update Options</strong>&gt;
<strong>Update Now</strong>)<br />
3. As the issue merely happens to you although you and your colleagues are working in the same office, if possible, please try logging into the Outlook client on your colleague’s desktop so that we can identify if the issue is related to your computer settings
 or the specific account.<br />
4. You may refer to <strong>When the status us DISCONNECTED</strong> part in this article and check if the issue can be fixed.<br />

<p>Hi Jerry,</p>
<p>Thanks for the pdf file uploaded.</p>
<p>I have checked the error message and found the root cause might be your internal network fails to connect to our Office 365 mail server. In this case, if you are not the firewall/proxy administrator of your organization, please contact them and add
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2#BKMK_EXO_IP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange Online IP Addresses</a>&nbsp;to your whitelist to check the issue.</p>
<p>However, if the issue persists after that, please share with us more details as I mentioned in the last post so that we can move forward on the issue.
<br />
1. Did the issue occur suddenly?<br />
2. Upgrade the Outlook client to the latest version.<br />
3. Configure your account on a different desktop to check the issue.<br />
4. Refer to <strong>When the status is DISCONNECTED</strong> part in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Switch-from-offline-to-online-mode-54e930da-b327-4aa7-b3ab-c429dadb2f9e?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IE&amp;ad=IE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;Just got back for a couple days off. The disconnect error happened to me this morning again. It's just me and only me. Nobody else has this problem. We have 4 desks that use outlook 365 and they have no problems. It has to be something related to my system
 as far as I can tell. My version is 16.0.6568.2036. This has been going on for sometime.</p>

<p>Hi Jerry,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting back.</p>
<p>I do understand you are the only person in your office who is affected by the issue and it has been going on for some time. Given the situation, I’d like to confirm if you have tried to whitelist the Exchange Online IP Addresses as I mentioned in my last
 post, if not, could you give it a try when you have time?</p>
<p>Also, as your current Outlook client is not the latest version which may contain some known issues, you can upgrade it to the latest in
<strong>File</strong>&gt; <strong>Office Account</strong>&gt; <strong>Update Options</strong>&gt;
<strong>Update Now</strong> and check if there is any improvement then.</p>
<p>And regarding ‘It has to be something related to my system’, do you mean you’ve tried configuring your account on another desktop and found the issue’s gone? We would appreciate it if you can share more details for our further investigation.</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued time and efforts on this issue.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Sam</p>

<p>Ok Yeah I am lost. I have not idea what to do with the whitelist. &nbsp;I checked out the page and stuff but I don't see any action items to take. Not sure where to go from here. I will try another system that part is easy. I did the update and will have to wait
 to see if it disconnects again. When I stated it had to do with my system, I meant that since nobody else encounters the issue it seems like the issue is contained on my system only. I might need telephonic support to attempt any other troubleshooting methods.
 Thanks for your patience. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jerry,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Regarding the documentation, as I mentioned above, you may turn to your IT admin or network firewall admin to add the corresponding Exchange Online IP addresses to the whitelist to check the issue. And since you’ve upgraded the Outlook client, let’s wait
 to see if the issue will reoccur in the future. We are glad to provide further assistance if needed.</p>

            Are the sections continuously numbered, or is numbering restarted in each section? The latter would seem illogical; in the case of&nbsp;the former, instead of the NUMPAGES field for N, you can use a PAGEREF field referring to a bookmark on the last page of
 section 5.

            Need to activate remote SIM access to pair with Bluetooth module but cannot see this listed on any of the 6300 menus. Would have thiought it would be in menu&gt;settings&gt;connectivity&gt;bluetooth, as it is in other phones, but there is nothing there, although
 the phone specfications state it supports SIM access profiles. Can anybody help?

<h2>            How do I permanently delete Norton anti-spam plug-in from Outlook 2010</h2>
                    I have opened Norton settings and turned the anti-spam filter off, also deleted the plug-in within Outlook "add-ons" and it&nbsp;works beautifully. After my PC&nbsp;sits for a while and I attempt to reopen Outlook the Norton plug-in reappears in the startup window
 and the program hangs. I have to restart my PC in order to access Outlook. This is a recent development as I have been using both Norton and Outlook for several years on this PC without incident. I am running Windows 8.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Windows Phone Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a few different things that can cause this error, but based on the information you've provided the only resolution I know of for sure is to hard reset the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before taking that big of a step, we can try clearing the cache on the phone and then syncing the account again.&nbsp; To clear the cache, go to Settings -&gt; Applications -&gt; Internet Explorer, and tap on Delete History.&nbsp; When that finishes, restart the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes back on, go to Settings -&gt; Email+Accounts and tap and hold on your primary account and select Sync, and then try to get onto the Marketplace again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, you'll need to reset the phone.&nbsp; You'll need to back up pictures and other media onto your PC.&nbsp; Contacts and Calendars will sync with the account and come back after the reset.&nbsp; To reset the phone, go to Settings -&gt; About and tap on
 Reset My Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't resolve the issue, definitely let us know!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Kevin J S</p>

<h2>            File sending</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am doing Medical coding online coaching through Skpe.&nbsp; Last Sunday (19/11/2017) I attend a module assessment test (1.15 minutes)&nbsp; from 3.50 pm to 4.pm, I sent a word file to transorz at 4.03 pm and also sent a text message to the same address. But they
 didn't get the word file and&nbsp; got the text mesasage only. Whenever they informed me about this,&nbsp; I sign in into skpe at 10.25 pm, the word file transferred at the same time.&nbsp; What was really happened I don't know.</p>
<p>So they said that, I am not completed the module assessment in correct time and it can't be valued . How can I prove that I sent the file at correct time, and delay in file transfer is not my mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking you</p>

<h2>            emails missing from outlook app on Iphone 6</h2>
                    Starting today all of my emails are missing from my outlook app. &nbsp;When I log into outlook.com, I am able to see them. &nbsp;Funny thing is - junk mail is coming to my phone. &nbsp;Anyone else having this issue?

            <p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately these steps did not resolve my issue.&nbsp; Yesterday some of my emails started appearing&nbsp;in my app again but not all of them.&nbsp; There is a gap between the newest and oldest emails. (about 15 months worth that only show up when logged into email
 from a web browser.)</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you started any troubleshooting? Are you missing older emails or new emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a synchoronization issue with your email and the outlook app. You can check the link below for more information:https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2526306</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try uninstalling and reinstalling the outlook app on your phone and set up your email again. Also check if you have the latest version of the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it'll work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>

<blockquote>Hey!&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I have done this previously, millions of times.&nbsp; In fact, this is the first place where I went to delete history.&nbsp; When i go to delete them, by selecting&nbsp; "DELETE HISTORY", it never looks like it is doing anything or at least it isn't
 appearing to be doing the same thing as when I have other links in there (The mesage coming up indicating history is being deleted).</blockquote>
<br />
Bummer.&nbsp; Have you tried the old "turning the phone off (until it says 'Goodbye'&nbsp;and turning it back on" routine and then trying to delete the history using both techniques again?&nbsp; This is not ideal.&nbsp; I think these things will be fixed, but at this point it
 seems we just have to "fiddle" with it until it works.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt this will help but it's worth a shot.&nbsp; Best of luck Louis.

<h2>            Exported Chat History ignores one contact. All others are fine</h2>
                    Running version 8.21.0.7 on my Macbook Air and when I export my chat history from 7.x under tools I get the chat history for all except those added at end of 2017. Can I run a second version of Skype on my laptop in order to get the chat history for these
 newer contacts??

<h3> furrytribe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slowing the fade-in fade-out transition between photos in Microsoft Powerpoint 2007</h2>
                    Is it possible in Microsoft Powerpoint 2007 to slow the transition between the fade-in and fade-out of photos?&nbsp; In animation tab I have selected slow.&nbsp; I also have selected fade to black in the transition scheme.&nbsp; I am not referring to the timing of transitions
 between slides.&nbsp; I realize I can make those as long as I need.&nbsp; I am unhappy with how quickly the photos transition from one to the other even though I have selected the slow option.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for your help with this.

<p>I think I understand your question.</p>
<p>If you change the Animation Pane view to Show Advanced Timeline,&nbsp;you can&nbsp;manually click and drag the length of the orange bar that represents the effect length. Or you can select the offending fade effect in the animation pane,&nbsp;click on the down arrow associated
 with that effect,&nbsp;choose Timing. In the Effect dialog adjust the speed setting.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t open documents in Word with my new Office for Mac 2011</h2>
                    When I try to open a .doc or .docx that has been sent to me it won't open in Word - not by double clicking or by trying to open file in Word - I would have to convert the file and the choices are 'Text Only, MS-DOS Text, RTF, HTML etc NONE of which works
 or are readable. The only way I can read these documents are in Text Edit which loses all the details images and formatting.<br />
<br />
I have a mac but often need to open documents that have been done on PCs and I bought Office a few weeks ago specially so I could!<br />
<br />
I can write and reopen my own Word doc (it saves as .doc not .docx) and Excel sheets so what is wrong? How can I set it up so it works as it should?<br />
<br />
There's an online redemption offer to get 365 home premium for a year - would that help? I'm not interested in any of the products, I just want to be able to open Word documents.<br />

            Have you tried&nbsp; opening in OpenOffice (Free) or in Apple Pages? sometimes a different applications can open then you can always export the document back to Word format. Have you also tried in preview. You might&nbsp; save using Preview.
<br />
<br />
If nothing works then you need have the person resend the file this time have create&nbsp; zip archive of the file (from Finder locate the file click to highlight the from File menu choose Compress then send then Zip file as an attachment to you.

<h2>            Filtering and Checkbox problems - excel 2010 and 2013</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am hoping to get help with an error I have been experiencing both with excel 2010 and 2013. It is also happening both with windows 7 and 8. (Iv'e tried the same workbook on 2 different devices).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Basically I have a simple worksheet with one column that has checkboxes in it. When I filter by another column, some rows will then have 2 checkboxes in them. You can see an example below:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Worksheet as is:</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/064764a7-a389-426a-b43a-d7199e72f656" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Worksheet when filtered:</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28fda584-de60-495c-9fa1-c20550f8d425" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm hoping this is just a simple formatting problem due to my lack of knowledge of excel! Any advice would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

            For this case, it is better to visit authorized repair shop and they need to do diagnose to fix the issue.

            If your table of data is in A1:C6 with column labels in row 1 and your 'drop-down' is in E2 like this,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwerwew.sn2.livefilestore.com%2fy1p3my_9XjTCe-MvNFMbxBYEedltDjx_7U8WNw3hdflhyTKpYTXbtwbG9V6GwH1gtnCNtT-PNUwVAtyGjxOeix4MZXLDhhcAjwX%2fCatDog.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<br />
The <i>array formula</i>&nbsp;in F2 is,<br />
<br />
=IFERROR(INDEX($B$2:$B$6,SMALL(IF($A$2:$A$6=E$2,ROW($1:$5)),ROWS($1:1))),"")<br />
<br />
... which requires <i>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</i>&nbsp;rather than just <i>Enter</i>. Once entered correctly, it needs to be
<i>filled down</i>&nbsp;far enough to catch the largest number of duplicates in column A. The values in column G can be gathered using VLOOKUP() and the retrieved value from column F.<br />
<br />
Note that ROW($1:$5) refers to the <i>position</i>&nbsp;of the match within the&nbsp;$B$2:$B$6 range, not the actual row of the match.

<h2>            How to download any new movie free of cost</h2>
                    <p>Hello, &nbsp;I want to ask how to dowload any new movie which is released in theatres and we want to see it on our computer or mobile as many a time the downloading sites are commercial and generally you are not able to download for free. Every time either they
 ask for a paid membership or subscribing to any option. There is not a clear way of simply downloading any movie or collection of songs. Please help me with all the relevant facts technically as well as non- technically because I am a computer savy person
 who has a little technical knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Jurgen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saved the songs onto the OneDrive desktop app for Windows 10 PC. Since I posted the original question of this thread, the songs now appear on the Groove iOS app but not the Groove Windows 10 application. This isn't really a problem for me though as all
 of my music is also stored locally on my PC and appears in the Groove PC application under "On This Device", but no music appears under "On OneDrive".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The songs are a mixture of MP3 and also M4A (songs bought from iTunes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jheaff</p>

            <p>Hello Jheaff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thank you very much for your post here and the fast response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please open the Groove app on your PC and check if your are logged in with your account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only then you can see your songs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are signed in go to songs and set the filter there to</p>
<p>"on Onedrive".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you should be able to see the songs saved on Onedrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if these steps could solve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

            <p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I posted this question I was signed into the Groove music app for windows 10 and did select "on OneDrive" filter. It all seems to be working fine now, perhaps there was a problem with Microsoft servers. I didn't do anything to rectify the problem it
 just miraculously showed all of the songs on my OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello Guruprasad Ra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing the exact same problem and have found no solutions so far. &nbsp;The problem is really isolated to my computer at work so I don't think the other users in the office are relevant to how the other users are saving the files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recap the problem: anytime I access an Office 2013 file on a network drive (ex&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">\\networkdrive\folder\working files\) to make changes when I click Save As, then click "Current Folder" I am taken to
 a Network Shortcuts folder (ex.&nbsp;</span>C:\Users\myid\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Network Shortcuts) located on my local C: Drive. &nbsp;How can this be fixed so it will take me to the "Current Folder" on the network drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Justin</p>
