<h2>            NAS no longer available when signed in with Microsoft account...</h2>
                    <p>I can no longer access my Seagate Black Armor NAS when I sign on to my computer (Surface Book Pro) using my Microsoft account. I have been able to do so up until about three weeks ago (last verified access). I created a local account on my computer and that
 does work. I also can access my NAS from another computer (Surface Pro 3), but using the same Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is really frustrating. While I do have a workaround--I can access the NAS from the local account, but it is a pain to not be able to use my NAS from my main account.</p>

<div><br />
<div>If I manually rotate a portrait orientation picture 90 degrees using <b>Windows File Explorer</b>,

=========================================<br />
A few ideas:<br />
<br />
1) To correct corrupted thumbnails...it may be worth a try to<br />
Clear and Reset the Thumbnail Cache.<br />
<br />
Windows 7: Thumbnail Cache - Clear and Reset<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/10797-thumbnail-cache-clear-reset.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/10797-thumbnail-cache-clear-reset.html</a><br />
<br />
2) Disabling Thumbnail Caching should prevent the issue from<br />
occurring in the future.<br />
<br />
Windows 7: Thumbnail Cache - Enable or Disable<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/10794-thumbnail-cache-enable-disable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/10794-thumbnail-cache-enable-disable.html</a><br />
<br />
3) If you are having the same issue in Windows Photo Gallery...<br />
you might try renaming the Photo Gallery proprietary database.<br />
<br />
This will force Photo Gallery to create a new database the next<br />
time it's launched.&nbsp; Be aware you may lose some tags and<br />
metadata and the gallery will have to be re-populated.<br />
<br />
The database file is Pictures.pd6&nbsp; (rename to : Pictures.OLD)<br />
<br />
If the result is not satisfactory...delete your new .pd6 file and<br />
rename the .OLD file back to .pd6.<br />
<br />
The path is:<br />
<br />
Windows 7 -<br />
%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Photo<br />
Gallery\Pictures.pd6<br />
<br />
This is a Hidden file so if you cannot find it...the following setting<br />
may need to be changed.<br />
<br />
Try the following steps in Windows 7:<br />
<br />
Go to.....Start button / Control Panel / Appearance<br />
and Personalization / Folder Options / View tab<br />
Advanced settings / Show hidden files, folders, and<br />
drives / OK<br />
<br />

            <div>Subject: Windows Photo Viewer - Manual Picture Rotation - Part 2</div>
<div><br />
<div>Gentlemen,</div>
<div><br />
<div>The content of the answer link provided by Phil Reineman presented interesting information. A conclusion was presented that "some applications do not correctly update the photo rotation metadata." This is another way of stating my original question. It
 is not helpful to "civilian" users to discuss internal programming issues. Civilian users do not normally have access to internal programming information. Discussing internal program processes, real or inferred, is not helpful, and these processes cannot be
 demonstrated by civilian users.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The content of the answer links referred by Volunteer J were not helpful. The problem that I presented did not suggest that the issue was with any cache database corruption or size issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To clarify this issue, and perhaps to belabor the point, here is a step by step demonstration of a small part of the picture file rotation problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Using a Nikon S6500 digital camera, take a picture using a portrait orientation. The picture will appear to be correct if the picture is viewed when the picture rectangle is in the vertical orientation, long side up.</div>
<div>1a. For simplicity, I will call "horizontal" orientation to mean that the picture rectangle is in the horizontal orientation, short side up with a sideways picture presentation. I will call "vertical" orientation to mean that the picture rectangle is in
 the vertical orientation, long side up with a meaningful up and down picture presentation.</div>
<div>2. Remove the SD card from the camera and, using an SD Card Reader, copy the picture file to the desktop for further viewing and manipulation. The thumbnail for this picture file shows the picture in the horizontal orientation with the top of the scene
 to the right short side. Note that at this point the orientation of the picture image is not indicated or viewable without using a picture viewing or editing program.</div>
<div>2a. Open this picture file using Windows Photo Viewer. This picture image is presented with the same horizontal orientation as in the thumbnail image.</div>
<div>2b. Using Windows Photo Viewer, rotate the horizontally presented image once (90 degrees) to the left (CCW) so that the picture image will be presented in the vertical orientation with the top of the scene up. This is a more meaningful presentation of
 this image.</div>
<div>2c. Close Windows Photo Viewer. The thumbnail for this picture file is changed to a vertical orientation that matches how the picture image looked when it was viewed with Windows Photo Viewer.</div>
<div>2d. Open this rotated picture file using the Nikon ViewNX 2 program. Select the view mode "Image Viewer" where the picture image is presented above the filmstrip that shows thumbnail images for each picture. At this point, the picture image is presented
 in a vertical orientation and the thumbnail image is presented in a horizontal orientation. Note that is mismatch between the presentation of the picture image and the presentation of the thumbnail image cannot be fixed.</div>
<div>3. Still viewing pictures with Nikon ViewNX 2, select the original, not rotated picture file. Here the picture image is presented in a horizontal orientation and the thumbnail image is presented with a matching horizontal orientation.</div>
<div>3a. Rotate the horizontally presented image once (90 degrees) to the left (CCW) so that the picture image will be presented in the vertical orientation with the top of the scene up. The thumbnail image changes to a matching vertical orientation.</div>
<div>3b. Close the Nikon ViewNX 2 program. A "Confirm File Change" message is presented ("Some files have been edited. Do you want to cancel closing the application and save the changes?"). If you click on "No" the program will close. A rotation action will
 not be made. The thumbnail for this picture file will appear with a horizontal orientation as it was before using the Nikon ViewNX 2 program.</div>
<div>4. Open the Nikon ViewNX 2 program and select the original, not rotated picture file again. Here the picture image is presented in a horizontal orientation and the thumbnail image is presented with a matching horizontal orientation.</div>
<div>4a. Rotate the horizontally presented image once (90 degrees) to the left (CCW) so that the picture image will be presented in the vertical orientation with the top of the scene up. The thumbnail image changes to a matching vertical orientation.</div>
<div>4b. Close the Nikon ViewNX 2 program. A "Confirm File Change" message is presented. (the File menu, Save command is not available) If you click on "Yes" the Nikon ViewNX 2 program will remain open, the picture image will be incorrectly presented in a horizontal
 orientation with the top of the scene to the left. The thumbnail image changes to a matching incorrect horizontal orientation. This new orientation was not selected and is not sensible. [This is an error with the Nikon ViewNX 2 program.] Closing and then running
 the Nikon ViewNX 2 program returns the presentation to the correct view. The Nikon ViewNX 2 program has a few problems with presentation; however the saved file is saved in a meaningful way. [It is unfortunate that these minor problems with Nikon ViwNX 2 have
 confounded this discussion.]</div>
<div>4c.Please also note that if all that was done with the picture file was a rotation, the only change to the file will probably be a rotation, and the user can reasonably assume that this was the action that was taken. The user can choose to rotate or not
 to rotate. 4d. If the picture file was rotated and edited (e.g. the Brightness was changed), other things will happen and the user will become even more confused.</div>
<div>4e. Close the Nikon ViewNX 2 program. The thumbnail for this picture file appears with a vertical orientation which was the intended orientation.</div>
<div>5. Open the Nikon ViewNX 2 program and select the rotated picture image file. The rotated picture image appears with the correct vertical orientation along with a matching thumbnail image.</div>
<div>5a. Close the Nikon ViewNX 2 program.</div>
<div>6. Open the Nikon ViewNX 2 rotated picture file using the Windows Photo Viewer. The rotated picture image appears with the correct vertical orientation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Summary:</div>
<div><br />
<div>The above examples do not present all of the picture rotation possibilities. Who knows how much trouble and confusion other rotation editing combinations can cause users?</div>
<div><br />
<div>As was stated before, Windows Photo Viewer and Nikon ViewNX 2 can produce inconsistent results with the correspondence between the picture image orientation and the thumbnail image orientation. If Nikon ViweNX 2 is used first to rotate an image, the two
 orientations will remain synchronized. However, if a user did not know my little trick about closing Nikon ViewNX 2 and then opening it again before proceeding with additional picture edits, the user would be significantly confused about how the Nikon ViewNX
 2 program performs picture rotations. If the Windows Photo Viewer is used first to rotate an image, the two orientations will be different and cannot be changed to present matching orientations.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As a "civilian" user (non-Microsoft or non-Nikon professional) it is not appropriate for me to criticize or suggest programming decisions made by Microsoft or by Nikon. It is legitimate for me to operate programs and to note inconsistencies about how programs
 work. My original question asked "Can this picture file rotation compatibility issue be evaluated and resolved?" This question still stands unanswered. Clearly several parties will need to be involved with this evaluation and resolution.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Additional Discussion:</div>
<div><br />
<div>The roles of picture file Viewing programs and picture file Editing programs may be philosophically quite different. Although it is probably a popular feature, providing an editing function (i.e. picture rotation) within a file Viewing program may create
 problems that may be difficult to solve.</div>
<div><br />
<div>File and PC specifics:</div>
<div>The picture file was from a Nikon Coolpix S6500 camera.</div>
<div>The OS was Windows 8 (64 bit) with a clean boot on a Samsung Series 7 Chronos PC.</div>
<div>All of the relevant programs were up-to-date.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for sticking with this interesting issue, WH</div>

<div>As a "civilian" user (non-Microsoft or non-Nikon professional) it is not appropriate for me to criticize or suggest programming decisions made by Microsoft or by Nikon. It is legitimate for me to operate programs and to note inconsistencies about how programs
 work. My original question asked "Can this picture file rotation compatibility issue be evaluated and resolved?" This question still stands unanswered. Clearly several parties will need to be involved with this evaluation and resolution.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Additional Discussion:</div>
<div><br />
<div>The roles of picture file Viewing programs and picture file Editing programs may be philosophically quite different. Although it is probably a popular feature, providing an editing function (i.e. picture rotation) within a file Viewing program may create
 problems that may be difficult to solve.</div>
<div><br />
<div>File and PC specifics:</div>
<div>The picture file was from a Nikon Coolpix S6500 camera.</div>
<div>The OS was Windows 8 (64 bit) with a clean boot on a Samsung Series 7 Chronos PC.</div>
<div>All of the relevant programs were up-to-date.</div>
<div><br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer the below questions to assist you better.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. When exactly do you get this error message? </span></span></p>
<p><span>2. Did you make any software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>3. What are the other troubleshooting steps that you tried to resolve this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Are you using Azure Virtual Machine?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please check the date and time set on the computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may run the SFC and DISM by following the below link and check if it helps.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>SFC: System File Checker</span> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persist, I suggest you to boot the Desktop system in Clean Boot and check if you are facing this same issue in clean boot state. (Clean boot is to check which application is causing this issue.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Yes. However, the way of making the Xbox her main Xbox is only by making sure that when you download her profile that you can go to settings, account and set it as Make Home Xbox. If this is her first time downloading her profile on a Xbox One then it will
 automatically become her main Xbox. At this moment there is no way to set a Xbox One to one Account as its the owner. The Xbox One gives each profile the same experience. You can download your profile on the same Xbox as her since you have gold and it should
 work. Giving all the profiles online experience. </p>
<p>Thank you! &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I have the same problem, but the fix did not fix mine. &nbsp;My setup is pretty standard with Drive 0 containing Windows on the first partition. &nbsp;My drive is a Solid State Drive if that matters, but Disk Management does show it as Drive 0 and the Windows partition
 is the first on the left...partition 1.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Here are several other options :<br />
<br />
A Refresh leaves data though redundant backups are always a good idea. <br />
A Reset removes everything.<br />
<br />
Refresh is part of reset in Windows 10<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>If you have made a disk from the ISO then you have what you need to repair<br />
the OS. And you can make a System Image Backup as&nbsp;I indicated in my previous <br />
reply. Or if the disk is not sufficient make a USB from the ISO.<br />
<br />
You may not be missing anything (probably a command line issue) :<br />
<br />
REAgentC Command-Line Options (Windows 8/8.1 &amp; 10)<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh825204.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh825204.aspx
</a><br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Use these to correct any missing or corrupted file issues :<br />
<br />
Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
<br />
Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.<br />
<br />
When that completes run these :<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
<br />
Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.<br />
<br />
Then restart the computer.<br />
<br />
And if needed you can do a repair install.<br />

    <title>Office 365&#47;Lync 2013 Hybridation - Skype for Business with proxy - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365&#47;Lync 2013 Hybridation - Skype for Business with proxy server</h2>
                    
<p>we've an existing lync 2013 environment with a federation with skype online. every think is ok for an internal person. but when a user is moved to the skype online pool, we’ve some issues with the connection of the client through
 our proxy.</p>
<p>all domains are whitelisted in our proxy from the office 365 list (no ssl inspection and anonymous access). but when the client is trying to connect, it tries to connect to xxxxx.infra.lync.com directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cecec25e-c750-4f2d-896c-27376e9c786c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cecec25e-c750-4f2d-896c-27376e9c786c" /></a></p>
<p>after 5/10 seconds, the client is using the proxy for all the requests to infra.lync.com and after that its working and the connection is ok. we don’t have the problem with outlook, the connection is direct and without delay.</p>
<p>the dns configuration is from the requirements of lync 2013. we even added a “lyncdisover” dns record in addition of the required “lyncdiscoverinternal”.</p>
<p>is there a way to configure the client for always use the proxy for each http requests? when i’m not with a proxy with a direct access to the internet its working great. it’s not an option for us to allow direct accesses.</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Microsoft recommend bypassing proxies wherever possible with Office365. I understand that you want to configure the client for always use the proxy server. I did a lot of research and didn’t find any official article about this.</p>
<p>We are also welcome community members’ for sharing, if they have any alternative related workaround.</p>
<p>Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Toby</p>

<h2>            Updated Skype changes in formatting visuals</h2>
                    <p>I conduct and record interviews for Youtube and before Skype updated, when I would have three people together for an interview, I could have all 3 in a direct line, like a comic strip. But, not I get one half of the screen with one person and the other half
 with 2, with one person over the other, so getting only a quarter of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) How do I get back to where I can 3 strip the video images?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) How do I get rid of that logo or image for myself in the upper righthand corner? Is there a way that my image could be put in with those of the three people I interview? This was not possible with the pre-updated Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Virtual Printers Suddenly Not Connected</h2>
                    After recently installing a new physical wifi printer Canon MX497, my other virtual printers (Microsoft Print to PDF, Microsoft XPS Document Writer, Send to OneNote) all became "Not Connected" in Devices and Printers. I tried uninstalling the Canon printer
 driver and reinstalling the Canon printer driver but there was no impact to the status of the other printers. They remained grey and when double-clicked gave me the "Operation could not be completed error 0x00000709" error. I am not sure how to fix this problem.
 Suggestions are welcome. Thank you.

            <p>Jesinta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the prompt reply. I tried a few things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I couldn't set the Print Spooler to Automatic (Delayed Start) because it gave me an error (Error 87: The parameter is incorrect.). So I set it to Manual. After restart, there was no change to the printer status. And I manually started the Print Spooler,
 also no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I used the printer troubleshooting tool. It detected that the printers were not turned on but gave no solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is some additional information after I fiddled around with it a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I wanted to see the Printer Properties, but it gave me an error (Printer properties cannot be displayed. Double check the printer name and make sure that the printer is connected to the network work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I tried to reinstall the printer driver to Microsoft Print to PDF through</p>
<p>&nbsp; * Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings</p>
<p>&nbsp; * Use an existing port: (left it as default LPT1 because I wasn't sure which to pick)</p>
<p>&nbsp; * Select Microsoft Print to PDF from the list of printer driver available</p>
<p>&nbsp; * Pick Use the driver that is currently installed (recommended) or Replace the current driver leads to the same result. -&gt; Error: Unable to install printer. The print processor does not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Same result when I tried to reinstall Microsoft XPS Document Writer. I also removed Microsoft XPS Document Writer before trying to install it again. Also got the same error. Through all this, my&nbsp;canon printer still works somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They all seem to point to this missing print processor. Do you know how I can reinstate this to my system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your help.</p>

                    I recently installed Windows 7 (used to have XP home edition) into a cleared out C-drive, and I can't get any of my music, pics, etc. from my Z-drive.&nbsp; I log in as what is shown to be Mark / administrator when I'm logging in, but when i try to open or
 move a file from my Z-drive, it says i need permission from the same Mark / Administrator to access the file.&nbsp; I've tried setting my Z-drive to allow full permission to Everyone, but that hasn't even done anything.... i'm lost on what to do.

<p>If anyone else runs into this problem, it's because XP encrypts files sometimes and i was unable to decrypt them via Windows 7. I had gotten rid of everything XP, so there was no hope to transfer the files back to decrypt... beware the random encrypts on
 XP.. hopefully i can find someone that can hack it or something, lol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again Pegasus, you tried a ton out via TeamViewer.&nbsp; Appreciate the time you gave up to help.</p>

<h2>            Wifi only connects to Gmail but nothing else, and only one on particular network</h2>
                    I can connect to Gmail online but nothing else, but this is only on one particular wifi network, which happens to be in a place where I do some consulting work. Any suggestions as to what might fix this?

<h2>            Missing feature after android skype update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am new to the forum so this is my first post. My issue is with video chatting. Previously during a video call if I were to 'minimize' skype to look at, say, chrome or facebook; a little window of whoever i was video chatting with would pop up so i could
 continue viewing the video call while multitasking. After the last update or two; this window no longer appears when I view another app yet the video call continues with audio only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to access this feature or was it removed during the last update? I would appreciate any advice on how to fix this. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am currenting running Skype Version 8.6.0.58070 on a Samsung Galaxy S7</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Some features may not be available at launch. This is a normal behavior of the new Skype app in which the call will be converted to an audio call if the user exits the application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that some users would want to multi-task and still see their contacts while on a video call.&nbsp;Our engineers are working hard to introduce new features, issue fixes and changes with every update of the application. We
 encourage every Skype user to post their suggestions and feedbacks here in the Community so we can collate them and pass it along to the appropriate support team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can monitor the improvements of the new Skype by visiting our&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34770/release-notes-for-the-new-skype-on-mobile?q=release+notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Release Notes for the new Skype on Mobile.</a></strong></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/227faa6a-f918-45ac-b380-ad0a7696f828" title="MikeArbuckle"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">MikeArbuckle</span></a><span> and welcome to the Skype Community!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Skype subscriptions are calling plans that lets you make calls to landlines and/or mobiles (if applicable). They&nbsp;can be&nbsp;purchased on our
<strong><a href="https://secure.skype.com/en/calling-rates?expo365=empty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Rates</a></strong> page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Could someone please tell me what this means specific to "mobiles and landlines?"&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A:</strong> This means that you will be able to call both mobile and landline numbers in Australia.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>There are certain premium-priced or geographic/country specific numbers</em><em>&nbsp;(e.g. 1-900 numbers)
</em><em>which are forbidden and cannot be reached using Skype. Additionally, Skype cannot be used for emergency calling.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>what if I don't use the 300 minutes in one month?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Skype subscriptions are recurring by default. They will refresh the same time and date when you initially purchased it. Unused minutes will not be carried over to the next month<em>.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Since I'll never, ever use 300 minutes in a month, will I lose them having paid for them already?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>Again, unused minutes will not be carried over for your next month's subscription use. Regardless if it's fully consumed or not, it will renew the same time and date of the initial purchase, that is why it is important to select a subscription
 that will suit your needs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps! For additional information on how subscription works, you may refer to

                    <p>I really hope someone can help me here.</p>
<p>I have a MacBook air 13" (purchased new in 2014), running Mavericks Mac OS 10.9.2,&nbsp;parallels desktop 9, build 9.0 24229 and windows 8.1, all installed in march 2014.</p>
<p>built in microphone and speakers on macbook air (no mic-in option)</p>
<p>sound and recording audio work fine on mac OS</p>
<p>No sound out or mic recording in on the Windows 8.1 side when all audio drivers set to parallels</p>
<p>When set to 'built-in' or 'default' for speakers and/or mic in Windows I get an echo even from ambient sound which gets louder without me doing anything and I have to switch to parallels audio drivers to stop the echo.</p>
<p>I am unable to record, or hear audio or Skype on the Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Everything is ticked green, device drivers say they are installed, up to date and working fine.</p>
<p>When try to do the 'set up mic' option, nothing happens when I do the test recording, whichever type of mic I try to set up (headset/desktop/other)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple Store Genius&nbsp;bar said they cant help as problem isn't with the Apple side but with 3rd party software</p>
<p>Parallels say I am past the 30 day support and will have to pay for any further tech support</p>
<p>Microsoft say that because it is an Apple device it isn't their problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stuck, having bought the machine specifically to record into a Windows based programme, and feel that I have followed all troubleshooting option on all three websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help please?</p>

            <p>Dear Mahesh,</p>
<p>I tried this, still no sound, as well as following the kb link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the sound icon and go on to volume mixer everything is green and volume is up. I tried listening to a video on a news channel on internet explorer - an explorer sound bar showed up with the green bar going up and down, but no actual sound from
 built in speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have enabled and disabled enhancements with restart each time, neither works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the mic seems to show a green bar, and dictation I recorded into sound player shows a green bar, plays with windows media player but no sound comes out (progress bar shows movement along timeline - before, it wasn't even doing that so mic definitely
 wasn't working, so this is a step in the right direction)</p>

            <p>I have had the exact same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back and forth with Parallels support several times. We had a couple sessions where they took remote control of my machine, tried a bunch of settings, etc. They couldn't fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on what I learned from Parallels support, this is a problem with how Parallels takes advantage (or rather doesn't take advantage) of the Apple hardware filtering that essentially filters out audio from the speakers when the mic is listening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Super frustrating that they can't fix this.</p>

            It is a custom built pc so how can I find the details you need?<br />
<br />
And I didn't just upgrade to win7 but it happened when i plugged a headset into the aux output socket.<br />
<br />
Also if I goto device manager and right click my name (At the top) and select add legacy hardware I can install realtek from there but when I try it says "Invalid access to memory allocation"
<br />
Maybe that can help a bit with the problem?<br />

If there is, you can try right clicking on it and update the driver. You may need to select what driver to install.<br />

            It is a Gigabyte p41t-d3 motherboard. I downloaded the latest realtek audio drivers from their website for that board, also tried the driver on the CD that came with the board.<br />
<br />
There is no audio device listed under device manager even after installing the latest or older drivers.<br />
<br />
I am running out of ideas to fix this issue. I've looked on nearly every forum but can't find a working solution to my problem and really don't want to re-install Windows again.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows.</strong>
<p>Fixing a customer problem: “No Audio Device is Installed” when launching sndvol on Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2009/01/06/fixing-a-customer-problem-no-audio-device-is-installed-when-launching-sndvol-on-windows-vista.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2009/01/06/fixing-a-customer-problem-no-audio-device-is-installed-when-launching-sndvol-on-windows-vista.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Also update or re-install the driver.</p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
</span></span></span><br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />

Fixing a customer problem: “No Audio Device is Installed” when launching sndvol on Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2009/01/06/fixing-a-customer-problem-no-audio-device-is-installed-when-launching-sndvol-on-windows-vista.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2009/01/06/fixing-a-customer-problem-no-audio-device-is-installed-when-launching-sndvol-on-windows-vista.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Is it on-board sound? Check to see if it is disabled in the BIOS - Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS)<br />
often F2 as you boot so watch the screen - make sure sound is not disabled.<br />
<br />
If it is an add-in card remove all power and remove and reseat the card - actually remove<br />
and reseat - do not just snug.<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
If needed :<br />
<br />
A new sound card may work IF there are not other issues including BIOS, low level chipset
<br />
drivers, and other major device drivers. For either a PC or a laptop you can try a Windows
<br />
compatible&nbsp;USB Sound Card which is not expensive - be sure to remove the old sound card
<br />
and/or disable the sound in the BIOS and Device Manager.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            I did look at that but it is not a problem with access rights. Also when I look into my registery I don't have: "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MMDevices\Audio\Render\{e4ee1234-fc70-4925-94e9-4117395f7995}"<br />
<br />
Maybe that might be where the error occurs from?<br />
<br />
It is on-board sound built into the motherboard. I'll try checking the bios<br />
<br />
*Edit*<br />
Not a problem with the bios boot settings.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect windows 10 laptop to Iphone 7 hotspot</h2>
                    My laptop connects to the hotspot but it just says "No internet, secured." My parents iphones can both connect to the laptop and they work properly. I have tried almost every solution online and nothing has worked. Other Iphones can also connect to my
 iphone's hotspot. Any help would be appreciated!

            Hi AkaConsending
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Try following one by one. Skip a step which you have already tried.
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections / Network / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooters
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt;
<br />1. Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />2. Click Network adapters &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />3. Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br />C. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />D.  As a last resort if nothing works - I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hello AkaConsending, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />I suggest you follow the instructions down below.
<br />
<br />
<br />Restart the iPhone or iPad that provides Personal Hotspot and the other device that needs to connect to Personal Hotspot. Make sure that you have the latest version of iOS. On the iPhone or iPad that provides Personal Hotspot, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset, then tap Reset Network Settings
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then you may also try:
<br />-Open Settings App and go to Network &amp; Internet.
<br />-Go to Wi-Fi section and click Manage Wi-Fi settings.
<br />-Scroll down to the Manage known networks, select your Wireless network and click Forget.
<br />-After you've done that, connect to the same wireless network again.
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />Thank you and good luck,
<br />Regards- Irisdiel H.       
        </p>
