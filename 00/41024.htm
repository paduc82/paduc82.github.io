    <title>Fan running non-stop since Windows 10 installation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Fan running non-stop since Windows 10 installation</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro yesterday and ever since then, the fan inside my laptop has been running non-stop. &nbsp;It is loud and annoying. &nbsp;I have updated my Nvidia drivers to the latest version that is designed for Windows 10, but it did not fix the issue.
 &nbsp;Is anyone else having this problem and is there a fix that is in the works for this?

Can you press Ctrl+Shift+Escape together and in the list, see which process is using the most CPU and Disk activity?&nbsp; You can click the column heading up top until the highest ones are listed first to make it easy to identify.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
The processes that are using the most of these could be causing the bottleneck and slow performance, especially if there isn't a lot of Memory available, because then it has to "swap" out to the swap file on the drive, leading to even more bottlenecks.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
If the programs using the most resources aren't items you're using, it's likely one of the following:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Virus scanner running the "first time scan" after installing your new upgrade</span></li><li><span>Search indexing system building up a new index after the upgrade</span></li><li><span>OneDrive/GoogleDrive/OtherOnlineCloudStorageThings re-scanning for any possible changes after the upgrade</span></li><li><span>Windows "deferred tasks" as Gabel Aul calls them (Microsoft General Manager). These are post-install cleanup tasks and other
 optimizations (you may be familiar with that LONG wait after upgrading android where it re-optimizes all the apps).</span></li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
If any of these are busy doing their work, it'll really impact performance. And if more than one happens to be going at once, it really basically drags you down to a crawl.&nbsp; I've honestly advised some users to just set their power options to not go to sleep
 mode, and leave it on overnight to finish all the things like that.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
But that's of course not always the case.&nbsp; If you don't think these above are what's impacting you, or you see other processes causing resource utilization (using CPU/Disk/Memory) that aren't these things, let me know and we'll see if we can identify them and
 what's causing the freeze.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
PS. I'd definitely advise checking for updates from Windows Update and your PC manufacturer's website for the best drivers to use for Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Hi. &nbsp;This has been going on for 3 days now so all the initial install/scan stuff clues don't fit. &nbsp;As far as the processes, you tell me:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71064c34-406e-40c2-9560-73c3bbf69d0d" /></p>
<p>I don't think these numbers are unreasonable. &nbsp;So we are back to square 1; no utilization but the fan is running all of the time. &nbsp;All drivers updated as well. &nbsp;What do you think the next step should be?? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

 site that said to turn off "Show me tips about Windows" (under Settings/System/Notifications &amp; actions). Success!! I can basically turn my laptop fan on and off by sliding this toggle switch -- too funny! I would have never believed it until I tried it. It
 is evidently spiking the CPU utilization, which is obviously affecting battery life as well. Hopefully this will be resolved in a build soon. HTH...</span>

<p>When I turn the switch ON, a process named "Runtime Broker" jumps to the top of the CPU usage list, and it typically is using 18%-22% CPU non-stop. &nbsp;Turn the switch OFF, "Runtime Broker" drops back to 0%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few other processes also spike during the "switch ON" period. &nbsp;"Service Host: Remote Procedure Call (2)", "Service Host: DCOM Server Process Launcher (6)", "Host Process for Windows Tasks", and "Shell Infrastructure Host". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All together, my CPU usage stays at 43%-45% while this switch is ON. &nbsp;Switch it off and all of the above tasks go idle (or disappear) and CPU idles at around 1% usage. &nbsp;HUGE difference.</p>

            <p>Killing the chromes for an hour doesn't do anything. &nbsp;The ONLY thing that has changed is the move from windows 7 to 10. &nbsp;Therefore, I don't think that it is a stretch to blame windows 10 on this.</p>
<p>

            <p>Sort your Task Manager list up there by CPU or Disk access and see what's using the most.&nbsp; Or on the Performance tab you can click "Open Resource Monitor" for even more details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also open your Indexing Options. Unless it says complete, expect your fan to stay on and strong until it's done.&nbsp;It's one of the top things that bring Windows 8.0 onward to its knees for the first 24-48 hours after install. And if you're using the computer
 for actually stuff, it slacks off (still killing performance... just enough to make it take even longer).</p>

            <p>Indexing is complete. &nbsp;Highest utilization by a program is 2% of the CPU. &nbsp;So according to all the values you have suggested, there is nothing that is driving the CPU to run the fan in a manner in which it is taxed and needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To go back to my first point, the upgrade to Windows 10 was the only thing that has changed. &nbsp;This leads me to conclude that there is something wrong within or with the upgrade that is causing this.</p>

<p>Sports games, fighting games, etc? &nbsp;I avoid these games for one reason - I have a very difficult time talking to a new, random person just out of nowhere. &nbsp;It's just kind of awkward, isn't it? &nbsp;I don't know, I'm not antisocial or anything, but I am definitely
 dependent on talking "amongst the crowd," so to speak. &nbsp;I follow the pack in conversation rather than pave the road of it. &nbsp;Anybody else like this? &nbsp;I'm sort of this way in real life but not nearly as bad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's better for me just to have everyone stay as random people. It's why I like forums because while they start to notice you there isn't any relationships being formed.</p>
<p>Thus when I play online I just 'go into battle - fight - go into next battle'. Or 'go into tennis match - play - go to next match'. Any talk is 'gg' or 'so much lag grrr'.</p>

<p>I don't like 1v1 games either, except for maybe fighting games, but I'm not &nbsp;a particularly big fan of those games anyway except for the occasional soul calibur game(and I'll probably end up getting the new MK). I'm just better as playing support on a team,

<p>It's not that difficult, Many of the people I've played games with sent me a message &amp; we got together &amp; played with no problems, no wall of silence between us as we played. &nbsp;It's rather simple to converse with someone who you don't know as long as you are
 respectful. &nbsp;Usually I take the route to ask about other gaming interest &amp; other casual topics or we enjoy talking about the game we're playing. &nbsp;Truth be told i would rather some form of dialogue as opposed to dead silence.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><em>The original post follows....</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>We can't connect a new Win 7 (64-bit) computer to an established ethernet printer in our local "work" network. We've reached the limit of our troubleshooting skills and need some expert help.<br />
<br />
Our Local Network<br />
------------------------<br />
The printer is a Dell 5100cn workgroup laser that is connected via ethernet cable to a Cisco/Linksys 5-port 10/100 workgroup switch. The switch is connected to an integrated Motorola cable modem / 4-port gigabit router / WiFi access point. There is no server
 between the printer and the network.<br />
<br />
The other computers on the network are also running Win 7 and have no trouble seeing and using the printer. Some computers are connected via gigabit ethernet cable to the Motorola router. Other computers connect wirelessly via WiFi (again, via the same Motorola
 device). All computers, including the new one, are assigned to the same workgroup.<br />
<br />
The printer has a static IP address. It also has a built-in webpage that can be accessed within the network via a browser to view the status of the printer. All of the previous computers can view the printer's status webpage by entering its IP address into
 a browser.<br />
<br />
The New Win 7 Computer<br />
--------------------------------<br />
From the Windows command prompt, we've successfully pinged the IP address of the printer and received a return signal. However, we cannot connect to the printer's IP address (and status webpage) with a browser. And we cannot find the printer when we install
 its printer driver. We tried disabling the Windows Firewall and it didn't help.<br />
<br />
When we install the driver, we install it as a "local" printer and create a new "Standard TCP/IP Port" for it. We enter the printer's static IP address and name the port. We set the protocol to "LPR", enter the Queue Name ("lp") and enable SNMP status with
 community name "public" and index "1". These settings have worked fine with our previous computers.
<br />
<br />
When it comes time to "choose the printer" we select "Have Disk..." and use the Dell 64-bit driver for this printer. But it doesn't work and a test page will not print. We've even tried installing the printer driver as a "network" printer but this doesn't work,
 either. Besides, the "local" method always seemed to work best in the past.<br />
<br />
The new computer has no trouble seeing the other computers and devices on the network. For example, there is an NAS connected to the same Cisco/Linksys switch as the printer and the new computer can access the NAS via its static IP address. The new computer
 can also access the internet. It just can't seem to use the printer's IP address. We even tried changing the printer's IP address but that didn't help, either.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that pinging from the command prompt works---the Windows network troubleshooter says that the printer fails to reply. What are we missing? Please help.

            <p><em>Greetings,</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, this will be our final post on this subject. We have discovered the source of the problem and can offer two "fixes" in case someone else runs into the same situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using MSConfig and a process of elimination, we disabled the non-Microsoft services that were running on the computer until we discovered that "Qualcomm Atheros Killer Service V2" was the source of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explanation</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>Our new Win 7 computer contains a Qualcomm Atheros e2200 ethernet/WiFi/Bluetooth communication module. The manufacturer provides a "Killer Network Manager" for this system. Its purpose is to monitor and control the data flow through a network connection
 in order to optimize it. For example, the user can choose to give Program-A a high priority and Program-B a low priority. This insures that Program-A has less lag in its network traffic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary market for this feature, up till now, has been online gaming (hence the "Killer" name). It allows gamers to funnel most of the available bandwidth to their game and away from other programs and services running at the same time. A quicker online
 response gives the gamer the edge he/she needs to get the "kill" before someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bandwidth control system&nbsp;interfered with the returning data packets from our network printer, mucking up communication between our new computer and our printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix 1</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>The easiest solution for us was to disable "Qualcomm Atheros Bandwidth Control" for the ethernet NIC. This was accomplished by going to: Windows Control Panel &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Change adapter settings (in the sidebar).
 Then we right-clicked on our Local Area Connection (our ethernet NIC) and selected the "Properties" command. Finally, under the Networking tab, we
<p>
</p><p>All that was needed after that was a quick reboot and we were able to access our printer even with the Killer Network Manager and its Qualcomm Atheros Killer Service V2 running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, we left the bandwidth control feature enabled for the Wireless Network Connection (our WiFi) since we're not planning on using this network printer when the computer is untethered from ethernet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix 2</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>If you don't want the Killer Network Manager running on your computer, you may be tempted to uninstall it. Don't! Uninstalling it will also uninstall the drivers required for your ethernet, WiFi and possibly your Bluetooth as well. We've heard that some
 users have contacted Qualcomm and been able to coax from them the necessary comm drivers without the "Killer" baggage. But you don't need to do that, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you need to do is: (1) Remove the "Killer Network Manager" from the "'Startup" folder of the Windows Start menu (under "All Programs") and (2) using MSConfig, uncheck "Qualcomm Atheros Killer Service V2" under the "Services" tab. Then reboot and you're
 good to go. The Killer Network Manager and its service will not be running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the reason we didn't choose this method, ourselves, is because we can see merit in having the Killer Network Manager available so we can block network traffic to select programs. Solution 1 makes this an easy matter because bandwidth control
 for ethernet can be quickly enabled again if it is ever desired. And we're leaving it enabled for our WiFi.</p>
<p>

<h2>            My chat history mostly gone after forced update</h2>
                    <p>I avoided updating Skype for ages cause I didn't need to, I just had it to check my old messages, today I got this notification so I guess I was forced to update it?<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eabe8536-444e-4819-a36a-49b37f945bf7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eabe8536-444e-4819-a36a-49b37f945bf7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Now, when I did this and went to check my messages I noticed that anything before around September 2017 was gone. It's not the end of the world or anything, I still have my old main.db file, but I don't understand why this would happen when they were perfectly
 fine prior to the update?</p>

            Hello Tdit.
<br />
<br />It is difficult to say why it happened.
<br />
<br />How the update process is described this should not happen.
<br />
<br />But regarding the community members report, it happens a lot with different scenarios (all data is gone, some data, very old data etc).
<br />
<br />I can suggest to main ideas. First, it is app limitations, second, it is not good developed app (error). In theory in old version all data is saved on your device manually (the devices are different and have different usage history), in this process to move this data from the device to the new app has an issue. Notice, that in new version all data is not saved on your device, it saved in your account.
<br />
<br />For this reason we always should report about the issues to the developers and they improve the service.

<br />
<br />Skype now keeps your synced messages in the Cloud. So, any conversations are accessible across any devices you have running Skype.

            So that's supposed to happen? Old messages are supposed to be gone?<br />
Is there any way to use an old version without getting forced updates? It's much more convenient than using a Skype log reader.

            The conversation history on the classic Skype will not be carried over to the new Skype, you can only view the recent messages in the new Skype. This means that the old conversation history is saved in the classic Skype's folder specifically in the main.db.
<br />
<br />As long as this file is still saved on your device, you should still be able to recover the old messages.

            My issue is that with the update I am no longer able to <strong>export my chat conversation history</strong> for any contact. This is a tremendous loss for me. Is there a workaround alternative for me to export a conversation history? I am using
<strong>version 8.37.0.98 desktop on Windows 10.</strong>

<h2>            Rear 5.1 Speakers Not Working in Sound Configuration Test in Windows 7 x64</h2>
                    Hey... I know that many people have had this issue and I've searched Google and this site but the difference seems to be for them they are getting sound during the Speaker Configuration Test while I am not.<br />
<br />
I just recently put together a new build which the hardware was taken from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/features/pc-buyers-guide-for-gaming-enthusiasts-may-2012.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sharkey Extreme</a><br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 7 x64 on virtually an identical case system other than that my speakers are Logitech z-640 5.1 surround sound.&nbsp; I'm using the Realtek onboard sound.<br />
<br />
Key Points:<br />
<br />
*** The speakers worked fine on my previous build which was using Windows 7 x32 with a Creative Audigy 2 ZS sound card<br />
*** The sub, center, and front LR speakers work fine.<br />
*** I have the wires hooked up correctly and are showing as connected in Realtek HD Audio Manager<br />
*** I have tried the driver supplied by ASRock as well as the newest drivers from Realtek.<br />
*** I have tried the trouble shooter but it didn't find any issues and I don't see any conflicts or exclamation points in the device manager.<br />
*** The speaker configuration is set to 5.1<br />
*** I have tried the speaker fill option.<br />
*** I am seeing movement in the green bar of the Playback device menu for my rear speakers when I do a test.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

            There is no way to only find files where a certain word (or letters) is the first word
<i>inside</i>&nbsp;the file. &nbsp;If that word appears anywhere in the file, it will be found in the search results. &nbsp;Windows has never had the ability to look at only the 1st words of files.

<h3> benoitvm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win7 Resource Monitor&#58; Disk Queue Length charts are gone &#33;</h2>
                    I wanted to troubleshoot disk access for a demanding application, and I just noticed that all but one of the Disk charts no longer appear in the right pane of the Disk page of the Win 7 Resource Monitor ! Only the general Disk chart is there, all the individual
 disk "Queue length" charts have diasppeared !!<br />
I already tried reloading the defaults, logging on as a different account (with admin rights of course), rebooting the machine, etc...no change.<br />
Until recently, the disk charts were all alive and kicking !<br />
The only significant thing that has happened recently is the installation of 15 mandatory and important Feb 2012 Win 7 patches (patch tuesday), including some .Net Framework 4 patches.
<br />
<br />
Why are these charts gone ?<br />
How do I recover them ?<br />
<br />
If a recent update is the cause of this, which one could it be ? (I am reluctant about destabilizing my system and losing a lot of time by trying to uninstall recent updates one by one....)<br />

Found the root cause and solution here:<br />

Just wondering if this registry corruption is really strictly limited to performance counters or if a more general registry corruption is to be suspected (had no suspicious symptoms so far)<br />

<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Anyway, I have an external DVD player (<a href="http://www.lg.com/us/support-product/lg-SP80NB60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this one</a>&nbsp;from LG) for my laptop that's been mostly working up until now. &nbsp;(There were a couple
 times in the past that it wasn't working, but that resolved itself.) &nbsp;It seems to be working fine as far as hardware. &nbsp;It's only a few months old.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Tonight, I tried to play a DVD in it and it wouldn't play it. &nbsp;I tested the DVD Player app (the one from Microsoft) by switching it for VLC. &nbsp;I tested the DVD by switching it out with another. &nbsp;The DVD drive is telling the computer
 that there is a DVD (It appears in File Explorer and the DVD Player app opens automatically.), but nothing is happening. &nbsp;The DVD player continues to attempt to read the disc while the DVD Player app "waits" for the disc to load.</p>

<p>It's probably malware rather than a virus. You could search your scheduled commands for something that launches msconfig.exe, then disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively you could disable ipconfig itself as shown below. Its absence has no effect on the operation of Windows.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cd-rom does not read disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue may happen if the disk is corrupted or if the cd-rom drivers are not properly installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</span></span></span>Have you checked with a <b>

</span></span></span>Have you checked the disk in

<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any
<b>changes</b> on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>

<p>To verify if the issue is with drivers, I would suggest you to refer the site:</p>

<p>I have a similar problem with the PNY Attache 16gb drive. &nbsp;I configured it just fine and copied ALL of my game saves to it. &nbsp;Now the damn Xbox see's the USB drive plugged in, but treats it liked an unconfigured one so I can't use it.</p>
<p>I'm so PISSED. &nbsp;I have 5 years and over 150 worth of game save data on that damn thing, and it seems like I'm up a creek. &nbsp;As a last ditch effort, I paid $60 for EASEUS Data Recovery Wizard software to recover the raw data from my USB drive to my PC, in
 the hopes that I can restore it to a new USB drive. &nbsp;I got the idea from this article:</p>
<p><a href="http://peoplesrepublicof.wordpress.com/2011/01/01/recovering-data-from-xbox-360-usb-memory-stick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">peoplesrepublicof.wordpress.com/.../recovering-data-from-xbox-360-usb-memory-stick</a></p>
<p>Anyway, if this works then I'm going to return the PNY and just order the Xbox certified one. &nbsp;It has been an expensive lesson either way. &nbsp;I'm going to flip if it doesn't work, I have so many games in progress it's going to suck for me</p>
<p>Damn MS! &nbsp;You SUCK!</p>

<h2>            I can no longer just start typing into the computer like before which was extremely handy. One Note and a few other questions</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface 3 and since the upgrade to Windows 10 there seem to be a few issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I can no longer just start typing into the computer like before which was extremely handy.&nbsp; When in doubt, type in the need.&nbsp; I used the corta (spelled wrong)&nbsp; and some of the web links opened up with error codes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; I'm not sure how to split the screen now.&nbsp; I used to be able to watch a video on one side while taking notes on the other.&nbsp; I can't swipe from the right side and quickly back to see all the open programs (LOVED THAT FEATURE!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; One Note will not even open!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I want to like the updated, however so far I'm not sold on Windows 10. I realize it's new and it will take some getting used to, however I felt Windows 8.1 was nicely designed for the Surface.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Anyone have these similar issue and have resolved them?&nbsp; Thanks</p>

            <p>General notes about Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 differences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 there is both the Start menu and the Start Screen.&nbsp; By default, the Start menu is used for desktop/laptop computers, and the Start Screen for tablet/mobile devices (Start Screen can be force on for desktop in Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Personalization
 -&gt; Start, and can be toggled by selecting the "notifications" icon by the clock, and selecting a button for tablet mode).&nbsp; Also for hybrid devices like the Surface, the defaults are Start Menu if the keyboard is connected, and Start Screen if it is disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8.1, if you are not in the desktop you are most likely on the Start screen.&nbsp; When you start typing on the Start Screen it just takes that as a search, and that is what you were doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are in tablet mode with (or just forced Start Screen) Windows 10 will behave the same.</p>
<p>When you are using the Start Menu you can click on the Start Button and then start typing your search.&nbsp; This actually the same as clicking on Cortana's button, and start typing.&nbsp; Cortana is basically search now.&nbsp; If you are looking for an application it
 will find it right away and be at the top of the list, for other things Cortana might answer, or if it doesn't know it will just do a search in your web browser.&nbsp; Personally I think that last one should be configurable, since I can do web searches on my own.&nbsp;
 Most people really are just intending to search their machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On split screen.&nbsp; When in tablet mode it works just like on Windows 8.1 as far as splitting the screen.</p>
<p>In desktop mode since everything is in a window you use snap instead to do basically the same thing.</p>
<p>See this on how to use snap:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Some users refer to Skype name as Skype ID, this is the unique username every Skype user has. &nbsp;You can use the Skype name/ID of a contact to search for him/her on the directory. Way back, users can choose and create what Skype name they would want to use
 but since Skype is a part of Microsoft now, the account creation process has been simplified so new users do not have to go through hoops. Accounts now can be either created using an email address or a phone number.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you created your Skype account using an email address then what you have is a Microsoft account. The Skype ID of your account would depend on your email address, the format would be live: + the first part of your email without its domain. IE. your registered
 email is asdfghj12345@outlook.com then the Skype ID of the account would be
<strong>live:asdfghj12345. </strong>If by chance you created your account using a phone number then your Skype ID would be live: + a combination of random letters and numbers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check the Skype ID of your account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to the Skype website. </li><li>Scroll down and click on Purchase History.</li><li>Your Skype ID would show on the upper left side corner of the scree beside sig out.
</li><li>Or, sign in to the app, then choose any contact that you can send a chat message.
</li><li>Type in <strong>/dumpmsnp </strong>and send it. </li><li>Locate Skype name. </li></ul>

</p><p>Restart the phone a few times and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check for all the updates. Go to Settings and check updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, reset the phone and check. Resetting your Windows phone will return it to the same state it was in the first time you turned it on. All of your personal content will be erased, and the phone will be restored to its factory settings.&nbsp;If
 you decide to reset your phone, you can back up apps, text messages, and more in the cloud beforehand.

<h2>            Windows 10 Download won&#39;t start</h2>
                    I get the pop up in corner daily about upgrading free to Windows 10. &nbsp;I have Windows 8 and finally clicked download and nothing happens. &nbsp;It says my PC is compatible and I click Upgrade now, then the screen disappears and nothing else happens. &nbsp;I've been
 trying for over a week and have not been able to download.

                    I think it may be Malware/Virus/Spyware of some sort.&nbsp; In the last week there was&nbsp;a fraud attempt to&nbsp;use one of my credit card.&nbsp; Maybe this has something to do with this?

            That is exactly what I was talking about and it is normal.&nbsp; If you start Internet Explorer and then do alt tab you will see a small image of the Internet Explorer screen and in the lower right corner of the small image you will see the small "e" icon for
 internet explorer -- that small "e" is not present on the screen when it shows full size -- same thing for the desktop only in case of the desktop it looks like a blue box. I have the same thing and it is consistent with how other applications are displayed
 with a small image + a small icon in the corner.&nbsp; It is not malware.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be a typo (you said regidit instead of regedit)&nbsp;or just not typing enough.&nbsp; Type regedit.exe and it should appear as a program at the top of the list that you can double-click to&nbsp;open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

            Hi, LEEWHITMAN
<br />
<br />Simply press the F8 key without any modifiers. The one with the little camera icon. Pushing the button apparently does some firmware thing on the camera which toggles it as enabled/disabled.

<h2>            Please, Microsoft stop this nonsense &#91;Mod Removed&#93; protection of Xbox&#47;MS gaming app on PC</h2>
                    <p>I don't know why you guys seems to enjoy to make life and gaming harder than it should be. The huge pro of gaming on PC, are modding and editing.</p>
<p>But this is basically impossible with games on Microsoft Store, Xbox app, or whatever you call it.</p>
<p>Years ago, I played a game on MS Store app, and I really hated the file protection that allows you to do nothing with game files.</p>
<p>Now, several years later, nothing is changed.</p>
<p>How can you be so mulish? Steam, Origin, Epic, Uplay. Nobody does this.</p>
<p>I know you can change permissions in Properties-Security, etc...but sometimes works, sometimes not. And some other times, I have to re-do it after a system restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I highly regret to have wasted 1€ on Game Pass. I can assure you I'll never do it again, and I'll never buy other games from your platform.</p>
<p>This is not pc gaming.</p>

            Modding is against the Xbox code of conduct and is not allowed. That's why you can't do it. Playing the game as intended is encouraged. You're basically saying Microsoft is the problem because you can't cheat or alter the game.&nbsp;

<p>You do understand that it's not always about what you can mod but more about the wishes of the developers?&nbsp; While some undoubtedly do enjoy the modding community's work it's also a source of considerable anxiety given the potential adverse effects on a game,
 not to mention the fact that every unauthorised mod adds potential for unintended consequences!</p>

Hotmail does not have Outbox. 


Which e-mail program do you use ? 



Sign in to your e-mail program  find the option that says Work Offline  click it  **** open Outbox  right click at the stuck mail  click Delete. 


Once the stuck mail is deleted, make sure you set the account  back to  Work Online.
