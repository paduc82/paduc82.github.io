<h2>            Does windows 7 support three monitors&#63; What do I need to do to get a continuous desktop across the three monitors&#63;</h2>
                    Hi folks.<br />
<br />
I now have two 1920 X 1200 monitors creating a continuous desktop. <br />
<br />
It would be very helpful for my work if I could have three monitors running from a single system and giving me a continuous desktop. My applications are primarily text-based--Word 2010-- but some are memory intensive, like the reference manager EndNote and
 MindManager.<br />
<br />
Does Windows 7 64-bit support this? What would I have to do in terms of hardware to get it to work well?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
Peter<br />

            <p><span>Hi pccostello,</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 7 will support as many monitors the display adapter supports.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to find graphics card which has three display adaptors, so that you can connect up to three monitors to
 your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Check for the compatibility of the graphics card with Windows 7 from the following link.</span></p>

Eddie b</a>.&nbsp; I solved this problem.&nbsp; My printer is default printer. <br />
&nbsp;How could I solve this problem.<br />
Before I&nbsp; installed driver,&nbsp; I created manual Connection point(port) . I give name it&nbsp; USB001. then&nbsp; I installed driver.&nbsp;&nbsp; so I have a problem. I think while I print it&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows send it My port. So Document is went null port.
<br />
<br />
I removed all Connection port&nbsp; USBXXX(USB001,USB002)&nbsp; Then restarted my computer. I Remove all canon programs and drivers.&nbsp; Then restarted my computer. Then I installed programs and drivers and then&nbsp; My printer is working successfully.Also again . I am sorry

    <title>Surface Pro registered to a business - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cavaughan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro registered to a business</h2>
                    <p>Just bought a new Surface Pro 2 for my daughter and it works great, but I was never able to register it. Today, however, I tried registering through the Surface website and it told me that the device is registered to a business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I bought the device through an Amazon reseller. The device was brand new.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also noticed a similar post where a support rep had sent the questioner information to his account to proceed with the conflict, but that information was not posted in the forum. I'd be interested in knowing what steps I can take.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have written the reseller, but they probably bought these up in bulk from a defunct business or something. There does seem to be a way of calling Surface Support and that they could do something. I tried using the Chat function, but I can't get anywhere
 as I can't register the device. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>Windows Update mess up my registry&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adaw989  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update mess up my registry&#63;</h2>
                    There were about 15 updates yesterday for windows 7. After installing theses I received "this file is not associated with a program.... set in default programs." I could still right click and open the folder but all my folders were out of order and jumbled.
 I restored my computer to Tuesday and all this was corrected. Now there are 15 updates that I am afraid to install because I do not want this to happen again. Also had high pitched frequency coming from speakers until I did the system restore. Can anyone tell
 me which updates to install or not install?

            <p>Ada</p>
<p>My research has revealed no obvious explanation for your problem. However, I will make a number of comment that may help.</p>
<p>The Windows Updates may not be the only updates that have been installed during the time between your System Restore point and you noticed the problem. You should not rule out this possibility. I discovered that Adobe released an update for Flash on 15 February.
 Obviously there could be others.</p>
<p>KB2668562, which&nbsp;relates to Silverlight, was withdrawn by Microsoft. It caused lots of problems for users because it would not install. It installed on this computer but I have not seen any problems. You will not be able to reinstall it until Microsoft reissue
 an amended update.</p>
<p>kb982726 relates to the Outlook Junk Mail folder. The Articles says there are some known issues but that is not to say that they would cause the problem. It does suggest to me that you might put it towards the bottom of the order of installing.</p>
<p>kb2597170 relates to Viseo Viewer. No security implications. No further comments.</p>
<p>kb2597091 relates to Office 2010. Looks to be minor improvements. No security implications.</p>
<p>kb2647516 Cumulative Update for Internet Explorer 9. Looks to be minor improvements. No security implications.</p>
<p>kb2633873 Net Framework Update -This type of update commonly can be difficult to install. Place well down the order for installing.</p>
<p>kb2633870 Net Framework Update -This type of update commonly can be difficult to install. Place well down the order for installing.</p>
<p>kb2645640 Windows 7 Security Update -Install first with kb890830</p>
<p>kb2654428 Windows 7 Security Update -Install second.</p>
<p>kb2660465 Windows 7 Security Update -Install third.</p>
<p>kb890830&nbsp; Malicious malware check -Needs to be first but combine it with kb2645640. It is conceivable that you could have malware so lets do that check first.</p>
<p>kb915597 Windows Defender update. -Install last if at all. In theory Windows Defender should not conflict&nbsp; with Trend Micro Titanium but you will find from a Google search that other have questioned whether it occurs.</p>
<p><span>A lot of problems arise from setting Windows Update to automatically update. You may prefer to change this setting. Select Start, All Programs,
 Windows Update, Change Settings. Under Important Updates is a box showing the current setting. Click on the Arrow down to the right and change the selection to ‚ÄúCheck for Updates but let me choose whether to download and install them‚Äù and click on OK.</span></p>
<p><span>If you encounter problems
 updating or you are not using the Automatic Update you should manually update by selecting Start, All Programs, Windows Update, Check for Updates. Check the boxes before the updates you want to install, click on Install and click again on Install in the next
 window and the process of installing starts. You should let the process proceed without interruption. Multi-tasking at the time updating is in progress is unwise. The progress window will tell you what is going on. You need to be patient.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a number of updates to install break the task of updating into two or more tasks. If you have been
 having problems with Windows Update run Disk CleanUp (or better still cCleaner) and Disk Defragmenter ( or better still Defraggler) before installing any large download.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The process of installing
 updates comprises downloading, installing and configuring the operating system to use the new updates. Some updates require the computer to be restarted and when this occurs configuring occurs as the system is shut down and is completed when the computer is
 restarted. It is important not to interrupt the configuration process as configuration involves making changes to the registry. If interrupted, the result can be a computer that will not boot.</span></span></p>

            <span>1.&nbsp; I purchased the Dell NEW from Staples in Hamilton, NJ on 9/3/15.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; The update was done through Windows update.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp; I suspect no prior versions of Windows&nbsp;are installed because the recovery process seemed to wipe out everything and then was reinstalling Windows 10, when it became stuck at 64% installed.&nbsp; It won't let me do anything. I certainly can't log in to use the
 link you provided.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4.&nbsp; I don't know if this is covered under an anti-virus plan.&nbsp; I have McAfee total coverage and McAfee internet coverage on other laptops, but I don't know if either one is on this one.&nbsp; I suspect not.&nbsp; I haven't used it since September 2015 because I hated
 it so much, (why I'm giving it away) so I probably let any anti-virus policy lapse.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5.&nbsp; I don't remember if I ever ran the McAfee removal tool ever on the notebook.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I appreciate your help.&nbsp; </span>

<p>It sounds like Windows Update is running in the background &amp; attempting to install one or more updates for Windows 10 (or possibly Windows 8.1). If so, you won't be able to "reinstall" Win10 while that's happening.</p>

<p>OK, that option should have restored Windows 8.1, not Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ACTIONS: Disconnect/unplug the usb drive (AKA flash drive; USB key) and just let Windows (whatever version) do it's thing. Leave the computer connected to AC power,&nbsp;leave the battery in its bay (for now), leave the computer connected to the internet &amp; just
 walk away. Let it run overnight, if need be. If and when things settle down, reply to this thread &amp; tell me if Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 is installed now. Again, see...</p>

    <title>Determine whether a Windows 7 computer has Windows 10 upgrade rights - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kdailey6560  say:</h3>
<h2>            Determine whether a Windows 7 computer has Windows 10 upgrade rights</h2>
                    <p>I work for a company that manages hundreds of desktop computers for many companies. We're beginning the push to get all of our users up to Windows 10 since Windows 7 is reaching end of life in January.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm quite certain that many of the computers we manage, which are currently running Windows 7, came with Windows 10 upgrade rights and a product key which is valid for either Windows 7 or Windows 10. However, I'm struggling to find a reliable way to verify
 whether any individual computer has a valid Windows 10 key. In most cases, we don't have the original box or receipt or any documentation that came with the computer. I have serial numbers, etc., but I need a reliable method of knowing whether a computer can
 be upgraded to Windows 10 without having to purchase a new license. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm aware of various software programs available which are capable of displaying the product key which is held in BIOS of OEM computers, but they don't say whether it is a Windows 7 or Windows 10 product key. It's my understanding that if a computer came
 with Windows 10 upgrade rights, then the product key is actually a Windows 10 key, but is valid to activate either Windows 7 or Windows 10. However, some computers may only have a Windows 7 key in BIOS, which is not capable of being activated on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to charge a customer for travel time and onsite labor to upgrade their computer, and then find out the product key in BIOS is only valid for Windows 7. Most computers in recent years don't come with a COA or any external indication whether it
 includes a Windows 10 license. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for being long-winded. I just hope to properly explain my question. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            At this time the free upgrade offer has expired so anyone wishing to upgrade would have to purchase a Windows 10 license.
<br />A Windows 7 key will no longer activate windows 10 either as this too has expired.

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />If you want to Extract OEM (PRE-INSTALLED) Product Key From BIOS and check for if it includes a Windows 10 license. 
<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgBfnVAst3Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgBfnVAst3Q</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZgBfnVAst3Q?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZgBfnVAst3Q?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>
<br />
<br />You need to get Windows 10 license keys for those computers which may only have a Windows 7 key in BIOS.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi kdailey6560 
<br />
<br />The free upgrade period to Windows 10 has lapsed a couple of years ago. So, even if those PC's cane with the option to upgrade to Windows 10, that would now be void.
<br />
<br />It is strange that those PC's did not come with an option to upgrade for free to Windows 8, since that was the next operating system to Windows 8

<p>Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, but I fear I may not have been thorough enough in my question. To illustrate my point, let me give an example. A company purchased an HP ProBook 450 two years ago, and it was marketed one of two ways: either that it had Windows 7 installed
 with Windows 10 upgrade rights, or it had Windows 10 installed with Windows 7 downgrade rights. The bag of accessories that came with these computers included install disks for Windows 7 and also Windows 10, so the end user could choose which they wanted to
 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In actuality, the product key that is stored in the BIOS of that ProBook 450 is a Windows 10 key, but it can also be used to activate Windows 7. This is completely separate from the free Windows 10 upgrade offer. It is completely legal to activate either
 Windows 7 or Windows 10 on that computer, using that key. However, not every HP Windows 7 computer in the world has one of these "dual activation" keys stored in BIOS. I want to find a way to verify if an embedded BIOS product key is capable of activating
 Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, the keys I'm referring to have nothing to do with the free Windows 10 upgrade offer.</p>

<p>I believe you are referring to purchasing the Enterprise edition of Windows? That defeats the purpose of my question, which is to save my customers the $199 cost of purchasing another Windows 10 license if they already own one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of the computers that my customers currently own came with a fully legal and valid Windows 10 product key, so there would be no reason for the customers to spend $199 per computer to purchase a new version of Windows 10. I'm trying to locate those computers
 which already have a valid Windows 10 license.</p>

<h2>            Computer stuck at restart screen after install of &#34;Features Update&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>I came here yesterday looking for answers to the aspect ratio of my webcam through camera app. After finding that the feature was no longer available I saw a new update for my PC and proceeded to install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install went fine until a pop-up prompted to "restart to finish update", which I did - since them the computer has remained on restarting blue screen for the last 7 hours. I have no way to remove the&nbsp; since my PC is a tablet/laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also. . . prior to restarting I could not open anything in the start menu, I had to ctrl/alt/del to restart the computer. (thinking it may have been some sort of delay due to it asking to finish with restart). It also took me nearly 30 mins to type in my
 PW to get to the homescreen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help this is urgent.</p>

<p>Hi Angelica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can happen if your system was corrupted. Since you can't do anything to enter desktop, then we suggest reinstalling Windows using the ISO files through Media Creation tool. Create the installation media using another computer that's working so you can
 perform a Startup Repair to the problematic laptop. Refer to this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to download the ISO file. Click the Download tool now button
 from the link and choose a path where you want to save it. We suggest using an external hard drive to save the installation media.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, connect the flash drive to the laptop you want to repair. Boot your PC until the logo appears to check for boot menu. Usually, its the F12 key. If not, you may refer to the device's user manual to check which key is for the boot menu. Press it
 until the Boot Menu appears, then change boot option to USB. A screen may appear with a message
<strong>Press any key to boot from USB. </strong>Press any key. Set the correct time and keyboard type then click Repair your computer on the lower left corner of the screen. Click
<strong>Troubleshooting &gt; Advanced option &gt; Startup Repair. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If Startup Repair did not work, perform a clean installation of Windows 10. Refer to this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">Forum Article</a></strong> created by

<p>Hey Anne, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding, I want to make sure I have you right AND do a reinstall correctly. One of the issues I am having is that the laptop is only going into sleep&nbsp;mode when I hit the power button&nbsp; - so will this affect my ability to reboot or am I going
 to the user manual like you mention to bypass that?</p>

            If pressing the power button makes the computer enter Sleep mode then let's try checking the settings of the Power Options first.
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the search box, type <strong>control panel</strong> then hit <strong>Enter.</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> then click <strong>Power Options.</strong></li><li>On the left panel, select <strong>Choose what the power buttons do.</strong></li><li>Under Power and sleep buttons settings, check if it is set to <strong>Sleep</strong> when power button is pressed.</li></ol>

    <title>Device Manager crashes while enumerating devices, wmiprvse.exe fault - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fpbear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Device Manager crashes while enumerating devices, wmiprvse.exe fault in event log</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 from 7, everything is working fine except when I go to the Device Manager, about half the time Device Manager will crash with "Microsoft Management Console has stopped working."&nbsp; Even when Device Manager normally completes the&nbsp;listing
 of all devices (which are all normal status), it always takes longer than usual to come up with the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I noticed in the Windows Application event log the following error, which seems related:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulting module name: ntdll.dll, version: 10.0.10586.122, time stamp: 0x56cc16f5<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000005<br />
Fault offset: 0x0004dab3<br />
Faulting process id: 0x2784<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01d1985f10eab59c<br />
Faulting application path: C:\WINDOWS\sysWOW64\wbem\wmiprvse.exe<br />
Faulting module path: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll<br />
Report Id: 2d74c552-3a7d-4614-a228-b410c8c318fb</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read someone's post&nbsp;stating&nbsp;that this event log entry occurs "when you use the WMI interface to query the hardware status on a computer that supports the IPMI standard."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I&nbsp;making the right connection between the Device Manager enumeration and the wmiprvse.exe fault?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a hotfix for Windows Server 2008, but is there a fix for Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2280777</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run sfc /scannow the results are normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when I run <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth&nbsp;the results here are normal too.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see a reason to do a clean install of Windows 10 (and spend all that time re-installing my applications) because everything else is working great.&nbsp; I would just like to fix this Device Manager crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused, I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for mentioning the steps you have tried to resolve the issue, we appreciate your effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Clean Boot</strong></p>
<span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">How to Perform a Clean Boot?</span></strong></a><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" to reset computer as usual.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2: System Maintenance troubleshooter </strong></span></span></p>
<p>Outdated or incompatible drivers could also cause the device manager to crash. If you recently upgraded to
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, it's possible that the current driver was designed for a previous version of Windows. Check to see if there are available driver updates. Follow the steps given in the help article on
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-freezing/d223c619-d802-4f27-90d9-8a3310ce9dfd"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">How to update drivers</span></a>.</strong></p>
<p>In addition, run the system maintenance troubleshooter and check if it helps. System Maintenance troubleshooter looks for unused files and shortcuts that you can clean up or remove so that your computer can run faster.
</p>
<p><span>1. Press <strong>Windows Key + R </strong>to open the run command.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Type <strong>control </strong>and press <strong>enter </strong>
to open control panel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the control panel search box and open it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Click "<strong>view all</strong>" on the left pane.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Run the <strong>system maintenance </strong>troubleshooter and follow the on-screen instructions.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3: Repair Upgrade</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue continues, </span></span>I would suggest you to try performing a repair upgrade using an installation media and check if it helps. Repair upgrade is done when the system starts causing different problems. It will not remove or delete
 any files. Refer the steps given be Andre Da Costa on <strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">How
 to: perform a repair upgrade using the Windows 10 ISO file</span></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: Repair upgrade will not delete your files or data. Choose the option to "keep all files" during the upgrade.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result.</p>

            <p>Also, it may help to see all the modules that are loaded during a crash.</p>
<p>

            <p>Looks like you are having a similar issue as in the following topic:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/device-manager-error-microsoft-management-console/09142dcd-b5ef-40b9-b917-0133146d581c?page=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/device-manager-error-microsoft-management-console/09142dcd-b5ef-40b9-b917-0133146d581c?page=1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In that topic is a suggestion to obtain a user mode dump of the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A user mode dump would give any "unloaded" modules that may be problematic.</p>

<p>Hi Myra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are unable to access <span>Microsoft Solitaire game in Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the <strong>Microsoft Solitaire Collection</strong> and check if it resolves the issue. Here's how:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then select <strong>All apps
</strong>to see a list of all your applications.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Locate the <strong>Microsoft Solitaire Collection</strong> app icon, right-click the icon, and then click
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Press the <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>R</strong>, or
<strong>right click </strong>on <strong>Start</strong> and select <strong>Run</strong> to open the
<strong>Run</strong> window. </p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Type <strong>wsreset</strong> in the <strong>Run</strong> window, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. </p>
<p>The Windows Store opens and displays the following message: <br />
<strong>The cache for the store was cleared. You can now browse the store for apps.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> In the search bar at the right, type <strong>Microsoft Solitaire Collection</strong> and install the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply and suggestions, Jenith. But, I am referring to neither the application tiles in the Start menu nor the desktop icons, but the application windows themselves.</p>

    <title>PC keeps crashing after installing Win 7 x64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan2012  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC keeps crashing after installing Win 7 x64</h2>
                    Just built a new computer. I have installed 2 different versions of Win 7 x64 and both have experienced the same problem. I originally thought the problem was due to a bad OS install disk so I sent the first one back and got a new one.
<br />
<br />
I've included below the long list event details of the errors I am getting. You can see from the event info that the errors occur immediately after install and force the computer to crash in less than 10 minutes time.
<br />
<br />
I'm beginning to think it is a hardware issue but not sure where the problem is as all the hardware except the GPU and Wireless card are brand new. My hardware setup is listed in my signature.
<br />
<br />
I've run diagnostic checks on the memory using the Win 7 install disk but nothing comes up.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!! <br />

            I installed the Mobo Chipset &amp; LAN drivers as well as the Wireless Card drivers.<br />
I had to System Restore after I kept getting Win32 errors from the Wireless Card.<br />
<br />
Here is the updated list of errors:<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />
<br />
ust built a new computer. I have installed 2 different versions of Win 7 x64 and both have experienced the same problem. I originally thought the problem was due to a bad OS install disk so I sent the first one back and got a new one.
<br />
<br />
I've included below the long list event details of the errors I am getting. You can see from the event info that the errors occur immediately after install and force the computer to crash in less than 10 minutes time.
<br />
<br />
I'm beginning to think it is a hardware issue but not sure where the problem is as all the hardware except the GPU and Wireless card are brand new. My hardware setup is listed in my signature.
<br />
<br />
I've run diagnostic checks on the memory using the Win 7 install disk but nothing comes up.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!! <br />

            <p>Hi Louise,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Windows cannot find the network printer and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you trying to setup the network printer for the first time?</li><li>If not, do you remember making any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li><li>Is your computer connected to domain?</li><li>Are you able to find and connect to other wireless&nbsp;devices on a network?</li></ul>
<p>There could be several reasons for this cause and to diagnose the issue, let's try the following steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the printer is connected to a home network, let‚Äôs check if both <strong>network sharing
</strong>and <strong>network discovery </strong>are turned on to make the wireless printer visible on the laptop. Refer to the link to check for the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/turn-sharing-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Turn sharing on or off</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To further troubleshoot the issue, you can follow the methods:<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>You can refer to the link to check and diagnose such issues when Windows is not able to find other devices:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why isn't Windows finding my device?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><strong>Method 2:&nbsp;</strong>Some older network printers might require additional information to complete the setup, and won‚Äôt appear in the list when you choose ‚Äú<strong>Add a device</strong>‚Äù. Check the manufacturer instructions for your device to see if
 there‚Äôs an option to turn on web services, which should automatically install your printer once it is turned on. If your printer doesn‚Äôt have that option, find the instructions to discover the printer‚Äôs IP address. You‚Äôll need this for advanced printer setup.
 You can refer to the link to do so:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Follow the section ‚Äú<strong>Advanced printer setup</strong>‚Äù from the article below.</p>

<p>i recently bought an xbox1 slim,whenever i put in a blu ray disc i get the following error code:<br />
<br />
' 0x91d7000a ."Disc stopped. Make sure your TV's HDMI input supports HDCP rights management. If not, try plugging your Xbox into a different TV input"0x91d7000a '<br />
i tried a reboot as suggested by xbox support and another hdmi input.neither worked<br />
<br />
despite the error the blu-ray proceeds to play after the message dissappears,it just annoys me that the message appears everytime .'</p>

            <p>Heya rogue avulsed.</p>
<p>To check, are you plugging your Xbox One directly into your television or is there a device between the two? If there's a device I recommend trying a direct connection. Also, if you have a different HDMI cable give that a try as well :) Let us know how it goes. </p>

 before it does, a line pops up in small text saying: "If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: DRIVER VIOLATION", the screen then appears to restart. Then opening ACER screen appears with a loading circle saying: "Preparing Automatic

Be sure to check with the System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom<br />
systems), their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums (if any)<br />
about any known issues. Be sure to update the<strong> BIOS, low level chipset drivers,
<br />
and the other major on-board and separate device drivers</strong>. Those alone may
<br />
resolve some or all of these issues.<br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings<br />
as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using <strong>
Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop <br />

                    <p>These two applets are in different places, the first in the new <em>Settings</em> environment, the second in the old Control Panel under
<em>Programs &amp; features</em>. They were both largely wiped clean by the Creators Update, so I would expect them now to show the same content, but they don't. Why not? And which is the right one?<br />

            Hi , this is Andre from the Microsoft Community. 

Lets see if we can get your problem resolved.

Update history is still a work in progress and its experiencing some growing pains at this time, ie. that bug that wiped out your update history. Hopefully it gets better over time. 

Best,

    <title>windows 10 mouse and trackpad sensitivity issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mournfulbliss  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 mouse and trackpad sensitivity issues</h2>
                    <p>Ever since upgrading to windows 10 yesterday 7/29/15, I have been unable to use my mouse and trackpad on my asus laptop like I was able to before this update. For example, when I click something the mouse automatically moves itself to something I did not
 click and opens something completely different. My trackpad will click something when I never pressed my finger to click anything. It will move windows with the lightest of touches. This is INFURIATING because my mouse and trackpad was set to respond to the
 way I type and click for YEARS and suddenly everything is SO SUPER sensitive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone to settings &gt; additional mouse settings &gt; pointer options...and turned off the precision.
</p>
<p>I've turned off the snap-to options, and no matter how many times I try to change the speed of my mouse, it is either way too fast, or too slow. My trackpad options, I've used all of them. Long delay, medium delay....etc. I cannot get my trackpad on my laptop
 to respond like it did before I updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I never updated. </p>

    <title>How to disable autoreboot after updates&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikopietik&#228;inen  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to disable autoreboot after updates&#63;</h2>
                    <p>One of the most frustrating features of Windows 10 home is that it reboots automatically after installing updates. This "feature" has several times destroyed the work that I was in the middle of. So is there any tricks to disable the autoreboot and go back
 to the old way so that the windows installs the updates and waits as long for the reboot as I give the permission? Before anniversary update I was able to disable the autoreboot with group policy editor, but this was disabled in anniversary update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I'm not alone with my frustration as I have read tons of articles and forums about this same problem. So far I haven't found any solid solution for this problem.</p>

                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Maxtor external HD was crashed 2 years ago. All the files saved in that hard Disk was through my company old Notebook running on Window XP then.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently managed to get a shop to recovery the files in the HD for me. However, they cannot read the files because they are encrypted. The old notebook was no longer available as I had changed to a new notebook then.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There are some important photos that I need to recover. Please advise what I could do.</div>

<div>Thanks and regards</div>

            If you encrypted the files using Windows Encrypting File System (foolishly, IMO, included by Microsoft with Windows XP Pro), you're out of luck.&nbsp; EFS is often called the "Delayed Recycle Bin" -- because it's just a matter of time until files encrypted
 using this system become unrecoverable (unless you have followed MS's <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/223316/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Best Practices for EFS</a>).<br />

Although there is one company that I know of that claims to be able to decrypt EFS-encrypted files, it's my understanding that this requires access to the system disk of the computer that encrypted the files and not just a collection of encrypted files on an
 external disk, such as your situation.&nbsp; You could ask them --&gt; <a href="http://elcomsoft.com/aefsdr.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://elcomsoft.com/aefsdr.html</a> <br />
<br />
You could also inquire at the professional data recovery specialists, such as <a href="http://www.krollontrack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Kroll OnTrack</a> and <a href="http://www.drivesaversdatarecovery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DriveSavers</a>, but IF those companies have the ability to recover EFS-encrypted files AND IF the use of that ability is not limited to law enforcement clients, it will cost you -- a lot.<br />
<br />
Your best bet is to find that old notebook and hope that its hard drive is still intact.<br />

</a><br />
<br />
The answer is probably the same if you used a different method of encryption (and similarly failed to save the credentials necessary to decrypt the files).&nbsp; See, e.g., this comment from
<a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TrueCrypt</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><b>I forgot my password ‚Äì is there any way ('backdoor') to recover the files from my TrueCrypt volume?</b>
<p>We have not implemented any 'backdoor' in TrueCrypt (and will never implement any even if asked to do so by a government agency), because it would defeat the purpose of the software. TrueCrypt does not allow decryption of data without knowing the correct
 password or key. We cannot recover your data because we do not know and cannot determine the password you chose or the key you generated using TrueCrypt. If you follow the security requirements listed in
<a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/security-requirements-and-precautions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a> chapter of the documentation, then (to our best knowledge) the only way to recover your files is to try to "crack" the password or the key, but it could take thousands or
 millions of years (depending on the length and quality of the password or keyfiles, on the software/hardware performance, algorithms, and other factors). If you find this hard to believe, consider the fact that
<a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=g1.globo.com/English/noticia/2010/06/not-even-fbi-can-de-crypt-files-daniel-dantas.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
even the FBI was not able to decrypt a TrueCrypt volume after a year of trying</a>.</p>

<h2>            My Important and frequently used files were deleted on Genuine Windows 10 and Office 2007</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using licensed Windows 10 with office 2007. I have McAfee (licensed)&nbsp; and Windows Defender running. I was working on these files for last two weeks. One fine day I restarted my system ( instead of sleep /wakeup), when I found that one entire folder
 containing my important files was gone. It was not even in the Recycle bin. I scanned my system and some how recovered my files from other resources, but then today I was missing another important file. This time it was in the recycle bin. After recovering
 the file from there, it doesnt open, says that either file is damaged or I dont have permission. This all started happening in last 10 days . I have installed some microsoft&nbsp;updates in this time and no other software is installed, lately. The only thing that
 somewhat got fuzzy is that I ran out of battery once or twice but my system was never improperly&nbsp;shutdown until I turned it off explicitly. I am wondering what went wrong.</p>
<p>Please note that I am an expert computer user and quite familiar with backup - recovery, antivirus, system crash , etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Saneeha</p>

<p>Will xbox one ever support 1360x768? cause my tv is 1360x768, and i tested, 720p and 1080p looks really bad on my 360, but as soon as i change it to 1360x768, it looked so much different, and better, just wondering if 1360x768 will come to xbox one or not.</p>

<p>1360x768 is 720p, you're upscaling it to 1080p on a 720p output TV, that's why it's looking horrible. In order to get a 1080p resolution looking good, you need a TV that has a native resolution of 1080p.</p>

<p>I'd like to know the same thing. That 1:1 pixel ratio I get with 1360x768 on my Xbox 360 and PC looks so much better than 720p (1280x720). I hated not having the option with my PS3 and now it really sucks not being able to run my One at my tv's native.</p>

<p>Same thing here. I'm looking to upgrade to a 1080p TV in the near future, but this would be great for people who can't afford to buy a $500 Xbox and a $200-$300 TV at the same time.</p>

<p>Come on Microsoft. I've we have had this on here for around 3 months now and there has been no reply or help from you. Please put a 1360x768 option on the Xbox One so your consumers and fans can get the best experience possible. Thank you.</p>

<p>I bought it about 1year ago, its a 19inch samsung, the picture is AMAZING for my 360, but XBOX ONE look very bad with the same tv, i swear to god, i honestly thought games look better on the 360 than it is on the ONE, and i have games like bf4,forza 5 on
 the X1, though RYSE does looks really stunning on my 46inch tv in my living room.</p>
