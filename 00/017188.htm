<h2>            How to recover a deleted section in Onenote 2013 on Microsoft Surface3</h2>
                    HELP......Have accidentally deleted an entire section in my Onenote program on my Surface 3. Have not found a way to recover this. Any help would be fantastic as I have lost over 50 files that were in this section

            <p>Deleted sections are moved to the recycling bin of the notebook (every notebook got its own one) where they stay for 60 days. You access it via the History Menu. It looks like a notebook of its own, containing all deleted sections and pages. You can restore
 them using the right mouse button and the move function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not find your deleted sections in the recycling bin, there is a last hope:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are lucky there should be a local backup of your notes, even if your notebook is stored on OneDrive. Bad news is: If you never changed the default backup settings in OneNote 2013 the last backup could be up one week old.</p>
<p>In the default setting OneNote 2013 is saving up to two backups under&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;your_username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneNote\15.0\Backup</p>
<p>(I am not quite sure about the last part of that path being named "Backup" cause I am using the german version. Should be at least very similar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can open it from OneNote 2013 by clicking on "File". In the Information section (which shows all recent opened notebooks) on the top right you should see a button named something like "Open Backups". This may lead you to backup versions of your notebooks,
 organized in folders which contain .one files which represent the sections. They are opened in a special section where you can review them and copy them to the right noteboks if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also would strongly recommend to change the backup settings. You find it under options - Saving and Backups in the top area. Maybe change the backup folder to a place on another drive and the backup frequency to 2 or 3 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

Even though I set the sync options to "only sync 2 weeks old and future", the device syncs ALL recurring appointments. Some of them going back for many years. This (of course) uses a ton of memory and causes Outlook Mobile to run extremely slow.<br />

Any ideas?<br />

<p>In fact when you create a reoccuring appointment, it is scheduled to go for several lifetimes.&nbsp; The suggestion is to put an end date that is reasonable.&nbsp; Likewise, it might well be a good idea to re-create appointments on a set schedule if memory is an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This might well be something for you to look at:</p>

<p><br />
Short answer: You can't - not directly from a PDF file</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You would need to create a file (text CSV / Excel etc) where each contact is contained on a single line. If a CSV file, each field needs to be separated by a comma. To avoid problems with fields that may contain "multi-line" data (i.e. street address, notes
 etc) - the data in the field should be "qualified" with a double quote character before and after the data (not required if creating the data in Excel). The first row should also contain the field names for each column/field the follows.

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>When viewing the open pdf file, all the fields appear separated in a list underneath the field names with each contact on a separate line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to import it into g@#gle sheets however, it recognizes each separate line of contact data but puts all the data for each contact in the first field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pdf file is here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.dps.texas.gov/RSD/TexasMetalsProgram/documents/mreListCityLocName1708.pdf<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been tempted to switch over to outlook from Act for Windows anyway, but wouldn't do it right now unless it would fix this problem. I'll bet there's a remedy using sheets, but it may involve a lot of work? There are 700 contacts.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Original reply still stands - convert the PDF file to a text file. Outlook requires a CSV file so you would need to open the text file in Excel and save it as a CSV file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the issue with each separate line ending up into the first field is purely because whatever import process you're using is expecting a CSV file which requires a comma as a field delimiter - have never imported anything into google sheets so have so
 idea what options you have in terms of opening a PDF file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't a Windows related problem - purely a data structure issue and PDF files are seldom, if ever, used as an import data source. Even when you convert the pdf file to text file, you will have to clean it up by eliminating the extraneous titles but
 be sure to leave the "header row" containing the column names.</p>

<h2>            Adding a hyperlink cuts off the link.</h2>
                    <p>I tried to add a hyperlink to a word. I paste a http link that is 4 lines long. I click OK and check the link and it is cut off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens in word and excel. Why limit the length of hyperlink? there are many links that are just long and can not be shorter.&nbsp;</p>

                    I shut Skype down on my laptop and left it for a few hours, when I tried to open Skype again and log in it said "We can't open Skype. You are already signed in on the computer. Please sign out and try again" The problem is I don't know how to sign out,
 there's no button or thing telling you how to do it. Does anyone know how to fix this or had this happen to them?

                    <p>I've been trying to get used to the new Outlook365. Some nice changes (I especially appreciate having the attachments available at the top).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I reply to a message and want to DRAG an alias between the TO, CC or BCC fi!elds, it doesn't let me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I flip back to old Outlook, it works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same problem if I just create a new message and put someone in one field, can't drag to another.<br />

    <title>Can I set the password when resetting user passwords instead of it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I set the password when resetting user passwords instead of it choosing a random password&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We just set up O365 in our org and I was able to bulk import all of my users but when their accounts were created the email with their temporary password never went out. &nbsp;I'd like to be able to reset all of their passwords to the same thing and set the flag
 to force them to change it at first login but I don't know if this is an option. &nbsp;Whenever I do a password reset it is always set to a random value. &nbsp;</p>

<p>hi jeremydunn,</p>
<p>when we reset user's password from the office 365 portal gui, we can only reset the password to a random value.</p>
<p>however, to bulk reset users' passwords and force them to update their passwords at the first login, we can get this done by using powershell.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;install office 365 sign-in assistant<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">microsoft online services sign-in assistant for it professionals rtw</span></a></p>
<p>2. install office 365powershell<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj151815.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">windows azure active directory module for windows powershell</span></a></p>
<p>3. right click the “azure ad module for windows powershell” and choose “run as administrator”.</p>
<p>1) i in the command prompt window, type in "<strong>connect-msolservice</strong>", press enter, then enter your office 365 administrator username and password in the pop-up dialog and click ok.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>2) generating csv file based on the online user</p>
<p><strong>get-msoluser | select userprincipalname|export-csv c:\users\password.csv<br />
<br />
</strong></p>
<p>3) before we move on to the next command, be sure to review the csv file and remove the users from the list that you do not want to reset passwords for.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>setting the same password for each user in the file and force an update via first login.<br />
<strong>import-csv c:\users\password.csv|%{set-msoluserpassword -userprincipalname $_.userprincipalname -newpassword user@1234 -forcechangepassword $true}<br />
<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>the whole process for your reference:<br />

<p>Hi Darrennewland,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, could you share with us the following info?</p>
<p>1. Do you install the EndNote app or EndNote add-in for Word? </p>
<p>2. Could you capture some screenshots for "document is now weird"? You could capture screenshots from existing old document and new document.
</p>
<p>3. Are all affected documents save in cloud storage (I noticed you mention "from web")?
</p>
<p>4. Click Word/Apple icon on the top bar&gt;About Word/About This Mac&gt;let us know versions of your Mac OS and Office suite.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

</p><p>When you click a hyperlink on a webpage or in an email message, nothing happens. Internet Explorer does not open the webpage, this can happen for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The setting where you choose what web browser that you want to use is corrupted. This can cause Windows to misinterpret which browser is set as the default browser on your computer.</li><li>After software was installed, settings were changed, which can cause links to webpages to work incorrectly.</li><li>A previously installed browser or add-in might be interfering with other software on your computer.</li><li>Registry keys were changed or became corrupted.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As the first step of troubleshooting, y<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>ou can try unblocking the hyperlinks and check if it resolves the issue.

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow the steps:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Check if you are able to find an option “<strong>Show content</strong>”. If yes, click on it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>b) If that does not work, click on Hyperlink and you will find “Unblock” option popping up. Click on it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c) Choose <strong>Allow once.
</strong>If you trust the hyperlinks that you receive on these emails, you can choose the other option.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Check if it fixes the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p>

<p>Hi Sartaj,</p>
<p>I would like to confirm a few things to know the situation better.</p>
<p>1. Could you see the same behavior if you click on the OneDrive at the app launcher?</p>
<p>2. Based on your mentioning "I can access the sharepoint site if type in the url", are you currently able to, through URL, access https://<em>organization</em>-my.sharepoint.com or https://<em>organization</em>.sharepoint.com?</p>
<p>And, please do the follows and let us know the results</p>
<p>a. Go to SharePoint admin center &gt; user profiles tab &gt; under People, Manage User Permissions.</p>
<p>b. Check whether <strong>Everyone except external users</strong> is listed. Add it if not</p>
<p>c. At the below Permissions for Everyone except external users, confirm to make sure&nbsp;ALL options are ticked and OK.</p>
<p>Feel free to post back at any time and we may discuss the situation further.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Rene</p>

<p>Hi Sartaj,</p>
<p>It seems that most of the apps in App Launcher are affected. To eliminate potential influence, please try clearing App Laucher cache:<br />
Go to https://<em>tenant</em>.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/clearlocalcache.aspx and https://<em>tenant</em>-my.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/clearlocalcache.aspx to clear App Launcher session caches.</p>
<p>Note: You will see a page showing “<em>This is a page for clearing localStorage and sessionStorage caches</em>”, it indicates that the clearing cache process is processing in the background, there is no dedicated menu option and progress bar here.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for the Exchange Online issue you mentioned above in 1A), 1B) and 1C), could you capture some relevant screenshots to clarify the situation?<br />
Note: To insert a screenshot, please click on Use rich formatting and select the Insert Image icon.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

<h2>            how to run internet explorer 10 64 bit in windows 8 64 bit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have already followed descriptions of the problem by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>step 1: I have go to the 64 bit program files internet explorer folder and when I run the iexplorer.exe, it is still run 32 bit not 64 bit version.</p>
<p>step 2: I have checked the security tab in the internet options and where I am supposed to find a check box for Enable 64-bit internet explorer, but the check box does not appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running windows 8 64 bit, I want to run internet explorer 64 bit, but all the references I have read are all inconclusive, because, in both locations of the c:\program files (x86) and c:\program files where I am supposed to find 32 bit version and 64
 bit version both run 32 bit version of internet explorer 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the big tamely question here is: how to run and/or enable 64 bit&nbsp;mode of internet explorer 10?&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>In Windows 8, there are <u>no longer two separate browser options</u> that can be selected from the start menu, as was the case in Windows 7.&nbsp; However, the browser still retains both its 32-bit and 64-bit modes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;To choose which mode to use, you will have to take a different approach.&nbsp; Enabling/disabling it is associated with<strong> security zones</strong>, just the way the security settings and Protected Mode are. This means you can use the 32-bit mode&nbsp;on trusted
 sites for maximum<strong> compatibility</strong>, and the 64-bit mode&nbsp;on untrusted sites for maximum<strong> security</strong>.&nbsp; But, understand that running in 64-bit mode will slow down your browsing&nbsp;speed considerably, and can cause a number of other problems,
 such as the inability of a website to open properly&nbsp; (many sites will only open in 32-bit, and many add-ons are 32-bit).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 32-bit browser is the default.&nbsp; It operates with only "Protected Mode" enabled.&nbsp; The 64-bit browser requires both "Protected Mode"<u> and</u>
<strong>"Enhanced</strong> Protected Mode" enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:<br />
Notice that the "about IE10" is the same whether you open iexplorer.exe from the "Program Files" or "Program Files (x86)" location. &nbsp;No mention of 32-bit or 64-bit like it used to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a004727-fec3-4a77-be51-bd51f379a61e" /></p>
<p><br />
1. To select the 64-bit browser mode................Open Internet Options.</p>
<p><br />
2. Click on the Advanced tab, scroll down to the Security section. Turn on "Enable
<strong>Enhanced </strong>Protected Mode"&nbsp;and you&nbsp;have enabled the<strong>&nbsp;64-bit browser</strong> in IE10, Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/51f3fb11-c4a2-4f55-b9f3-3b48260674fa" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;3. Then...open the Security tab . </p>
<p>If not already checked, select the "Enable Protected Mode" box for the Internet zone. (this box is usually checked by default).

Click APPLY.... OK. to set the IE10<strong> 64-bit browser for the Security Zone..</strong></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>4&nbsp;To&nbsp;set the <strong>32-bit browser for the security zone,</strong> simply UNCHECK&nbsp; "Enable Enhanced Protected Mode" in Step 2.</p>
<p>Click APPLY..&nbsp; OK.</p>

<p>5.<strong> Restart the computer</strong> when you change the browser mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have chosen your preferred settings for all the security zones, simply restart Internet Explorer. You will now be able to browse the zones in the corresponding 32-bit or 64-bit modes. This new method seems to be a welcome change considering it removes
 the necessity of having two versions of the same browser installed while still granting access to both versions.</p>

                    Hello, we have a Domain A of a forest B and we have a new domain C in a new forest D. We have migrated 200 mailboxes a office 365 of domain A from a total of 3500 mailboxes of Exchange 2010. We want to migrate the 200 domain users of A with mailbox Migrated
 to Office 365 to the new domain C. We will migrate them with ADMT. But how do we connect the mailboxes to Office 365? A cordial greeting.

<p>Hi Babiano,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better help you, may I know how you migrated the 200 mailboxes of domain A in forest B to Office 365, Staged migration or Hybrid move?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Hybrid move, you can move the 200 migrated mailboxes to Office 365 back to forest B. After that, you can use ADMT to move them to domain C in forest D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Staged Migration, you can consider to configure a Hybrid between your forest B and Office 365. After that, you can move the 200 mailboxed back to forest B. Then you can use ADMT to move them to domain C in forest D.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alan</p>

<p>I delete the name of the contact in a Distribution List (DLs) but it still shows up when I use the DL to send an e-mail. I notice that when I put the first part of the name in the To: field of an e-mail that DLs with the same start to their names show up
 even though they have been deleted. Any ideas how to fix this?</p>

            Select the dl name in the autocomplete list (use the arow key) and press Del. The next time you use the DL, it will use the copy in the Contacts folder and all should be well.

    <title>Windows 8.1 firewall blocking paypal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xafairmont  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 firewall blocking paypal</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>After lengthy discussions with Paypal &amp; my internet provider we have figured that the window firewall is stopping access to the paypal website (not just the logon). I have tried both firefox &amp; internet explorer, the only thing that allows access is tuning
 off the firewall. Is there a way to allow a website through the firewall while leaving the firewall on as I cannot see a simple way?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Yes, you can allow a program through the firewall, but that defeats the purpose of a firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your security settings are probably too high and you are blocking<em> everything
</em>from entering your computer.&nbsp; Try adding PayPal.com to your list of "Trusted Sites" and see if that fixes anything....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open PayPal.com on the Desktop</p>
<p>Select "Tools</p>
<p>Internet Options</p>
<p>Security (tab)</p>
<p>Trusted Sites (green check mark)</p>
<p>Sites (button)</p>
<p>PayPal.com should already be in the box.....just click Add</p>
<p>Select "Close"</p>
<p>Select "Reset all zones to default level"&nbsp; (medium)</p>
<p>Click APPLY</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then&nbsp;&nbsp; click the "Advanced" tab</p>
<p>scroll down in the box to the Security sub-category</p>
<p>UNCHECK the box "Enable Enhanced protected mode"</p>
<p>Click APPLY, OK</p>

            <p>I'm having the same issue on Win7 Pro 64bit. Don't know what it is but I can open every website except Paypal. The only way for me to access Paypal is to turn off Windows firewall. I've tried all the suggestions here but still can't open it. Never used to
 be an issue but since I recently did a clean install and installing all the Windows Updates (with the firewall off so Windows update would work, a whole other story) I can't get onto Paypal while the firewall is on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm clean of viruses and malware</p>
<p>I've deactivated my Trend antivirus</p>
<p>I've tried IE and Chrome</p>
<p>
</p><p>No success. Surely this can't be hard to fix.</p>

            <p>on my windows 7,&nbsp; access to paypal.com was blocked and windows update was NOT working as long as windows firewall was on.&nbsp; This made me crazzy.<br />
Solution to let "windows update" work : go to control panel &gt; programs &gt; microsoft .NET framework 4.x, do a right click and repair, then restart computer.</p>
<p>But paypal is still NOT working</p>

<p>
</p><p>Will be our Windows19H1 installation revert back, to previous/last oficial build 1809 - if we logout from Windows Insider Program?</p>
<p>Or not, and our pc will hold last installed version Windows19H1 after logout from Insider Program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Big thanks for everybody who give answer on this question.</p>

<p>Hi biohaz55,thanks for info.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Last two additional questions on Insider Program:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*<br />
And if we for example today upgrade on 19H1 and tommorow logout from insider, so after microsoft release 19H1 to public - so we will be receiving updates etc. for standart oficial public version 19H1? or our pc will stuck with Slow Ring releases?</p>
<p>
</p><p>*<br />
Exist somewhere on microsoft site changelog/information - which version windows will be as next in insider channels? preview, slow, fast</p>
<p>For our information in which time we must switch our channel, or logout from insider, or again login into insider<br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you opt-out of Insider program you start getting CU's for Windows v1903 (19H1) and you arfe not member in any insider ring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>* exist somewhere on microsoft website where is wrote information which version windows will be in next months in Previous or Slow or Fast rings? for our info, which we must switch on different roads.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>At the moment we don't have information which builds MS will start release for users in Slow ring (19H2?).</span></p>
<p><span>Fast Ring users are getting previews of 20H1 which will be released to public in spring 2020.</span></p>
