<h2>            WP8 Backups Really Old</h2>
                    <p>Ok all, after 2 1/2 years and over 100 Drops I finally crack the screen on my beloved N920. I picked up a replace 920 for $30 (I am heavily vested in 920 Accessories).
<br />
<br />
I Rebuild the new phone, sign in, and it shows me my back ups. There are only 2 backups listed and both are&nbsp;2 years old. I switched my sim back to my old one, verified that ALL the backup features where turned on, let it sit over night.&nbsp; Next day I&nbsp;then switched
 sim back to the new one. Sadly, it was the same restore points from 2 years ago.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Anyone know how I how I can a restore point from Today? </p>

    <title>Conditional Formatting - Open Office concept not translating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vincent876  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional Formatting - Open Office concept not translating</h2>
                    
<p>Task:&nbsp;&nbsp;A spreadsheet used to track vehicle maintenance has&nbsp;10 columns.&nbsp; Vehicle ID -&nbsp;Cell C1, Current Mileage (Daily) -&nbsp;Cell C2, Oil&nbsp;(Mileage Oil change due) - C3, Rotation Due, Cell C4, etc.&nbsp; The values of cells C3 through C10 all differ significantly and
 each must be compared to C2 independently of the others.</p>
<p>What I am trying to accomplish is to change background, font and font color depending on:</p>
<p>1. Cell C(n) (3 thru 10) &lt;= Cell C2.&nbsp; This indicates that the maintenance for that catagory is due for that vehicle.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Cell C(n) (3 thru 10) &lt;= Cell C2+500.&nbsp; This indicates that the maintenance for that catagory is due&nbsp;within 500 miles.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Cell C(n) (3 thru 10)&nbsp;&gt; Cell C2+500.&nbsp; This indicates that&nbsp;no maintenance for that catagory is due.</p>
<p>I had a solution for Excel 2000 which I then converted to work in Open Office but now that we have Excel 2007, it no longer works.&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part II:&nbsp; Optimally, it would use relative addressing so as to allow use of the format paintbrush for the other 30 rows of vehicles.</p>
<p>Thank you for any help you may give.</p>

<p>The 10 cells C1, C2, ..., C10 are in 10 different <strong>rows</strong> of&nbsp; the same<strong>column</strong> . So it seems that you have 30
<strong>columns</strong> of vehicle data.</p>
<p>You can use conditional formatting to change the background, font and font color. Here is one way of doing it in Excel 2007.</p>
<p>Select the entire range where you want this formatting to be used. In you case it would be C3:AF30 I guess.<br />
(Alternatively you can format a single cell and then use the format paintbrush to copy the formatting to other cells.)</p>
<p>Ribbon -&gt; Home tab -&gt; Styles section -&gt; Conditional Formatting -&gt; New Rule... -&gt;Format only cells that contain</p>
<p>In the New Formatting Rule window that pops up:</p>
<p>Format only cells with: Cell Value, less than, =$C$2</p>
<p>Click on Format... and select the format you like, e.g. Background color Red</p>
<p>Click on OK and OK and New Rule...</p>
<p>Format only cells with: Cell value, less than or equal, =$C$2+500</p>
<p>Click on Format... and select the format you like, e.g. Background color Yellow</p>
<p>Click on OK and OK and New Rule...</p>
<p>Format only cells with: Cell value, greater than, =$C$2+500</p>
<p>Click on Format... and select the format you like, e.g. Background color Yellow</p>
<p>Click on OK and OK and OK.</p>
<p>If you want you could also add a role with</p>
<p>Format only cells with: Cell value, equal to, =0</p>
<p>Click on OK and check the Stop If True checkbox for the Cell Value = 0 role</p>
<p>Click on OK and test you formatting by putting different values in cell C2 and in the range where the formatting is applied.</p>
<p>Hope this helps / Lars-Åke</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. Highlight all the cells on the rows you want formatted C3:C10<br />
2. Choose Home, Conditional Formatting, Manage Rules, New Rule<br />
3. Choose Use a formula to determine which cell to format<br />
4. In the Format values where this formula is true enter the following <br />
formula:</p>
<p>=C3&lt;=C$2</p>
<p>5. Click the Format button and choose a format.<br />
6. Click OK twice<br />
7. New Rule<br />
8. Choose Use a formula to determine which cell to format<br />
9. In the Format values where this formula is true enter the following <br />
formula:</p>
<p>=C3&lt;=C$2+500</p>
<p>10. Click the Format button and choose a format.<br />
11. Click OK twice times.<br />
Repeat for the third rule:</p>
<p>=C3&gt;C$2</p>
<p>Order is important so choose Conditional Formatting, Manage Rules, move the first rule (in the above example) to the top by selecting it and clicking the blue arrow.&nbsp; Move the second condition from above into the middle position.&nbsp; Click OK.</p>
<p>These are relative reference regarding copying down or to the right with the format painter.</p>

<p>Thanks Lars.&nbsp; I'll get on it after a sleep session since it is obvious that I am brain dead!.</p>
<p>I was writing without looking at the spreadsheet (or thinking).&nbsp; I had the rows vs columns right.&nbsp; I had the cell id's incorrect.&nbsp; That should read:</p>
<p>Task:&nbsp;&nbsp;A spreadsheet used to track vehicle maintenance has&nbsp;10 columns.&nbsp; Vehicle ID -&nbsp;Cell C3, Current Mileage (Daily) -&nbsp;Cell D3, Oil&nbsp;(Mileage Oil change due) - E3, Rotation Due, Cell F3, etc.&nbsp; The values of cells E3 through&nbsp;L3 all differ significantly and
 each must be compared to D3 independently of the others.</p>
<p>That said, since the entire grid will be formatted at once, it doesn't appear that my error would&nbsp;change your answer.&nbsp; Am I correct?</p>
<p>Once again, thanks a lot.</p>

<h2>            Rented HD movie but only had Stereo sond</h2>
                    <p>I have an XBox 360 with HDMI cable going to a Denon AVR-2313CI. The AVR normally runs Dolby surround sound when playing games and watching DVDs. However, when I rented the HD version of the Maze Runner last week, it only played stereo. Incredibly lame. If
 I can't get at least Dolby, what is the point of renting the movie?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Cabbage:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the questions you have regarding the sound quality of your HD movie rental.&nbsp; The videos from Xbox Video do indeed support Dolby 5.1 sound.&nbsp; If you are getting less quality then you expect there may be an issue
 with the settings or set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I would suggest you do is double check the audio settings for your Xbox console.&nbsp; I would suggest you try both the Dolby 5.1 setting as well as the Dolby Digital with WMA Pro setting.&nbsp; You can find more about this here,
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/configure-audio-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/configure-audio-settings</a> .</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have issues the next thing I would suggest you do is disconnect and reconnect your cables connecting the Xbox 360 to the audio receiver.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The final thing you might want to try is related to the TV settings.&nbsp; I have seen some reports of others with Dolby Digital surround sound issues stating they had to make sure the Xbox 360 is in the HDCP secure link mode via the HDMI cable being used.&nbsp; From
 what I have gathered you would do this by pressing the input button on your TV remote to switch the display to TV view and then back to HDMI mode.&nbsp; After doing this there should be a pop up related to "HDCP secure link".&nbsp; If you have any issues with this you
 may want to refer to your TV manual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue continues from here the best thing to do is contact chat support any time of day or night to see if there are any other Xbox troubleshooting steps or resolutions to your sound quality issues.&nbsp; You can contact them here,

<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>

<p>No, you should NOT use more than one Anti-Virus in same PC, it will cause error and other problems. Chose one, Symantec Endpoint protection is Enterprise solution that in IT enviroment your IT admin could monitor and mange PCs in there.</p>
<p>If you are in a company discuss it with your IT department. But if you are using as your own PC, then MSE would be good option but decition is yours. Both MSE and Symantec would try they best to remove threats but with different ways and methods.</p>

<h2>            I want to highlight text appearing in my browser, right click that text and &#34;append&#34; the highlighted text to a OneNote file</h2>
                    &nbsp;
<p>Hello,&nbsp; for anythinig appearing in my browser, i would like to highlight what i want to save, "right click" this&nbsp;hightlighted text, and select&nbsp;a command like "append to OneNote" from
 the "right click" select list or if the "OneNote" is not showing in the "right click" list, i would then like to select a&nbsp;key combination like CNTL-ALT-N which would also copy/append my highlighted text to a OneNote file, some where in the backgroud. So for
 example, what i'm typing into this forum question entry right now,&nbsp;i would now hightlight this text......which i'm doing right now...."right click" this highlighted text and then select "OneNote from the "right click" select list,&nbsp;to append" this text to a
 OneNote clipboard file somewhere in the background......and i see that when i right click my currently highlighted text, i don't see the OneNote link in my "right clicked" list, so i would then like to revert to selecting a&nbsp;key combination of some sort like
 CNTL-ALT-N or something like that, to copy or append this highlighted text to a OneNote file save in the background.</p>
<p>So is there a way i can configure OneNote to operate in this way no matter what is appearinig on my browser?</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions and i used to be able to do this with WikiPad, so&nbsp;i'd like to see if i can configure OneNote to operate in the same way?</p>

            <p>Ok thanks Pollardie, i see how to make OneNote work with Word and its ok and i even added a Word-VBA macro i found so i could select a Word Key to copy highlighted text to OneNote, but its really unusual that they didn't add that "Copy to OneNote" right
 click selection to Word because it looks like OneNote was mimicked from Word so to speak!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But nonetheless, i would hope that MS does add the "Copy to OneNote" context selection item for WORD down the road as it would make it a "no brainer" for our users obviously and as they hyperlink from one document to the next, they can
</p>
<p>1. highlight a section of text in WORD document</p>
<p>2. right click that selection, select "Copy to OneNote" </p>
<p>3. maybe even jump to OneNote and jump to another Word document in OneNote</p>
<p>4. hightlight a section of text in the jumped to document</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>all without having to think, "oh this is Word, therefore i need to select the Review, then then Link Notes" ect ect, ie as soon as user have to do something "unituative" they find another approach quite often, sometimes out of spite for not being consistent!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok so if you could please forward this request on to MS and i see others have made the same query/request, cos its really sort of a mind blower that of all places this "Copy to OneNote" is not a premier feature! or if you know where i can make this recommendation,
 i will defintely do that, and fyi, i tried to make this recommendation on a "connect" link, but its no longer active!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again Pollardie for trying to help and sorry to dump on you like this, but i now see OneNote as vehicle for summarzing&nbsp; domains of WORD information into summarized linkable documents for on the go mobile devices and where execs can even comment right
 into this OneNote document and resend back for remerging and also use OneNote for training and procedure references, even including video how tos!</p>

            <p>Ok Pollardie, i found this great VBA code and just substituted the "Selection.text" in the code, so that when i select a VBA key it will copy the selected text to OneNote, but now i need to test how i can get this to work on Sharepoint 2010. In other words,
 sure it will work when i'm running on my local machine, but how will Sharepoint know to use my local machine macro to copy the selection.text to a OneNote located on Sharepoint?</p>
<p>Ok thanks Pollardie!<br />

<p>Hello Vikram Ranka,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Thanks for your reply. Sorry for late response I was out of office. Based on message header, as the SPF failed with the reason:&nbsp; domain of xxx**** does not designate as permitted sender. So it should be a spam. But for better confirmation please contact
 with your admin that if this email sent from them or if their have any policy to confirm the ownership. But none of the above two situation, it is spam.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Your time and understanding will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>I finally resolved following instructions on this link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/something-went-wrong-adding-gmail-to-outlook-bc5403de-1e0f-4156-96a8-f7d084699dc1?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>What my gmail account was missing was the app password, I didn't had one created so I was using the same password for the webbrowser and outlook when for outlook I need to use a different one = the app password created in the 2 factor authentication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help you can close this.</p>
<p>Sergio.</p>

<h2>            COMPROMISED OUTLOOK&#47;HOTMAIL ACCOUNT</h2>
                    <p>I think my account has been compromised, so I sent messages to microsft about it. I changed my password as a precautionary measure- then I decided it might be better to close the account, not knowing if its compromised or not-- When closing-- outlook prompted
 me to deactivate it-- so&nbsp;I did - and yet I can still get in and use the account -- This concerns me!! Deactivating should mean unavilable for use-- also closing account should be just that closing it rigth away !!&nbsp;Will someone&nbsp; (if it was compromised ) still
 be using my account with my name? MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS!! What can I do to completely get rid of the entire account ASAP so I know everything is safe and secure? I'm very frustrated, unhappy, and concerned about the various issues this brings up - i.e
 identity theft!! Could someone please respond to this question when they have a chance, tell me what to do, or put me at ease by explaingin things I may have misunderstood. Thanks , greatly appreciated!</p>

            Hi Johnney,
<div><br />
<div>You can insert a jpg image into a Word document but you can't convert an image file to a Word document.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To insert an image file into a Word document, open Word and open the Insert tab on the ribbon, then from the Illustration group choose Picture.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

            You may be able to convert an image file to a Word document using OCR software - much depends on the jpg image.
<br />
<br />
Office 2007 includes Microsoft Document Imaging which will convert TIFF format images to editable text, but that would mean converting the jpg to TIFF in order to use it.
<br />
<br />
Third part OCR software will usually have the ability to convert directly from jpg.<br />
<br />
If you are expecting a perfect copy, you are bound to be disappointed.<br />

            Thanks&nbsp; for that Graham but I agree, it won't be a great copy. Here's a bit more info - the jpeg image came from a scan of a printed Word document and contains only text. I have an Epson V600 Photo scanner. Could I re-scan and save it as a word doc?

            If your Epson scanner came with OCR software that would create a Word document version of the text, then yes, go for it.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
We would like to gather some information first on this.<br />
<br />
1. Is there any other application that you sync your data with? Such as Outlook over ActiveSync /WMDC<br />
2. Did you ever uninstall the client and re-install the client or did you Stop the Service and relogin to the service from the phone/<br />
<br />
Alternatively you can go to the portal and use the Delete Duplicates Feature.&nbsp; Please follow the following steps to delete the duplicates<br />
<br />
&nbsp; a. Login to Portal<br />
&nbsp; b. Click on the Contacts link on the left side<br />
&nbsp; c. Above the list of contacts , click on the Find Duplicates and then choose the Delete Duplicates option<br />
&nbsp; d. It would provide you with the list of duplicates and ask if they can be deleted<br />
&nbsp; e. Upon performing that action, all your duplicates will be deleted<br />
&nbsp; f. Also , on the next sync all your duplicates will be deleted on the device<br />
<br />
Please let us know if this worked for you<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>One trick is to use a Helper column to the left of your Table (in Sheet2), and put =left(B1,7) in a1 and copy down.&nbsp; This will put the first 7 (or how many you want to use)&nbsp;letters of the persons name down column A.&nbsp; Then, in the other sheet (Sheet1)&nbsp;with
 your names in column A, put this in B1 and copy down</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP(LEFT(A1,7),SHEET2!A:B,2,FALSE)</p>
<p>It ain't perfect, but can get you close.......</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>use this matrix formula: =VLOOKUP(A1,LEFT(Sheet1!$A$1:$B$100,LEN(A1)),2,FALSE)</p>
<p>Adjust the addresses for your needs.</p>
<p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula you must enter it again
 with CTRL+Shift+Enter. (Mike H)</p>

    <title>Subscript Keyboard Shortcut - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lauraannen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Subscript Keyboard Shortcut</h2>
                    For some reason, the keyboard shortcut for subscript, Ctrl+=, isn't working. &nbsp;When I hit this combination, it zooms in on my page, instead of converting to subscript. &nbsp;The superscript shortcut works fine, it's just subscript. &nbsp;I know this may sound like
 a petty thing to complain about, but I'm a Chemisty major, and when I'm typing up notes, it'd be so much easier for me if I could just use the shortcut. &nbsp;Am I using the wrong shortcut? &nbsp;Is there a way to change your shortcuts?

Thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
I have searched them with extension .obml15, but i found that the new opera mini 6.5's saved pages actually don't have extension!! They begin with initial name ''file''.<br />
I have used y browser to find them.<br />
<br />
Saved pages were on mass memory as i have installed it there-<br />
E:\system\apps\operamini\savespages<br />
<br />
Thank you.

<p>I think you were trying to set the password for your wifi earlier. I presume you have it set up now and it is working for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What to do after you've set up the access point is to make sure that it is filed in the correct category so your applications can find it. If you goto, Settings&gt;Connectivity&gt;Destinations, You will see Access Point, Internet, Multimedia messaging, Wap services
 and Uncategorised. They are the various categories you can file each access point under. Go through each one and see where your access point is currently. If it is in Internet, then leave it alone. If it is in Uncategorised, you need to move it to say Internet.
 To move it you first highlight the access point you want to move, click on Options&gt;Organise&gt;Move to oither dest, now select the destination which is Internet. Now go back a step to Destinations, then click Options&gt;Default Connection and select Internet as
 your default connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now open the browser, click on Options&gt;Settings&gt;General&gt;Access Point, make sure this is set to Internet. Try browsing again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't need to connect to your wifi before browsing. Just start browsing and the wifi should connect or try to connect itself.</p>

<p>ok, I hit web, then recently visited pages, then 
http://www.google.co.uk, just as an arbitrary site... the center is blank, and the left corner says 'stop', as if it's loading, then after a few minutes, i get 'invalid server name', then a blank screen with a white double-headed arrow in the bottom right

<p>The double headed arrow means it is trying to use the mobile internet access point and not your wifi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go back to Settings&gt;Connectivity&gt;Destinations&gt;Internet, highlight your wifi, click Options&gt;Organise&gt;Change priority, now move cursor up to the very top and click OK. You have just made your wifi the top priority access point in Internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now try the browser again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you get a change if you can list all access points in Internet for me.</p>

<p>Could you temporarily move the other 2 access points over to&nbsp;uncategorized&nbsp;and see if we can force the browser to use our wifi. When connecting to wifi you should an icon that looks like a chess pawn with lines radiating from it at the top right hand corner.
 If you see the 2 headed arrow again you know it is trying to access mobile internet. Also make sure you are within range of your wifi when trying this.</p>

            I couldn't move them to uncategorised, but I moved them to multimedia messaging. At first it seemed like it was doing something different, I think it gave the message 'connection unavailable', when I next loaded the browser, but then it repeated exactly
 what had happened previously<br />

            You can not hide the HTML code that is the web page.... There are ways to make it more difficult using javascript and other gimmicks, however if the browser can read and interpret the page (and it must), then the html code is visible also.&nbsp; Script code
 (processed on the web server) is not visible to the browser.
