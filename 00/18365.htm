<h2>            Can&#39;t open .pst files using Outlook 2010</h2>
                    I'm running 64-bit Windows 7 and Outlook 2010. I have a .pst file on my hard drive I want to open. It was NOT saved using third-party software. It DOES have data in it, over 100 MB worth. When I try to open it using Outlook's File | Open | Open Outlook
 Data File command sequence, the screen flashes once but nothing else happens. Outlook remains in the default .pst file. I get NO error messages. Suggestions?

            <p>#1 - Nothing is ever going to be "replaced" (temporarily or otherwise) when Outlook is open and over-writing a PST file with a different one by the same name is not recommended unless you are restoring a backup of the original (and then Outlook would have
 to be closed regardless)</p>
<p>#2 - If the PST file is listed in the DataFiles list then it has been added to the profile and should appear in the Navigation pane - just expand the root folder (there should be one for every PST file shown in the Data Files list.
</p>
<p>#3 - The obvious indication that it's been "opened" is the sheer fact that it's included in the navigation pane - it's just another PST file with whatever folders were created within it.</p>

            For future reference, the Inbox Repair Tool is installed by default whenever you install Outlook. The article tells you how to find and run it on your local partition. You do not need any installation files to run it. &nbsp;

    <title>property sheet in form, table and query designer is very slow to work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justin tighe  say:</h3>
<h2>            property sheet in form, table and query designer is very slow to work with</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my Windows 7 to Windows 8 OS and now in Access 2013 the property sheet in form design is very slow to work with. Every time you click a control and the property sheet is open, the property sheet redraws itself. If you move a control the property
 sheet continuously redraws itself until you stop moving the control. If I close the property sheet the form designer returns to its normal speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried this by creating a new blank database, a database from a template and one of my own databases. My own database was created on Windows Vista with Access 2007, I have run it on Windows 7 with Access 2010 and Access 2013 without this problem, but
 it seems that the upgrade to Windows 8 has triggered the problem with Access 2013.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get the same problem in the Table Designer and the Query Designer. It probably happens in the Report Designer as well but I gave up as this bug makes Access unusable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a known problem with Access 2013?</p>

            <p>You are not alone! This is why I ended up here looking for solutions as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seem to remember reading that Access now stores object property information somewhere else, which probably means in the clouds. The trouble is that I can't find where I saw this anymore. This problem certainly seems worse when my internet link is slow.
 This is an alarming development that is making the design of tables, forms, reports etc. almost impossible and the product is becoming unusable. It took me 10 minutes to change a control's enabled status from true to false.</p>

            I found that on Windows 8 after some service patches were installed - I am not sure which one and whether it was a windows or office patch - the problem disappeared. Now I have upgraded to Windows 8.1 and the problem reappears. Very frustrating to say
 the least

            <p>That's odd, it has been a while since I checked on Access 2013 and I have noticed that the problem has come back again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had it under Windows 8, then some patch seemed to remove the problem. When I upgraded to Windows 8.1 it came back then another patch seemed to fix it again and now when I have just checked prompted by your reply and the problem is back again! I have had
 the Office service pack 1&nbsp;installed recently and I don't know if that reset the problem back again. Which patch (windows or office) that fixes or breaks the problem I do not know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have given up on Access 2013 for now&nbsp;as it is such an awful update and&nbsp;I am sticking to Access 2007/2010 for now.</p>

            <p>That's the really frustrating thing, I really can't remember whether I found a solution or it just went away by itself. If I did figure it out, it's not the sort of thing that you think you're ever likely to need again so I didn't make a point of recording
 what I did. I know that I do occasionally use Access 2010 to design objects to run in 2013 on occasions because it's quicker.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj250134%28v=office.15%29.aspx and read some of the comments there about the dissatisfaction with 2013 and the new way they deal with applications, I know I originally wondered if this was something
 to do with it because I always seemed to have problems when my router was running slow. I never did resolve this point though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There does appear to be some kind of conflict at Microsoft between the marketing for Access claiming it is a quick and easy way to develop database solutions locally (without the need to be a programming genius) and the overall Microsoft strategy of taking
 everything off your computer and putting it in the "clouds" whether you want to or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was daft enough to fall for the sales pitch about Office 365 only to discover that it's dead if you don't have an internet link open "to verify you 365 subscription". No longer can you sit on the beach and develop you database on a laptop because you haven't
 got an open link for them to apparently take your code and put it somewhere else if my understanding of that link above is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speed of developing database solutions used to be Access's unique selling point. If they don't sort out this kind of problem people will start to drift.</p>

            <p>Me too, in my case working with Access 2007, recently moved from Windows 7 to 8.1 following acquisition of a Surface Pro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a small relief to know that it's not just me. On the basis of these quoted &nbsp;experiences I'd be sorely tempted to reinstall Windows 7 if that were practical.</p>

            <p>Exactly the same problem!! &nbsp;Been using Access for some years now and &nbsp;very used to it. &nbsp;I upgraded to Windows 8 on a new, more powerful machine from XP where my Access 2010 worked fine! Put it on the new machine and same thing, everything you try do do results
 in the property sheet redrawing and taking about 10 seconds to allow you to change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it was a problem with Office 2010 so I put in my installation disc, repaired office then Access 2010 was OK again until next time I restarted my computer and went back into Access!!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am also having this problem.</p>
<p>I have been working with MS Access since the Beta release of version 1.0 and this is the first time I have really got frustrated with the product (along with the move to the cloud). The issue does not seem limited to field properties. I have an Access application
 which used to run fine on Windows 7 / Access 2010 and earlier (on everything from XP forwards) but which now runs considerably more slowly.</p>

<p>The cloud seems to be a problem. Noticed that the OneDrive service was running and, since I do not use it (and did not want it) I managed to find out how to disable it in Group Policy. Forms now work fine.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting the question. I will assist you with the query you have with sharing the address book contacts with multiple profiles in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to troubleshoot the issue related to Outlook, you may try the step below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copy the Outlook data file from the below location and open it in the new Outlook profile.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Location</font></span>: drive:\User\user name\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook</p>
<p>Or C:\documents\Outlook data</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer to the link below to know the location of Outlook data (PST) file and how to open the PST file in Outlook:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/open-change-or-close-outlook-data-files-HA010355609.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/open-change-or-close-outlook-data-files-HA010355609.aspx</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the PST file is opened, you will be able to see it in the navigation pane of the Outlook window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the contacts folder and you will see multiple contacts folders, in one of them you will see the contacts that were created in the other profile.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the contacts are located, follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click on any one of the contact and then on the key board use the shortcut to select the contacts (</span><span style="font-weight: bold">control + A</span><span>) and then drag and drop the contacts to a default contact folder.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Once the Contacts are moved, you may go to the navigation pane and close the old data file and continue working with the new one.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above steps helps. If you need further assistance on this particular issue or any other Office related issues let us know and we will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<br />
You've done it again - That is WRONG INFORMATION. Pasting a pst file into the default location of another Outlook Profile usually CORRUPTS THE PROFILE.

<p>That is INCORRECT information and will quite probably corrupt the mail profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open one of the Outlook Profiles.</p>
<p>Create a new Outlook Data File. (On the Home Tab, click on New Items-More Items-Outlook Data File)</p>
<p>Copy the Contacts into the new Outlook Data File.</p>
<p>Close that profile.</p>
<p>Start the other profile and add the new pst file. File-Open-Outlook Data File.</p>
<p>Note that you can't have both profiles open at the same time - it's either one or the other.</p>

</p><p>I am using the Outlook app on the iPhone and iPad. I can see all the folders that I see when I am using Outlook on my desktop. However, it also has some others called 'Deleted Items', 'Archive' and 'Sent Items'. I do not need these as I already have 'Trash',
 separate archive folders and 'Sent' folders that sync properly between all devices. So how do I delete the unwanted folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the 'Drafts' folder on ios devices never syncs with the desktop version.</p>

            I find it incredible that no one can resolve this issue. Support blames Twitter. How is it Twitter's fault that I cannot remove a Twitter connection?

            It's not a browser issue, it's not a cookies issue, etc. The API between MS and Twitter is broken.

            I would suspect a driver issue.&nbsp; Probably worth going onto the HP website for latest drivers.&nbsp; Although they might not officially support W10 yet due to its test status.&nbsp; I've heard of W8 drivers working in W10 on some occasions, that might be worth a
 shot too.

            To use the scan feature, the printer-scanner must be directly connected to the computer or the wireless router--not connected to another computer on the network. You can share printers connected to another computer but not scanners. The scanner software
 must be installed on all computers. Try reinstalling the win 8 <a href="https://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?os=4158&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=4027469#N907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

This is obviously a connectivity issue, e.g. DNS problem.&nbsp; Why haven't you tried the other suggestions?&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular using Google.com to start from.&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason it sometimes works, possibly by setting up DNS caches in some useful way.</p>

<div><span>The server at&nbsp;<strong>bay146.mail.live.com</strong>&nbsp;can't be found, because the DNS lookup failed. DNS is the network service that translates a website's name to its Internet address. This error is
 most often caused by having no connection to the Internet or a misconfigured network. It can also be caused by an unresponsive DNS server or a firewall preventing&nbsp;<span>Google Chrome</span>&nbsp;from accessing the network.</span></div>

<strong>Change account type</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Account type</strong>, select <strong>Administrator</strong> from the drop down menu.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Change a user account type on Control Panel</p>
<ol>
<li>Type "control" on the <strong>Search/Cortana</strong>, then choose <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />

            Hi hzelhob,<br />
<br />
This might be a possible software-related issue. For us to isolate, we'd like to know some details about this concern. When did the issue begin? Have you made any changes on your phone prior to the issue? What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?<br />
<br />
You may try to perform a soft reset by pressing and holding down the <strong>power
</strong>and <strong>volume </strong><strong>down </strong>buttons at the same time until your phone vibrates and restarts.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it turns out.

    <title>Problem with Inserting an Outlook Item - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peewhit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Inserting an Outlook Item</h2>
                    I am using the Insert Outlook Item in an outgoing email to insert the content of several emails from my Sent Items Folder. I have previously changed the arrangement of the column fields in this view. However, when I view the emails after choosing Insert
 Item the view reverts back to the standard view and does not show me my customised fields. I have tried everything to change this but cannot find the solution. Can anyone help please? Thank you.

I use my personal Mac to access corporate emails. Every month the Active Directory password is required to be changed on the Windows AD laptop.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Upon setting up a new password for Windows AD, the Outlook for Mac AD password is out of sync. On the last few occasions, I have deleted the keychain (resetting it to default) and that is a painful exercise as it removes all my other passwords in Safari, Mail

So while Outlook works fine after deleting keychain list and resetting it, is there a better option to delete any specific keychains or update passwords elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
As a process, I do update the: 1. Internet Passwords; and 2. Outlook preferences password, however none of these actions update the AD password for Outlook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I also use the same exchange account on the Mac mail client and it works fine. It is only the Outlook for Mac that does not synchronize to changes in password at the Exchange Server.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Rejection on a contact, when emailing&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft office 365,</p>
<p>I have been having a problem where a particular person I have been trying to email hasn't been sending through because it says that you are rejecting my letter. I have tried switching and asking her email but it has been happening for ages now and I am sick
 of it!</p>
<p>I have no other problems emailing another recipient for it is just her. I am frustrated about this problem because I can't send all of my emails through. I understand that you will need the name so you can fix this problem. I can't give you the full email
 but only some hints and letters: it begins with a t, the recipient is a girl, she uses Hotmail.com, part of it has the name ceran-, after the hyphen is a j. I hope this is enough information.</p>
<p>Please FIX this FRUTATING PROBLEM.</p>
<p>I would like a reply. I also can't give you all of my information when I end this so please figure out my clue.</p>
<p>If this problem isn't fixed I might have to take action and use another app/brand if it doesn't end by the end of August!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Chloe M</p>

            Hi Chloe,
<br />
<br />We are only Independent Advisors on the outlook.com community. We are members such as yourself helping others, not microsoft employee's 
<br />"because it says that you are rejecting my letter" can you give me the exact error message so we can track down why the email is being rejected. 
<br />The view source information should have the information as to why the email was rejected. I have included a screenshot to find this information. 
<br />There are many reasons why the email is being rejected.

    <title>Outlook app not working on windows phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danjoseph  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook app not working on windows phone</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Since the last Outlook update (version 17.8700.40676.0) which updated on my phone on 18th November 2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>It slowly started to not sync over a few days, it could only sync when I forced it to. Then as of 27th it stopped syncing all together. The calendar also started to not sync. I could add events but they didn't sync to my account. I tried playing around with
 the settings and managed to force a sync when I switched off the focused and other email grouping and that was on the 29th. But nothing has synced since and I can't even add events to calendar any more. If I open either the mail or calendar it will kick me
 out or take ages to open. Their seems to be a few people experiencing the same issues.</p>
<p>Have logged the issue with Microsoft via feedback hud but no response as of yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do we know if this is a much wider issue or just one only a small percentage are experiencing? Also is a patch update to fix the bug issue coming soon/ being worked on?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Dan,<br />
<br />
<br />
There are different possible reasons that can cause this issue. One of these is a corrupted program file. Sometimes restarting your device fixes the issue.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If restarting doesn't fix it, we suggest that you perform a soft reset on your Windows phone to check if the same issue will persist.<br />
<br />
Please check the steps provided by 7thSense on how to soft reset a Windows phone through this<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">

<p>I've turned the phone on and off a few times already and it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just tried the soft reset as you said but that has had no effect. I'm reluctant to do a hard reset. In case an update comes along and fixes the issue</p>

</p><p>Ok used the Tool kit to recover my phone, as the tool kit had an older version of the OS I couldn't use my stored back up to get my settings back. So had to re use the tool kit and do a fresh start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I had used the recovery tool and started a fresh, everything was working fine. I let the phone naturally update the OS and apps over the last few weeks. On the 21st it updated the mail and calendar app to version 17.8700.40676.0 (windows phone app)
 which was the version I stared to have the issues with.</p>
<p>And as of the 26th the syncing issues started again with the mail app. It can no longer send emails from the app, it says last synced 2 days ago. To receive emails I have to force sync, the app is slow in performance and will kick me out of the app from
 time to time. Which is what happened last time so I know in a day or 2 it will stop working altogether and the calendar app is also to starting to have issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've sent my self test emails from outlook through the website, also outlook office and mail app PC (version 17.8730.21155.0) They all work fine.</p>
<p>So there is a problem with the phone version of outlook. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that the PC version is a newer release does it have any link with the phone version? If so does that mean a I can hope for a roll out of this update to my phone and hopefully fix the bug? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I too am facing the same problem and did a hard reset which sorted the things for about a couple of days after which it was a reiteration of the previous state.</p>
<p>It seems like the is a bug in the outlook app that renders the previous written state unreadable after the authorization token from microsoft account is refreshed. In fact, on my phone it does not even show all the email accounts add to the application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also on version [17.8700.40676.0].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well looking around the net a few people are having the same problem. Hopefully if enough people report it then they will release a fix sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest if you haven't done so already is to report it. I'm going to report it again as it seems this thread isn't getting checked. I've logged it via feedback hub and on here.</p>

    <title>AVG Support Advertisment is a SCAM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richsiem  say:</h3>
<h2>            AVG Support Advertisment is a SCAM</h2>
                    <p><span>The advertisement below is a scam. I came across it at the top of Bingâ€™s search page when I typed in search â€™AVG and Windows 10â€™ on Thursday 6 Aug 2015 at 2.10pm
 (Australia).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All I wanted was to ask AVG Support was â€œI canâ€™t turn on Windows 10 Defender, is it because I have the Free AVG?â€</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I spoke to a male with a strong Indian accent, who spoke very fast and I didnâ€™t quite understand him, but he said he could fix it if I allowed him to take control
 of my computer, which I did. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Very, very quickly he was opening (I later suspect he was uploading) pages showing data problems that was caused by malware and told me I was under threat from scammers,
 who would get my banking and private details from my computer. He said HE COULD FIX the malware and make it safe. He started making changes on my computer before I gave him permission and I asked if there was a fee? He avoided the question with blah blah and
 I asked again. He said $240. I said I am not interested and he then uploaded some annoying music and an image of a bulldog and other pages and then hung up. Every time I tried to close a page, he would continually move my curser away. Seeing I could not do
 anything, I turned off my modem, closed all the pages and restarted the computer. Everything seemed back to normal.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Iâ€™m think this message should be passed on so nobody gets scammed.</span></p>

<h2>            &#91;N97&#93; Will not connect to Exchange server</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been trying for hours now and have looked through the boards here and found only similar discussions. What I am trying to do is to retrieve emails from my exchange server on the N97 (as you can see) I have gone through the wizard, installed the package
 that allows me to use the exchange services and have my account sitting there.</p>

<p>However, when i try to connect to get the emails, there is no sign of what is happening, and no emails are retrieved? This is very puzzling as the account has worked before but another thing happened to the phone so that it had to be replaced. So, here I
 am with no emails and no clue on how to fix it. The <em>only</em> thing that i can see is wrong is that when asked for the Exchange server i usually enter an address starting with https:// which it will not allow me to do on this phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry if i have been vague or am starting '<em>another one' </em>of these topics but i am really stuck... if i have missed something out, please ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbicher.</p>
