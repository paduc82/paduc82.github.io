<h2>            How do I refresh Groove Music on Windows 10 Mobile &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Nokia 830 running the latest version of Windows 10 Mobile</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a major cleanup of my music on my laptop (22GB) which I wanted to replicate on my phone.&nbsp; I deleted all of the files and folders on the SD card of my phone and then copied all of the cleaned up&nbsp;music back to my phone's SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Groove Music updated itself but it still lists many artists and songs that I removed from my music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get Groove Music to do a complete refresh ?&nbsp; I have seen some suggestions on how to do it on a PC but it doesn't work on the phone (or at least I can't see the directories that contain the files that need to be deleted)</p>

<p>You could go into file Explorer in W10Mobile and see if clicking on the music adds them to the collection.</p>

            <p>I manage my music on my laptop and then copy it to my phone.&nbsp; I do use OneDrive but I keep the music in the OneDrive directory on the laptop (which is backed up to OneDrive online) but the copy to the phone is from the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made some significant changes to my music collection so I didn't want to try and replicate the changes I made on my laptop on the phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key events on the phone are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I deleted all music on the phone</li><li>I then copied the updated collection from my laptop to my phone (much of the music is the same but there were a couple of hundred deletions and additions)</li><li>Groove Music recognizes all of the new music I added.&nbsp; </li><li>The problem is Groove Music still lists much or all of the songs that was formerly on the phone that I removed from my collection)</li></ul>
<p>I am wondering if it might make sense to:</p>
<ul>
<li>delete all the music on phone again</li><li>open Groove Music and hopefully it will remove all pointers to songs</li><li>reload my updated collection to phone</li></ul>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; That does work for a song/album that I can identify as having been removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem however is that I have 6,000 songs,&nbsp;I made hundreds of changes to my collection, I didn't keep a record of what I changed and I am hoping to avoid spending a lot of time to right everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Briefly this is what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added/deleted hundreds of songs to collection on my laptop which is automatically replicated on OneDrive</li><li>Deleted all music on the SD card on my phone</li><li>Copied my updated collection to my phone which is what Groove Music on phone accesses</li><li>Now Groove Music on my phone recognizes&nbsp;all of the additions to collection but still shows the music I deleted from collection (and generates an error when it tries to play those songs</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to do if it is possible is to force Groove Music to automatically refresh it index of songs so that the songs I removed are no longer in the index</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that if I could remove the Groove Music app and then add it back that that action would force a complete refresh but I that app isn't deleteable like 3rd party apps and I don't know how to do it.&nbsp; I might just take the phone to Microsoft Store
 next time I am near one (I find the store to be very helpful)</p>

</p><p>I asked some developers on the team about this, and it sounds like a bug that we recently found and have fixed. I can't commit to a date when the fix will be out, but will try to circle back here when it's available.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Publish to Blog</h2>
                    <p>I have a couple of users who have been happily using word to create blog post's and then using the 'share&gt;publish to blog' option to publish the doc to our sharepoint blog.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked fine up until a couple of weeks&nbsp;ago. Now when they now click on the share button it instead just gives them the option to upload to onedrive to share it. There are now no options to post to blog (see pic)?</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4a3a895e-536c-40f3-82b8-f0899f274e5b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am actually running exactly the same build version as my users (1709 build 8528.2147) and i do get the option to post to blog. As far as i can see there are no differences between the office setups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Jomel,<br />
<br />
So slight update to this, it would appear that the button has been removed from the share option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i open up a new word document and select the blog template this still allows us to publish to blog, however if you have done a standard word document and want to publish this you can't. The work around is to copy everything out of the document, create
 a new word doc under the blog template and then paste everything back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not exactly a intuitive or smooth process</p>
<p>

    <title>Removing a Windows Phone from your Microsoft Account to obtain the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shakacbaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing a Windows Phone from your Microsoft Account to obtain the Recovery key...</h2>
                    <p>To resolve an issue in which my Windows store app disappeared on my Lumia 640 running Windows 10 mobile, I hard reset the phone. After doing so, The phone requested a Recovery Key to continue the installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10549/microsoft-account-protect-my-phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>suggested that I should remove the phone from the account to obtain the key. I did so and the key never appeared. I've tried everything I can think of and chatted with microsoft and BSX Agents to no avail. It appears to be an account issue. When I attempt
 to sign in on the phone with my Microsoft Account, it returns: "Could not turn off Reset Protection - Ooops! Looks like we ran into a problem trying to turn off Reset Protection. Make sure you have a network connection and try again later." At this point,
 I suspect the error is due to the fact it's been removed from my account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, When removing the device from your account, does the recovery key generate in a
<strong>pop-up window</strong>? If so, then I suspect that my <strong>pop-up blocker</strong> may have prevented the key from generating. I've noticed several other Lumia owners who have brought up that they never saw the key either after removing the device
 from their account... I wonder if a blocked window may be the cause; If so Microsoft may wish to initiate a fix or at the VERY LEAST place a warning up to shut off any pop-up blockers before proceeding with the removal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, without the key, what is the best course of action to resolve this? I am the first and only owner of this phone, and it's done INCREDIBLY well up until these recent issues. Is there a way to obtain the key in another way? Is there any way to restore
 it to my account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you for the screenshot. I think I understand what may have happened then: because of the "Get Recovery Key" Links Location on the screen, It was to the right and offscreen on my monitor; I never saw the link...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, This should have occurred...</p>

 The recovery key will display on the page and will also be emailed to you."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've been hoping I'd at LEAST receive an email. I got the last one stating that Reset Protection had been turned off the first time I did this (due to issues with the reset I attempted the Reset several times yesterday)...
 But I've received no email with ANY key so far...</span></p>

<p>Yes, that's correct. The device is no longer listed because I removed it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Email that stated reset protection was turned off was from an earlier reset a day or so prior. The device was still giving me issues with sluggishness and still didn't want to install the app store, so I tried again. I was in a location with limited
 access to internet/Cellular data at the time, so maybe that was where the miscommunication occurred. Either way, the phone would not allow me to continue beyond the Reset Protection procedure and failed when I entered my Microsoft Account info, even prior
 to removing the device.</p>

<p>all was well last night, but this morning i cant turn it on! - it wont respond to soft reset so i looked at the forums to see how to hard reset. I tried to do the hard reset but i cant even get the exclamation mark on the screen, i press the volume down
 button and the power button, it vibrates, i then press the volume down button but i DONT get any exclamation mark on screen, it just vibrates, i get the Microsoft logo, cogs appear for a couple of seconds, then it turns off again, and thats all i can get it
 to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyone know how to get it working or is the phone knackered?</p>

<h3> mina123---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia E72 Backup Battery</h2>
                    
<p>I think I have a problem with the backup battery in the E72.&nbsp; Can someone switch off the phone, take out the battery and tell me how long it can stay outside before you have to enter date and time when you restart the mobile. Is it in the&nbsp;range of seconds
 only (to allow just to change battery) or is it more than 5 mins?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help. I hate to bring it to a Nokia repair center. It was there the last two months.</p>

<p>You really have to move quickly to remove battery, change SIM and re-insert battery without losing settings, so my guess limit is about a minute.</p>

<h3> garethhunt8251  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Public Folders - Cannot Display This folder - Server Administrator has limited the number of items</h2>
                    
<p>Currently we have some Public Folders setup on Office 365 and we seem to be having some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>When first trying to expand the Public Folders it can freeze for up to 10 mins (this is happening to users of Office 2013 and 2016 on a variety of internet connections and speeds.)
</li><li>Once the users have accessed the public folders, they can navigate them ok (with some lag), however after moving around a couple of different folders the users will receive an error:
</li></ul>
<p>Your server administrator has limited the number of items you can open simultaneously. Try closing messages you have opened or removing attachments and images from unsent messages you are composing.</p>
<p>Sometimes if you wait a couple of minutes and try again it starts working again.</p>
<p>At first I thought that this may have been limited to a single user running Windows 10, however I have been able to replicate the issue with the error message on a different computer.</p>
<p>So far I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating a new Outlook profile </li><li>Removing access to a shared mailbox </li><li>Repairing Office </li><li>Reinstalling Office </li><li>Trying under a different user profile (login) </li><li>Tried it while the computer was connected to the domain and on a computer that hadn't been joined to the domain
</li></ul>

<p>hi ghunt03,<br />
<br />
based on my experience, the issue may be because outlook locally caches all folders to which you have access in the secondary mailbox. you can try the following steps :<br />
1. on the file tab, click account settings in the account settings list.<br />
2. in the account settings dialog box, click the e-mail tab and then double-click your microsoft exchange server account.<br />
3. in the change account dialog box, click more settings.<br />
4. in the microsoft exchange dialog box, click the advanced tab.<br />
5. <strong>clear</strong> the download shared folders check box. (screenshot below for your reference).</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f15e829d-54a5-4f9d-9cd6-a08187e493f9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f15e829d-54a5-4f9d-9cd6-a08187e493f9" /></a><br />
6. click ok two times.<br />
7. click next, click finish, and then click close.<br />
6. restart outlook.</p>
<p>if the issue persist, please do the test below to narrow down the root cause: <br />
create a new account and give it full access of a public folder which don't have much content. check that wheather it can be opened normally. if you are not able to get a new account, remove all permissions from an existed account and give it a public folder's
 permission. this is to identify whether the issue is related to too many items in the public folders.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
louis</p>

<p>Louis,</p>
<p>I tried changing the cache settings and it made no difference, I then tried another user with only a couple of folders and the public folders expanded quickly. I couldn't test the issue with moving between folders and getting the "too many items opened"
 as there were enough folders to browse through.</p>
<p>What are the recommended number of sub folders in a public folder? Does this also tie into how many folders are in each public folder mailbox?</p>

<p>Hi Ghunt03,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>To answer your question, we need the following information:<br />
1. How many public folders does the problematic account have?<br />
2. The size of the public folders. Right click the public folder-&gt; choose Data File Properties-&gt; choose Folder Size. Please post screenshots of the folder size especially the folders you have trouble opening. To upload a picture, please click Use rich formatting
 under the reply box and then click the Insert Image icon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, closing Cached Exchange Mode may need some time to take effect. If possible, try to create a new Outlook profile for the affected users with the following steps.<br />
1. Go to Control Panel in Windows.<br />
2. Go to Mail.<br />
3. Click Show Profile then choose Add to create a new profile in Mail Setup.At this time, do not open Outlook until you finish the steps below.<br />
4. After adding a new profile successfully, choose Data Files in Mail Setup.<br />
5. Double click the new Outlook profile you created in the list and choose Advanced column. Clear the Download shared folder check box as mentioned in the previous thread.Then, open Outlook with the new Outlook profile to see if the there is any improvement.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Larry</p>

<p>We are suffering from the same problem and have tried all of the solutions mentioned here. Nothing seemed to directly affect the problem. &nbsp;I have also gone through and cleared out all the permissions and reset them, but still no solution. It's working better
 now on most machines, so I'm thinking that Microsoft was having a problem on their end, but now way to know. It has been very frustrating. We even opened up a Microsoft support ticket, but still no answers. It just sort of works better and sometimes it doesn't
 but nobody knows why. It has been a very unsatisfying experience. If we were hosting our own mail server, it would have been resolved by now. We have people on phone calls who can't get to emails and people having to ask clients to resend them messages. All
 very bad stuff that makes me very unhappy with Microsoft. No one is taking responsibility and fixing it!!!! It's like talking to a wall!</p>

<h3> ashbartlett  say:</h3>
<h2>            AutoSave is disabled and I can&#39;t turn it back on without saving a new copy to my OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>I just got a new surface laptop and have not been able to use the autosave feature or have my documents syncing properly to OneDrive. I have gone through the process of exiting and re-syncing my OneDrive onto my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go through my OneDrive folders on my PC from here:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/284eb910-f29f-4fc0-8818-4d4c65e861d8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/284eb910-f29f-4fc0-8818-4d4c65e861d8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I find the folder and the document that I want and open it. It opens the document I was working on yesterday on a different computer which I than uploaded to&nbsp; my OneDrive account. Instead of saying AutoSave is turned on and whatever it is meant to say beside
 my file name when it's syncing properly it instead has AutoSave turned off and "Saved to PC" beside my file name.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6711928-5a97-4554-bdcf-49a49ce2f69e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6711928-5a97-4554-bdcf-49a49ce2f69e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I try and turn AutoSave on, and in the past on my old tablet it has been as simple as changing off to on and it works
 and is great. But this time I'm getting this pop up:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2004a023-7ac1-4035-996c-eca630a6def5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2004a023-7ac1-4035-996c-eca630a6def5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>(The fact that I have both of those accounts connected has never been an issue for me, in fact I had four different accounts on my last computer)OneDrive - Personal is the one that I opened the file from originally so I click on it but instead of just turning
 on AutoSave and syncing it tells me it's saving a copy to my OneDrive!!! It's saving a copy of a document I opened from this exact same account to the account so that I can AutoSave?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f39565ce-f420-4ca3-9a04-d75d6e06daec?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f39565ce-f420-4ca3-9a04-d75d6e06daec?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The file is already on my OneDrive, I literally opened it from the OneDrive account it has saved a new copy too! So I don't understand why to turn on AutoSave I have to save a new copy (and no I can't just create a new copy and use that one, I have 12 Uni
 assignments half completed and a lot of other documents I work on and they're all telling me they won't AutoSave and I'm not saving them again, that's just ridicules and if that's the solution then there's something seriously wrong here.)<br />
</p>
<p>I did save a new copy of one of the documents and it saved itself into my main Documents folder in OneDrive. I tried moving it into the folder that it should be in in my OneDrive and open it and it comes up with the same 'saved to PC' message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have a problem with the folders inside my main files not syncing? My settings tell me that all of my OneDrive folders are syncing properly and I have lovely little green ticks on all the folders and documents, so what's happening? This is really frustrating
 because I'll often go from my laptop and open my documents on computers at Uni so I can work on them there and it's awesome cause OneDrive means I don't have to carry around a USB or harddrive for me to lose but at the moment it's not working and I'm getting
 annoyed. It's also not just my Word documents, I have PowerPoint documents giving me the same hassle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm rambling now... can someone please help me???????</p>

<p>Hi AshBartlett,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to get a better picture of your concern, can you verify if the file is saved to the correct location. To do this, click the name of the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ef88e0d-1f4a-45c3-ae4d-da45b51070a1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ef88e0d-1f4a-45c3-ae4d-da45b51070a1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file is saved in the local folder, then we have an issue with OneDrive. However, if the location is correct, then we may have an issue with the application not displaying the correct location where the file is saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would also like to verify, is the issue happening on just one file or on all the files that you are working on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To notify me and have me get back to you, simply reply to this post.</p>

    <title>Enterprise activation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevenhirons  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enterprise activation</h2>
                    <p>Hi, After contributing to the insider program for a year I decided to leave and gratefully accept my free copy of windows.</p>
<p>My version was Enterprise and was fully activated by the 2 week pre launch update. Problem now is that my windows bugged up and I am no longer able to reload the Enterprise edition I officially received and activated. Is there anyway of me getting my Enterprise
 edition back ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have tried the VLK centre which doesn't recognise my account so no joy there, the evaluation version is just an evaluation and wont activate. My version also was not an upgrade from a previously activated copy of windows either, it was the original boot
 image from the very first ISO's released in the insider program. Could anyone direct me or help ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any guidance in advance.</p>

Hi, thanks for the reply. A little confusing since Microsoft sent the th1 update which sent your insider copy to full activation 2 weeks before launch and in all press releases Microsoft stated that all insiders copies of windows would be free as a thank you for participating. If Enterprise was not part of the launch , why send out a release patch on the update ? Just a little miffed after having Enterprise for all this time and a bugged update forced a re-install. Just a couple of pics to show I am not talking out my ****. First one is a bit meh but that was the th1 enterprise activation update 2 weeks prior to launch.

            <p>Enterprise is activated only with a volume license key from an organization which has a Software Assurance Agreement with Microsoft. &nbsp;Enterprise is available for evaluation to anyone but it is a 90-day trial. &nbsp;You cannot purchase a retail license for Enterprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can extend the evaluation period for 90 days by opening a command prompt and typing</p>
<p>
</p><p>slmgr /rearm</p>
<p>
</p><p>That will only work three times, so wait until the 90th day to rearm. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer came with Windows 7 or 8 preinstalled, one thing you can do is to download the Media Creation Tool for Build 10565 from<br />
</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso<br />
</p>
<p>create media and do a clean install. &nbsp;Setup for build 10565 will search for the OEM activation data stored on the motherboard and activate. &nbsp;If you have a Windows 7 or 8 retail product key you can also enter that during installation and activate that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can stay in the Insider Program as ZigZag says.</p>

<h2>            SEQUENTIAL NUMBERING IN A HEADER FOR EXCEL TEMPLATE</h2>
                    My transmittal documents have to be numbered and I am already at 60 in a software program called expedition that&nbsp; is no longer supported and there is a problem with it and we can't use since last Thursday. So I am at 00059 last used template that was auto
 numbered in Expedition. To make matters more complicated, I would like the number to show up in the header so on every page and it rare to have one page of this transmittal document.&nbsp; I am really open to having the sequence show up somewhere else in the document.
 HELP! what is the simple formula I am overlooking. Thank you very much for any and all responses.<br />

<h2>            Error 80048264 in Nokia Lumia 928</h2>
                    <p>My Nokia lumia 928 windows 8.0 mobile phone first stopped bringing notifications when I get messages in whatsapp or messenger so I reset it. Now I can't download any apps as this error code 0x80048264 keeps coming even when I try to logging in with my Microsoft
 Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the problem? I have now reset my phone 3 times and this problem won't go away.</p>

            <p>Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a similar problem this morning using an N900.&nbsp; I looked at the Microsoft websites, and saw that they now recommend the server s.outlook.com for Exchange ActiveSync setup.&nbsp; I changed the server address on my email client from m.hotmail.com to s.outlook.com.&nbsp;
 I synced once, and got some emails.&nbsp; I'm not positive that was the problem, but it probably was.&nbsp; I'll check again tomorrow.</p>

    <title>after on-line repair to Office 365, can&#39;t reactivate product - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twf42  say:</h3>
<h2>            after on-line repair to Office 365, can&#39;t reactivate product</h2>
                    Office 365 install failed to remove all Office 2002 components. This week documents created &amp; stored in Word 2013 opened in Word 2002. Setting defaults didn't work since Word 2013 didn't appear as a default program. Did a "quick repair" on Office 365-didn't
 help. Then did "on-line repair" which fixed problem but I was then asked to activate the product (which I had done back in March). This is Home Premium version with 5 users. $ copies are now in use. During activation I was given two options (1) user name and
 password, or (2) product code. Since I didn't have my manager's&nbsp; password (I have email address for MS account), I used product code. Final step required user name and apssword again. Seems if I was given product code as an option this is all I should need.
 Help. It's Saturday and I need to get work done over the week-end.<br />

<br />
</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">I understand that you're trying to activate the Office suite. Let me assist you with this issue.<br />
<br />
How did you purchase the Office suite? Is it online or from a retail store?<br />
<br />
As per the following article, a product key isnâ€™t provided when you buy and download Office online. Instead, the Microsoft account you used during the first Office installation will be linked to the product and will be needed if you need to reinstall.</font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

<font><br />
</font></span><font color="#000000">If you've purchased the Office suite online, I suggest you to get the linked username and password and then try activating the Office suite using it.<br />

<p>I thank you so much for your help. I have been hours on this one. Is the answer 6 or 9? Your formula says 6.

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>can we assume that Conference is in column A, wins in column B and losses in column C?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since the task talks about arrays, here is an array formula, without IF(), though.</div>
<div><br />
<div>=SUM((((B2:B100&gt;25)+(C2:C100&lt;10))&gt;0)*(((A2:A100="B12")+(A2:A100="BE"))&gt;0))</div>
<div><br />
<div>You need to confirm this with Ctrl-Shift-Enter, not just the Enter key.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are allowed to use SumProduct(), then adjust Kevin's formula to the actual ranges:</div>
<div><br />
<div>=SUMPRODUCT(((C2:C100&lt;10)+(B2:B100&gt;25)&gt;0)*(((A2:A100="BE")+(A2:A100="B12")&gt;0)))</div>
<div><br />
<div>This can be entered normally.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The correct result is 9.</div>
<div><br />
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>What are columns B and C?&nbsp; Wins / Losses&nbsp; or the other way around?&nbsp; Based on the question, I'm assuming that's the way it is: 1st column (A) = conference ID, 2nd column = wins, 3rd column&nbsp;= losses.&nbsp; If it were the other way around, answer is zero.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conference (almost) doesn't play into this because of your requirement of "<strong><font color="#000000">from the "BE" conference
<em><u>OR</u></em> the "B12" conference</font></strong>"&nbsp; and all entered are from only those two conferences, but we will assume that somewhere along the line another conference identifier could be introduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, there are a total of 6 entries with wins <em>greater</em> than 25.</p>
<p>There are a total of 9 entries with losses <em>less</em> than 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But once again the requirement is <strong><em><u>OR</u></em></strong> for the scoring.&nbsp;
<strong>I believe the answer should be 9</strong> from observation and interpretation of the requirements.&nbsp; If the scoring had said &gt;25 wins&nbsp;<font color="#000000"><strong><em><u>AND</u></em></strong> &lt;10 losses, then the answer would be 6:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">32 &amp; 2, 27 &amp; 7, 27 &amp; 5, 26 &amp; 6, 26 &amp; 7 and 26 &amp; 9.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Actually, I believe <strong>zorvek</strong>'s formula returns the correct answer of 9.&nbsp; I rewrote it based on A=conference, B = wins and C = losses like this:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">=SUMPRODUCT(((C2:C100&lt;10)+(B2:B100&gt;25)&gt;0)*(((A2:A100="BE")+(A2:A100="B12")&gt;0)))</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">and it shows me 9 here.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Of course this hasn't taken the HINT into consideration at all; just say you ignored the hint and used an array function [SUMPRODUCT()] that internalizes the IFs. :-)</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Now the long-winded proof of this would be something like this formula:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">=COUNTIFS(A:A,"BE",B:B,"&gt;25")+COUNTIFS(A:A,"B12",B:B,"&gt;25")+COUNTIFS(A:A,"BE",C:C,"&lt;10")+COUNTIFS(A:A,"B12",C:C,"&lt;10")-COUNTIFS(A:A,"BE",B:B,"&gt;25",C:C,"&lt;10")-COUNTIFS(A:A,"B12",B:B,"&gt;25",C:C,"&lt;10")</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Where we count the rows where BE is combined with wins &gt;25, add in the rows where B12 is combined with wins &gt;25, add in rows for BE with losses &lt;10 along with rows for B12 with losses &lt; 10 ... that gives you 15 (6 &gt;25, 9 &lt; 10) but is
 incorrect because it is counting the ones that are 'paired' twice, so the last two pieces subtract out those rows where both OR conditions were met: again the result is 9.</font></p>

            <p>Here is another approach using an IF() statement to evaluate each entry individually and then sum up the results at the bottom. I've shown the formula that's in D2 which is then filled down to the end of the list of entries, with a simple =SUM() at the bottom

 just use the one function.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

That's pretty much what the function was designed for.&nbsp; Actually, it was created to do matrix math, but its widest use for years has been to evaluate multi-conditional situations like this one.<br />

<h2>            Default meeting duration of 15 minutes&#63;</h2>
                    The majority of my meetings needs to be brief - just 15 minutes. The shortest default seems to be 30. Is there a way to change this? It's such a pain to have to manually do this every time an appointment is scheduled!

<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your question on changing the default time on your calendar to something other than 30 minutes as a default.

<br />Here is a link that I hope will help you accomplish what you are needing.

            Dear DebbyS821,
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users using my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />Thanks for your question!

    <title>Issues synchronizing SharePoint libraries with OneDrive... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues synchronizing SharePoint libraries with OneDrive...</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About two weeks back, I updated my Windows 10 machine, and ever since then, I have not been able to synchronize SharePoint libraries with OneDrive. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I do not remember what version number it was, and have tried everything I could think of to
 repair this handy feature, including...</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Uninstalled the Groove.exe instance of OneDrive, and installed the new OneDrive.exe instance of the application</p>
<p>- Checked for application / system updates</p>
<p>- Checked registry keys associated to OneDrive</p>
<p>- Re-imaged my machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help that you can provide would be greatly appreciated! &nbsp;I am constantly working within different SharePoints, and having everything synchronized to one central location with OneDrive saves me a enormous amount of time and energy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest you
