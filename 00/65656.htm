<div>In our Windows XP SP2 PC, latest itunes setup installation was successfully downloaded but after starting of it's installation window, it disappears automatically without any error or notification messages even after restarting the PC after emptying TEMP
 folder of running user &amp; temporary disabling AVAST SECURITY according to Apple Support Community advice. So, please help me. Earnestly waiting for your valuable reply.</div>

At first I thought, "Wow - Windows XP SP2 system.&nbsp; Easy to see where that is going wrong..." but to my surprise, the minimum requirement for Apple iTunes: Windows XP Service Pack 2 or later.&nbsp; Wow.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Here in-lies the problem, however; although iTunes may be supported on Windows XP with just SP2 - Windows XP with just SP2 is not supported any longer.&nbsp; You should likely upgrade to SP3 (unless you left out a lot and this is Windows XP Professional 64-bit...?)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
So here is my suggestions:<br />
1) Upgrade to SP3.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
2) Install the MANY patches that were released dependent on SP3.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
3) Cleanup the machine a little:<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a> (&lt;-- link)</li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</a> (&lt;-- link)</li></ul>
<p>Removing everything they find. Rebooting when needed. (You can uninstall one or both when done.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSet Online Scanner</a> (&lt;-- link). Remove anything it finds.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</p>
Reboot.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
4) Download the <a href="https://secure-appldnld.apple.com/iTunes11/041-8597.20130918.PmmEw/iTunesSetup.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
full iTunes installer</a> and SAVE it to your desktop.&nbsp; Restart the computer and THEN run it.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Anything?<br />

            Hi,
<div>Thanks a lot for your valuable advice. According your advice I have successfully installed WinXP SP3 package &amp; update my system from WinXPSP2 . I have re install my OS then install AVAST security 1st. So, there is no question of any threat to my system.
 Then even after temporary disabling the AVAST security, the latest itunes installation starts but disappear automatically without any error or notification messages. So, please advise for further action.</div>

Three things going on - so divided in my quote of your reply...<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1st - you seemingly installed Windows XP SP3 onto your system and (Hopefully) all post-SP3 patches, updates and such.&nbsp; What happened when you attempted to install iTunes then?&nbsp; Or is this not a separate part of your troubleshooting?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
2nd - it looks like you decided a clean slate approach was in order - so you formatted and installed Windows XP cleanly.&nbsp; I have to assume (you did not mention) you also installed all the hardware device drivers direct from the individual hardware device manufacturer(s)
 web site(s) to make sure everything was working and you patched the system to SP3 and all post-sp3 updates *in addition* to installing "AVAST security"?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Given the wording, you then tried to install iTunes onto the clean installed (and fully patched) system and it failed silently...?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Two things:<br />
1) I personally would uninstall the full 'Security" suite that is "Avast Security" and just get the antivirus.&nbsp; The suites - for almost every product out there - are more trouble than they are worth.&nbsp; Heck - it could be your whole issue if it has remained the
 single constant.<br />
2) If you truly did a clean install and fully patch/update Windows XP (including hardware drivers) and the only other thing installed was "Avast Security" - that does two things: first points more towards (1) above and second - unfortunately leaves you with
 contacting Apple support.&nbsp; The second thing is because it says it is supported under Windows XP with SP2 or greater and a clean install is about as ready as you can get for something like that.<br />

<h2>            Trouble signing into my account - Parent&#39;s Permission</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an account with Microsoft more than 12 years now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Skype was working perfectly until a couple of months ago. I tried to sign in, but it would not let me. I thought that overtime it would get better, it is still not working and it is impossible to communicate with the virtual chat that Microsoft has set
 up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message it's showing me is: "Based on your age, we need your parent's permission before you can use this account. Using a web browser, sign in to account.microsoft.com to get your parent's permission and come back to try later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is weird because my parents have never been associated with this account and I am well aver 18 years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to use someone else's account to give me permission, but it did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody else has this issue? Do you guys a solution to this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!<br />

    <title>one touch button for mute control from keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leeasi  say:</h3>
<h2>            one touch button for mute control from keyboard</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am looking for a way to mute the sound from the computer with one button.&nbsp; My previous computer is an IBM Thinkpad and is a far superior product to this in a bunch of ways, not the least of which is that it has 3 independent buttons to control up and volume
 down volume and mute.<br />
<br />
Without such buttons on my new ASUS computer, the only thing that I have found is to use TWO hands and hold down the fn key and hit F12 to engage the mute function.<br />
<br />
How can I accomplish muting the sound with one button (utilizing one hand) ???<br />
<br />
Thanks, in advance!<br />
<br />

            If it is not built into the Keyboard Drivers to do such a thing you will not have any way to do it.&nbsp; You will have to find 3rd party software which is not supported here to do what you want.&nbsp; AutoHotKey can accomplish this but you will have to know how
 to operate the software and we do not provide support for it on the Microsoft Community Site.

            Is AutoHotKey a program?<br />
I looked on Download.com and all it showed me was TempCleaner for Windows XP.<br />
<br />
Also, <br />
Do you know how to adjust the sensitivity of the muse screen on the laptop?<br />
It is too sensitive and every time I go to click the button it moves over a little and it does not click.&nbsp; It takes me several tries to get it to click and it is very hard to press compared to the IBM Thinkpad.<br />

            It will search BIOS for a bootable device and automatically boot from that. So, no, you don't have to.

<h2>            corrupted color of jigsaw pieces</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded to Windows 10 on old Dell Laptop.&nbsp; Playing Big Fish 1001 Jigsaw Earth Chronicles (3 versions), all of the puzzle pieces display only in blue/green spectrum.&nbsp; Got a new HP laptop, installed all updates, installed all purchased Big Fish games from
 their website;&nbsp; same issue.&nbsp; Checked for driver updates etc., tried various resolutions, contacted Big Fish "help", still NOTHING has changed.&nbsp; Colors of puzzle thumbnails are fine; colors of puzzle pieces are wrong--no reds or yellows. &nbsp; This does not happen
 with other 1001 Jigsaw games, only "Earth Chronicles" games.&nbsp; I am out of ideas.&nbsp; Anyone with a solution--please make it simple as I am not a computer nerd, just an old woman. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how difficult it is, when the game won't work the way it should. For us to isolate the issue, we'd like to know more information on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you experiencing the same issue, when you select other categories like Animals, Birds, Landscapes, Flora, Water world, Food, and Humans on the game?</p>
<p>2. Are you able to see the red or yellow color in the original image, and not in the puzzle pieces?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest you to change the background color settings and check if it makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Launch the game.</p>
<p>2. Click on the gear icon.</p>
<p>3. Change the background color and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I'd suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the game. Update us on the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hello, Naveen</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding.&nbsp; I have tried your suggestions but there was no change.&nbsp; This problem happens on 3 games:</p>
<p>1001 Jigsaw Earth Chronicles</p>
<p>1001 Jigsaw Earth Chronicles 3</p>
<p>1001 Jigsaw Earth Chronicles 4</p>
<p>
</p><p>It occurs with every puzzle in all 3 games regardless of puzzle piece numbers, background color, etc. &nbsp; The puzzle image as well as the ghost images are normal, i.e. red strawberries (not blue), blue skies (not ochre), pink flamingoes (not blue), etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not own any other Earth Chronicles puzzle games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does NOT happen with 1001 Jigsaw World Tour London or with 1001 Jigsaw World Tour Asia, the only other 1001 jigsaw games I own.&nbsp; I purchased these all from Big Fish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some searches looking for help, and it seems I am not alone with this issue, but I haven't found any solution.&nbsp; I have read articles that talk about graphics cards, drivers, etc. but this is really beyond my expertise and I am not brave enough
 to try replacing the existing graphics program with something new, not without some guidance.&nbsp; Plus, this is not a life or death issue, but I have PAID for these games, and I used to like them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started on my old Dell laptop once I installed Windows 10, and now that I have a new HP laptop I am still having the problem.&nbsp; All of my games were installed on this new laptop from the Big Fish app, so uninstalling and reinstalling seems like a waste
 of time, but I may do that anyway.&nbsp; I suggested to Big Fish that the creators rewrite the code that seems to be affected by Windows 10 and issue updates for their games, but they haven't responded--well, they did offer me a free game as a replacement, and
 I may have to be satisfied with that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, thanks for your help, even if that means there is no solution.&nbsp; I would like to know if this is fixable or not, so that I won't obsess over it any more.</p>
<p>

<h2>            &#34;Generic host process for win32 services encountered a problem and needed to close&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Lately I've been getting "Generic host process for win32 services encountered a problem and needed to close" errors. It happens after the computer has been up for a while (usually while I'm working with internet explorer, but I'm not sure there is a connection
 to it because I almost always work with it...). When the error pops, if I click it -&nbsp;the computer stops responding completely and I need to&nbsp;shut it down&nbsp;manually.</p>
<p>I'm not completely sure but I suspect the problem started after I installed&nbsp;Avira Premium Security Suite (I had a previous version of Avira antivirus before).</p>
<p>What can I do??</p>
<p>I'd appreciate your prompt reply. <br />
Thank you very much!</p>

 up and I reported it tonight, it has just started doing this over the past few days. I had upgraded to Norton Internet Security 2010, I suspected that the program was causing this, it used to not give an error message and it seem to do it when Norton was doing
 it's updating.&nbsp; I have taken all Norton products off of my PC and have loaded AVG in, the performance seems to be a lot better, however tonight I got the Generic Win 32 has encountered a problem message, and had to shut down manually.</p>
<p>How can this get fixed?</p>
<p>Thank you for your advice.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Lately I've been getting "Generic host process for win32 services encountered a problem and needed to close" errors. It happens after the computer has been up for a while (usually while I'm working with internet explorer, but I'm not sure there is a connection
 to it because I almost always work with it...). When the error pops, if I click it -&nbsp;the computer stops responding completely and I need to&nbsp;shut it down&nbsp;manually.</p>
<p>I'm not completely sure but I suspect the problem started after I installed&nbsp;Avira Premium Security Suite (I had a previous version of Avira antivirus before).</p>
<p>What can I do??</p>
<p>I'd appreciate your prompt reply. <br />
Thank you very much!</p>

            Hi Mario.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You'd have to have saved it in the format required to run a script, as shown here:
<br /><a href="https://itstillworks.com/write-scripts-notepad-8513530.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://itstillworks.com/write-scripts-notepad-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Mario
<br />
<br />Open a new document in Notepad and choose to save it - that will give you the location of your last saved file
<br />
<br />Go to that location in File Explorer
<br />
<br />On the view tab of file Explorer, temporarily turn on 'File Name Extensions'
<br />
<br />Change the file extension on that file to suite your script - that will depend on the language you used, if that was VB, then change the file extension to .vbs, or if you coded a batch file, change the extension to .bat
<br />
<br />Then you just need to double click that file to run the script . . .

    <title>Remote Procedure Call &#40;RPC&#41; - How do I determine if someone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joestop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Procedure Call &#40;RPC&#41; - How do I determine if someone has been accessing my system remotely&#63;&#63;&#63; I believe that someone is.</h2>
                    
<p>I believe that my computer is being accessed remotely, with files and emails being read. I have disabled Remote Access in the Services section, and have also disabled Mobile Sync; I was not using either of these services.</p>
<p>When I come to the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service and open the properties, the LogOn tab has the "This Account" section clicked, "Network Services" typed int he box and a password is set. I am unable to change anything on this properties tab; I cannot
 disable the service or disable the "Undocked Profile". How do I gain access to this service to make changes and more importantly, how can I confirm that someone is logging into my system remotely and checking emails, files, etc. This is NOT a networked system,
 it is my personal computer in my home office. I am running Vista Ultimate.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your anticiapted assistance.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Ultimate also has Group Policies which you can set to help lock down the machine - GPedit.<br />
<br />
Managing Windows Vista Group Policy (Part 1) - see links to Part 2 and 3<br />
<a href="http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/Managing-Windows-Vista-Group-Policy-Part1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/Managing-Windows-Vista-Group-Policy-Part1.html</a><br />
<br />
Remember someone could be accessing your email at the server so be sure to set a new password.<br />
Also does anyone else have physical access to the computer?<br />
<br />
Stopping System Services is not really the best/correct method to provide Security.<br />
<br />
1. Make sure the system is malware free :<br />
<br />
Do a thorough check for malware as no one program detects and removes it all. Added easy to find<br />
malware is often accompanied with harder to discover and remove payloads. Best to be prudent<br />
now than suffer the consequences later.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;them in
<br />
regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone. (If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes - free<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Run the Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool <br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; MRT&nbsp; find at top of list - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You should be getting this tool and its updates via Windows Updates - if needed you can download it here.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(Then run MRT as above.)<br />

<br />
also install Prevx to be sure it is all gone. <br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free - small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security programs. This is
<br />
a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />

2. Set up Security - get a router with a built-in hardware firewall to add to your security.<br />
<br />
Check with your router's maker and their forums as they usually have excellent info.<br />
<br />
Best to use WPA/WPA2 security if available and you can hide the SSID which will help<br />
prevent others from seeing the network (note on some older routers hiding the SSID<br />
causes connection issues and if they find out the name it no longer helps).<br />

    <title>SKYPE for One Drive enterprise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bossartnicolas  say:</h3>
<h2>            SKYPE for One Drive enterprise</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>just purchased yesterday office 365 to use One Drive enterprise solution (already use OneDrive since 2013 for personal use and its awesome!).</p>
<p>Also bought MS Office 2016 licence at the same time.</p>
<p>My question is: yesterday on my One Drive private interface i saw on the right side my SKYPE discussions and interface...this morning it disappeared.</p>
<p>Why? i have merged my MS Office account with my SKYPE account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is too bad because it really worked and it was cool to have Skype and OneDrive on the same page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, My main issue is this: how can i use OneDrive enterprise as a practical and powerful collaborative tool. I do not mean by that only sharing files with my collaborators (who btw still need to buy each a license...) i mean real time work on files, chat....ecc...</p>
<p>thanks for your help</p>
<p>Nicolas</p>

</p><p>What does this mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before this, I tried Memory Management and nothing came up; the loop started over again. I tried youtube online command prompts of bootrec, and it's still the same as before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I just bring the computer in to a tech store and have it fixed?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The /r parameter will read every sector on the disk and search for corruption.&nbsp; If it finds corruption it will likely fix it.&nbsp; It will also check unused portions of the disk for failing storage and if it finds it will remove it from the pool of available
 storage sectors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may fix it, but not likely.&nbsp; This is the first step in a line of diagnostic steps.</p>

                    <p>I have installed an old game, Sim City 4, and have played it for several months on Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now when I try to start it, nothing happens and no processes are seen in the task manager for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not installed anything from when it was working to
 when it stopped working.&nbsp;&nbsp; I only saw some Windows Updates happen on 9/9/2015.</p>

            <p>I found the solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft broke it with update KB3086255 by turning off the safe disk driver.&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on guys I know cd based games are old, Mine is nearly 10 years old, but with such a large and devout user base of old games, you should have made
 it known that you were turning off access to this feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/3086255 </p>
<p>
</p><p>Auto updates are now turning off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next thing I know you will force Windows 7 to stop working.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic">Whenever you change to a new version of Windows, you need to install drivers

    <title>USB 3.1 eXtensible Host Controller problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bitcr  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB 3.1 eXtensible Host Controller problem</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<div>I just don't know where to start. I'm trying to fix this issue for a week now and can't figure it out.<br />
My USB 3.1 eXtensible Host Controller is missing rom my device manager list. It's hiden when i got no usb flash connected to it. As soon as i Connect something to the port, it wakes up and it works fine.<br />
The problemis that i work with audio software, and everytime something is connected or disconnected from my type-c thunderbolt ports, i get a huge latency spike and my soundcard stops the playback.<br />
I tried everything:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- Disabled the "allow the computer t turn off this device to save power" in device manager<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- Changed the power settings in control panel not to suspend USB<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- Tried to install some moded drivers<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- Tried High performance mode<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- Tried other editions of Windows 10. on&nbsp; 1809 doesent even wake the devices until i "scan for hardware changes"<br />
<br />
I have to mention that the standard USB 3.0 Type-A port on my HP specre x360 (2017) works just fine and it is shown in device manager all the time.&nbsp;<br />
I was going to post this on HP forums but i tested it on two more laptops (Lenovo Yoga 530, and HP elitebook), and the&nbsp;USB 3.1 eXtensible Host Controller works this way on both of them. So it must be a OS thing.<br />
Can anyone help me with this issue? I'm losing my mind here. Is this the way windows is handling usb type-c ports? And is there someway i can change this behavior?<br />
<br />
Thank you. :)</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Since it was the same on 3 computers I would suspect the drivers/device is not supported. Best to check with the device maker. Have also seen similar with a cabling issue.<br />

            Hi Bitcr
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />You might need to update your chipset driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try connecting a USB device, when it shows up, try the following steps:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers at the bottom
<br />
<br />Right click each entry then click uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit then restart 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will then redetect them. 
<br />

<h2>            Can I use a prepaid MasterCard to pay for my monthly subscription. </h2>
                    
<p>When I try to purchase a one month live membership with a prepaid MasterCard I get the message, "We couldn't get authorization for this. Try a different or new way to pay. If you have more questions, ask your bank."&nbsp; The funds are on the card.&nbsp; Does Microsoft
 not accept Prepaid cards?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for the support message.</p>
<p>Unfortunately no, Microsoft does NOT accept prepaid Master/Visa Cards to be the payment instrument for a monthly Subscription. &nbsp;However, you can buy a prepaid Xbox LIVE Gold Subscriptions in intervals of 1, 3, or 12 months at your local retailer. &nbsp;You can
 not use Xbox Gift Card either to purchase Gold Subscriptions either because of the auto-renewal feature.</p>
<p>Should you have any other concerns, feel free to post back.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Pen Pressure - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Pen Pressure</h2>
                    <p>Hello!<br />
<br />
I recently purchased my Pro 4 and wanted to draw on things like Paint Tool SAI, but it seems all of the WinTabs that I install do not help solve the issue.
<br />
Is there a way that I can fix the pressure sensitivity?</p>

            <p>I had had a similar corruption problem and have solved it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem likely was the version and build of windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check for windows 10 version click the windows key and the r key at the same time.&nbsp; This opens the run menu.&nbsp; Then type winver</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows 10 version is likely old.&nbsp; It may be 1511 build 10586.494.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was the latest version and build downloadable from the Microsoft web site prior to July 29,2016, the last day for the free upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Performing windows updates as of today 8/5/2016 does not yet install the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The corruption problems detected by sfc /scannow and dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth were fixed by this windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can search for Windows 10 iso download or go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest version is 1607 build 14393.10</p>

<h2>            XBOX One S - Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t install any games</h2>
                    
<p>I bought my XBOX One S yesterday but I can't download any games to it. Nothing installs. All my games were working perfectly on my original XBOX One a few hours before I got my S. I get the error code&nbsp;(0x87e00064) but all my games are clean and like I said,
 worked perfectly fine on my other XBOX One. Somebody please help. This is extremely frustrating. I didn't pay $400 for a console that I can't even play games on!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>INSVIYVN,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Sorry you're having issues installing your games. Do you have any digital titles you can try? That would let you know if there is an issue reading your discs. Historically I've seen that error mean there is something wrong with reading the discs. If digital
 games work, I would suggest unplugging your console and plugging it back in. If you're still having issues try doing a<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> factory reset</a>. If you're still having issues
 past that, I would suggest exchanging your One S for another one if multiple discs do not read, but digital content works with no issues.&nbsp;</p>
