    <title>Windows 10 update lost one of my accounts home directory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oldimmigrant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update lost one of my accounts home directory</h2>
                    <p>After applying a relatively (compared to original Windows 10)&nbsp;innocently looking 'update' 1511 to my home Windows 10 (running happily before), my wife's account home directory disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My own account, with admin privilege, had no problem - perhaps except it took for ever to log in for the first time. However, switching to my wife's account, it took at least that long, and than said 'logging off'.</p>
<p>After that, any further attempt to log in under that account resulted in a quick 'logging off'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back in thru my account, I discovered the account home directory C:/Users/Whoever is not there. Changing that account to 'admin' allows to log in ... but of course, there is nothing in there, not even the Start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were no warnings, complaints etc during the upgrade (which took hours), and I can't find anything relevant in windows update log (well, I don't claim to understand it) nor system logs.</p>
<p>Account files are nowhere to be found (recycle bin, Windows.old or any system wide search).
</p>
<p>More precisely, /Windows.old contains a 'skeleton' for that account (same as for any other user accounts), but no data.
</p>
<p>My suspicion is that something went wrong on the first login attempt (perhaps they try migrating everything to OneDrive and it failed - we have no OneDrive login...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to recover (at least some of) the Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>Could rolling back this 'upgrade' recover the data?</p>
<p>Could it be stored somewhere else (where)?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I just finished the bulk my recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a local account, and I found it hidden below Default.migrated as 'unreadable' (even with admin). The normal search for directory name did not find it (why?!). However, after not finding any of my files&nbsp;using tools for&nbsp;'lost/deleted' I concuded that
 it must be somewhere on the disk, and&nbsp;kept looking directory by directory...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why it got 'stuck' in there (unfortunately, Microsoft does not isclose what their updates do, it would be nice to have a book like 'Inside Windows NT' for update process :-).</p>
<p>It definitely did not get there by user error: just copying it to backup device required numerous user interventions and overrides. Even simply moving it back (where it belongs) required multiple interventions (I am surprized, as in the past moving directory
 did not do anything below it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably there is something wrong in that tree (it reports duplicate filenames in ...IE5), and&nbsp; may be the update failed on that; but WHY&nbsp;the upgrade&nbsp;did not report a failure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway. I also had to fix/rebuild the Start menu for that account (fortunately, there is Google help for that), and now it's back to checking what else is 'broken'.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded two PCs to Windows 10, when playing AVI videos in Windows Media Player 12 the video is reduced in quality and looks pixelated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of three computers running Windows 10 only two are like this and they are both using Nvidia GPUs, the third is a laptop using the integrated Intel HD GPU and it plays AVI videos correctly. The GPU is the only thing I can think of that is causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other media players work fine, it is only WMP12 that has this problem and I would prefer to use WMP12 as it is the only player fully integrated into the OS UI and right-click context menu that isn't the crummy "Movies &amp; TV" app.</p>

This post</a> from 2014 is a related question regarding the same issue in Windows 8.1 that was marked as answered but the marked "answer" does not solve the issue. There is something that Microsoft changed between Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 that initiated this
 problem. The reply in that thread from Peter__G indicates that my theory of the problem being related to Windows 8.1 and higher with Nvidia GPUs could be true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have proven that this is related to Nvidia GPUs and Windows Media Player 12 on Windows 8 or higher. See my third post below</p>

<h2>            Cancelling a past due renewal</h2>
                    
<p>I've run into trouble with my xbox live account. Recently I logged on and wasn't able to connect to xbox live because apparently my payment was past due. I remember going through the process to stop auto-renewal a couple of years ago but apparently it was
 turned back on or something and because I didn't use my xbox for a couple of month I was never notified that my subscription status was nearly up. I just want to downgrade to the silver membership so that I can continue to use my xbox for netflix as I'm not
 really interested in playing online games right now but apparently they've already charged me for the current year (although my credit card expired).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm wondering if there's anything that I can do to downgrade my membership to silver because I don't have the money to pay for another year membership at the time being. Do I just need to create a new account and leave my current one until/if I can renew
 it?</p>

    <title>FIFA 11 Wierd Achievement Glitch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> musept23  say:</h3>
<h2>            FIFA 11 Wierd Achievement Glitch</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>to start I don't know if this is the correct forum to be posting this but I didn't find anywhere else to post so, if this is not the correct place please tell where it is and I will post there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason to why I'm posting this is due to a very wierd glitch in my achievement list in FIFA 11:</p>
<p>The achievement "Hundred and Counting" is supposed to unlock when we play 100 rnaked games over xbox live... now look at this video in my youtube channel and you will understand why this is a major glitch and I don't know how this will be corrected:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9SHt1V_WOg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9SHt1V_WOg</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/j9SHt1V_WOg?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/j9SHt1V_WOg?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p><span>As you can see in the first part of the video, in the my player hub I have 158 ranked matches played and 103 wins<br />
<br />
The achievement is for playing 100 ranked games, you don't have to win, just play, but I've waited till I won more than 100 to see if this got corrected but nothing...<br />
<br />
As you can see next in the overview of the game it says I have 44 of 46 achievements unlocked for 800GS...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now the weird part, when I enter the Fifa 11 achievement details it says I have 45 of 46 and the "hundred and counting" is there at the bottom but the 100GS hasn't been credited...</span></p>
<p><span>This video was recorded in December of 2010, now I have 210 games played, 139 wins - 49 Losses - 22 Draws and still have the same problem... this is the only achievement I have left to get the full 1000G on the game and in a page it says I have all
 the achievements and the full 1000G, but in the overview it says I have 900G and 45 out of 46 achievements unlocked!!<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had this problem? What can I do to fix this?? Is this fixable by support center of Microsoft?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for the help</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why are my files not copying to my USB, and how do i fix it&#63; - FIXED</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a university student in need of help urgently with my USB pen drives, being on an art course, i frequently need use of a USB pen drive in order to back up and transport my work. However recently i've been unable to copy files onto my pen drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run on Windows 7 Home Premium (64-bit) where at first instance, the files copy and paste fine on my pen drive, however when i remove the USB (even if i safely remove it) and plug it back in to check on the files, the copied files are either corrupted or
 simply disappear. I do not believe it is the USB itself, as i attempted copy pasting with two different pen drives with the same result - corrupted or missing files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to restore my computer to an earlier point (albeit by two days - the only available restore point) without success, and there appear to be no issues with Windows under a SFC SCANNNOW prompt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as i am totally stuck in the dark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE</p>
<p>Ran a quick format after reading more and more on the same subject, appears to have fixed the USBs for now as they are holding the files after removal. May or may not be due to viruses even though a scan did not pick up anything.&nbsp;</p>

I attempted to investigate the cause and the Microsoft storage space controller&nbsp; stated that,&nbsp; it is not&nbsp; working properly.

 waiting for Windows to find another driver&nbsp; suitable and there was none. Can you please help?&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Skype immediately hangs up call - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> norm sash-ns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype immediately hangs up call</h2>
                    <p>Win10, Surface Pro 3, Skype 11.19.856</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've cancelled my Skype subscription because I haven't been able to get any value out of Skype due to it's many problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to place a call via Skype, it immediately hangs up the call.&nbsp; I'm not sure that it ever gets to the point where the ring goes through although I do hear the ring on my end.&nbsp; But it just rings a couple times then hangs up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the temp folder and cleared out the appdata area.&nbsp; Uninstalled Skype and reinstalled.&nbsp; Still no change in the behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly related, although I'm not sure, is that it takes 30 seconds to 1 minute for Skype settings to show current settings.&nbsp; The settings panel opens fine, but it takes about 30-60 seconds for the current setting values to populate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas about either problem?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, Marites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to focus just on Skype &lt;&gt; Skype calls for right now.&nbsp; I would like to get that working before looking at Skype &lt;&gt; Phone calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all current updates on Win10 and I've reinstalled Skype from the Windows Store.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When doing a Skype &lt;&gt; Skype call it immediately hangs up.&nbsp; It happens for multiple contacts... I don't know if it happens for every contact I have, but it fails for every contact that I have tried.&nbsp; I've not been able to have a successful call yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also created a new Win10 profile and the same thing happens on the new profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens when I'm using wireless on the Surface Pro 3 or when I'm plugged into the dock and using Ethernet.</p>

            no idea if this is the latest thread on this, the latest update killed skype for me with the same problem above, and many others.&nbsp; The confusion between desktop, web, classic, WIN10 and business has intensified, not abated.&nbsp; My belief at this point is
 that MS is trying to get out of the skype game and hoping we'll all migrate away to google or other solutions.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no other explanation than incompetence so severe that it seems less probable than the former explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server 2008 R2, formerly known as Terminal Services in Windows Server 2008 and previous versions, is one of the components of Microsoft Windows
 (both server and client versions) that allows a user to access applications and data on a remote computer over a network, using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Terminal Services is Microsoft's implementation of thin-client terminal server computing, where
 Windows applications, or even the entire desktop of the computer running Terminal Services, are made accessible to a remote client machine. The client can either be a full-fledged computer, running any operating system as long as the terminal services protocol
 is supported, or a barebone machine powerful enough to support the protocol with terminal services, only the user interface of an application is presented at the client. Any input to it is redirected over the network to the server, where all application execution
 takes place.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>Terminal service is called as remote desktop service.</p>
<p>Remote Desktop Services allows computers on a local area network (LAN) to connect to a server (also called a remote computer) and run programs located on the server. This can save organizations time and money because they only need to install
 programs on a few servers.</p>
<p>Remote Desktop Connection uses Remote Desktop Services technology to allow one computer to remotely control another. Some other features that use Remote Desktop Services technology include RemoteApp, Remote Desktop Web Access,
 and RemoteApp and Desktop Connections.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am unable to get the details(CPU Util,Swap Util) from windows machine using SNMP(SNMP4j.jar). The SNMP service is running on the target Windows XP system.Where can I find the correct OID for windows XP to retreive these parameters?</p>
<p>Attaching code below:</p>

<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What exactly happens when you try to start the Ares program?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you receive any error message?</p>
<p><br />
According to the Ares website Ares 3.1 is compatible to work with Windows 7. I would suggest that you download Ares 3.1 from the link provided below and check if the issue persists.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting IP address on your device to access the router issues are best handled by the Internet Service Provider support. We suggest contacting your Internet provider to have further assistance on how to set the IP address on your phone.</p>

<p>Thank you for the quick response. That was a good answer but it doesn't resolve my problem. The main problem here is the speed of access to the router and the speed of resolving the problems
<span>accordingly to the situations which may </span>occur. If I should contact the Internet Service Provider support every time when something similar is needed, it
<span>drastically slows down the time of resolving issues and problems on the field of work.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>But I think I understand your answer and politics about this topic. It's about the Privacy &amp; Security problems, which are your main concern here. I would still wish to know one thing:
</span>Why is this option available and simple for Windows 10 (Lap-top or PC), but it is unavailable for Windows 10 Phone?

<h2>            Skype on Android TV box won&#39;t connect to Logitech C920 webcam</h2>
                    I have an Android (V. 7.1) H96 4k Ultra HD TV Box and a Logitech C920 Pro web cam set up to use in my office conference room. &nbsp;The webcam works fine with several of the camera apps on my Android TV Box. However, the Skype app will not connect to the camera
 (no video or audio - the camera itself shows no indication of being active during echo test). The Android TV Box advertised as Skype compatible as does the camera. In my searches there is little to no information regarding solutions for this particular problem.
 &nbsp;Are there any technical workarounds available to deal with this issue?

</p><p>I appreciate your suggestion however we are rolling out the Skype updates on the application itself, thus using third-party application might have a risk or there is no guarantee that it will work.

<h2>            Reading IPHONE from USB connection</h2>
                    <p>I think Windows upgrade degraded my computer's ability to read my Apple Iphone when I plug it into a USB port. It says "Apsple Mobile Device USB Drive can't work properly with USB.3.0. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had a problem until a few weeks ago and have no idea why it occurred. I made no changes which would affect the connection.</p>

<p>I would like to see all the functions of the menu bar in Edge.&nbsp; It's fast but lacks a great deal of function.&nbsp; Internet Explored is much slower executing scripts than in 8.1 but has the best function.&nbsp; I am using Mozilla Firefox until Microsoft finishes
 developing Edge.</p>

</p><p>I have no idea at what level in the monolith you function but , as a Microsoft employee you could have&nbsp;avoided wasting your customers time and forwarded this thread to the developers yourself pointing out that this is a blindingly obvious basic requirement
 that requires fixing ASAP. Had you done so we&nbsp;might not be in the same ongoing predicament apparently six months down the line. This is not a request for a software enhancement that requires popular support to justify the time investment.&nbsp; This is the restoration
 of an essential that has been present in predecessor browsers since year dot. Has anything at all be done about&nbsp;this in the interim?</p>

            I concur - if Microsoft are serious about getting Edge adopted they should at least integrate basic functions like this into it.

<p>Place a bookmarklet in Favorites Bar. Instead of URL, use the&nbsp; following text:</p>
<p>javascript:location.href='mailto:?SUBJECT='+document.title+'&amp;BODY='+escape(location.href);</p>
<p>It will open the default "mailto:" handler. If you set Outloook for this, it will open this program.</p>
