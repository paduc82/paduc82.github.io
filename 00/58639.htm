<h2>            How do I make my Windows phone show up like it used to in File Explorer when I plug it in&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It used to show up automatically but I never needed it to do anything but charge the battery so perhaps I clicked something a few months ago to stop that box from appearing every time that I plug the phone in with the USB. That OR as I've been fighting fixing
 this SICK PC (see my horrendously long Q at&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/please-help-me-with-my-sick-windows-10-pc/e6066b14-e8cb-4781-9c5e-7d42773fe690">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/please-help-me-with-my-sick-windows-10-pc/e6066b14-e8cb-4781-9c5e-7d42773fe690</a>&nbsp;),
 I was told to set some items not to start up automatically at login using Task Manager's Startup tab. But on that idea, I've looked there and I can't see anything that might affect the Phone Companion from even recognizing that I've connected the phone and/or
 that would make the phone never show up suddenly in File Explorer when I connect it via USB as I think that it should. But, the phone's battery does always charge full time when I connect that USB cable and the phone displays that little CHARGING icon in the
 upper right on the main screen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So help please. And I'm sure it will come up in any Reply that I have all updates so let me tell you that I did a Clean Install startover of Windows 10 on this PC a month or so ago and went thru all the steps of updating drivers, installing APPs aka programs,
 importing my Docs, Music, Photos and Videos from a USB stick that I stuck into that same USB port and my PC and the Outlook 2013 both use my outlook.com email address for everything.<br />
AND the phone is less than a month old to me. It is a Nokia Lumia 635 that I was sent from T-Mobile on warranty exchange. Just in case it matters to anyone, this phone did used to connect and show up in File Explorer before I did that Clean Install of Windows.
 I'm just now checking it for the first time since then since it has never mattered. I'd never wanted to transfer any files and I've only been using the cable for a long time to charge the battery every day.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>1) What is the make and model number of your computer and phone?</p>
<p>ACER Aspire ZC-102 All-in-One desktop that is now Windows 10 and IE-11 and Nokia Lumia 635 with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>2) Are you able to connect other devices to your computer? <br />
Yes, I have a Brother scanner/printer and a Brother color laser connected thru USB to a Dynex switch that shares them with another Windows XP 9150 Dell. I also have a&nbsp;Linksys Wi-Fi router connected via cable and wirelessly.&nbsp;My mouse and keyboard are plugged
 in with USB cords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Did you connect the same phone with a different computer and check? I don't use any other computers but I did just take the cable and phone over to the Windows XP Dell and it also didn't appear in My Computer when I plugged it in, as it should. So I guess
 this tells me that the issue is in the phone and not in my computer so I guess I should skip the rest of what you said about drivers and Device Manager since that was totally confusing anyhow since there&nbsp;is a TON of USB stuff and I wouldn't have a clue as
 to how to figure out which one is which.<br />
The main reason this is all coming up anyhow is because I'm about to get a replacement phone from T-Mobile for this faulty phone that they've determined is hardware related and causes it to do stupid stuff. Part of the process of making sure that everything
 is backed up and can be transferred to the replacement phone tomorrow is to connect it via cable and transfer copies to my PC so that I can install it on the replacement. I guess that's not an option. GRRRR</p>

            <p>Help please maybe? I took my phone in and T-Mobile gave me a 'certified OK' replacement i.e. a used piece that someone else returned for some unknown reason. But when I plug it in to my Windows 10 computer, just as with the other version of this same Nokia
 Lumia 635,&nbsp;all that happens is that I hear the phone beep telling me that the connection worked and it is getting slowly charged. This is what also happened before with the other one which is why I'd asked this Question.</p>
<p>The Phone Companion software never opens nor is it visible, as it should be, if I look in File Explorer.</p>
<p>So I tested another micro-USB to USB cable and that also did all the same stuff. Then I plugged it in to my Windows XP Tablet Edition with each of those two cables and each time it popped up a little box near the Task Bar clock saying that a new USB hardware
 device had been noticed and what did I want to do such as Install From A CD or Install From A Location On C:?<br />
So, I skipped all of that as I don't use that old XP Tablet. I need to get Phone Companion working again on my Windows 10 ACER Aspire ZC-102 All-in-One desktop PC like it used to automatically when I would plug in my phone to charge it.</p>

</p><p>My replacement phone also doesn't show up in File Explorer so it obviously also doesn't pop open that
 Phone Companion software that is apparently built into Windows. I used to see this and I'd just ignore it since all I wanted to do was charge my Nokia's battery, which it does just fine even though it charges slower than by using their special wall plug-in
 110volt charger.</p>
<p>But, this new phone also would do anything on the T-Mobile store's tech help/cashier computers. So either Microsoft or Nokia must</p>
<p>have changed something sometime in the past year or so.</p>
<p>I can't keep up with this world. It's changing all the time at such a high rate of speed.</p>
<p>I'm not afraid of speed but this world is going crazy. I don't even know how tech companies are able to keep up.

It says at that link, "</p>
Prerequisites
<p><strong>To apply this hotfix, you must be running Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012</strong>.
</p>
<p>Also, I'd already mentioned that my phone also isn't noticed by Windows when I plug it in to a USB port on my old Windows XP Dell Dimension 9150. My phone is my 4th Nokia Lumia 635. These things are pretty troublesome but luckily T-Mobile keeps giving me
 replacements even though I got my first one from them for Christmas 2-1/2 years ago. That to me tells me that they must be known to be a phone that has more than its share of problems. They've tried their hardest to get me to move over to an iPhone or an Android
 but I'm a longtime user of Windows smartphones since they'll ActiveSync with my computer's Outlook.
<br />
I used to need to run Microsoft ActiveSync manually with all of my Motorola MPx-220 phones that are in this image but then Nokia Lumia 635s came out and I was super jazzed to move up from my old flip-phones to something more modern. But boy has this thing been
 a source of never ending grief.<br />

            I've not heard back which concerns me. Also, perhaps Microsoft altered the Hotfix so that it couldn't be run on Windows 10 machines as it had mentioned that
<strong>To apply this hotfix, you must be running Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012</strong> on July 4th when I tried it.&nbsp;Now it won't even load the hotfix's page when I click that link and wait forever even though&nbsp;my IE can go to any other site.<br />
Help please.&nbsp;

            <p>No luck yet. Doing that Clean Boot didn't make my phone show up when I plug in the USB&gt;Micro USB cable to it&nbsp;while my computer is in File Explorer like it used to.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell you something odd that happened since I've done Clean Boots before and oddly, this time it wasn't the same as it used to. Maybe Microsoft has changed something?</p>
<p>Anyhow, when I typed msconfig into Cortana's Ask me anything and picked System Configuration - Desktop APP, after I unchecked Load startup items and then I went to the Startup tab, it always used to have a checkbox down in the lower left that would make
 it hide all Microsoft items. But nothing is on that page now at all and it just has a link to Open Task Manager where it says to manage them at. THAT's new.</p>
<p>What the heck?<br />
I did go to Task Manager with that link and Disable everything but it did no good even after a reboot.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Support Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Last time I upgraded to Windows 8,0, I lost most of my programs and applications - they no longer worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I want to make sure Windows 10, will be more sensitive in accepting and working with my programs and applications.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried to contact Microsoft Support:&nbsp; Went to MICROSOFT SUPPORT web page:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Chat - It would not connect, just spin and spin and spin</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Call Me as Soon as Possible - It would not load.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Schedule a call - It would not load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought about using the DISCUSSION area.&nbsp; Could not remember my password, so I clicked on link to password sent to me - AGAIN, it would not connect, just spin and spin and&nbsp; spin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a simple list showing what Windows 10 is compatible with, both programs and apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is support going to get better, or worse?</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP&nbsp; - Mike in So. California</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, I suggest you to answer the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you trying to upgrade to Windows 10 and want to save the applications and programs?</li><li>What programs and applications are you trying to check the compatibility with Windows 10?</li></ol>
<p><span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> is designed to be compatible with the majority of devices and apps that are currently available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For details about your specific devices and apps, check the compatibility report that is a part of the Get
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> app. To do this, open the Get <span>
Windows&nbsp;10</span> app, select the menu in the upper left corner of the app, and then select
<span>Check your PC</span> (or <span>Your PC is good to go</span>) to see any known compatibility issues and recommended resolutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post to us with more information for the above to help you better.</p>

            <p>Free support - from Microsoft and everyone else - is only going to get worse. Basically, you get what you pay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With one exception: The web is still free and with research you will learn everything you need to know. Since installing a new operating system is the most technically difficult thing you can do to a computer, you'll want to do
<em>lots</em> of research. I spent literally days scouring the web to learn as much as I could about doing a clean install. I made a complete plan, including what to do if things didn't work. Then I spent more days learning about Windows 10 and all its new
 features. It was a lot of work, yes, but when the Big Day came, I was <em>ready</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No surprise, then, that my clean install went off perfectly on the first try. No problems. And I haven't taken a single class in computer engineering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you want your install to succeed - really succeed - then forget Microsoft technical support and get to work on the web. If you do that, one of two things will happen: You'll have an excellent installation experience or you'll understand why most people
 prefer to simply buy a computer with the operating system already installed. There's no shame in that.</p>

            With any antimalware, including Defender, you are relatively MORE safe than you are without it.  But new attack strategies can sneak through anyone. Especially if you visit hazardous sites.

<p>I would move this question to the ambassador-specific forums.</p>
<p>You might be able to ask an admin if they could change the e-mail on your ambassador account, but you -can't- alter it once your registered. You're having a problem because there is no option to do what you want to do.</p>
<p>but see what they can do in the ambassador forums. I'm inclined to agree with the other advice givers, in that the e-mail that they usually use is associated with your gamertag. After all, you use your gamertag to log in on the ambassador website, so they
 are forever linked.</p>

<p>Hey again aVeRsioN X! Can you tell us how recently you signed up for the Ambassador program? Also, did your personal email perhaps used to be your main Microsoft Account email? Have you recently changed it from that email?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also want to confirm that the email isn't listed in your <a href="https://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I signed up about a month ago or a bit earlier. I was on vacation and just now realized I received an email that I was removed from the program - with no reason given. I looked up all the possible reasons to be removed and none of them applied to me. I never
 violated any rules or got a Code of Conduct ban. The other reason says it could be ''inactive for over 60 days'' - I haven't even been a member for that long I don't think and I was actively doing some ambassador chat on LIVE messenger and helping people before
 all of this happened. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Is there a way I can actually look up why I might have been removed? I really do want to help the Xbox community on my spare time.</p>

            I have confirmed that it's a Surface Pro hardware issue, and will get an exchange from Best Buy. I tested my USB 3.0 drive on the floor model of Surface Pro at Best Buy and it recognized the drive right away. Although, the floor model is a 64gb instead
 of 128gb... I wonder if it's possible that there's a difference between the two...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the comments!<br />

            Whew... I was finally able to fix this!
<div><br />
<div>After I did the complete reset to factory defaults and ran into the issue again, I tried the steps from the plugable.com guide again. This time I didn't reboot the second time, and just installed&nbsp;iusb3hub.inf to the unknown device right after iusb3xhc.inf&nbsp;and
 it took! No more memory_management BSOD!</div>
<div><br />
<div>One thing to note is that when I installed the driver version 1.0.7.248, it broke my wireless somehow and started having random BSOD. (I think it's&nbsp;due to the version number difference because the inf files are pointed to 1.0.6.245) I found the older driver
 below and reinstalled it, and the wireless has no problems now.</div>

<h2>            Enabling Windows Fax and Scan fax transmission log files</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,<br />
I'm using Windows Fax and Scan in Windows 7 to send faxes and it's working great.<br />
What I'm missing though is the ability to create a list of which fax transmissions were successful.&nbsp; I can see the list in the "Sent Items" pane but need them in text form. No export option is available for this list.<br />
I've searched the web and read about Windows Fax and Scan send and receive file logs that are disabled by default and must be enabled manually.<br />
The directory Windows Fax and Scan uses in my PC (can be found under the Tools/Fax Settings/Advanced menu) is in my case:<br />
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows NT\MSFax<br />
I can see the received and sent fax images in the Inbox and SentItems sub-directories, however the ActivityLog sub-directory is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found several threads on the web about enabling fax logs in various Windows Server versions, but no mention of it regarding WIN7.</p>
<p>Anyone know how to do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Acer Aspire 7551 slow internet download speed.</h2>
                    I am working on an Aspire 7551 laptop.Internet connection is from Comcast.Running through a Linksys/Cisco e900 router.Advertized speed is 8mbps download.When I check the speed at various speed test sites the best I get is 512kbps.I have tried running directly
 off the modem.Same result.After trying countless options I then ran my old Dell D600 running Windows 7.Connecting with the wifi on my laptop I got 6mbps download.Both computers are using the internal wifi cards.Both are Broadcom.I have tried everything I can
 think of with no results.Upload speed is fine.

            I found a couple of references.<br />
<p>Two registry settings that seem to prevent or alleviate the throttling are: </p>
<p>(DWORD value) HKLM\system\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanworkstation\parameters\DisableBandwidthThrottling (create if it doesn't exist and set to 1 to disable and then reboot)
</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Multimedia\SystemProfile\NetworkThrottlingIndex (set to a value between 1 and 100 and reboot)
<br />
</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>windows 8 canon d760 imageclass printer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows 8 canon d760 imageclass printer</h2>
                    <p>Im working with a low income housing apartment complex. They upgraded some of the office equiptment. They replace the main office computer that is using windows 8 and I'm trying to use the main office printer ( Canon d760 imageclass printer). I have contacted
 Canon about trying to get a driver and they advised me to contact Microsoft as Canon does not have a printer driver to support windows 8. Is there anyway to get this printer to work with windows 8? The compaines budget cannot afford to update the printer.
 Is there any assistance on this printer problem. It would put this complex back on track for the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you..</p>

<h2>            How To Create Bootable DVD for Windows 10 &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've just successfully upgraded to the Free Windows 10 Home&nbsp;and want to create a Bootable DVD for a future (I hope not) crash so I can recover. My computer is an HP Desktop (500-314) with AMD Processor, 8 GB Memory and 2 TB Hard Drive.&nbsp; What is recommended?&nbsp;
 EDIT 8.Aug.2015: How much DVD memory is required for the Boot Disc ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Related Question: Windows 10 appears to have a method to answer my initial question [ie:

<p>Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; [sub-selection] Save backup copies of files with Save File History &gt; System Image Backup &gt; [choice]:

    <title>Reinstalling Windows 10 after upgrading from Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reinstalling Windows 10 after upgrading from Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and have been using for over a year and half, also running dual-boot with a Linux distro, until ESET update irrecoverably crashed my Windows 10 and it was no longer possible to revive the loader. I've tried multiple
 options, including contacting ESET support but none of it worked so I decided to reinstall Windows 7 (which I had the key to) unaware it is possible to reinstall Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the Windows 10 folders are said to be stored in the Windows.old directory and I presume they are, my question is - can I still reinstall Windows 10 without trouble? I've read the activation of the product should happen automatically, however I am concerned
 because I've reinstalled Windows 7 first.</p>

</p><p><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be
 stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.</span></p>

</p><p><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.&nbsp;</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through

<p>Hello,</p>

<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>What is the battery status when the charger is connected to Surface? (e.g. plugged in, not charging, battery not detected, etc.)</li><li>Where did you purchase the new power adapter? Was your friend's charger similar to the original power supply that came with your Surface?</li><li>Can you confirm which Windows version and OS Build is installed on your Surface? Just click the
<strong>Cortana</strong> icon and type <em>winver</em>, then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your reply.</p>

<h2>            After system restore, all built in apps and the windows store stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I performed a system restore on my computer and after the second time all the built in apps turned grey and had these exclamation points at the bottom right corner. Over time I the movies and TV, calendar and calculator app worked but nothing else did. The
 Store icon disappeared but there is a space where it should be but when I click it, it pops out for a split second and doesn't open. Help. Please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Just to clarify the only apps that work are calendar, movies and calculator everything else is grey and has exclamation points</p>

            <p>Windows 10 Home (x64)&nbsp;build 10586.63</p>
<p>1 Microsoft account</p>
<p>2 local accounts</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a very similar issue. I did a system restore back to about a week ago. Since then, I've had a few interesting things take place...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Photos app crashes on open for Microsoft account. Appears to work normally for local accounts.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Edge browser is slow on initial web page load, further use appears to load quick. This has not been tested for local accounts.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Any store app that shows a map (Maps app, Weather, etc) shows a location icon, but the map itself is completely blank. This happens on all accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting steps taken:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> chkdsk /f /r</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> sfc /scannow</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> DISM (can't remember full command to repair windows image corruption)</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Created local accounts for testing in case creating a new account corrected it. it did not.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> attempted powershell method to repair built-in windows store apps. This broke them worse, requiring another system restore, which put me back to square 1. (See Issues above)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only issues with the system are the things system restore broke. It seems System Restore is not yet stable in Windows 10. If possible, I'd like to try to avoid a Windows reset, or fresh install, unless I have no other choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>Windows 10 (x64) Build&nbsp;10586.71</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the latest update, the photos app, and Edge seem to be working again, but the maps are still screwed up. I'm still investigating the system to see if anything else is malfunctioning.</p>

<h3> jeong-hun  say:</h3>
<h2>            PERMANENTLY remove Folders &#40;Desktop, Documents, Downloads...&#41; in Explorer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft added Folders below "This PC" on the left and above "Devices and drives" on the right. Microsoft may have put them to help users, but I do not need them, and frankly they are getting in my way. They are very annoying especially on the tree, because
 they are placed above the drives such as "C" or "D", making me sometimes scroll down to find the drive I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are registry hacks (deleting the entries). I have downloaded the ".reg" file and executed it. Folders were gone, but the problem is that they always come back somehow. I do not know what triggers this, but after days or months, they always come
 back. Is there any way to PERMANENTLY remove them?&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you that rather than removing it you may try to disable it from the Windows Explorer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so, <strong>right click</strong> on a blank space in the left side of the explorer and
<strong>uncheck </strong>the favorites or the </span><span>libraries which you want.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would also like to inform you that&nbsp;Microsoft don't support removing of libraries as it is an integrated part of Windows and&nbsp;we cannot recommend you a software for the purpose you have mentioned. We can definitely help you with technical issues with
 Windows. Regarding your query, we hope that someone with expertise on such software helps you. You may also use your favorite search engine to look for reviews of such software done by trusted technical sites and decide based on those reviews.</span></p>

            <p>Sorry, but this answer is not answering the question and I find it irresponsible and a bit arrogant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is about under "This PC". Your first paragraphs do not solve the exact demand.&nbsp; It's a possible workaround for users wanting to completely disable them and wanting their left pane behave with the other consequences of such approach. It's OK
 and usefull to mention it, but please don't write as a means to give the total answer a feeling of "We dó listen to our users, but it's you who don't listen to us."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, libraries and such folders being an integrated part of Windows might be true, but showing them under "This PC" certainly is not!&nbsp; The registry hack proves it. Just make it possible to make it permanent or admit this is frustrating for some users
 and M$ will not listen to those users or just make it possible in an upgrade. (Windows 10 still has this "inability".)<br />
This is an invalid argument, a lousy excuse.<br />

    <title>Fresh Win7 SP1 installation says convenience rollup does not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blueprints  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fresh Win7 SP1 installation says convenience rollup does not apply&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My mother's HDD went to meet its maker the other day, and I was elected to fix the situation. After installing a new HDD, loading Win7 SP1 and KB3020369, I attempted to save a few days of updating by installing the new rollup. However, the update keeps insisting
 it does not apply to this machine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not understand. This is a fresh installation. There are no updates (beyond KB3020369) on this machine, yet it refuses to install. I double checked -- Win7 has been activated, and both the OS and the rollup are x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why this is not working?</p>

<p>They are referring to the Local Cast app for Android. I am also having this problem not only woth local cast but any app that has the casting ability. Netflix, youtube, etc... are no longer seeing the xbox one on the cast to device list like it used to.
 Was there an update that removed this feature of casting directly to the xbox??</p>

<p>Sometimes a weak <span>CMOS</span> battery can cause various issues including slow, locking as well as other unexplained performance issues.<br />
This is fairly rare but the battery is relatively easy to replace, check your motherboard/computer manual for replacement details.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggest that you <b><i>first</i></b> rule out malware as the cause of the issue by doing the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><i>I.</i>- Clean up the system (clearing out all the temp/tmp folders, and included all offline content, clearing the browser tif, delete cookies.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do a disk cleanup. click the start button. in the search box, type <b>d<i>isk cleanup</i></b><span><span>, and then, in the list of results, click disk cleanup. Best and easier to use - ccleaner.</span></span></p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We recommend you to perform in-place upgrade i.e. repair install of Windows and install all the available updates on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Important:</strong> Performing in-place upgrade will restore the computer to a state when you installed Windows the first time. The installed programs on the computer will not be affected. You'll be prompted again to install all the updates you
 installed earlier. We strongly recommend you to backup all the data before you proceed with the steps as executing the steps incorrectly will remove data from the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To perform in-place upgrade, try the following steps:<br />
a. Close all the applications, insert the Windows DVD in the computer's DVD drive.<br />
b. On the Setup window, click Install Now.<br />
c. Click Go online to obtain the latest updates for installation (recommended). <br />
d. Type the CD key if you are prompted to do this. <br />
e. Click Yes to accept the Microsoft Software License Terms. <br />
f. On the Which kind of installation do you want? screen, click Upgrade. <br />
g. When the installation is complete, restart your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
