<h2>            Network Address Translation &#40;NAT&#41; in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I have a laptop which came with Windows 8. I tried to find the following information in the support pages from Microsoft, but could not. I also ran a search in this forum and came up empty. If I am making a redundant post it is unintentional.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently installed a wireless firewall router on my home network to begin making things more secure. I have gone through initial installation and set up, but have not gone through all of the security options yet. Connectivity to the Internet is working
 fine, but I am having problems connecting with other devices on my local network. I ran the troubleshooter on the Windows 8 machine and it complained there were two devices on my network doing Network Address Translation (NAT) and that although Internet connectivity
 would likely not be interrupted it could cause other network problems. Since this is what I am experiencing I believe this is the likely problem. As of the moment, I only have the router, the Windows 8 laptop and my MyBookLiveDuo external storage unit turned
 on. And of course the connection to the Internet. Since I know the Duo is not doing NAT, I assume it is that Windows 8 is doing it in addition to the router.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Problem is I can find no information on Windows 8 doing NAT or how to turn it off. I run Norton Internet Security and have Windows Firewall and Windows Antivirus turned off. I cannot see the MyBookLiveDuo from the laptop, yet I could before I installed
 the router and in fact I could see it for a time after I turned the router on and finished initial set up. Oddly enough, I cannot see the Duo at all when I am connected to the network via the wireless on my laptop, yet when I plug in a cable and connect to
 the same network directly I can see the Duo, but cannot access the shares on it. This makes me think again it is strange behavior due to two devices trying to do NAT.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I ran the troubleshooter I got a network diagnostics log file, but it is not text and I do not know how to open it to see if there is more information to help me figure this out. The log file is named,&nbsp;</div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>

<td>802B35DF-3D94-441C-BB9C-EECB1CFA959A.Diagnose.0.etl</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
<div>Can anyone tell me how to open this? Has anyone had issues with setting up a router on the network with a Windows 8 machine? In case it matters to anyone who may be able to help, the router is a Cicso RV110W Wireless VPN Firewall Router. Either it is this
 NAT problem or some other kind of compatibility issue and frankly I do not have the diagnostic tools to track it down. Support from Microsoft on Windows 8 issues has been very poor and I am trying to avoid the inevitable finger pointing by Microsoft and Cisco
 at one another to duck having to try to get to the bottom of this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone has any ideas on how to figure this out, please let me know. I will be trying to find more out by doing some research as well.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sincerely,</div>
<div>Gregg.</div>

<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>

<p>I would recommend you to post the query on TechNet Forum which, I am sure, would help you in a better way. As the issue is related to NAS it would be better suited in IT pro forums as they are experts in this.</p>

            Wow.<br />
<br />
Such a well written description of the problem and probably the worst response ever.<br />
<br />

PranavMishra5582&nbsp;</a> even read the question?<br />
<br />
NAT&nbsp; = network address translation<br />
<br />
NAS =&nbsp; network accessible storage<br />
<br />
This issue is affecting others.&nbsp; I suppose I'll have to search a public forum as help from MS is apparently useless.<br />

            <p>Don't think your problem is still actual, but anyway.</p>
<p>You doesn't give important information for this case: are IP addresses on your local devices from same network with same mask?</p>
<p>All devices in local part must have addresses from same network. For example: router - 192.168.1.1, laptop - 192.168.1.2, external storage - 192.168.1.3. And all of them must have same netmask,&nbsp;for example above - 255.255.255.0. NAT should be setup on router,
 IP address from ISP should be setup on router's WAN interface. When all device in Local Area Network would communicate with itch over, and have access
<strong>to</strong> Internet. For access <strong>from</strong> internet, some changes should be made in router settings.</p>

            Hi patbeckner 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Reset your password (on another device) and if you login using Safe mode, make sure to use Safe mode with networking.
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE USING MICROSOFT ACCOUNT
<br />You will have to reset your Microsoft account password. To reset your password, click on the below link and follow online directions
<br /><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/password/reset</a>
<br />
<br />If you have security info on your account, Microsoft will send a one-time code to the alternate phone number or email address you gave to Microsoft. After you enter the code on the next screen, you'll be able to make a new password.
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE USING LOCAL ACCOUNT
<br />Reset your Windows 10 local account password - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4028457/windows-10-reset-your-local-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402845...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<br />
<br />If it's a local account then you can reset it from the Sign-in screen only if you have set up test questions or made a Password Recovery drive:

This is an interim reply. Thank you for your MS suggestions.&nbsp; I am going through the lists but will tell you I recognize may on the list that I've already tried such as confirming the router/modem and cables are all connected correctly.&nbsp; I've run the network
 troubleshooter, looked for device drivers and uninstalled/installed device adapters.&nbsp; Some of the items on the list require I be connected to the internet but I'll see. Standby for further updates. Thank you&nbsp;for trying to help me solve this MS Windows 10 auto
 update deficiency I'm experiencing.

            I found a workaround&nbsp;by reverting to a previous&nbsp;edition of Windows&nbsp;10 and choosing the metered ISP connection.&nbsp; So, the auto-update&nbsp;doesn't kick in automatically and gives me the option to update or "ask later."&nbsp; I know I have the un-updated version of
 Windows 10 but I hesitate to update again and try the fixes to see if they work.&nbsp; I can tell you those on the list that are&nbsp;within&nbsp;windows i.e. troubleshooter, connect to the internet, manage drivers/disable/enable et al all gave me the same results, that
 there was a problem with the drivers and that t:hey failed to start."Those others on the list I have not tried yet until I get the courage to try another update. VERY FRUSTRATING as I can't be wthout&nbsp;an internect&nbsp;connection!

<p>Your disappointment is understandable, Carl. What we can suggest to you is to <strong>
temporarily prevent a Windows Update from reinstalling in Windows 10</strong>. You may check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3183922/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-windows-update-from-reinstalling-in-windo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for the steps and more information about the said option. It will
 also prevent you to keep choosing if you will install the update or ask later. After this, you may install the update depending on your choice of time.</p>

            If you know when the problem began, try a System Restore to a point in time BEFORE the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a>.&nbsp; Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE:
 You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
You can also go to Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Services and check to see if Task Scheduler is automatic and started.&nbsp; If it's stopped then click on it and start it (and make sure it's set on automatic).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corrouption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a>.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a>&nbsp;along with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</span></a>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on
 the safe side.<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem (probably the System Restore).&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Professional to Enterprise Registry Hack Legal&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been asked to find a way to update our current Windows 7 Professional machines to Windows 7 Enterprise.&nbsp; We have the licensing for both the Professional and the Enterprise, but we are trying to keep from having to redo over 400 machines so I came
 across a "fix".&nbsp; The process involves changing the software name in the registry so that we can update Windows, since it thinks it the same version after the change; leaving all current user, programs and files intact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, is it legal to do such a thing since we have the licenses for the product or does this violate any Microsoft terms or agreements?</p>

<p>I got the answer form another Microsoft Website, if youre using PSTN Conferencing with Skype for Business via Office 365, then there is a known issue where the skype client doesnt tell you there are people waiting in the lobby and apparently MS are working
 on a fix for this. As a temp work around, you have to create youre meetings as open so people dialing in and get straight into the call and bypass the lobby until the notifications to the host to admit them are fixed.</p>

<h2>            Upgrading Windows 10 Home to Professional</h2>
                    <p>The powers that be decided to get some new PCs that were on sale.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when they arrived they were running Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; We cannot use this version as it doesn't have the Group Policy Editor.&nbsp; We have to use Windows 10 Professional.&nbsp; We were
 given disks for the OEM version of Windows 10 and attempted to install the upgrade.&nbsp; It always failed.&nbsp; Indeed, during the attempted installations, a windows stated that it would install Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; We ended up with Home, which we can't use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We seem to have run afoul of I-don't-know-what.&nbsp; Perhaps the installation disk is falsely labeled.&nbsp; I know that Microsoft has grabbed more control over Windows 10 than previously.&nbsp; Is there anything that would prevent upgrading Home to Professional?&nbsp; Is
 there any way out of this dilemma?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>If the computers purchased came with the home edition then the only way out is to pay for an upgrade to Pro, around $99 US. This can be easily done from Settings&gt;System&gt;About - click on Change product key or upgrade your edition of windows. However the licence
 for several PC's will of course be more. In this world you get what you pay for and there is nothing cheaper than a boss.</p>

<p>An OEM version of Windows can't do an upgrade. It can only do a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the powers that be bought 'Home' instead of 'Pro' they'll have to pony up for Pro. There's no need for a disc - it's just a license fee.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased the SB2. Using the touch screen works well, but when I use my surface pen, I notice that at the task bar, where cortona is located, as well as the other pinned apps are located; the cursor glitches and navigates to the other side of
 the screen, in a horizontal manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this? Calibrating it doesn't seem to be doing anything for it.</p>

            <p>Use revouninstaller:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find Revo Uninstaller at http://www.revouninstaller.com (freeware). Here’s a quick look at how to use Revo uninstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Launch Revo uninstaller after installing, select the program you want to uninstall or search for it using the built in search tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Uninstall button on the toolbar</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will start the uninstallation wizard for the particular program you selected. Revo uninstaller will go through a series of steps which include creating a system restore point, creating a backup of your Windows registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then analyze the program and run its default uninstaller, click Yes when you see the above dialog. After the uninstall is completed, you have a choice of scanning modes to select from. What this will do is let you scan for any left over files, folders and
 registry items from that particular program. Safe looks in the usual places, moderate in more advanced locations while Advanced does a thorough search throughout the entire computer. After selecting your choice, (I went with Advanced), click Scan.</p>
<p>After the scan is complete, you will see a list of registry entries left behind by the program, select them then click Finish to thoroughly remove the program from your system.</p>
<p>The default uninstaller should work for most persons, but for those troublesome programs, the Force Uninstall feature and advanced scanning options will give you more control.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should also try upgrading manually:</p>

            Hi shahzadnaeem78,
<br />
<br />I'm Nathan, a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help.
<br />
<br />Your Windows license would have been transferred to a Windows 10 license (if you did the free upgrade when it was available). 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows by using the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool found on the following website: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />This will allow you to reinstall with the option of keeping your files and applications, or doing a fresh install. 
<br />
<br />If you reinstall Windows, your license will automatically activate as you haven't changed any hardware (specifically the motherboard as the license gets tied to this). 
<br />
<br />Some more information about linking your Windows license to a Microsoft account for further recovery: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/20530/window...</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need anything further.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

            <p>Most often that error means a bad installer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you format the flash installer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have UEFI BIOS?&nbsp; If so the stick must be formatted specially and then <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
booted as a UEFI device</span>.&nbsp; Use Windows 10 <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media creation tool</a></p>
<p>or <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Rufus</a> to format UEFI installer for GPT disk.&nbsp; Delete all partitions using the Drive Options at the "Where do you want to install Windows?" screen to clear formatting.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Legacy BIOS use Media Creation Tool to create stick.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In rare cases like with RAID you may actually need to provide the SATA controller driver at the link.&nbsp; I would not use dated RAID as it causes problems and confers no advantage.&nbsp;

<h2>            My cat sat on the keyboard &#38; now everything is upside down&#33;  How do I get it back to being right-side up&#63;</h2>
                    My cat sat down &amp; the keyboard &amp; A line of stars appeared in the address space.&nbsp; When I reached to lift her off, she hit something else &amp; suddenly, the screen images were all upside down (which makes reading my email a bit problematic)&nbsp; :-)

<h2>            Windows 10 email</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new Dell desktop with Windows 10.&nbsp; I set up my EarthLink.net email account under Other POP/IMAP account.&nbsp; The email is not syncing properly and the message content will not display.&nbsp; In the reading pane, it says to "download messages
 and pictures' but when I click on that nothing happens.&nbsp; I used the settings wheel and went to the email account; the "change email sync settings" option is blanked out.&nbsp; The password saved is not the one I entered, and when I change it to the correct one,
 it doesn’t save it—but reverts to the incorrect one.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've tried deleting the account and resetting but that doesn't help.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;The Mail version is 17.6965.40901.0.</span>

    <title>Rosetta Stone ISO File Mounted but won&#39;t Run - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sososooofrustrated  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rosetta Stone ISO File Mounted but won&#39;t Run</h2>
                    So I have been looking EVERYWHERE for a solution to this but I can't find it anywhere. My electrical instructor offered me her Rosetta Stone program a few days ago and because I have a Toshiba Satellite C55, my laptop doesn't have a DVD/CD drive. So we
 copied all the disks onto a flash drive and put them on my laptop. I tried to run them and I got the installer to work but when I load it it asks me to select a language level from the CD drive. I did some research and turned the files into .iso files so it
 would run. I still have the original files also. I turned them into .iso files, I mounted them, I ran the program. My laptop recognizes the disk in the virtual drive. Rosetta Stone does not. What am I doing wrong? Please help, I'm not very technically literate.

            <p>I run at home a 32 bit windows 7, a 32 bit windows 8.1, a 32 bit windows 10 and a 64 bit windows 7. To install Rosetta Stone v 3 is no problem on all machines, after installing it the 32 bit machines recognise ISO files as well the CD in the drive, (ISO
 file must be connected as a virtual drive) except the 64 bit windows 7. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To install a language CD on the windows 64 bit windows 7 is not possible. But if you have an old windows XP machine you can install the desired language CD. If you do so you can copy the installed language(s) by making a ZIP file on a stick or a portable
 harddisk. You find the installed language in the hidden partition c:\program data\rosetta. You can copy also this map immediately to a stick, but this goes quite slowly because the installed stuff is countainig 100.000 files or something like that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have this copy open on your windows 7 64 bit machine the map c:\program data\rosetta and copy all files of this stick /disk to this map. Restart when you are finished your machine and you can work with Rosetta V3 on a 64&nbsp;bit machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Till now I didn't find an answer on the site of Rosetta Stone, but it seems there is a missing connection with 64 bit windows.</p>

                    I was given a Sony Vaio LAptop fro my birthday about a month ago. I work from home, I have an online job and I&nbsp; use my computer everyday. The two programs that I use the most are giving me a hard time and not letting me use them for some reason. The software
 came on the laptop so i called Sony and they told me it should be working fine and if i have problems to contact microsoft. Well my point is its not working and it causing me to loose money by not being able to work. Im very frustrated and im desperate for
 help. PLease if anyone can tell me what to do to fix these problems i would greatly appreciate it. Im at my wits end here. Acrobat reader 8 keeps saying I need some serial number to continue using the program and will close down and i lose all my work. Also
 Microsoft Office Word 2007 keeps saying i need a product key number. I use these programs daily for work, i cant deal with this. They keep causing me to lose all the hours of work ive done. PLease help!!!

<p>Adobe Acrobat Reader is free, it should not be asking for payment for continued use.&nbsp; The Adobe creator packages (Adobe Acrobat Standard, Pro, Pro Extended) do cost money.&nbsp; Microsoft Office is often loaded onto a computer as a trial package.&nbsp; You need to
 follow up with Sony on these items to ensure whether they shipped trial packages or fully paid packages, and if they are supposed to be fully paid packages your only relief will have to come from Sony - we can't help you here.</p>

<blockquote>I was given a Sony Vaio LAptop fro my birthday about a month ago. I work from home, I have an online job and I&nbsp; use my computer everyday. The two programs that I use the most are giving me a hard time and not letting me use them for some reason.
 The software came on the laptop so i called Sony and they told me it should be working fine and if i have problems to contact microsoft. Well my point is its not working and it causing me to loose money by not being able to work. Im very frustrated and im
 desperate for help. PLease if anyone can tell me what to do to fix these problems i would greatly appreciate it. Im at my wits end here. Acrobat reader 8 keeps saying I need some serial number to continue using the program and will close down and i lose all
 my work. Also Microsoft Office Word 2007 keeps saying i need a product key number. I use these programs daily for work, i cant deal with this. They keep causing me to lose all the hours of work ive done. PLease help!!!

<h2>            nVidia GTX 470 - Random pixels appearing on screen</h2>
                    Hello, I'm using a brand new computer: i7 processor, GTX 470 graphics card, Windows 7 64-bit.<br />
<br />
Generally it's running smoothly. But in very specific situations, random black/white pixels appear on the screen.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
I create a PDF and Acrobat auto-opens the new PDF. It will have random stationary black pixels appearing. These are NOT part of the actual document, if I print it the black pixels don't appear. If I scroll through the PDF, the pixels will jump to different
 spots on the screen.<br />
<br />
If I press 'print screen' to screengrab my monitor, the pixels showup in the grabbed image.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts why this is happening? Any possible solutions?

<h2>            Skype...WTF&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good golly! How could MS possibly screw up a great, intuitive app more? WTF? It used to be so easy and literally enjoyable to hear the Skype tone on an incoming call. Now, it's impossible to do much of anything with it, including inviting my girlfriend to
 join Skype while she's on a cruise with her family. It's now worthless.&nbsp; Oh, BTW, all the old online website instructions, that no longer apply to version 7.40.x are still up and running. Thanks for majorly screwing up a great app.</p>

</p><p>I am sorry to hear about your concerns, but based from your post, it's seems that you are contacting your girlfriend, do you encounter any error message from this? and is this for paid calls or Skype to Skype calls?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will look forward to your response.</p>
