<h2>            cannot update insider build, or even open settings or apps including edge. build 16188 surface pro 4</h2>
                    <p>Hi , my current build has expired(16188.rs-prerelease expired 12/4/2017.) , I'm not sure why updates stopped installing, I tried to update many times before this,&nbsp; I would click update and&nbsp;go to bed, or work returning to find it hadn't updated. Now it has
 completely expired it is still giving me the '&nbsp;this&nbsp;build of windows will expire soon message' upon first boot , but will now no&nbsp;longer let me open apps&nbsp;or programs , so now I cant even open settings to get to updates. Every time I open an app I get the error
 dialog box ms-wpc.??appblock?cver=RS1&amp;n=Microsoft(long string of stuff depending on what I'm trying to open.).Or I get a flashing unreadable dialog box which never fully opens, just flashes open and shut.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So 2 questions , 1, is there an easy way to circumvent this blockade&nbsp;just to&nbsp;get to settings to update (no I'm assuming) so 2, if I&nbsp;create a bootable usb key from the current&nbsp;insider build iso can I update&nbsp;the previous&nbsp;insider build on my&nbsp;surface with
 it, or do I have to do a&nbsp;fresh install and/or does the fact that these will effectively be 2 different redstone pre-release builds further complicate the matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>First off thank you all for the quick replies, each reply was viable however as my main goal was getting full functionality back, with the least amount of reinstalling, restoring etc. CrazyKats reply offered me the closest option to what I needed.</p>
<p>F.Y.I.&nbsp; I am typing this on my previously unusable SP4.🙂.</p>
<p>&nbsp; So in the spirit of community....here is how it went.</p>
<p>&nbsp;First off you need another p.c. Because my surface pro was locked up there was no way to use it to download anything. In order to have the best chance of just an update instead of a clean install I opted for the build which was closest to the build I was
 using.16299. I knew I would easily be able to update from that build once my machine was stable again. I
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
opted for the insider build</a>, again because that's what was running on my machine.</p>
<p>Once downloaded the Iso needs to be put onto some type of media to install from, because the surface doesn't have a disc drive you have to use a USB key, I think it needs to be 8gb at least I used a 16gb that wasn't being used for anything ( note that anything
 on the usb key will be erased during creation of the installation media, so back up your files.)The old

Windows USB/</a>DVD&nbsp;Download Tool is still the best way of creating a bootable usb key...there is a

newer version of this at the download a new build website</a>, which looks great but I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to install an already downloaded ISO to it; it only offers you the current build and then&nbsp; downloads it for you.So you have to
 use the old one. The tool WILL NOT WORK without installing .NET 2.0 or higher (kinda .<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NET 2.0 - 3.5 works</a>, .NET 4.0 and higher doesn't work for this.)The
 tool is easy to use once downloaded ,click to install it then you will find it I apps under W. The app is pretty easy to use as long as you know where to find your downloaded ISO (should be in downloads unless you changed something), and that you know the
 name of your USB key, you can find the name and drive letter of your usb key by going to My P.C.( if you choose the wrong drive it will be erased ,which is not best case scenario.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Now you have a brand new installer usb key the hard work is done. all that needs to be done is to get it on your pc.On the Surface ,first&nbsp; back up anything important if you have not already done that, you should be able to do an in place upgrade but
 if something goes wrong you will be happy that you backed up.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Now to get the Surface to boot from USB the trick is . Turn off the surface. plug in the usb installer key. Hold down the volume down button ,and while holding down the volume button press the power button until you see the surface logo appear on
 the screen, then let go of the power button whilst still holding the volume down button down. this should take you to the installing windows prompt from the usb key. At this point it will give you the option of either upgrade and keep files, or a fresh clean
 install.chose what you need and the installer should do the rest. Good luck. After tracking down all the files necessary for install...the install was in fact painless.</p>

<h2>            Problem uploading files to websites</h2>
                    I am having difficulty uploading files to websites (primarily job search sites).&nbsp; I am able to browse to find the document I want to upload and select it.&nbsp; The file appears in the browse box, but when I click on the upload button, the file disappears and
 is not uploaded. I have tried the same thing on the same sites&nbsp;from a different computer and it works fine, so the problem is not with the site(s). In the past I was able to also upload files from this computer, but have not made any system or settings changes
 that I recall. I am using Windows 7 and IE9. Active X Filtering is turned off.

            <span>Hi Walter,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
I will surely assist you regarding the issue you’re experiencing in Outlook.<br />
<br />
How many <b>Mail folders</b> do you find in the <b>Navigation Pane</b>?<br />
<br />
If you find more than one, expand it and check if the emails are in one of the <b>
Outbox </b>folder.<br />
<br />
You may delete/move it.<br />
<br />
If you don’t have multiple mail folders, issue could be due to <b>Outbox</b> corruption.<br />
<br />
Create a new profile and configure the email account and start using the same. <br />

I have had the same issue several times and the only fix I have found is to delete the hotmail account and then set it back up again.

Mine has actually gotten so bad that I have gone back to using Outlook 2010 with the Hotmail connector which sucks because I use Tasks and&nbsp;they don't sync with the connector.&nbsp; I hope Microsoft gets this fixed before they release Office 2013 to the consumer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I can't be checking my "Sent" box all the time to make sure emails went out.

<h2>            How to graph negative time values in excel 2010</h2>
                    Is there a way to graph using negative time values in Excel 2010?&nbsp; For some reason this functionality has either been taken out or not working.&nbsp; 2003 worked fine however in 2010, negative time values will not show on the Y axis or on the data label.&nbsp; Is
 this how they are now making it work?&nbsp; Is there a work around?

            Looking at that, it looks like its for data labels.&nbsp; Im not so interested in the data labels, more the actual X,Y axis.&nbsp; If this will help, I dont see how.&nbsp; Maybe I am misunderstanding something?!?<br />

            <p>I understand what you want, but as you have found, there is a bug in Excel 2010 that prevents displaying negative time values even if you use the 1904 date system. As a workaround, the thread that I pointed to uses a dummy series with data labels that look
 like they are axis labels. It's a bit artificial, but give it a try.</p>

            Ok, I finally understand what needs to be done.&nbsp; I am trying to simplify things and mimic the example.&nbsp; The problem I am having now is that it wont let me.&nbsp; no matter what I do Excel flips the x and y axis always putting the time values horizontal.&nbsp; It
 wont let me add the helper values as in the example either.&nbsp; Why cant they just fix this to make it work the way 03 did?&nbsp; This is frustrating.<br />

                    <p>I cannot enable the hot corners of the screen --- the options are either disabled or not functioning. What can I do to re-enable it to make it work exactly like Windows 8.1?</p>

</p><p>Basically, in Windows 8.1, I switched apps by swiping from the left or pushing the mouse far top-left, peeking through the apps like channel-surfing in TVs, and the whole screen is used. I could also access the settings easily by swiping from the right,
 or pushing the mouse top-right to show the charms bar, but now it only becomes a TINY button on the window title bar, which is hard to accurately point to it to the extent that pressing Windows-C is even quicker, even worse, when I work in full-screen modern
 UI, I don't have a way to switch apps efficiently by using the mouse/touchpad only. I can only use the keyboard to switch apps. Accessing the start screen is also difficult. Nothing shows when I push the mouse to ANY corner. Because I hide the taskbar to make
 more screen space, I must now press the keyboard or push the mouse to the SIDE (pushing to the corner has no effect), and move it through the taskbar to the start button, which is a PAINFULLY SLOW process.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hot corners are disabled in this build of the preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have apps opened and you want to switch, close, or see the running apps,&nbsp;you can click the new
<strong>Task</strong> button that is placed to the right side of the Taskbar <strong>
Search</strong> button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>Charms Bar </strong>can still be used by pressing <strong>WinKey+C</strong>.</p>

            Maybe there was some temporary problem in that webpage. Just tried and after entering the IMEI code of my D211 I was able to enter the download section.

<h3> jimmyb66  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting tons of junk emails in my MSN email, but checking email with a iPad.</h2>
                    <p>Been using an iPad for the last 4 years to get emails from my MSN account. &nbsp;Had no issues in the last 4 years till last week. &nbsp;Been getting tons of junk emails. &nbsp; I spent 3 hours on the phone, live chat with MSN, and got hung up on, passed from department
 to department, and finally a supervisor said their was nobody available to help me with my problems. &nbsp; I've had a MSN paid account for 15-20 years. &nbsp;I then called Apple, they spent time with me telling me there's nothing they can do, and showed me why. &nbsp;Back
 to MSN. &nbsp;Was told this is my only recourse. &nbsp;So.... &nbsp;With my MSN email, even when signing into MSN, I see no way in which to change settings or set up filters for junk emails. &nbsp;I have no gear icon whatsoever anywhere. Checked the help aboard a, and this site
 for help, and saw no answers. &nbsp; Overall it was painful to deal with MSN so far on this issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help appreciated, but not holding my breath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jimmy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ps, even in trying to post this, I see no category, topic or subtopic which this fits under. &nbsp;Is no one addressing email problems? &nbsp;Horrible. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I am accessing my email on my iPad mail app. &nbsp;As far as a screen shot, I'm not sure what shot your looking for. &nbsp; &nbsp;I am just getting tons of junk emails. &nbsp; Also, during one phone call yesterday with MSN, they gave me a phone number to call. &nbsp; It turned
 out to be a third party, but they did say my email was being accessed in the state of Texas and Pennsylvania plus a few more. &nbsp;Forgot to add that. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

            Just finished with MSN. &nbsp;This is so bad I can't put it into words. &nbsp;My problem is real, yet there is nobody available at MSN to address it, so I've had to turn to this to resolve it. &nbsp;And all I've gotten is two people who responded, who I doubt even read
 my post. &nbsp;Just so bad. &nbsp;Nothing has changed. &nbsp; I keep getting tons of junk emails. &nbsp;Been accessing my email on my iPad through the mail app icon. &nbsp;Is there nobody qualified to address email problems while using an Apple product? &nbsp;Ridiculous. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            No colour in Word for iOS</h2>
                    <p>Hello all </p>
<p>All documents that I open in the Word app for iOS are displayed without colour (fill in tables, font colour) and any highlights are a default blue, no matter what colour I select.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have opened the same documents in Word 2016 (Desktop) via OneDrive, and they display all colours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked around the Internet for help, and the only solution seems to be to turn high contrast mode off, but I do not know how do to this on Word iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app on my IPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, as this issue makes editing documents in the app a nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>

            This may be the issue, as it worked in iOS 9, and now I am using iOS 10. However, I uninstalled the app quite a while before upgrading and then didn't have the app for a good amount of time after upgrading, so I can't say for sure that this is what caused
 the problem.

<h2>            Internet works but not internet explorer </h2>
                    I used to be using internet explorer 7 but out of no where it stopped working and shows the message
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It appears you are connected to the Internet, but you might want to try to reconnect to the Internet.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retype the address.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go back to the previous page. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most likely causes:<br />
•You are not connected to the Internet.<br />
•The website is encountering problems.<br />
•There might be a typing error in the address<br />
<br />
so i installed internet explorer 8 and the same message appears. fire fox works and msn messenger works. I even tried to reset the browser but no luck.

</p><p>It is possible to call landline and/or mobile numbers using Skype. As long as your Skype Credit is enough or your calling subscription covers the number and destination of the call, then the call should push through.

</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <em>Unfortunately Skype does not support calls to all number ranges in every country. There are certain premium-priced or geographic/country specific numbers which are forbidden and cannot be reached using Skype.</em></p>

    <title>Cannot Login to Linkedin - Invaild username or Password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> knuckles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Login to Linkedin - Invaild username or Password</h2>
                    Today all of Sudden I keep getting the invalid username or password for Linkedin via Outlook 2013 Social Connector when it was working in the past so well.
<br />
<br />
Is there troubleshooting steps to fix it? <br />
Outlook 2013 has it built in so I don't know if there is a way to reinstall that part.
<br />
<br />
Facebook Works. <br />
<br />
I tried making a new profile but still get the same problem. <br />
<br />
I found a thread with people on Linkedin side having similar Problems:<br />

            Thanks Russ<br />
<br />
I realise that PAB files are not supported but I thought when importing the fields from the PAB file that I would have the option to allow or not allow duplicates - these are greyed out and cannot be adjusted. Is there a way I can enable these options to stop
 duplicates from being created?<br />

            Answer remains the same. Those options only pertain to supported file types.

    <title>Outlook Search Results Incomplete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Search Results Incomplete</h2>
                    <p>When I search Outlook for an email containing certain text, the results I get are missing a number of emails that contain the exact text for which I'm looking. My emails are fully indexed and after exhaustive searches, I can find the emails I'm seeking (sometimes),
 but why is the search result truncated in the first place? And, it seems like the later items (the ones currently in my 'In Box' as opposed to a sub-folder) are the ones that are most often missing. Please let me know if anyone has experienced this and if
 (hopefully) there is a solution. Thank you!</p>

<p>I went through all the steps, but it didn't make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me explain the problem in a little more detail. Let's say I'm looking for keyword 'celebration'. I type the word in the search area and hit the little magnifying glass. And, I'll get many returns, but not ALL. If I search through my current or sent,
 I'll find 3 or 4 MORE emails that contain my keyword but will NOT show up on a search. Ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kinda thought keywords were absolute, but apparently not.</p>

<p>If that is the case, we may need to configure the <strong>Indexing Options</strong> in
<strong>Outlook 2010</strong>. Indexing in Outlook, in simple terms, is all about the performance of locating or data retrieval of a program stored on a drive or network.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To configure <strong>Indexing Options</strong>, simply follow the workaround provided in the link below:</p>
