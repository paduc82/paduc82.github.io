<p>I &nbsp;wonder if there will be a higher or lower ratio of annoying kids on xbox one vs 360. I'm plumping for less as kids who won't have the money right away to buy a new console at over 400 quids. Christmas isn't long after though...

<p>I don't think we will see too many kids on the Xbox One until we see a price drop with the console. Realistically there is not going to be many parents out there who are going to be able to afford the console price let alone a few games on top the month
 before Xmas. I would be surprised if many children got one at Christmas. When you break it down your talking £530 for the console and a couple of games

My guess is the majority will be playing it on this gen, as you said Christmas isn't too far behind so no doubt next gen will catch up lol.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Trinipablo1966,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hello Trinipablo1966,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try booting into Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.
<br />
<br />2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.
<br />
<br />3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.
<br />
<br />4. Under Advanced options screen, click Startup Settings.
<br />
<br />5. In Startup Settings screen, you need to click Restart.
<br />
<br />6. After restart, press F4 or 4 to boot into Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />This will allow you to login as built-in administrator, then try steps mentioned here:

                    I hope someone in the Community will choose to assist me with this issue.&nbsp; I realize that XP has long been end-of-life status, but I still prefer to run it on my old (mint condition) DELL Inspiron 8100/32-bit architecture, manufactured circa 2002.&nbsp; Here's
 the problem:&nbsp; after I install the O/S using the reinstallation disc, I immediately install the device drivers that shipped with the 8100.&nbsp; I use updated versions of the drivers sourced directly from DELL. After I proof out the updated install and make sure
 it runs OK, any attempts to install other third-party utility software such as CCleaner, Auslogics&nbsp; Disk Defrag &amp; Registry Cleaner and Macrium Reflect, Windows crashes and generates a&nbsp; Fatal Error BSD.&nbsp; The O/S restarts just fine, but my question is - who
 has any idea on why they think this is happening?&nbsp; All the devices on the DELL Inspiron 8100 are in good, working order.&nbsp; I haven't detected any hardware conflicts.&nbsp; Network card

them to .MPG and you can play them with Windows Media <br />
Player. If you wish to play the DVD as it plays in a DVD Player...<br />
see the following...<br />
<br />
First...you would copy the VIDEO_TS folder from the DVD <br />
to a folder on your hard drive. <br />
<br />
If Windows Media Player will play regular DVDs...you could<br />
open it and go to...File / Open...navigate to the VIDEO_TS<br />
folder and when you open it select all the files inside...<br />
(Ctrl+A should select all files) with all files selected...left <br />
click the 'Open' button and the DVD should launch in Windows <br />
Media Player.<br />
<br />
Also...as an alternative...<br />
<br />
If you download and install the freeware VLC Media Player...<br />
you can right click a VIDEO_TS folder and from the menu...<br />
choose..."Play with VLC Media Player".<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
VLC Media Player<br />

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Unable to complete updates. Undoing changes</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro (10.0.17134) on a Dell G3 and have been trying to get the latest Windows 10 updates installed, but part way through installation I get the message "Unable to complete updates. Undoing changes" and it rolls everything back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run the Windows Update Troubleshooter and it finds issues each time it's run and says that it's fixed them. Then I run it again and it finds the same issues and says once again that it's fixed them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>

            Hi Steve, you are currently running version 1803 of Windows 10, version 1809 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            Hi SteveErrey71,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />I suggest you to delete the content of "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download", then perform a disk clean up and at the end download Windows Update Assistant.
<br />
<br />Here the procedure:

<br />
<br />B) To perform a disk clean up:
<br />
<br />1. Open "File Explorer"
<br />2. Click on "This PC"
<br />3. Right click on "C:"
<br />4. Click on "Proprieties"
<br />5. Click on "Clean-up disk"
<br />6. Click on "Clean up system files"
<br />7. Select every option in the list, but not "Download"
<br />8. Click on "OK"
<br />

    <title>Glitched Xbox One Achievements. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emzx99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Glitched Xbox One Achievements. </h2>
                    
<p>We have an issue with achievements not unlocking, and a hard reset isn't cutting it. Link Repeater (win two rounds of chain link) in Battlefield 4, is at 100%, but glitched. Friends of mine are also seeing problems with games like Wolfenstein and Tomb Raider.
 Is anyone going to acknowledge these issues? When are they getting fixed? I'm an achievement hunter and knowing my list will never be at 100% is going to *** me off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hard resets DO NOT WORK. Find a new solution. It's been almost a week and nothing has sorted itself out. Super unimpressed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assassin's Creed 4</p>
<p>WolfenStein</p>
<p>Tomb Raider</p>
<p>Guacamelee</p>
<p>Clearly this is a console issue and I hope when it's fixed they manage to have them all unlock instantly for everyone. Does anyone have a link to them acknowledging the fact that they're glitched?</p>

<p>Sooooooooooooooooooo an achievement I did for Wolfenstein The New Order will not unlock! I did it over a week ago and will not unlock even though when I compare to my friends it says Locked (100%). It's the last achievement I need for 1000g!</p>
<p>I replayed the game on easy to get this last achievement and deleted my saved data. I started all over again. I was playing this earlier today to finally get it. I got all the letters and replayed this game for a SECOND time and it did not unlock!!!!</p>
<p>I checked Xbox Live status and saw this error message that Xbox One achievements are not unlocking during my playthrough earlier. BAD LUCK!! That service alert is no longer there. I just reloaded the game, resynched my profile, and it did not unlock.</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh I do not want to play the game for a third time just to get this last achievement!!! &nbsp;Anyone have any advice?</p>

<p>It appears Microsoft gets it, and is fixing. Wannabee Microdrones, screw off with your "service alert" link. It's useless. Keep adding games should they get bugged, other than that, do not comment with solutions as there are none, yet, confirmed by Microsoft.</p>

 showing them as being successful,&nbsp;&nbsp; This has been ongoing for some time now , I right clicked on the updates and the &nbsp;error code 80200001 appears on all of them. I am way past fed up with this, I am seriously considering getting my Old Mac back in service.
 I have tried everything , countless Windows fixes, to Command Prompts Admin re Computer failing to recognise Updates , this didn't work either, so anyone else had this problem and resolved it. any&nbsp;help would be great..</p>

</p><p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Did the computer come with Win8 (or Win8.1) preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win8 (or Win8.1), or did you upgrade a (e.g., Win7) computer to Win8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. <em>Assuming you started with Win8 =&gt;</em> When (approx. date) was Win8.1 installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currently-installed <em>third-party</em> anti-virus application or security suite (i.e.,
<em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>), if any, and <em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription
</em>(if any)<em>&nbsp;expire?</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any?&nbsp; What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em> since you bought it?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>6b. How about KB3035583 and/or KB3044374?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7a. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in IE11's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,
<strong>Update Version: 11.0.54 (KB1231231)</strong> ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7b. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Is <strong>Adobe Flash Player v18.0.0.194 </strong><em>for Internet Explorer</em> installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>So your answer to the very specific, three-part question in my previous reply would be NO, is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>Firefox [v29.0 is installed]
<p>Chrome [v65.61.49249 is installed]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If all were well with your computer (<em>it's not!</em>), Firefox would have auto-updated itself to v38.0.5 (released 02 Jun-15)&nbsp;or v39.0 (02 Jul-15) by now - and Chrome would have auto-updated to v43.0.2357.130 (22 Jun-15) by now. [Google changed the version-naming
 convention several years ago so I have no idea where or how you got v65.x.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said,&nbsp;were Firefox &amp; Chrome already installed before you upgraded to Win8?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Update doesn&#39;t want to install updates</h2>
                    Hello, today I opened my Windows Update tab to see that I have 47 updates awaiting approval. I tried to download them but unfortunately an error showed up. The error number was 8007002. I looked up a solution on the internet and I found this article:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/910336
 . I followed the instructions as described by removing the folders and restarting Windows Update. I tried updating my system again in the Windows Update tab but I wasn't able to, as it kept looking for updates infinitely. I ran the Windows Update Diagnostics
 program but it didn't change anything. I also tried downloading the KB947821 update and installing it manually, but it just kept looking for updates on my PC and didn't proceed. I can't update my system because of this. Please, help me find a solution to this
 problem.

            <p>Sorry. My mind was clouded because I suspected the missing updates to impact one of my apps' behavior.<br />
<br />
My system is Windows 7 Home Premium SP1, 64 bit.<br />
<br />
The latest update to appear on my installed updates list is a security update KB3140735, and before that a Windows update KB3138612.<br />
<br />
My anti-virus is Malwarebytes Anti-Malware along with Microsoft Security Essentials. I had AVG 2015 before that but I removed it before trying to update.<br />
<br />
What happened is that I tried to approve the Windows Update files to be installed (I set my updates to be downloaded but approved before installing) and right after I clicked the update button it showed me the 80070002 error. Then I did what I described earlier.</p>
<p>

    <title>Error 0x80070002 when attempting system restore to new hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ramcharger79  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 0x80070002 when attempting system restore to new hard drive</h2>
                    We had an internal FDD go bad necessitating a new hard drive.&nbsp; When I started up with the restore CD and plug in the external USB drive that contains the WindowsImageBackup folder and files the restore process seems to go well until it actually starts
 transferring files.&nbsp; About 15 seconds into the restore the process errors out with error code 0x80070002 stating it cannot find the file specified.&nbsp; I've tried copying the files over, changing the permissions of the folder and files to allow SYSTEM full access,
 running CHKDSK on the folder, and scanning the folder but all come back ok.&nbsp; I need help because I don't think I should have to purchase a new OS when I did what I was supposed to do creating this image backup before we lost the internal drive.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

 presume the installation file detects which version it requires when it's run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be aware that this software only installs in specific versions of Windows 7. It will not work in Windows 8/10, and might even cause some damage to the OS if you try to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really need Windows 7/XP on a Windows 10 device then the only sensible approach, apart from dual booting separate Operating Systems, is to use Virtual Machines, e.g. VirtualBox software, plus a genuine install of Windows 7/XP.</p>

    <title>Why doesn&#39;t Windows Media Player Show Music CD information - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t Windows Media Player Show Music CD information anymore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings, Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Recently, I bought a&nbsp; brand new HP Pavilion dv7 6b57nr notebook computer that came with Windows 7 home Premium.</p>
<p>I bought Window 7 Ultimate and performed the anytime upgrade of the computer's operating system. So now the notebook has
</p>
<p>Windows 7 Ultimate as it's operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, to get to the point of this inquiry.&nbsp; I am using Windows Media Player to put music on my computer's hard drive.</p>
<p>I've used earlier versions pf media player to do this and I have always been impressed with how the program would show</p>
<p>you all of the information about any cd you put in the computer,&nbsp; The cd's album art, the title of every song on the cd, the</p>
<p>composer of a song, etc.&nbsp; When I load a music cd into my computer, all I get is 'unknown artist',&nbsp; I thought that only ocurred
</p>
<p>when you weren't connected to the internet.&nbsp; Is there a media center update/upgradevthat corrects this problem?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or does this problem have something to do with the Digital Millenium Copyright Act?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanking you in advance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respectfully.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walter D.&nbsp;Wormack</p>

            <p><b><span>Hi,</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In many cases, the Player can download media information for you and add it to your files automatically. For example, when you rip a CD, the Player can search an online database and download media information about the tracks on the CD.</p>
<p>The Player can also periodically scan the contents of your Player Library for items that are missing media information. First, it matches the items in your Player Library to entries in the online database, then it automatically downloads the missing media
 information and adds it to the files in your Player Library.</p>
<p>For detailed information about how to automatically add or edit media information when you rip a CD, see

<h3> muhathan  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;HELP&#93; Windows 8.1 doesn&#39;t detect my Wifi Card after clean installation</h2>
                    <p>So I have this Lenovo Y50 Laptop that I have been using for some time. One day my laptop ran into a trouble I couldn't handle (the harddisk was corrupted I think) so I reinstalled the OS with an USB Installation Media that I downloaded from Microsoft Website
 (8.1 Professional). It was a clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all the process is done somehow the Windows doesn't detect my Wifi Driver (Wifi Adapter, or Wifi Card, I don't really know what it called).</p>
<p>Things I found under the Network Adapters drop down in Device Manager are just Bluetooth and Family Controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also, I was left with bunch of things in Other Devices category such as 3D Video Controller, Network Controller, PCI Device, Unknown Device, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I *already installed* all of the windows updates but this problem still presists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being the problem happens on a laptop, I couldn't possibly messed up with my hardware, specifically the wifi card since other drivers work just fine. (I still can connect via ethernet)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I solve this? Does the Other Devices have something to do with this? Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I have downloaded an Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless-AC 3160 device (I read on the Lenovo website that this is the device Y50 is using) but there's a Code 31 error in the device status.</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We appreciate your effort to resolve the issue. We would be happy to assist you further.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the description of the issue, I understand that the Wifi driver is undetected in Windows.
</span></p>
<p><span>A Code 31 error is caused by any number of reasons that prevents Windows from loading the driver for the particular hardware device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kindly follow the below mentioned methods and see if it helps resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Hardware and Devices troubleshooting.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to run Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter.
 As it detects if there is any issues with hardware or devices. Follow the steps to do so and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>a) Press the
<strong>‘Windows + C’ </strong>to open the charms menu or move the mouse pointer to bottom right corner of the screen to get the charms menu.<br />
b) Click on ‘<strong>S<span>earch’ </span></strong>and select ‘<strong>Settings’ </strong>
and type <strong>‘<span>Troubleshooting’ </span></strong>and select ‘<strong>T<span>roubleshooting’</span></strong>.<br />
c) Click on ‘<strong>Hardware and Sound’ </strong>and select <strong>‘<span>Hardware and Devices’
</span></strong>and click on next to run the troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows comes with drivers for many devices. So you may try updating the drivers to see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Link:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 3:</strong> Try to install the Wireless driver in compatibility mode and check if the issue still persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the below to do so:
<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></a></p>
<p><span>I also suggest you to refer to below link for further assistance:<br />

<p><span>If the issue still persists please contact the manufacturer’s website to download the latest driver updates on chipset.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kindly update the status of the issue. Feel free to ask us for any further assistance with Windows Operating System. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

<p>Hi Dave, I have a Verbatim USB memory stick which I have tried to format for use with my car radio. The radio will only accept MP3 files with a compression rate from 8kbps to 320kbps, that's no problem. However
 the USB must have formatted byte/sector of 512byte or 2048byte and be FAT 12/16/32. Windows 10 dose not give me the byte size options, how can I get round this....</p>
<p>Thank you for the warning about the scammer.

            Hi Maurice
<br />
<br />When a drive is over 64GB Windows will refuse to use a lot of format options, including FAT and FAT32 . . .
<br />
<br />Right click that Flash Drive in Fie Explorer and choose Format
<br />
<br />Set the File System to FAT (Default)
<br />
<br />Do you not get the opportunity to set Allocation unit size to 2048bytes?<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03a44902-bf7c-4639-8ad8-314d4aaa32ee?upload=true" />

    <title>Lost files after User Profile service failed problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sailoray531  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost files after User Profile service failed problem</h2>
                    <p>In order to fix a User Profile Service Failed problem, I followed the instructions at support.microsoft.com/kb/947215 to delete the corrupted profile and create a new one. &nbsp;The (presumably) corrupted profile was both my usual login and my admin privileges
 login (I did not know there was any reason to keep them separate). &nbsp;I created the new admin privileged profile and logged on successfully with that. &nbsp;However, my original admin profile did not delete and I can now log on to that as well. &nbsp;So, I now have two
 admin profiles and a guest profile. &nbsp;The problem is that I cannot access my data files using any of these profiles. &nbsp;This includes my Word and Adobe documents, and all the other applications into which I have entered data. &nbsp;The applications are there but they
 show up as having no data in them. &nbsp;My screen has reverted to the default screen and almost all of my desktop shortcuts have been removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I access my data?</p>

<p>You can try this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download, install and run <a href="http://nicbedford.co.uk/software/systemrestoreexplorer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>This will give you a virtual drive letter that shows drive C: as it was on the selected date. Using Windows Explorer, you should now be able to copy the missing files and folders to the place where you normally keep them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be a good time to review your backup policy. The rule is: A file that is not backed up is a lost file. It is only a matter of time. Regular (e.g. weekly) backups to an external medium (usually a hard disk in a USB case) are standard practice.</p>

<h2>            Windows Server 2016- network path cannot be found</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys, Running into a little bit of an issue. Was wondering if someone can point me in the right direction. I am fairly new to Windows Server 2016- server/network in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done is setup a DNS and AD on the same server. DHCP is on another device. I created an AD computer and User account for myself on the domain controller. No one else or PC has an account yet. I am just at the testing phase right now, just to see
 if I have it all configured correctly before I add others to the domain. But when I try to join the domain from my desktop, I get that error message that the, "Network path cannot be found". Could this be a DNS issue possible? What would you recommend that
 I check?</p>

<h2>            IMJPDSVR.EXE runs in Windows 7 when opening an Access 2007 database</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>We have recently installed Windows 7 Enterprise and are having problems with the above process running, logged on as a normal user, when opening MS Access 2007.&nbsp; The problem does not occur when logged on as a member of the domain administrators. At some
 point, and this is not something we have been able to determine an exact number of, after opening and closing Access the program will hang, though only if a database has been&nbsp;opened. This hang can be seen either in opening database forms or when opeing a new
 instance of Access.&nbsp; By ending the process through the task manager enables Access to function and databases to open and continue until another instance of Access is initiated.</p>
<p>When opening Access&nbsp;this process starts and retains on average 30% of the CPU even though IME has not been installed. On occasion multiple instances of this process can also be seen.</p>
<p>For testing purposes UAC control has been disabled and the third party software we use for call control which is embedded into our database application has been installed with compatiability settings, run as administrator and full control to the active x
 control that it uses.</p>
<p>Hopefully I have placed this in the right forum and someone will be able to shed a little light on any additional settings I can try to stop this process from running.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>
<p>Tracey</p>

                    I hit the button to update ITunes and that's where the problem began. It needed to remove itunes and everything with it and it can not remove bonjour. It says I don't have privileges. Well, I have spent about 15 hours on the phone with Apple (they finally
 said it was a windows problem) doing everything that could be done. I then took my computer to where I purchased it and stood with the technicians for 2 hours--on the phone they said "we have a way we can get it off" in the end, they could not and I left them
 scratching their heads. So now both Apple &amp; the techs have said I am probably going to have to re-format my whole computer. Guess what?? I bought a new Kodak printer the other day. I went to install it yesterday and it wont download the software!! Guess what
 that problem is? They are trying to install a different version of BONJOUR (OH GOD, there's more than one!!) and so we keep getting an error message saying another version is installed. My husband was on the phone with kod

<p><span>“</span><strong><span>Revo Uninstaller</span></strong><span> helps you to uninstall software
 and remove unwanted programs installed on your computer even if you have problems uninstalling and cannot uninstall them from "Windows Add or Remove Programs" control panel applet.<br />
<br />
Revo Uninstaller is a much faster and more powerful alternative to "Windows Add or Remove Programs" applet!<br />
<br />
With its advanced and fast algorithm, Revo Uninstaller analyzes an application's data before uninstall and scans after you uninstall an application. After the program's regular uninstaller runs, you can remove additional unnecessary files, folders and registry
 keys that are usually left</span></p>
