</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm struggling with this ATEX problem for a while now and still didn't find a solution myself.</p>
<p>I hope someone knows the answer to solve it.</p>
<p>every time that i start my pc i get the same error 'ATKEX_cmd.exe has stopped working' around 5 times in a row!</p>
<p>you can see a printscreen from it added to this post!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had personally never heard of ATEX so i searched alot over the web</p>
<p>and didn't even find why i need it exactly.</p>
<p>Anyway, i came to know that it is in a part of my registry so it has like all other parts 'binary codes'</p>
<p>and it would probably be affected by malware because i never changed anything in my regedit on this pc so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i ran an SFC scan and i did some malware scans and scanned and repaired my registry with some of the better free products (like ccleaner and so on)
</p>
<p>there was no malware detected and the registry got some repairs (like always) and some of the binary codes that needed to be quarantined or deleted had to do with ATKEX!</p>
<p>but the same problem was still occuring...</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'm not able to find the ATKEX_cmd.exe but i found the folder named 1.01.02 under 'C:\Program Files (x86)\ASUS\AXSP\1.01.02' witch contains 3 files named: 'ATKEX.dll', 'atkexComSvc' and 'PEbiosinterface32.dll' so as you can see the dll file is still on my
 pc </p>
<p>you can also see the printscreen from this in my post</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;also ran in some troubles when i tried to update the BIOS of my asus maximus vii ranger motherboard, because apperently i needed to rename the cap file before updating it, i have a feeling that this could be the cause but i'm not shure what i should do
 now</p>
<p>
</p><p>i would appreciate it if someone could help me out!</p>
<p>many thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maxim</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is related to ASUS chipset driver and the corresponding DLL file is suspected to be damaged or missing from its intended location. I'd recommend you to kindly visit ASUS website and see if they have any update available for your computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, you can also turn on Windows update and let it find the latest updates available. Also, allows them to download and install those available updates in between.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps!!!</p>

<h2>            Backwards Compatibility Network Issues</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I've been playing both Black Ops and Black Ops 2 (mainly for Zombies) on Xbox One through Backwards Compatibility and have had no issues whatsoever until this morning. I turrned on my Xbox, signed in, started BO2 up - the usual stuff. However, when I tried to go online, it said that I was unable.</p><p>Error Code 8015190E</p><p>I reset my Xbox and tried again, but still nothing. I thought 'Ok, maybe it's just BO2 that's having issues' so I went with Black Ops 1. Nope. Same problem.&nbsp;Error Code 8015190E, can't connect. Tested connection both times and apparently, there is no issue with either my network connection or my multiplayer connection.</p><p>To confirm this, I put in Black Ops 3 to test. It connected fine. In fact, the NAT Type has switched back to Open, which is a bonus for me.</p><p>I thought 'Ok, let's try something other than COD. Maybe it's just an Activision/Treyarch thing' so I went on Halo: Reach. Still nothing. It won't even attempt to connect.</p><p>I decided

<p>Greetings, MindEraser4! Thanks for coming to us with your question. What you'd have to do is login to the current parent account and select "Remove from Family". After doing this the child account would be able to add a different parent account. You also
 have the option of changing the LIVE ID of the parent account as well. Just follow the steps in our sticky post and let me know if you have any issues.

<h2>            Device Manager Code 19&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I know the issue is my computer because when I plug in my flash drive or my mp3 player to my sisters laptop, it works just fine.</p>
<p>Under USB Controllers all six have warning signs and it says</p>
<p>Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)</p>
<p>Two are Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host Controller and the other four are Standard OpenHCD USB Host Controller. They don't successfully uninstall and reinstall and when I try to update them it says they're already updated.</p>
<p>What do I do? I have Windows Vista and an HP dv7 1464nr. Oh, and could my issuse also be my battery, because my laptop needs a new one and can only work when it's on the charger now and I noticed the problem around the time my laptop started cutting itself
 of when it wasn't on the charge though it would tell me I have 20% of battery life left. Thanks for any help!!!</p>

<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you reinstall the USB controllers on the computer and check if it works.</span></p>

<p>Certainly do appreciate your help. Yesterday my windows mail crashed; I am in a non-nwtworked stand alone environment running Windows Mail v6 from the Windows Vista Home Premium SP2 OS.</p>
<p>Is there a way to recover/restore the messages and folders?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>This new problem has several solutions.</p>
<div>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't resolve the problem, try the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
To run the Bootrec.exe tool, you must start Windows RE. To do this, follow these steps (you need a Vista Installation Disk to do this - not a Recovery diisk):
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Put the Windows Vista installation disc in the disc drive, and then start the computer.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press a key when you are prompted.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select a language, a time, a currency, a keyboard or an input method, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Repair your computer</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong>System Recovery Options</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<span>Bootrec.exe</span>, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<div>
<p><strong><span><span>Note
</span></span></strong><span>If rebuilding the BCD does not resolve the startup issue, you can export and delete the BCD, and then run this option again. By doing this,
 you make sure that the BCD is completely rebuilt. To do this, type the following commands at the Windows RE command prompt:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>

    <title>Network ID and Password. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glaustin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network ID and Password.</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>I had an XP PC and Laptop and a Win7&nbsp;PC and ran them over a Wi-Fi network on a workgroup called "X" and all the PCs happily talked to each other.&nbsp;A month ago I replaced the XP laptop with a Win7 laptop and it and communicated on Workgroup X without a problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;However a&nbsp;bunch of problems led to me having to have an (identical) replacement laptop and when I ran through set up it found the faulty laptop and was set up on the Workgroup using that and it communicated with the Workgroup without a problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The faulty one is now gone and today I changed the replacement&nbsp;laptop's name. But every time I want to access another Workgroup machine I keep getting an ID and password request - only for the Win7 machines;
<em>there are no problems with the XP machine</em>! I changed the settings not to ask for a password but that doesn't seem to solve the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. So I entered my laptop's name as its ID and its network sharing centre password and it connected. I did the same with my PC and entered the PC's name and the PC's network sharing centre password and that allowed access from that side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. <u><strong>Problem 1</strong>:</u> Although I have found I can connect using these IDs and&nbsp;passwords, I haven't clicked on "remember the credentials" yet in case I do&nbsp;something irretrievable. A silly question, but do I enter the Laptop's password for
 the laptop only and PC's network password only for the PC or should I just use one of the passwords for them both?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.<u><strong> Problem 2</strong></u>:&nbsp; Separately, in the Network and Sharing Centre, I get a message saying Windows detected another Homegroup on my computer and asks if I want to join now. The thing is I don't know what this homegroup is and I'm worried
 if I enter my PC's password that I'll cause a problem and banjax the connection I have via the ID and password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this is clear enough to enable someone to advise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 no bluetooth voice reception - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arandul  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 no bluetooth voice reception</h2>
                    <p>I have been using bluetooth in the past to for voice conversations through my computer. &nbsp;I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and had no issues. &nbsp;I recently purchased a Sennheiser VMX 200-II headset and paired it with no issues. &nbsp;Almost immediately I encountered issues.
 &nbsp;My connection to the device would drop and reconnect upon restarting the headset only to drop again. &nbsp;I tried removing and re-installing my bluetooth drivers, re- pairing the device, and checking for driver updates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was finally able to get audio to work by doing a driver rollback on my Bluetooth Module driver and MIcrosoft Bluetooth Enumerator, however I still cannot get voice to work. &nbsp;In my audio control panel my headset shows up twice for playback, once as a headset
 as&nbsp;Sennheiser VMX 200-II Hands-Free (which shows as disconnected) and again as Headphones&nbsp;Sennheiser VMX 200-II Stereo (defualt device), the hands free device appears again under recording as disconnected. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find anything on sennheiser's website about issues like this, and not sure what I can do to correct the issue with bluetooth. &nbsp;The device works properly on OSX.</p>

<h2>            How to delete &#38; re-create email shortcuts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was directed to this forum after asking a question here <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-signin/error-message-every-time-sorry-there-seems-to-be-a/db2272d0-b96c-4bb4-bb5d-6d094235bce4">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-signin/error-message-every-time-sorry-there-seems-to-be-a/db2272d0-b96c-4bb4-bb5d-6d094235bce4</a>&nbsp;about a problem I am having with signing into outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since hotmail became outlook, I have encountered an error screen every time I try to open my email account. There is a "Try to return to Outlook" button, which once clicked will successfully take me to my email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error occurs when I access email via any one of three shortcuts, they are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1- The E-Mail link in the start menu.</p>
<p>2- The "Read Mail" button on the Command bar.</p>
<p>3- The E-Mail button on my keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I type <a href="http://www.hotmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.hotmail.com</a> directly into the adress bar, I do NOT have the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was suggested to me to try "delete that shortcut and re-create it again". How do I do that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using IE 8, on Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Manasa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding step 1: When I&nbsp;run the shell:start menu command, the email shortcut does not appear.&nbsp; The shortcut in question is not one that I created, it is a windows shortcut which is added to the start menu by going to&nbsp;"Taskbar and Start Menu Properties"
 -&gt; "Start menu - Customize" -&gt; "General" tab -&gt;"Show on Start menu" -&gt; "E-Mail" and selecting "Windows Live Hotmail".&nbsp; I cannot find a way to change the target of the shortcut created this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding Step 2: When I right click the icon in the Command Bar, there is no delete option.&nbsp; Again, this icon was not created by me it is included in IE. I don't want to create an icon on the "Favorites bar" as I do not use the Favorites bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surely there is a setting somewhere which controls these existing&nbsp;shortcuts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not afraid of using regedit, but I don't know where to find the correct command lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems &#40;KB3081455&#41; - Error 0x80073712</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro (64) a couple of weeks ago and so far, all has been well ... until today. &nbsp; The system claims that a&nbsp;Windows Update&nbsp;(KB3081455) is&nbsp;available, but when I try to install it, the progress bar gets to 5% and then I get the error
 as noted in the subject (Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3081455) - Error 0x80073712).&nbsp;&nbsp; Clicking Retry gets the same result.&nbsp; Other than this Windows Update failure, the rest of Windows seems to be working fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched the web for various solutions to this problem, but none have seemed to work.&nbsp; Here's what I've tried.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleted the contents of&nbsp; \Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download</li><li>In an elevated command prompt window:
<ul>
<li>Ran WSReset.exe</li><li>Ran dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth&nbsp; (It found no problems)</li><li>Ran dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth&nbsp; (Just in case.&nbsp; Still no problems reported or fixed.)</li><li>Ran Get-AppXPackage... with full syntax as noted in another post in this community forum&nbsp;(I won't post the entire command here.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It appeared to download packages.&nbsp;
</li><li>Restarted the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tried the update again.&nbsp; Same error.</li></ul>
</li><li>Ran SFC /Scannow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp; No Problems found</li><li>Ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter:&nbsp; No problems found</li><li>I'm running both Malwarebytes Pro and Bit Defender:&nbsp; Scans with both show no problems.</li></ul>
<p>I've since restarted the PC a few times, and repeated some of the steps above.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still no luck ... same failure at 5%&nbsp;when trying to download and apply the update.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, just for the record,&nbsp; the 5% appears to be during the download phase.&nbsp;&nbsp; On one attempt,
 it made it to 100%, but then I got the same failure message immediately after.&nbsp; I've checked my network drivers and connection, all appears to be fine there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what to try next.&nbsp; I'm trying to avoid a full re-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Thanks</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, neither of the two methods you suggested worked.&nbsp; I am still unable to install Windows Update KB3081455.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it gets a bit more complicated now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to perform a complete Windows Reset on the PC, allowing it to reinstall windows 10 clean. &nbsp; The reset seemed to go well and upon completion,&nbsp; I&nbsp;figured&nbsp;I'd&nbsp;allow it to run the Windows Updates before
 I reinstalled any of my own drivers and applications.&nbsp; That way, there&nbsp;would likely be no conflicts of any sort.&nbsp;The system immediately found 4 updates that were available. &nbsp;I believe three were security oriented and the last one&nbsp;was the Cumulative&nbsp;system
 update,&nbsp;KB3081455, which&nbsp;is the one that failed before.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first three security updates installed without issue, but just as before, when it got to the last update, KB3081455, it&nbsp;failed with the same error (0x80073712).&nbsp;&nbsp; So, even with a clean system, that
 particular update is&nbsp;still&nbsp;failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What concerns me&nbsp; now&nbsp;is that since it's a cumulative update, my understanding is that KB3081455 supersedes all previous Windows 10&nbsp;system updates, and therefore those previous ones (the one that had successfully been installed in the past, prior to the
 reset)&nbsp;are no longer available to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is ... what now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; I'll give sfc /scannow another try, although admittedly I don't have high hopes of any success.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm now also curious to see whether the problem is simply with this one update, or if this problem will now occur with all future
 updates as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;Windows Update is&nbsp;automatically retrying to download and apply this particular on a daily basis ... and of course it's failing each time.&nbsp; Any way to stop the attempts?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried everything mentioned already, and I am just pissed off I get NO information about what exactly failed.</p>
<p>I tried resetting Windows Update removing SoftwareDistribution folder and catroot2, WU Troubleshooter, sfc /scannow, dism, ... no chance; always stuck on 5% (after Download is cleared; 0% if already tried) and then 0x80073712</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am out of ideas and need help with this, because I'm afraid I cannot install further updates anymore ... :(</p>

            <p>The link with help to reset windows components (above) only points to all other windows versions, and the link at the top of that page has no help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not at all confident about using method 2, and I can't use method 1 because - guess what? The link refers to the page for all other Windows versions, and the link at the top of that page (to windows 10 help)&nbsp; has no advice on the subject.</p>

            I'm hoping that because of our combined reports that the various suggested solutions haven't worked, that one of the MS Support Engineers will respond with either some other suggestions, or information as to what we can expect next.&nbsp; It's obvious from
 the responses to this thread (and other similar threads) that this problem is not isolated to just one or two people.&nbsp;

                    <p>Original title: Cannot find VBScript engine - Windows 7 64bit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I keep getting an error message "<strong>Cannot find VBScript engine</strong>" after I install
<strong>Zimbra Desktop</strong> and open the application. Tried running the MS-FixIt program
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9648765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9648765</a>, but that didn't help. I registered the DLL &amp; also restarted my computer, but that didn't work either. I checked if any services needed to be started,
 but couldn't tell which one it might be, cuz couldn't find a service that said "<strong>VBScript</strong>". I am on Windows 7 64-bit OS. Need help and this is getting a bit frustrating! :)</p>

            <p>Hi Linney - </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for responding to my question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the following options mentioned in the <strong>Triple-Computers URL</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Registering the DLL "vbscript.dll" - this was a success</li><li>Registering the DLL "jscript.dll" - <strong>this was a failure. error code was 0x80004005</strong></li><li>I checked the registry setting and it already had the value mentioned in the above URL</li></ul>
<p>The first time Zimbra runs, it executes a <strong>vbs </strong>script and it is at this time, the
<strong>config </strong>file is created. This config file is essential for the <strong>
exe </strong>file to run; therefore if I run the exe file directly as <strong>Administrator</strong>, I would receive an error message saying "<strong>Unable to load config file</strong>". Also, I can't run the
<strong>vbs </strong>script as an <strong>Administrator</strong>, cuz that option doesn't show up in the pop-up menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had already performed a bing search on this issue, but couldn't find a good solution for this problem. That is why I am now relying on Microsoft support. The only thing that stands out here is the failure while registering the DLL "jscript.dll", even though
 the DLL exists in the designated folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funny that you sent me a search result from "Google", when Miscrosoft has its own "Bing". :)</p>

<p>Is it an inconvenience to uninstall Zimbra, and then reinstall it via&nbsp; right-clicking on the actual Setup.exe and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?&nbsp; Do so even if your user is an Admin.<br />

            <p>Linney,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response and my apologies for the Google/Bing reference. I thought you were from Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to register <strong>jscript.dll </strong>successfully this time. I worked when I opened the
<strong>command prompt</strong> window as an <strong>Administrator</strong>. However, this didn't help in solving the original issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled &amp; reinstalled <strong>Zimbra Desktop </strong>several times in the last couple of weeks. That hasn't helped. Also, I can't run the
<strong>setup </strong>as an <strong>Administrator</strong>, cuz it is not an <strong>
exe </strong>file. It is an <strong>msi</strong> file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funny thing is that I was able to successfully install and work with it, when I installed the email client in my wife's laptop, which is a
<strong>DELL XPS 15z</strong>. My fairly new laptop is an <strong>Acer Aspire 4830T</strong>. The make of the laptop really doesn't matter, but I am starting to wonder if any of the pre-installed applications are blocking a port or something like that.</p>

<p>Have you tried cleaning out your Temp folder, you can do it by typing %temp% in the Start Menu RUN box.&nbsp; This will open your Temp folder, there you can delete everything that Windows will allow you to do so.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to show Both Hidden and System Files, and also to uncheck "Hide known file types" in Control Panel/ Folder Options/ View, to navigate to the mentioned Temp location.</p>

            <p>If you are using an OEM version of Windows XP the product key will only activate on the original computer it was installed on and can not be transferred to another computer.</p>
<p>If however you have a "Full" retail version of XP then you can try phone activation.</p>
<p>Also not that some new computers will not support XP, so check the computer manufacture's web site for XP device drivers for your specific make and model.</p>

<div>The Diagnostic Toolkit may ot may not fix the issue, but after you run it, if it freezes again and if you are in the USA, go to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store and get</div>
<div>swapped out. See if they will give you a new vs. refurb. If not in the US, you</div>
<div>need to contact support and they will exchange for a refurb</div>

<div>(or if you are lucky, the seller will accept a return for a full refund and you</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A new Surface should not behave this way and updates should not make a device</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;It's impossible to use this expensive device as business computer. </div>

<div>&gt;Meanwhile, after 2 month I count way over 200 freezes. Has anyone encountered the same and fixed this?&nbsp;

<p>Really? I'm not even surprised after I've been told by one MS rep that password protection is impossible to be disabled on Windows 10 without special, "advanced" tricks that he's not going to share with me for security purposes (and that was after I had
 succeeded in disabling the protection on another Surface of mine), and after my mother's been told by another MS rep - with her Surface BSODing on her - that Microsoft is not going to accept the device for service until she completes 7-pages long instructions
 for reinstalling the entire system, and THEN gets back to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft tends to be such a joke sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As concerns the actual topic: this is most probably another hardware failure of Surface, much like my mom's SSD issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. the password bypass is pretty well documented at <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3539-sign-user-account-automatically-windows-10-startup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3539-sign-user-account-automatically-windows-10-startup.html</a> - I always warn folks that there is risk on doing this on a portable computer/device, but it they have a home desktop and aren't concerned about others having
 access to their info.. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Surface support - yeah, they will almost always ask for a complete reimage from a downloadable recovery image as part of their script to rule out software issues. But the other piece of that is that you don't want to send a Surface in for exchange that
 has personal info/data on it because you don't know who will be accessing it. The process to DO this is too complete for a lot of folks. Which is why, if customers are in the US, I send them to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store. The reset should
 be a TRUE one button reset.. </p>

<p>I have the - 2017 i7, 16gb Ram, 1tb hard drive version</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am already on my 3rd Surface Pro 2017 because I have already had 2 exchanged:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st one was caught is a boot loop,</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd one kept crashing and turning off / hibernating all the time,</p>
<p>
</p><p>3rd one is freezing all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this machine to use professionally and haven't been able to trust it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my experience these very expensive devices are junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wouldn't be so bad if Microsoft would do the decent thing and refund customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to be returning this one for my FOURTH machine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:</p>
<p>Is there a point at which Microsoft will actually refund me. I mean it's been months now since my initial purchase and I STILL don't have the product they advertised?</p>

<p>I have had my brand new Surface Pro 2017 for three days now, and it has randomly frozen at least 5 times. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for these freezes. Each time, it is completely unresponsive and requires a hard-reset by holding down the
 power button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is unacceptable and very disappointing. There is no way I am going to accept a refurbished replacement if that's what they are offering. This a brand new top of the line Surface Pro that is three days old. I expect better when I drop $3000 on a new
 computer.</p>

<p>I feel for you mate... like I said in the post above I'm already on my third... I was the same as you. Mine broke very shortly after purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will be told to send it back. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You will then receive a refurbished one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Like me, you'll probably be really upset and call Microsoft. </p>
<p>Then you will speak to someone who can do absolutely nothing more than keep saying over and over "I understand...", "I understand....", it's literally what they have been trained to keep saying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll now have a refurbished Surface Pro that cost you the same as a brand new one. You won't know anything about it and you will very possibly&nbsp;find that it has some other issue like keeps happening with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft used to offer refunds if you had 3 units exchanged but still ended up with a defective one. They've stopped doing this, presumably because so many people were asking for refunds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you search ebay&nbsp;there are dozens of 'brand new' never turned on Surface Pro's for sale. These are the refurbished ones that people are immediately selling and not ever turning on so they can call them brand new and get some of their money back (about
 50% of your money back).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's Surface Pro is a scandal... that unfortunately like me, you've been bitten by.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll never buy a piece of Microsoft Hardware again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so you know what to expect....&nbsp;unfortunately it's not good news. They won't give you a brand new one. If I were you mate I'd try to get a refund while you're still in the 30 day period. If you keep the Surface Pro or go for an exchange, believe me,
 your troubles are only just starting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

    <title>I need help with my mouse&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan leach  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need help with my mouse&#33;</h2>
                    I have a year old ASUS-K35S and a HID-Compliant Optical Mouse from ASUS too. At first the mouse worked fine but then it started getting all bad. Sometimes it would work sometimes it wouldn't.
<br />
I tried uninstalling/disabling the mouse but it still wouldn't work. It keeps saying USB Device Not Recognized and when I clicked properties, it said The device has stopped working because it reported problems (Code 43). I tried rebooting, and even tried connecting
 to other USB Ports, it just wouldn't work. Miraculously, it started working again - for 2 days. The 3rd day it wouldn't work, now 4 weeks later it wouldn't even budge.<br />
I think this is useless but incase this is some info about my mouse:<br />
C P/N: 04G125400280 PID: LZ122HF04HL M/N: M-U0008 When I plugged the mouse in, the red light under the mouse comes on, but the cursor won't move. Sometimes the red light doesn't even come on or just blinks and then goes away! :(<br />
And my mouse isn't in bad shape or damaged. I need help please!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Where is the line, on which part of the screen?<br />
<br />
Check with your laptop's maker, the on-line documentations&nbsp;and their forums (if any).<br />
<br />
The line could be something wrong with the monitor and you would need a real computer shop (not leeks<br />
and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox stores) or the System maker's Support.</p>
<p>If the line is on an edge.<br />
<br />
Check this - RIGHT CLICK DESKTOP -&nbsp;Graphics Options -&nbsp;Notebook or whatever - is FULL SCREEN<br />
NO BORDER CHECKED? It should be.<br />
<br />
RIGHT CLICK DESKTOP - Graphics Properities - look around for Geometry Settings (maybe consult<br />
manual) Parallelogram - adjust your screen fit properly.<br />
<br />
===================================================================<br />
<br />
You can also update or re-install the video/display driver to see if that helps.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Version 1803 update won&#39;t automatically install. In the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robert44zw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Version 1803 update won&#39;t automatically install. In the Update History it shows error code 0x8007042b.</h2>
                    After labouring through a lengthy proces of installing and working on the updates the system shows the text in Update History, as follows: "Failed install attempt - 0x8007042b". It tries to install this update repeatedly and it has gone through four previous
 attempts without success. What is the significance of this error code? How can I circumvent it and have this update successfully installed?

            Hi Robert,
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

            Option 1:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

<br />
<br />Option 2:

<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.

                    Hi - I've installed the Fall Creator's Update and even though I have my computer set to go to sleep after 30 minutes on battery and 2 hours plugged in, regardless of whether it's plugged in or not, it goes to sleep in just a couple of minutes.&nbsp; I've updated
 all drivers, etc. and can't find a cause.&nbsp; Any ideas?
