<h2>            Can&#39;t eject external hard drive because computer says it is still working</h2>
                    <p>I backed up my File History and did a backup with the link "create a system image" on an external hard drive.&nbsp; I closed all my programs, then tried to "eject" the external drive.&nbsp; I tried many times and got a message that said it is still in use.&nbsp; I finally
 just unplugged it from my laptop even though I didn't want to.&nbsp; How do I prevent this in the future and what does it mean?&nbsp; Did I hurt anything?</p>

<p>Hello Kathy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've encountered this issue one time in my own 1 TB external hard drive. What I've noticed is that even though I've already closed all the programs that I've opened in my external hard drive, it is still blinking rapidly like it is being used and when I
 try to eject it, I was getting the same error message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've done to resolve the issue is, again, I've made sure all apps are closed, and I opened
<strong>Task Manager</strong> (By pressing <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc </strong>on the keyboard), highlight
<strong>Windows Explorer, </strong>and hit the <strong>Restart</strong> button. You can refer to screenshot for reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b6b8fbb-fd27-4713-8beb-135b0265841a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b6b8fbb-fd27-4713-8beb-135b0265841a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, try to eject the external hard drive again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it is possible to corrupt your files in your external hard drive if you just yank it, another option is to shut down the computer before removing the said the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi ryanres,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Are the options to create a shortcut grayed out?<br />
2. Which program file or folder are you right clicking to create the shortcut?<br />
3. Since when are you facing this issue?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to check if you face the same issue in safe mode
</span></span><span><span>– In Safe mode; you have access to only basic files and drivers. Refer to the link to start the computer in safe mode and then check -
<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may even check if you face the same issue in different user account or administrator account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may even check if the issue persists in a new user account on your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer to the link - Create a new user account-<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the creation of shortcut was working fine some point earlier then you may even perform a system restore. T<span>he System
 Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Note: When you use System restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed
 are removed.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To do this, there must be a System Restore point at which the logon was successful. Follow the steps mentioned below to perform
 system restore –</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span>, type
<strong>system restore</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then click
<strong>System Restore</strong> in the <strong>Programs</strong> list.<span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span><br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>System Restore</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Choose a different restore point</strong>, and then click
<strong>next</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click
<strong>next</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Finish</strong>.<br />
</span><span>The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created. Restart the computer in normal mode.</span></span></p>

            Hi Jerry.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>

</p><blockquote>Hi Jerry. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start:
<br />
<br />
1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>. Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.
<br />
<br />
If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />
2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if not accessible by any other method:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> <br />
<br />
Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a> <br />
<br />
You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:
<a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a> <br />
<br />
Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version
 Update. <br />
<br />
If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a> <br />
<br />
3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows.
<br />
<br />
4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.
<br />
<br />
There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
Once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:

<h2>            Surface RT no longer connects to xbox live games</h2>
                    <p>I can't connect to any of the xbox live games on my Surface RT any more. I am able to log into xbox live just fine from my PC and xbox consoles, but not the Surface. It tries to log in and then fails. It never queries me to re-enter my user name or PW and
 I can't find where I could reset that. </p>
<p>Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

<p>It's there even with a new game and I have now discovered the same two icons infiltrating other programs' dialog boxes - apparently randomly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I wonder if Freecell can take voice commands in some undocumented way.</p>

    <title>Laptop audio crackles regardless of which speaker is selected - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimbrooker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop audio crackles regardless of which speaker is selected</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded a new game from steam, but I quickly realised that no sounds was playing. I checked my default audio device (Realtek HD Audio) drivers to see if they were up to date. They weren't. I installed the new driver but the sound became extremely
 tinny and crackly, especially with louder and higher pitched audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I though this might be a problem with Realtek HD Audio, so I disabled it and connected my TYLT portable Bluetooth speakers, but they also played a tinny and crackly sound. Therefore this couldn't be a Realtek HD Audio problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm completely stumped on this one, I've tried the windows audio troubleshooter but it didn't resolve the issue. I've disabled all enhancements as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Thank you for the information, Jim. There is a possibility that the audio driver of your computer has an issue. We recommend that you completely uninstall the audio driver, and then restart the computer. This will allow Windows 10 to install a generic audio
 driver. By doing this, it will help us verify if the issue is with the driver or not. To know how to uninstall a driver, follow the steps
<strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/using-device-manager-to-uninstall-devices-and-driver-packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Please take note that you need to click the
<strong>Delete the driver software for this device</strong> option on the <strong>
Confirm Device Removal</strong> dialog box to completely remove the audio driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Boa Noite pessoal, comprei um jogo recentemente que vem com sua DLC's mas não sei o pq que os códigos delas não estão funcionando...</p>
<p>Será que é por ser um jogo antigo ou é algum problema na LIVE?</p>

<p>Eu resolvi esse Problema...</p>
<p>Como não foi liberado para o Brasil, essas DLC's só são baixadas por uma conta Americana!!!</p>
<p>Basta criar um e-mail com os Estados Unidos como país, logar no Xbox e fazer o download delas, vai funcionar na conta Brasileira normalmente!!!</p>

                    <p>HI</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Disk usage 100% whenever i use Outlook 2016. I did not have the problem prior, this is happening from a month.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I re-installed the Outlook to see if that might have corrupted files but its still the same. I have 194 GB of free space in the drive. Most of my work is on Outlook, Word, Excel and web browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried not using outlook for a day and everything seems to work well, Let me know a way i can resolve this issue. I tried to disable Windows Search, Super Fetch and performed a disk check, which has also not resolved anything.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender in Vista/windows 7 is an Anti-Spyware Program, not an Anti-Virus Program.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>You should have an Anti-Virus installed.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are using <strong>Norton, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, etc</strong> the default action is for&nbsp;Windows Defender to be disabled, as those AntiVirus Programs have their own Antispyware Applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is nothing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Using the two Programs at the same time can cause System conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a different Anti-Virus, please read this:</p>
<p>"<span>How to Start/Stop </span><span>Windows Defender service"</span></p>

<p><span><span>I was looking for the security status and firewall settings into the control panel.

<p><span>When I click on System and Security, Explorer stops working or shuts down and does not start again. It is happening most of the times.(95%) If I go through it, it hangs if I click on Action

<br />
<p><span>Hello Funwith7,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>To understand the issue you better I would like to ask you couple of questions.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you accessing as an administrator?</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>I would suggest you to perform SFC scan and check whether it helps.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>To determine whether the issue that you are experiencing is caused by one or more system files that are used by Windows Vista,
 run the System File Checker tool. The System File Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this issue, let’s use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe).&nbsp; To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong>
</strong>Start, click All Programs, click Accessories right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>The SFC /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect&nbsp;versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For more information how to do SFC/ scan, please follow this link:
<p>
<span>If this doesn’t helps then, perform a clean boot, may be any third party application is causing this problem. Please follow the step 2 to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>To find out which startup application is causing the issue, try to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Clean Boot will help you start your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program or any of the third party service is interfering
 with your program.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Steps to perform a Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. Click Start on your Desktop.<br />
</span><span>2. Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.<br />
</span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue.
<br />
</span><span>3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
</span><span>4. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
</span><span>5. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
</span><span>6. Click OK.<br />
</span><span>7. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the computer boots fine after clean boot, then there are some non Microsoft applications causing the problem. To find out which application causing the problem refer from step 2 to step 6 in the
 article which is mentioned in the clean boot article?</span></p>
<p>
<span>Once you find out the application which is causing the issue, i would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the application.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To return your computer back to normal boot:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. Click Start on your Desktop<br />
</span><span>2. Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.<br />
</span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue.<br />
</span><span>3. Click the General tab.<br />
</span><span>4. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.<br />
</span><span>5. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.<br />
<br />
</span><span>For information on using “Clean Boot”, see the following Microsoft Article:<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</span></a></p>
<p>
<span><span>I hope that this information helps. Please get back to us if you have any more questions about this issue.</span></span></p>

<h2>            There are no PSTN Calling Plans available</h2>
                    
<p>I've searched for this answer for hours. We have a Nonprofit E5 license.</p>
<p>First, there is no "Add-On" section on our Subscriptions page as referenced here in the official documentation:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Buy-or-edit-an-add-on-for-Office-365-for-business-4e7b57d6-b93b-457d-aecd-0ea58bff07a6?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IE&amp;ad=IE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Buy-or-edit-an-add-on-for-Office-365-for-business-4e7b57d6-b93b-457d-aecd-0ea58bff07a6?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IE&amp;ad=IE</a></p>
<p>Second, following other instructions visiting Purchase Services in the Admin Center, PSTN Calling is not in any of the lists.</p>
<p>Third, visiting this url <a href="https://portal.office.com/commerce/catalog.aspx?empty=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
portal.office.com/.../catalog.aspx</a>, as referenced in other posts, also does not show PSTN calling.</p>
<p>The PSTN Service<em>&nbsp;is</em>&nbsp;available to Non-Profits, as is <strong>clearly</strong> stated here:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Skype-for-Business-Online-licensing-overview-3ed752b1-5983-43f9-bcfd-760619ab40a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Skype-for-Business-Online-licensing-overview-3ed752b1-5983-43f9-bcfd-760619ab40a7</a>&nbsp;under
 the heading "What features are available to GOV, EDU, non-profit organizations?"</p>

<p>hi dane,</p>
<p>i understand you are using office 365 nonprofit e5 subscription but cannot find the pstn calling add-on. but according to the article, the service should be available. given the situation, please further check if you can find that in the following locations:<br />
1. is there a cloud pbx plan listed under <strong>billing</strong>&gt; <strong>subscriptions</strong>? if yes, please refer to the article you pasted and check if you can find the add-on there.<br />
2. you can also go to <strong>purchase services</strong> and check if you can find the add-on under
<strong>add-on subscriptions</strong>.</p>

<br />
note: if you are using the office 365 admin center preview, please click <strong>
billing</strong>&gt; <strong>purchase services</strong>.</p>

<br />
if you eventually cannot find the target add-on after checking all the places, please take some related screenshots of the page you can see and upload them.
<br />
1) billings&gt; subscriptions&gt; e5&gt; add-on<br />
2) billing&gt; subscriptions&gt; cloud pbx plan &gt; add-on (this one is optional as you may not see cloud pbx plan.)

<p><span>Hi eileenjune,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers community.</span></p>
<p><span>This issue may occur if one or both of the following files are missing or damaged:<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>1. Config.nt<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>2. Autoexec.nt<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Try the below steps and let me know if it helped.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Double click "My Computer" then your hard drive (probably C drive) and open the "WINDOWS" folder.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open "Repair" folder. Find "autoexec.nt" and "config.nt" in there. Copy these files (Ctrl+C) then go back to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 and paste them there (Ctrl+V). It will ask you if you want to replace the old one.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click "Yes".</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Now check if the problem persists.</span></p>

<h2>            Deleting user account in only one computer</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new computer, and although my old computer is still quite usable, I am unable to delete my user account as it is the same as the one on&nbsp;my new computer. If I delete one, I delete both. How do I go about doing this? I was going to
 just re-format the hard drive, but I am seemingly unable to do so in Windows 10 (upgrade from 8.1)

<h3> andrewx3n  say:</h3>
<h2>            i7-8700k running lower than its base clock&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've never seen it running lower than 3.7GHz, even when not in use, so this strikes me as unusual. It's not overclocked.</p>

            Hi Andrew,
<br />
<br />This is all very normal, I have had core i7 processors for that last 8 years since they were introduced.
<br />
<br />The SpeedStep Technology will manage your processor and your processor is capable of ticking over at even 1GHz this is not a problem at all, it means the technology is working
<br />
<br />When you need it, that processor will boost to 4.5GHz and that is the way core processors are designed to work
<br />
<br />Honestly you have nothing to worry about, below is a screenshot of one of my Laptop's current processor state:<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77a39e67-e7ab-4a7a-a813-dbfc6ef6ac84?upload=true" />

<h2>            Skype Webcam</h2>
                    <p>So I am using the Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920 with skype and basically my problem is as follows:</p>
<p>In the skype video settings i am able to change the webcam to mirrored or normal, and i prefer it to be normal rather than mirrored but when i click mirrored on the video settings, i can see the normal version and everyone else can see the mirrored version.
 Is there any fix for this? Its very annoying. I just want to be able to see myself the way others are seeing me on skype.</p>

            On a video call the local feed is intentionally mirrored to mirror your actions. There is no option to change this behavior in the software. Mirroring the feed in any software/driver will simply reverse the behavior, it will not accomplish what you want.
 The webcam settings may be the only location where you can view the feed normally as your participants see it.&nbsp;

<p>You are free to falsely believe I and others in the Community are wrong. It is simply how it is done in Skype for Windows Desktop and how it has been hard-coded for years. More than likely your friends do not notice it or they use some other software that
 behaves differently.</p>

    <title>My printer spooler will not start automatically. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> narellemorgan  say:</h3>
<h2>            My printer spooler will not start automatically.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;The print spooler properties show that its start up type is automatic.&nbsp; The service status shows "started" (even when there are no documents sent to print)&nbsp; and the Stop button is the only highlighted button.&nbsp; The start, pause and resume buttons are all
 greyed out.&nbsp; If I run the trouble shooter when a document has been sent to print, it will then print with the message that there is a print job in the queue.&nbsp; The only print job is the one that I just sent.&nbsp; I have tried the Microsoft Fix It tool and it advises
 that everything is OK.&nbsp; How do I resolve this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi diyanayunus_1502,<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.<br />
From your description it appears that you are not able to use touch keyboard automatically.<br />
Touch keyboard is designed in such a way that you have to open it or click on it to use,it cannot be launched automatically.<br />
To fix this issue you can follow these steps:<br />
Method 1: You can create a shortcut of Touch keyboard on the taskbar<br />
Step 1: Right-click on the taskbar and select Properties<br />
Step 2: select Toolbars tab.<br />
Step 3: check the option named Touch Keyboard and click Apply button to see a small keyboard icon in the taskbar.<br />
Step 4: Click on the keyboard icon on the taskbar to start using the touch keyboard.<br />
You can refer this link How to use the touch keyboard.<br />

            Don't understand&nbsp; this reply. Here is what it says at the "using touch keyboard" link above -
<br />
<br />
<u>To use the touch keyboard, tap in a text field or other area where you can type. The keyboard appears automatically.<br />
<br />
</u>Doesn't do that for me, I have to click on the taskbar icon. Also, I do not get any text suggestions.

            <p>I am having the same issue. The touch keyboard comes up when I am in Word &amp; PowerPoint 2013 but not in Excel or any other applications requiring text input.. So it obviously works for some and not others. As already asked above, is there a setting to make
 it always automatic? It does not make alto of sense to always have to tap an icon on the taskbar...</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Please see all additional questions on this string and kindly provide insight/answers!&nbsp; Sounds like many of us can't get the keyboard to auto work in many apps requiring text input (for me it is particularly a nuisance in internet explorer... its a hassle
 to type in a simple URL!</p>

<p>The touch screen keyboard supposed to work as :</p>
<p><em>tap in a text field or other area where you can type and the touch keyboard appears</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it did not work out this way, some bugs must exit with Windows 8, I would like to see the automatic appearance of keyboard when I tap a text field just like what Android or iOS does.</p>

<p>This is a very important issue for MS team !!</p>

<p>You need to distinguish between Desktop and Modern UI Fullscreen (MUF) apps.&nbsp;&nbsp; The stated functionality is only available for the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; For Desktop use you can add the Touch Keyboard toolbar to your Taskbar.&nbsp; In any case you can use the Settings charm
 to start a TK.</p>

            I understand that the touch keyboard does not automatically start for desktop applications. But I don't know why it's features (eg text suggestions) don't work even though I've got them all turned on in the settings. It's VERY frustrating!<br />

            I have suddenly encountered this problem as well.&nbsp; It started after Dell replaced my hard drive.&nbsp; I had no such issues before then.&nbsp; Dell sent out a tech who replaced the motherboard, but that didn't help.&nbsp; The screen will also no longer rotate in tablet
 mode.&nbsp; Are these Windows 8 issues or Dell?
