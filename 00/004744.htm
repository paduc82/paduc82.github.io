<p>To install the application to your windows phone, you need to gain access to the marketplace from your phone...there's no other way to install applications except by accessing the marketplace from the phone.</p>
<p>You'll need to provide more information about the problem(s) you encounter when you try to access the marketplace.&nbsp; Have you installed the marketplace software to your phone? If so, do you receive any kind of error message when you attempt to access the
 marketplace from your phone?</p>

<h2>            E-mail Sent is nowhere to be found</h2>
                    <p>I clicked on a hyperlinked e-mail address on a website to apply for a job. When I clicked on the hyperlink it opened a smaller window of Outlook (not my account) where I composed a fairly lengthy message, and attached my resume and a reference letter. I
 Bcc'd myself, but this message has never arrived. Looking in my Outlook account it also does not appear in the Sent box. The message with the attachments appeared to go through once I pressed send, but don't understand what happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In hindsight, it appears this message was not composed in my Outlook, but some outside Outlook window. Can anyone explain?</p>

<p>Hello Jesinta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying -- hope you can help! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a long-time Hotmail account holder and a Windows Live Mail user through the Firefox browser. This very recently changed over to an Outlook.live.com Mail interface without my selecting it, and I have the Windows 10 platform. As I look in my settings
 it does say Outlook 2010, but nowhere on my email account does it say Office Outlook, so I am really not sure -- the recent changes have me somewhat puzzled. Nonetheless, I am not sure that is relevant to the aforementioned question.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was on a public school's website attempting to apply for a teaching position. I went to the applicant's page and there was a hyperlinked e-mail address for the principal. When I clicked on this blue email address another window popped up that was Outlook,
 but appeared to be a light version, or at least something different than my Outlook e-mail interface. There was no From address listed for me at all. I wrote a message requesting the position and attached a resume and a reference letter, and since I was concerned
 by the strange appearance (that it clearly was not my e-mail account, but a somehow more simplified Outlook e-mail window) I Bcc'd myself. As I said this never arrived in my inbox and does not appear in my sent messages when I return to my Outlook e-mail account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since gone into the advanced settings on my laptop, switched the proxy settings for the default e-mail program to Windows Live, then returned to the same website and when I click the hyperlinked e-mail address a similar window to the simpler Outlook
 pops up, but it is blue and says Windows Live at the top, rather than Outlook. This is still not my e-mail account, but a seemingly dumbed-down version of e-mail interface which also does not have my From address listed. There is only a space for To addresses
 and a "send" button at the top left. I assume this e-mail interface would have the same result as the similar Outlook version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is A) Why is this what pulls up automatically when I select the hyperlinked e-mail address?, and
</p>
<p>B) How do I change settings so that when I click a hyperlinked e-mail address my actual e-mail account pulls up as the default?, and C) where does the e-mail I wrote and sent to myself and that school principal end up when sent from this screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, is Outlook E-mail now my only option? That is, can I no longer have the e-mail interface through Windows Live to which I was accustomed?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time,</p>
<p>Justin&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2010 is a part&nbsp;of Office which consists of Word, Outlook, PowerPoint etc. Office&nbsp;Outlook&nbsp;which is a mail client to access your&nbsp;email account through desktop and not web browser. "2010"&nbsp;is the version of Office installed in your computer. I understand
 that you use Office Outlook and web browser to access your email account and when you login to
<a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a> through the web browser, you see
<strong>Outlook Mail</strong> on the upper left corner.&nbsp;I also noticed that you&nbsp;use Windows 10, therefore you&nbsp;might&nbsp;be using&nbsp;in-built Windows 10 Mail app to&nbsp;access your email account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your&nbsp;questions:&nbsp;When you click on the hyperlinked link, it&nbsp;open a new email&nbsp;from your Outlook 2010 mail client or Windows 10 mail app with the principal's email address on the TO: section. This can only be determined after you send&nbsp;us a screenshot
 of the&nbsp;window that appears after you click on the hyperlinked email address. Therefore, the sent email will not show in your Sent Items folder through the webmail i.e. when you login to your email account through web browser but one of your mail clients.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend you open both Outlook 2010 and Windows 10 mail app and check if you can find that email in&nbsp;any of their Sent Items folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, once your account is migrated to the new interface, you cannot revert it back to the old&nbsp;interface. Eventually all the email accounts will be migrated to the new interface.
</p>

<p>Hello Michael D McCarthy, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, please make sure Outlook and Skype for Business have connected to the same account. Then login Outlook Web App to see if issue occurs on web side. If issue only presents in desktop client,
 you may use Outlook Web App as a temporary workaround. Besides, check updates for Outlook for Mac to make sure it is in the latest version.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better help you, if issue only exists in desktop client, you are suggested to contact our built-in support via Outlook-&gt;Help-&gt;<strong>Contact Support</strong>, they are dedicated team focusing on Outlook
 for Mac issue, and will further assist your regarding your situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Prasad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Ciao,

it looks like there are some known issue between Office and older MAC OS versions.

Could you please try to upgrade to High SIerra?

https://support.apple.com/macos/high-sierra

Please let us know the outcome!

Thanks
Ugo

<p>Upgrading to High Sierra is a boxed solution that will cause more issues than it solves, if it even solves the dictation issue in the first place. I absolutely will not upgrade to High Sierra. That OS has not been tested to the extent necessary for a public
 release. It's too unstable, has caused thousands of users critical problems during the upgrade process, and breaks many of the apps I depend on daily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And since this is happening only in Word, not in Excel or Powerpoint, or any other app on my computer, I am quite confident this is an issue on Microsoft's end. Fix the app, not the OS.</p>

just to let you know that we are independent professionals (not Microsoft or other company employees), so we'd love to fix all the issues but we cannot :-D.

I'm escalating your concerns to the company, they will certainly help you out!

<p>I am using macOS 10.12.6. Word 2016 is at fault here because dictation works perfectly in Excel, Powerpoint, and Word/Excel/Powerpoint 2011 as well as every other app I've ever used it in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may just go back to Word 2011 because the ENTIRE Office suite takes up 1.5 GB of hard drive space instead of 6 GB like Office 2016 does, and the restore windows function actually works properly in Office 2011.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In your original question you mentioned you have Word version 15.8. Did you mean 15.38?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really have 15.8, then you should install updates because you're more than 30 updates behind.</p>

<p>OK - before you totally abandon, please do a couple things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Install updates. The current version is 15.39</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. After installing updates, if the problem persists, click the smile button to send a report directly to Microsoft so they can be alerted that there is a problem to fix. Sending the report that way also sends some system information for them to analyze.</p>

            I am having major issues with dictation since updating to High Sierra. I have the latest version of Word. My dictation is also fully functional in all other apps. The issue is specific to Word. Since updating, whenever I attempt to dictate, the dictation
 works normally, but transitioning back to using the cursor results in extremely diminished performance (huge lag time, often doesn't capture all the letters I am writing, may randomly delete words, etc.). How can I fix this issue?? It is greatly impacting
 my work productivity and is a huge hassle. &nbsp;

<p>Hi Gavinfb,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing the information. Please try the solution and troubleshooting mentioned in this
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/joerg_sinemus/2017/03/03/sharepoint-designer-2013-and-login-issue-in-cloud-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> to see if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’d like to confirm if you have tried the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Sign out SharePoint Designer.</p>
<p>2. Go to&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>User Account</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Manage Windows Credentials</strong>&nbsp;&gt; remove all credentials related to&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Restart SharePoint Designer and sign in to see if the issue still exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists after you try the steps above, to identify if this issue is related to your account, if possible, could you try your account from another computer or try a different account from the same computer with your account signed out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Joshua</p>

</p><p>I would go back to the 2011 version too. But in 2011, they took away the capability to specify table column widths and row heights. *sigh*</p>

            IIRC - and I've checked as far back as Office 2004 -- PPT for Mac never did have any means of specifying Row Height &amp; Column Width... For that matter, neither does Excel. That's a capability offered only by the Table Properties in Word.<br />

            I must be missing something. You always could &amp; still can set column &amp; row width &amp; height in Excel in every version I know of on Mac. Just highlight the row(s) or column(s) &amp; choose the FORMAT pulldown. You can set it with CELL or ROW or COLUMN.

            You're correct, of course, in regard to Row Height &amp; Column Width for an <em>
entire worksheet</em>... That's why you need not actually highlight the entire row or column, you need only select a single cell within the column or row. The question, though, is in reference to a singular Table.<br />

<h2>            &#34;This file can&#39;t be previewed because of an error in the Microsoft Word previewer.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>There have been different posts about this but none seem to resolve the problem on my computer. Never had the issue with Outlook 2010. Perhaps someone has found a solution by now... Using Outlook 2013 on Windows 7 64bit SSD with Word 2010.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice that "Microsoft Word" is not listed specifically in Trust Center attachment handling,</p>
<p>Could that be part of the problem?</p>
<p>Excel, Visio, RTF and many more are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: strange, search can be performed in Word attachments... but can't preview Word file.</p>
<p>So, Outlook can 'see' Word docs but won't let us have that preview.</p>

            <p>Okay, well, where is this <strong>Microsoft Office Button</strong> ? Did try within Word 2010 (i have) via "or the
<strong>File</strong> tab, and then you then click <strong>Open</strong>." but that only opens for choice of docs and nothing about "preview" there. Did send myself an Excel file and having same issue as Word (no preview).

<p>Please, do tell me where to look for that "preview option"!</p>
<p>For i can't find it in any of the drop-downs in that screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BTW, it's odd, for some reason i can't even get previews of docs via Windows Explorer anymore.</p>
<p>I had un-ticked some programs from Trusted section and re-ticked (Outlook 2013) them back and had done reboots since too.</p>

The site owners have listened and made the process of posting images easier (but not easiest, yet).<span>&nbsp;
</span>The link above details the process.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
The replies are HTML files, you cannot paste images directly into them like a Word DOC(X) file. Instead you have to provide, in one form or another, a HTML link to a picture file that is available on the internet.
</p>
<p>In short form, the image must be in <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">PNG</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">,
<strong>JPG</strong>, <strong>GIF</strong>, and <strong>BMP </strong></span>format.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Use the <strong>“Add Image” button</strong> that is on the same line as the “Bold”, “Italic”, “Underline” feature buttons.
</p>
<p>So, you will first have to save screen captures to a file on your HD or the internet, ie skydrive, before you can insert them in the discussion using the “Add Image” button.</p>

    <title>Yahoo Folders into Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> madelinestone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yahoo Folders into Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have just opened an Outlook 2013 account, and am in the process of integrating an about-to-be-shut-down Microsoft Exchange account and an existing Yahoo account. I tried to "add" my Yahoo account when I opened the new Outlook one, and was partially successfull:
 all of the messages currently housed in my Yahoo Inbox showed up (as well as recent Junk mail). However, none of the folders that I have set up in Yahoo (or the contents therein) are showing up on Outlook; these contain a great deal of my email content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added my Yahoo account using a POP3 server. Should I have used IMAP instead?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I import all my data from my existing Microsoft Exchange account, is there something I should do to ensure that my folder (and sub-folder) structure will be maintained?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Yes, you need to use IMAP to see all of the folders. You many need to create the folders in yahoo then move the mail - but try copying a folder to see. Always copy the mail, don't move it, so you have a backup copy incase something goes wrong.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks very much, Diane. Just so I'm clear, are you suggesting that I should add&nbsp;a new Yahoo account using IMAP instead - and, if so, should I delete the existing account - or should I somewhow change my server settings to IMAP?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'm not sure I understand what you mean about creating the folders first in Yahoo. I already have several folders in my Yahoo account, and it's these folders that did not transfer to Outlook. If I use IMAP, will they automatically transfer, or are
 you suggeting I somehow need to copy/move them. And, if so, can you provide a bit more detail about how to do that? Sorry, I'm not the most technologically advanced!</p>

            <p>If the account is configured as an IMAP account, you can't delete from the server, outlook holds a copy of the mailbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use POP3, you can configure it to delete from the server as it downloads mail. This setting is in File, Account Settings, double click on the account then click More Settings. Look on the Advanced tab for the leave on server settings.

    <title>Outlook 2010 - Some sent emails are greyed out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saragangale  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 - Some sent emails are greyed out</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a Windows 2008 R2 terminal server with Office 2010 installed,on which 10 users connect and work. Every user have his own email profile.</p>
<p>On only 2 users, randomically some sent emails are duplicated, and one of the two copies is greyed out and barred. Looks like it has someway been deleted, but the users didn't delete those emails as the greyed out duplicate shows up immediately after the
 user clicks on send.</p>
<p>If the user double-clicks on the greyed out item, it opens with no issues, and as soon as the user closes the email, it's not greyed out and "barred" anymore, but there are still 2 copies.</p>
<p>The issue is completely randomic, not all the sent mails are affected.</p>
<p>The email profile is configured in IMAP and it's attached to a non-exchange mail server.</p>
<p>The other users have never been affected by this issue, but the IMAP configuration is the same for all the users in the domain.</p>
<p>How can I troubleshoot this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Gradient feature unavailable in MS-Office Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>I have MS Office 2010 (Standard)&nbsp;installed on my PC. I have a problem that, in MS Word I cannot use the gradient feature, using that we can fill color&nbsp;effects in some word or sentence. Whenever I select any word and click on font color option, then gradient
 feature is shown in gray i.e. inactive. Please let me know if&nbsp;I need to install some plugins or any updates?
</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gradient feature is not available if the document is in compatibility Mode. Try re-saving the document to Word 2010 document format and then check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists throughout all Word document, then repair Office 2010 installation and verify the results.</p>

    <title>Autosave on Mac for Word 2016 Doesn&#39;t Work--Repeated Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jfs3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autosave on Mac for Word 2016 Doesn&#39;t Work--Repeated Error Messages</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having annoying troubles with Autosave on Mac for Word 2016. &nbsp;I set it autosave every 5". &nbsp;When that happens, I get a message that says "You cannot save while this file is in use by another process. &nbsp;Trying saving the file with a new name." &nbsp;When I
 click on OK, I get another message that says, "Word is unable to save the AutoRecover file in the location you have specified. &nbsp;Make sure that you have specified a valid location for AutoRecover files in Preferences, and that you have permission to write files
 to the location you specified." Then the file crashed, and there was nothing in the Autosave file. &nbsp;This happened several times. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is intermittent. &nbsp;It doesn't happen all the time. &nbsp;I started when I downloaded the latest version of Office 365. &nbsp;I have spoken to MS technical support twice, but the problem keeps occurring. &nbsp;When it first started, I relocated the Autorecovery
 file to a new location, but that didn't help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gather that there are quite a few other users who have this problem. &nbsp;I tried a fix posted by Rich Michaels on October 16, 2016 which made the problem go away but then it recurred, I think after downloading the most recent Word for Mac update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have MS Word for Mac v 15.31. &nbsp;I am running macOS Sierra V. 10.12.3 on a mid-2011 iMac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Setting AutoSave to too short of an interval means it may not be finished saving from the last time it was automatically invoked, and you get an error message. This is decreasing, not increasing your overall system stability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll get a much better backup environment with an inexpensive external disk and OS X's Time Machine utility turned on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Thank you. I do have Time Machine, it it does hourly backups. &nbsp;For now, I've turned Autosave off, save frequently, and will rely on Time Machine.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

<p>I suspect that unless each user is logged into Windows with an Insider Microsoft Account, they may not see Files on Demand until it becomes generally available. I do not see it yet on my 16299.15 non-Insider installs, so the new OneDrive version has to come

<p>What does it have to do with the question well it has a lot to do with it first MS advises not to use beta software on any everyday system,&nbsp; installing it on any new system will also void the warranty, no direct support from MS when using Preview,&nbsp; as Hula
 was only give you some advice about using a BETA operating system&nbsp; on your computers that might be important for your business.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for you original question it is still under beta testing and will be released with the Fall upgrade, this maybe the reason it doesn't show on some system as&nbsp; 16299.15 has not be posted by MS as the official Fall release we should be getting another update/upgrade
 soon maybe to-day&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>Summary solution - remove the offending 3rd party program and/or ensure that you have the latest version installed but at the end of the day - problem can only be resolved by the vendor responsible for the product&nbsp;triggering the problem.</p>

            <p>Hi Nicola,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest referring to this very important article from <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> which was released earlier this year. It is about the upgraded Outlook.com and how you can reconnect your account to it after the upgrade. The said upgrade impacts
 all <strong>Outlook</strong>, <strong>Hotmail</strong>, <strong>Live</strong>, or
<strong>MSN</strong> email accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Reconnect-Outlook-2016-or-Outlook-2013-to-Outlook-com-for-uninterrupted-email-access-cda1751d-9503-40bf-bf76-e79454ac5eb3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><strong>Reconnect To Outlook.com for Uninterrupted
 Email Access</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>Looking at the screenshot from the article, it's noted there that you will need to create an App Password to add the account in Outlook.</p>
