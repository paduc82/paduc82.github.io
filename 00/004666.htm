<h2>            Need to resize&#47;scale a document&#39;s contents</h2>
                    <p>I want to resize (scale) a document and continue to write in it, at the reduced scale, so I can fit more into one page.&nbsp; This is not just changing font size; everything must scale (such as textboxes and tables) and thus allow more space on a page for me
 to write or otherwise work with.&nbsp; Office for Mac does this, through print settings and scale, but Word 2007 only seems to adjust viewing size, not working size, or scales down one page, which isn't flexible enough for me.&nbsp; I used to be able to make a 100%
 document into, say, 82%, and thus get 8 pages into 6, etc.&nbsp; Please help!&nbsp; I'm trying to change from Mac to PC, but little (!) things like this that really hurt my productivity are beginning to make me regret the switch.</p>

            Word 2007 certainly lets you print a document in multiple pages on the same sheet, if that helps. In the Print dialog box (Ctrl+P), choose something the number of "Pages per sheet" that you want.

            Thank you, Suzanne.&nbsp; Your page shows very many useful tips, some which I do regularly and others which I know will be helpful.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I think your comprehensive document pretty much confirms for me that Word just does't do what I really want,
 which is to resize the whole thing, so I'm then typing in a smaller font without chaning font size, etc.&nbsp; I'm used to resizing from 100% to 93%, then maybe to 85%, and being able to just continue to work with lots more space on the page--officially still with
 12 pt or whatever I used, but the computer automatically making the overall page smaller.&nbsp; The Mac version does this, but I think I'm going to have to give up that feature now that I'm moving to Word 2007.&nbsp; Your document (<span><span><a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/FitCopy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/FitCopy.htm</a>
</span></span>) gives me enough tips, new or reminders, that I should be able to still do my worksheets and various handouts (I'm a math teacher in an independent study program, where I post a lot of files online (as pdfs) or handout in person when possible.&nbsp;
 The more readable information&nbsp;I can fit on one or two pages, the better.&nbsp; I'll work with the information you've given me and hopefully that will be enough to make up for losing the resizing feature.&nbsp; I really do appreciate your replying; thank you again for
 answering and helping me with it.&nbsp;

            You might experiment with the "Scale to paper size" settings. There's no requirement that you print on the size paper you have scaled down to. But this still doesn't meet the requirement of getting more text on a single page.

    <title>Why exclude Vista users from free Windows 10 upgrade&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sonofthunder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why exclude Vista users from free Windows 10 upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    <p>You're giving this OS away to nearly 75% of all computer users already. In this huge campaign of consumer good will, unification, and righting past mistakes, it seems silly to exclude Vista users, who have suffered long enough, and represent only 0.8% of
 computer users, according to recent statistics.<br />
<br />
It's particularly dejecting to those of us participating in the Insider Program, giving you free beta testing on your new product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been a loyal customer who has spent thousands of dollars on various versions of your operating system over the years, never once having illegally downloaded any of your products.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to have a sense of entitlement about it, but I can't fathom how you can give this away to 75%, but 76% is a bridge too far?</p>

            <p>Even though Vista installations are not officially part of the promotion, they can still install the free promotional upgrade, just that it was not obtained under the validity of the promotion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft care, no, not really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Vista represents less that 2% marketshare. By the time Windows launches, it will represent probably less than 1%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its not necessarily licensing why Microsoft is not supporting, but engineering itself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you migrate to Windows 10 Previews now, you will also be able to upgrade to Windows 10 for free when its complete.</p>

            <p>i thought it was stupid to give 7 and 8.1 users free, but dump the 8 users out on the curb. i dont care either way, 10 dont seem like much of an advancement unless you can hold your pc monitor in your lap, or carry it around with you in your pocket or poke
 at the screen with your finger.. as far as vista, you should have upgraded just like me, 4 of my 7 machines are XP, i dont even want 10 free. judging by the hoopla going on in these forums and the actions of the people at MS, i will just stick with what i
 have. maybe even pick up a couple copies of OEM7 before they cease to exist!<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you feel left out by not getting "free" i guess you could download the 10TP, install it on your pc as a second OS and wait for final build=free stuff!</p>

            Yeah, I'm already dual booting the TP. My concern was, and to some extent still is, that they're not going to give TP users the full version for free. Free being the key word that I'm not hearing from MS. They just talk in vague terms about upgrading being
 possible and wanting to "provide a path". To me, it sounds like non-committal double-talk. Maybe I'm worrying over nothing. Wouldn't be the first time.<br />
<br />
As for not having upgraded from Vista yet, yeah, I would've loved to. But I'm one of those people for whom $100 is a lot of money, so the Win 7 disc has gone up against bills and groceries and continuously lost. First world problems, I know. Also, I'm working
 on some software, and I like having a Vista machine around to test it on. Although why even bother at this point, since it's such low market share.<br />
<br />
Well, I've got the TP, and I hope MS does right by their testers and gives us the free upgrade. Maybe 6 months from now I won't miss $100 either way.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. Does the same thing happen with other websites?</p>
<p>2. Were there any changes made in the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>3. Were you able to access the same website earlier without any issues?</p>
<p>Perform the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><b>Verify that Active Scripting, ActiveX, and Java are not being blocked by Internet Explorer</b></p>
<p>Active scripting, ActiveX, and Java are all involved in shaping the way information displays on a Web page. If these are blocked on your computer, it may disrupt the display of
 the Web page. Reset the Internet Explorer security settings to make sure these are not blocked. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the
<b>Tools</b> menu, click <b>Internet Options</b>. </p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
<b>Internet Options</b> dialog box, click the <b>Security</b> tab. </p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<b>Default Level</b>. </p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<b>OK</b>.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> ActiveX controls and Java programs are turned off at the High security level in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the below articles:</p>

<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Try disabling the Add-ons in the Internet Explorer 9 and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>How to manage add-ons in Internet Explorer 9</b></p>

<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p>If the issue still persists, then you can also try resetting the Internet Explorer and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>Reset Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;9 settings</b></p>

    <title>Unable to Remove Device Lock Security Setting WM6 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twcoll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Remove Device Lock Security Setting WM6</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I setup my device to sync with our exchange server through Active Sync on the phone, it required the security settings be changed so that I would have to enter a password after so much time of inactivity. I no longer need to sync my phone with my email
 and I have removed the Active Sync Exchange server from my phone but it still asks for a password after turning it on or it being inactive for a period of time. I have tried to see if I can disable it by going to Start - Settings - Lock, but it does not allow
 me to uncheck the option to disable the password. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know if I am missing anything here to remove the password lock for WM6. I am running a Cingular/AT&amp;T/HTC 8528

    <title>Virus infected System of OEM computer that was running Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randolphpaul  say:</h3>
<h2>            Virus infected System of OEM computer that was running Windows 10 Insider Preview</h2>
                    <p>Howdy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had windows 10 Insider Preview on this OEM computer last year.&nbsp; I hated the HP OEM so last years I changed out my HDD with a new SSD and installed the Windows 10 Insider Preview.&nbsp; With the Product key issued to me when I downloaded the Preview OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then recently my computer started to perform strange task, without user commands!!!&nbsp;I had to assume it was a virus, so I ran different anti-virus &amp; anti-malware.&nbsp; I couldn't fix the random, crazy stuff that still continued to occur on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I felt deep down, "I might have been hacked".&nbsp; At this point, I decided to wipe the SSD and re-install my original Windows 10 Insider Preview OS (that I use to install on this computer last year).&nbsp; It wouldn't even start the installation setup.&nbsp; Now I was
 starting to freak.&nbsp; I used another computer to try to download my original version of Windows 10 Insider Preview from Microsoft.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; I doesn't exist any longer.&nbsp; So I'm logged into Microsoft, I see the newest versions of Windows 10 Insider Preview.&nbsp;
 I download the new 14393 version.&nbsp; As I am downloading, the process never gave me a new Product Key.&nbsp; So I assumed that my original key would work, since I had to login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the newly formatted SSD and installed the newest Windows 10 Insider Preview version 14393.&nbsp; During install I reached the Product Key setup.&nbsp; I entered the Original Insider Product Key, "not a valid key".&nbsp; At this point I'm confused, this was the
 original Product Key issued to me from my Windows Insider Preview account.&nbsp; What the heck is going on?&nbsp; The old key doesn't work and no new key was issued during download of newer Insider Preview OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is what I am looking at;</p>
<p>Watermark of "Active Windows - Go to Settings to active Windows".</p>
<p>Went to settings, "Error code 0x803F7001" Windows is not activated.</p>
<p>I selected Troubleshoot.</p>
<p>Troubleshoot has completed.&nbsp; "We found Windows 10 Pro digital license for this device running Windows 10 Home Single Language.&nbsp; To active using this digital license, select upgrade your edition of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My original Windows 10 Insider Preview installed last year, was not the Windows 10 Insider Preview Pro version.&nbsp; Unless that is what happened when I thought I had been hacked?&nbsp; Any way, any advise is welcome?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>RJPaul</p>

            <p>Max,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, I will give this a try.&nbsp; I've been thinking of doing this exact things, but delaying it because of all the time it takes to backup data, download, install OS, install correct drivers/software, install microsoft office, blah, blah, blah...</p>
<p>
</p><p>LOL, then the fear of going through all this work again, and the product key would not work.&nbsp; Oh well, it's not like I had any plans this weekend.&nbsp; I do want the Windows 10 Inside Preview to work at it's best so I can explore different features on this ol'
 boat anchor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>RJPaul</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Just to let others know, even the way it is (with limits on setting features due to the activation issue), this is the fastest this computer has run. Only using 8GB RAM &amp; 2.2 GHz 4x AMD Processor with x64 Windows OS.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Are you attempting to copy from the <strong>Password</strong> field, itself? What I see here is that Excel 2016 will not permit copying a password [regardless of length] from the
<strong>PW</strong> field. If it did, a user could easily mistype the pw then copy the same error as verification... the result being that they then would not be able to open the file with the pw they
<em>thought</em> they had used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A password copied from a different source can be pasted into both the <strong>
PW</strong> &amp; the <strong>Verify</strong> fields, but otherwise, the verification must be typed.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2003&#59; Exchange server&#59; POP3 connection&#59; want to receive but not send on POP3</h2>
                    On my office desktop I have Win XP and Outlook 2003 connected to the office network running an Exchange server.&nbsp; On my desktop I have three email accts established:&nbsp; Exchange server - works fine; IMAP for gmail - works fine; and a POP3 acct which receives
 but won't send.&nbsp; It continuously tries and fails to send via POP3.&nbsp; I think that constant effort is causing Outlook to slowdown.&nbsp; I would like to continue receiving the POP3 email but stop the effort to send over the POP3.&nbsp; Is there a way to do this?&nbsp; Thanks.

<p><strong>If I now try to forward an email which came to me thru my POP3 account, Outlook still tries to send it via the POP3 account.&nbsp; In fact, I checked the "Details" on send and receive and it actually said that the POP3 send was completed.&nbsp; In reality,
 it was not completed.&nbsp; The POP3 email was and still is in the Outbox.&nbsp; Do I need to re-boot to have these changes take place?&nbsp; Is there something else I need to do?&nbsp; What am I missing?&nbsp; Thanks.</strong></p>
<p>This is the expected behavior. Outlook will always send on the same account that downloaded it. The Send emails option is for&nbsp;including the account in a send/receive, not what account is used for replies and forwards.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you want to send replies and forwards from a different account, go into Account settings (tools menu) and change this account's outgoing server to the one you want to use or can use.&nbsp; Go into More Settings and set&nbsp;the outgoing&nbsp;server authentication so
 its correct for the desired smtp server. If you want replies directed to a different account, change the&nbsp;email address and reply to addresses for the account also.</p>
<p>A common scenario for this&nbsp;is you changed ISPs and the old one lets you receive mail at the email address for 6 months. You need to send replies from your new ISP.&nbsp; You'll use the old incoming mail server and logon as usual, but change the email address
 and the outgoing server to the new one. This screenshot shows how you it would look:

<h3> danielschumann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 830 Camera saving problem, saving at a low resoloution</h2>
                    <p>So what is the fix for the "saving" issue with 830? I have two identical phones with the same win 10 version on them but one have the issue with getting stuck with saving after so many photos are taken. I also noticed it is taking a lower resolution photo
 than what the setting is at. Have tried the restart, soft start, removed battery. What else is there?&nbsp; Is it a software issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks daniel</p>

    <title>Not able to edit slow motion videos on Nokia 930 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevedavis71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not able to edit slow motion videos on Nokia 930</h2>
                    <p>I've just recently bought a 2nd hand Nokia 930 and upgraded it to Windows 10. I can take slow motion videos OK, but am having problems editing them - in the sense that I can't!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything I can find seems to suggest you open it in the Photos app and then click Edit, but I don't have an option to do that, only to Delete/Share and a few other unrelated items. I know some devices don't let you edit slow motion, but all of the evidence
 I have found seems to suggest I should be able to on a 930. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to install something else in order to be able to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The basic process I am following is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Activate the camera</p>
<p>2. Select the video icon</p>
<p>3. Click the turtle to choose "Slow Motion On"</p>
<p>4. Record some video</p>
<p>5. Press the circular icon top-left</p>
<p>6. Video starts to play in slow motion</p>
<p>7. Click the screen - apart from the timeline no option to edit</p>
<p>8. Click the ellipsis - No option to edit, only Delete/Share/File Info</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Steve</p>

<p>Years ago we received occasional complaints on the forum of this occurring when Windows Defender Offline was a stand-alone program and was being used to remove a rootkit infection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm curious if you don't mind me asking - why were you running the Windows Defender Offline option?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this has occurred on a Win 10 computer your easiest solution is to reset the computer.

                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a split <a href="http://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=1683764#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>database</span></a> and i added a new field to the main table called "finalresolution".<br />
<span>database</span></a> and i added a new field to the main table called "finalresolution".<br />
<br />
The field was not in the table when I split it originally and now i want to add that to the front end forms (again I split this database so multiple users can use it).<br />
<br />
When we go into the main form (the one we copy and share with others) and try to add the new field, it let's me get to a certain place and then does not allow completion of the task.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
1. I log into the form<br />
2. I note that my tables are all linked to the main table<br />
3. I see that the new field that i added to the back end (main backend table) shows in the linked
<a href="http://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=1683764#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>data</span></a><br />
4. I go into the form i want to edit<br />
5. I add the new combo box and answer the questions which are:<br />
a) do you want to use an existing query/table? I select this and point to the correct table that has the field i want<br />
b) where do you want the data to be placed? I want to now select my newly added field that i added to the backend and is showing in the linked form tables. I note that when I try to see the new field in my drop down (for where to place the data, it is not listed).<br />
<br />
Why isn't my new field coming into my combo box?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

            <p>i created a split database, so that multiple users can use at the same time.</p>
<p>i added a new column (Final Resolution Code 2) to one of the main tables "Member Portal".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when trying to create a new combo list, i want the list to <u>pull</u>&nbsp;its values from table "Secondary Final Resolution Codes" and then input that value into table "Member Portal - Final Resolution Code 2".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>while creating the combo list using the combo list wizard, it prompts through questions and one of the last questions is&nbsp;asking where i want the values stored.</p>
<p>it&nbsp;displays&nbsp;a list of fields all from the main table i want "Member Portal", but my newly added column/field Final Resolution Code 2 is not there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>why?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and yes i've re-linked the tables, twice!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any suggestions or feedback would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>my issue is when i'm setting up the combo box...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>using the combo box wizard its prompts a handful of questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. where do you want to pull the values from?</p>
<p>- i want it to pull from one table = Secondary Resolution Codes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. where do you want the values stored?</p>
<p>- i want the values stored in a different table and columb = Member Portal - Final Resolution Code 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when it asks this last question it pulls a list of fields that are all in Member Portal table, but its just this one column Final Resolution Code 2 that i can't see, its not an option to select.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and i dont know why.</p>
<p>i've relinked the tables...</p>

    <title>Outlook VBA&#58; Numbering end of subject line sequentially - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kc_c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook VBA&#58; Numbering end of subject line sequentially</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've put together 2 codes from the internet to add sequential numbers to the end of the subject line on emails I select. I will have several emails with the same subject line and I want to add sequential number to the end of the subject line b/c I some of
 the emails to the network folder. I got tired of manually having to rename the emails when I save them to the network at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works, but:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I would like have the numbering to start over the next time I select a group of emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ex: subject line of 1st email_1</p>
<p>subject line of 2nd email_2</p>
<p>
</p><p>but next time I run code and select emails it continues with 3 and I would like to start at 1 again, if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I would like it to number the oldest or first email with 1 and the newest with a later number. As it is right now, the code will number the 1st email re: a certain subject with later number and the newest email with 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate help with both questions, but if this is too hard, the 2nd question is the most needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help.</p>

            <p>It might have been in an editable mode, there are ways you can get Excel to appear unresponsive, sometimes also with macros that fire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But anyway, usually just a one-off isn't cause for alarm.&nbsp; If it keeps continuing, let us know.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please be careful to only turn off the PC suddenly when all else fails.&nbsp; It's far better to always at least try to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and either force-quit Excel or use the power button on that screen to do a "soft" shutdown.</p>

<h2>            When I plug my phone into my Pc &#38; Zune launches. I get a Connection Error &#34;Can&#39;t connect to your phone. Disconnect it, restart it, then try connecting again.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>No matter how many times I do this I get the same connection error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've tried reinstalling my WP7 usb drivers and still nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The device shows up on the pc no problem, but Zune wont function with it anymore.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I just recently reinstalled my OS. It worked fine before I reinstalled. </p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm curious if there is a way to erase the previous zune setup threw the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As i'm almost positive it's because It has a prior connection with my previous Zune software on my old OS.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I know this because the device shows up as what I named it&nbsp;from the prior Zune software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The new download just wont connect it. Nothing is wrong with the phone or driver as far as I know.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;It's functioning correctly. Just not on the Zune software.</p>

            <p>Yes.</p>
<p>You need to wait until there is a message on your phone indicating the update is available.&nbsp; This should happen in the next couple of weeks.&nbsp; There is no way of predicting exactly when, since the rollout is being staged on a random basis.</p>
<p>When you get the notification, plug the phone into your PC on which you have previously installed the latest Zune software (or Phone Connector software if you use a Mac).&nbsp; Zune will manage the update.</p>

<h2>            I need to find a way to refresh our SharePoint o365 QA collection from SharePoint o365 Prod to QA</h2>
                    
<p>We have a SharePoint o365 tenant with a QA site collection and a production site collection. &nbsp;The production site collection is 57 gig. &nbsp;I need to refresh / copy / replicate to the QA from Prod to assure that they are in sync. &nbsp;So when our QA group tests
 in the QA environment we can legally say that QA is the same as production. &nbsp;This is something we do on premise all the time. &nbsp;We have Metalogix "Content Matrix" tool but that would take days. &nbsp;Has anyone found a good solution for such a predicament?</p>

<p>Hi Craig,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There is no official solution to automatically refresh/copy/replicate two site collections in SharePoint Online. We can only copy a site with
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-and-use-site-templates-60371B0F-00E0-4C49-A844-34759EBDD989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Save site as template feature</strong></a> (the limitation is 50 MB) or move library files between two site collections with
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Video-Copy-or-move-library-files-by-using-Open-with-Explorer-c27bc6f3-7b38-4c29-b947-5d00c7153384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Open with Explorer</strong></a> feature.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You may need to look for some 3rd party solution. Other community members are welcome to share your experience about this requirement here.<br />

<p>Not sure if you're looking for an autosync here... If so, this won't be of any help.</p>
<p>But regarding the issue of the time it'd take, if budget permits it, you could look at other SharePoint Management tools. Sharegate (who I work for -&gt; full disclosure) for instance has an "insane mode" that might be what you need. Others might provide such
 features as well! </p>

<p>I picked up my phone to do a reset but decided not to as I have only just got it personalized again.</p>
<p>I had an idea which worked (first time for everthing), I linked the tiles and then unlinked them and that has done the trick.</p>

<h2>            Backlight of the navigation keys Lumia 830 not working properly</h2>
                    
<p>My backlight of the navigation&nbsp;bar of the&nbsp;Nokia Lumia 830 are not working properly. They were on in the beginning, but after a while they turned off.&nbsp;If I disable the option ''battery saver (brightness)'' in the settings of ''screen'', the lights turn on!!
 Strange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is.. I haven't enabled battery saver and my battery is fully charged. Still, the lights won't go on when I have enabled the option ''battery saver (brightness)''.Thereby, on my glance screen the battery saver icon is activated. Agian, battery
 saver is not activated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like a software problem. Is this a known problem and is there a solution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope to here from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<p>Hi, jesse_s93.&nbsp;We're glad to see you in the forum.&nbsp;Are you still experiencing the same issue with your Lumia 830? Let's try to further identify the possible cause of it. Does this happen randomly or is it a continuous fault? What fixes have you tried so
 far? By the way, have you tried coordinating this with your point of purchase for a possible replacement? We hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I first wanted to say thank you for your response!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I'm still experiencing it, but I've found a workaround. Let me first answer your questions and then I will tell you about my workaround.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't happen randomly. It started after a charge overnight. I inplugged my device and this battery shield was on my glance screen, even though battery saver was not activated. On my start screen this shield wasn't visible on the battery icon. After
 that, my navigation keys won't light up anymore. I've tried soft resets and all options in the battery saver settings, but that didn't help. I would have contacted my point of purchase if it was a hardware defect, but..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've found out that it isn't. It is a software bug. In settings there is also a setting for ''screen''. If I go there, there is an option called ''battery saver (brightness)''. It is enabled by default, which is good so my screen will be dimmed when battery
 saver is active. But.. although battery saver is NOT active, this option does effect my brightness (so it will dim when battery saver is not active)! Thereby, when I disable this option, my keys will light up!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems some sort of software bug related to the battery saver. It is not enabled on my device and my phone is fully charged, but there is a battery shield on my glance screen and the option under screen does have effect on my brightness. I've checked it
 with a Lumia 930. The option under screen (battery saver (brightness))&nbsp;has no effect on the brightness of the screen when battery saver is not active. After activating, the lights of the keys will also still light up. So, no trouble with the Lumia 930.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope I explained it clear. If not, feel free to ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>btw,&nbsp;is there somewhere I can report this bug? Or if I report it her, will it be in the right place?</p>

            Tested your workaround since I was having the same issue. I even opted in to PfD to get the latest version of the software but to no avail.<br />
<br />
Your workaround does work, and it is an issue with the software. Kinda frustrating that Lumia 830's Denim isn't the full Denim package as it still has an outdated firmware, that also makes the Lumia Camera 5.0 not working properly.

<h2>            Enable Scripts error when trying to download Office 365 on Mac</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to accept an invitation to install Office 365, but keep getting the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">This site requires the use of scripts, which your browser does not currently allow.&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=524405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">See how to enable scripts.</a>"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>when I log into my account. &nbsp;My sister was able to download onto her Mac a few months back so this appears to be a new problem. &nbsp;All scripts, including Java, are confirmed to be enabled in the safari preferences section and have never been disabled. &nbsp;Please
 advise how to fix this.&nbsp;</p>
