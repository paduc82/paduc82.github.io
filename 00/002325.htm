<h2>            Outlook--Your session has expired</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10, Build 15063 (what ever that means). Frequently, I am writing emails and a window pops up and tells me "Your Session has expired" and asks me to sign out and then sign in. I use Outlook several times a day and sometimes when I am
 writing an email and the window pops up and I follow the instructions and then send that email--it vaporizes. It appears to be sent, but it shows up in the draft folder instead. Any ideas as to what is happening?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6c0772c-75a1-41ac-9b81-8139bea9c6d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6c0772c-75a1-41ac-9b81-8139bea9c6d6" /></a>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you received the session expired message, one is if your system's time and date is not set properly. To isolate your concern, we'd like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes on your device prior to your concern?</li><li>Have you tried using a different browser? If yes, did you encounter the same issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, ensure that the time and date is set properly on your device. Also if you're using Internet Explorer, clear your browsing history and cache and check if the issue persists. To do this, follow the steps provided on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17438/windows-internet-explorer-view-delete-browsing-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll appreciate if you can send us an update.</p>

<p>Darwin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I've had the issue for several months, perhaps most of 2017. So, many changes/updates have occurred. It would be hard to isolate the appropriate factor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Typically I use Google Chrome and while I have used a few other browsers, I don't use them frequently enough to see if the issue occurs with them. I'm comfortable with Chrome and every time I export 'my favorites' (hundreds of them) to a different browser--they
 arrive all jumbled up and out of any semblance of order. It is such a mess, I find it easier to stay with Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) The date and time are correct--and don't they always update themselves when connected to the internet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            Hi, currently I only have one desktop computer (which I use 99% of the time) and a Dell notebook computer--which has its own large set of problems. Since I'm retired and have no access to a computer elsewhere, it would be difficult to spend time on a different
 device. I do clear the cookies, cache, history every month or so--but it has no beneficial effect on the Outlook issue.

You're expected to notice on your own that when you drag a Favorite past a gap between two items there is a change in the pointer and a black bar is inserted between them.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the only time that you can do a drop, e.g. to have the one that you are dragging
 replace that black bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you try to drop it at any other time, you're right, it won't work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could be a difficult procedure for someone with an unsteady hand I suppose.</p>

<p>You can rearrange links and other items on your Favorites bar by dragging them from one spot on the Favorites bar to another. You can also create folders and organize your favorite links, Web Slices, and feeds.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click to open Internet Explorer.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create folders by right-clicking an existing item on the Favorites bar, clicking
<span>New Folder</span>, and then giving the folder a name. You can then drag items from the Favorites bar into that folder.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Remove old items by right-clicking the item on the Favorites bar, and then clicking
<span>Delete</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>Favorites</span> button, click the arrow next to the
<span>Add to Favorites</span> button, and then click <span>
Organize Favorites</span>. From here you can add, remove, or rearrange your links, feeds, and Web Slices in the Favorites bar folder.</p>

<p>Hi Tammy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, when you select the spreadsheet in&nbsp;<strong>Mailings &gt; Select Recipients &gt; Use an Existing List</strong>, there usually comes a error message. Please try the following suggestion first:</p>
<p>1. Save your worksheet as a .csv, and use that as your mail merge data source. (That is more likely to work if your data is not multiline and does not contain "delimiter" characters such as commas, double quotation marks).</p>
<p>2. Try creating a new Word document, copy the sheet and paste it into that document, save it and use that as the data source. That would have a better chance of dealing with those comma/"/multiline problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, to help us clarify the scenario, please provide some more information:</p>
<p>1. A screenshot of the error message.</p>
<p>2. Does the issue occur to one worksheet or all worksheets?</p>
<p>3. Does the issue occur when you choose other options in&nbsp;<strong>Select Recipients?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Joshua</p>

<p>I moved to a new fancy building and figured I would see if they had a wifi connections. On configure wireless networks there is nothing (except my home network) listed under "only access points". But ther is a "free internet access" under "only computer-to-computer".
 What does this mean and can I use it? The other settings are "connects to: the internet", checked "This is a device-to-device (ad-hoc connection), "authentication: open", "Data Encryption: disabled".</p>
<p>It seems that i connect to it, Internet works for a couple of minutes, but then I keep getting page not found. if i go back to the wifi settings, it still says that i am connected. On the Configure Wireless Networks screen, I drop down the Networks to access
 and choose All available (what is the</p>
<p>1) if you have both Data Connection On and WiFi On and both are connected - which one is being used for Internet, Email, etc.</p>
<p>2) when the wifi symbol shows the moving two arrows, does that mean it is trying to connect or that it is connected.</p>

<p>It's really not a good idea to connect to any ole network your device finds.&nbsp; Unless you are familiar with the network your device is connecting to, you could be "stealing" access from someone's private, albeit unprotected, network or you could be setting
 yourself up to have private data diverted from your device (such as login and passwords, credit card info, etc) to a spammer or other unsavory person. I would be particularly suspicious of and leery to connect to adhoc networks (unless I know the person who's
 running the connection), since these kinds of networks are usually created "on the fly" and run from someone's personal computer or device.</p>
<p>Different wifi networks have different connection requirements and protocols.&nbsp; If you know the network you are connecting to, but are unable to achieve a dependable or consistent connection, then you will need to seek help from the owner of the network.</p>

Appreciate the detailed response, Christian! However, that is not quite&nbsp;what I was about. I prefer to leave Outlook.com in English and just type my response(s) in the target language.&nbsp;I run a Windows 7 Home Premium OS and have it set up to switch my keyboard
 languages between English and the target language. As I said before this works well in my other applications, including MS Office 2007. However, in Outlook.com I get garbage characters. Now sometimes when this happens, if I reboot the system then the language
 switch also works in Outlook.com. But this shouldn't be happening. Any further ideas?

Thank you for wanting to pursue this to a resolution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I could not get the Snipping tool screenshot copy to paste into this space so I'm just including the actual text I typed in the sample message. Prior to typing this into Outlook.com I set the language/keyboard in the Windows taskbar to Polish.
 I normally operate with this set to English.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Gdy chc pisa po Polsku to klawisz nie dziaBa poprawnie.</p>
<p>To s czcionki Polskie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should have shown up with the Polish keyboard above:</p>
<p>"Gdy chc<u>e</u> pisa<u>c</u> po Polsku to klawisz nie dzia<u>l</u>a poprawnie.</p>
<p>To s<u>a</u> czcionki Polskie: <u>a, A, e, E, s, S, z, Z, x, X, c, C, l, L, n, N."</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will note that the above underscored letters are missing in the first sample, or, in the case of accented lower case 'l', the spurious character 'B'.</p>
<p>Those are the relevant accented characters that I normally get in other Windows 7 applications by utilizing the right hand ALT key + letter, for lower case, and ALT key + SHIFT + letter for upper case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In prior attempts in Outlook.com I would incorrectly get just another random&nbsp;alpha character or '['.
</p>
<p>Here we got only one incorrect alpha character in the sample, i.e. 'B'; the rest was just blank spaces.</p>

            Thanks, Alden. Although disappointing and frustrating, it doesn't surprise me that&nbsp;Outlook.com doesn't support the language switching feature at this point.&nbsp; Without invoking another app (Windows Live Mail), there is another workaround for this situation.
 I compose my message in the target language in MS Word, or other text app, then cut &amp; paste into the Outlook.com message space. Not elegant, but it works. Ironically, the pasted foreign language text in the Outlook message window displays the correct accents.
 I guess we're done on this issue for now.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do not want to upload 17035 but it is downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I messaged previously and received answer on removing Downloads from Windows directory but can not trace the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure that you do not just remove the files but more is needed. As the prompt is still in my "Update &amp; Security"</p>

<p>Pause Windows Updates via the option in the Insider section of Settings. Then run Disk Cleanup and select Clean up system files. Check all options, including Windows Update cleanup. If there is a hidden folder at C:\$WINDOWS.~BT delete that folder also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then enable updates again and hopefully you will see 17040 instead of 17035.</p>

            On the left of the Settings screen is Troubleshoot. Look there for the one for Windows Update and try running that. Also, in Windows Insider Program, you have to select Fast Ring to be offered 17040.

<h3> lastgas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network and Sharing Center won&#39;t start - Related to Hyper-V&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The immediate problem (Insider Build 17406, Windows 10 Pro) is that the Network and Sharing Center won't open. It just hangs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit of history:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed Oracle Virtual Box but it didn't work the way I wanted, so I enabled the Hyper-V feature in Windows. I never could get the Hyper-V VM to connect to the Internet. I used the Network and Sharing center a good deal, and I tried different
 settings for the virtual network adapter, and I used the Network and Sharing Center. I also uninstalled Virtual Box.&nbsp; It seemed that during this time, Internet host resolution was sluggish, but Internet speed was good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then seemingly unrelated to anything specific I did, the Network Sharing Center just wouldn't start. It wouldn't start from the Settings app, and it wouldn't start from the Control Panel. (When started from the Control Panel, the Control Panel hangs too.)
 I tried disabling the Hyper-V network adapter, and finally I removed the Hyper-V feature altogether. I still cannot start the Network Sharing Center. Internet Host resolution is fast again, though. Rebooting didn't help.</p>
<p>

            Have you tried the Troubleshooter?&nbsp; If that didn't help, tried sfc /scannow from an Administrator Command Prompt?&nbsp; If that didn't help, do a DISM online with the&nbsp; scanhealth and restorehealth switches from an Administrator Command Prompt?&nbsp; If none of that
 worked, a Defender, Device Performance and Health, Fresh Start might.&nbsp; I'm not your best bet on the intricacies of the VW's you tried, but perhaps Oracle Virtual Box left something a tad tweaked for it's controls behind after the uninstall.&nbsp; Give these a shot
 if you haven't already.&nbsp; If one works, great.&nbsp; I would try them in the order I listed.&nbsp; If they don't work, come back with your machine details.&nbsp; Data seen in my signature and maybe a little more on request may help a more experienced virtualist to assist
 you.&nbsp; Good Luck!

            The three network and adapter troubleshooters might find something...or not...historically the troubleshooters are pretty lame, but...to my knowledge running them has never made things worse.&nbsp; If SFC found some stuff and fixed it, definitely do a full
 DISM online.&nbsp; Not blaming Oracle, but it seems highly unlikely the 'stuff' broke itself.&nbsp;

            Looking at the Device Manager I found that there were two Hyper-V adapters, Hyper-V Virtual Ethernet Adapter and&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyper-V Virtual Ethernet Adapter #2. Deleting the first one fixed the problem.

<p>I'm not an authority on the subject but this is my understanding:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key question is whether the PDFs actually were <em>embedded</em> using a Windows version of Word or whether they were
<em>inserted</em> using a Mac version.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In the first case there should be an <strong>embeddings</strong> folder in the unzipped Word document. That folder should contain the complete PDFs in PDF format.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In the second case: <em>Object Linking &amp; Embedding</em> [OLE] is a Windows technology which never has been fully implemented on the Mac operating system. It is supported in Mac Office only for Word documents &amp; Excel files... PDF is not a supported OLE file
 type.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">In Mac Word a PDF is inserted as a picture displaying only the first page of the PDF, which is processed as an EMF image file. The inserted EMFs are what you are finding in the
<strong>media</strong> folder. Unfortunately, EMF is not native to Mac so they can be opened only by certain graphics programs which support that file type,
<em>Photoshop</em> among others. Even then, only the inserted page will be included if the original PDF was a multi-page document. Also, the EMFs can be inserted into another Word document {<strong>Insert&gt; Pictures - Picture from File</strong>] but will present
 only as a picture displaying the page that was inserted originally.</p>

<p>Greetings ndhdh!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Total Access forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You absolutely do not have to use Outlook on the PC.&nbsp; You can keep all of your contacts that you create over time directly on your PDA.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't want to use Outlook on the PC, then you do not need to synchronize your contacts, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mobile Outlook (on the phone) is not required either.&nbsp; You can choose to use your own e-mail client and use that if you like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you want to use ActiveSync to synchronize your contacts, calendar, tasks, etc, then you will need to have Outlook installed on your PC (it comes pre-installed on your phone, so that's a non-issue).</p>

                    <p>When I open Outlook it freezes up usually 2 to 3 action steps into using it. get message "Not Responding" I am given uption to restart program, close program or wait for program. When I restart it tells me&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Cannot restart Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook Window. The set of folders cannot be opened. The file C:\Users\Toddc\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\*** Email address is removed for privacy *** cannot be opened"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I need to restart the computer. and I open Outlook and repeat the same steps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the 2 options for repairing the program under the control panel. I changed my profile and that helped for about 5 days, then this restarted again.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for getting back to us. There could be an issue with the Outlook application. However, for us to fully identify the main cause, let us perform some troubleshooting steps. Please refer to the information below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Start Outlook in Safe Mode. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Close Outlook. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Choose <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Outlook.exe /safe</strong>, and press
<strong>Enter. </strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Close Outlook, and then open it normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Use the Windows System File Checker to repair corrupted files.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Close Outlook. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> button in Windows, and choose:<strong> Command Prompt (Admin).</strong> If you dont see that option, instead choose:
<strong>Windows PowerShell (Admin). </strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. In the Command Prompt window type:<strong> sfc /scannow </strong>(note the space in the command).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Wait until the process completes. This usually doesnt take longer than 20 minutes with a regular hard disk, and takes much shorter when you have a fast SSD drive.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Restart your computer, and then open Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know any changes after performing the steps provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            When downloading XML file it is downloading as a PDF</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to download an XML file from a site. When I download the file it is saving as a PDF. I am able to download the file as an XML file from a different computer it downloads properly which indicates that the issue is with a setting in IE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you assist? I have been going through the security settings in under Tools&gt; Internet Options but haven't been able to find the cause.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue occurs if the ContentType header in the XML file involves the charset parameter. We suggest that you remove it. Check this

<p>Thank you for your quick reply, and I apologize for my slow response time. Other user's in the organization are able to download the same file as an XML, so it does not appear to be an issue with the file but something specific to security, or setting on
 my workstation somewhere. I have already reset IE settings by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Close all Internet Explorer windows. Select the Tools button, and then select Internet options.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Select the Advanced tab, and then select Reset.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In the Reset Internet Explorer Settings dialog box, select Reset.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; When Internet Explorer finishes applying default settings, select Close, and then select OK. Restart your PC to apply changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>

<p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not only limited to a browser-related issue. You may have mistakenly set the action for opening XML files into creating a PDF. The other possibility is you may have set the file download format into PDF instead of XML. Kindly try using another browser
 to download those files and make sure to set the download file format into XML.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have more concerns, feel free to post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>A quick question before we proceed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What happens when you try to open Outlook, do you get any error message? If yes, what is the complete error message?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Start Outlook in safe mode following steps mentioned below, then try working in Outlook
</span><span>and verify the result</span></span></span><span><span>.<br />
<br />
* Hold Windows key + R.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press <strong>
Enter</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Outlook /safe </strong><br />
<br />
Note: There is a space between Outlook and /.<br />
<br />
If Outlook works as expected in safe mode, disable the add-ins by following steps mentioned below and determine the problem causing add-in:<br />
<br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Enable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.<br />
<br />

</p><p>Unfortunately that is not the resolution, as the post you linked only is relevant to OneNote 2016, 2013, and 2007; it does not apply to OneNote 365 (screenshot below is based on the link you gave, which referenced how to create the task in Onenote - and
 that is specific on versioning). It WOULD work except the problem is you can't create the task in OneNote 365. Unless I'm missing something...</p>

<h2>            cloud-based OneDrive - do I have to have it&#63; Windows10</h2>
                    <p>According to &nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this site</a>, the main reasons to have cloud-based OneDrive are</p>
<p><em>1. Access files from any device</em><br />
<em>Use your phone, tablet or computer to continue what you started, wherever you happen to be. Any changes you make will be updated on all of your devices.</em><br />
<em>2. Offline access</em><br />
<em>Stay productive when you're off the grid. You can access your files without being online, which means that you can always have your most important files with you.</em><br />
<em>3. Document scanning</em><br />
<em>Use your phone to scan and store paper documents, receipts, business cards or whiteboard notes in your OneDrive.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I haven't got a modern mobile - I don't need one. As for syncing between my three laptops, I can do that manually.</p>
<p>2. Probably the same comments as #1. My three laptops are kept in different parts of my house and I live in the countryside not a crime-ridden inner-city area so the chances of losing all three in a fire are remote - likewise, the chance of having all three
 stolen are also remote.</p>
<p><em>3.&nbsp;</em>I can scan using my printer's Control Centre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as I see it, I don't need cloud-based One Drive at all. And I was perfectly happy with the OneDrive I had before changes were introduced in the last few months.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I right please or am I missing something?</p>

            Hi  Taffy,
<br />you may use OneDrive as a backup storage of your files. You may use it to share your files with others.
<br />But in general you do not need to use OneDrive, I think,

            Hi Steve,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you would like to sync files in OneDrive for Business to local computer via the OneDrive sync client. In this case, members can cooperate files in local OneDrive synced folder. It is not feasible to achieve it. Files in OneDrive for
 Business are independent for each user, they can only sync and update files stored in their own OneDrive for Business. Besides, they cannot sync files shared by others from their OneDrive for Business, for Shared with me is a view in OneDrive for Business,
 files in the view are still stored in others' OneDrive for Business. <br />
<br />
To satisfy your requirement, I would like to suggest you work with your members in a SharePoint document library. A document library provides a secure place to store files where you and your co-workers can find them easily, work on them together, and access
 them from any device at any time. For example, you can use a document library on a site in SharePoint Online to store all files related to a specific project or a specific client. Adding files or moving files between folders is as easy as dragging and dropping
 them from one location to another. For more information: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-a-document-library-3b5976dd-65cf-4c9e-bf5a-713c10ca2872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What is a document library?</a><br />
<br />
As for sharing files with external users, you can check more details in this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-sites-or-documents-with-people-outside-your-organization-80e49744-e30f-44db-8d51-16661b1d4232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share sites or documents with people outside your organization</a><br />

<p>It looks as if you may have to visit Nokia Care facility with proof of purchase for lock code to be returned to default
<strong>12345</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You haven't enabled encryption upon memory card?</p>

            i went to nokia care and solved the problem..password again changed to 12345..but its not all over there...<br />
<br />
When i reached home i reset my phone with *#7870# and then when my phone was on i clicked the phone lock facility... Just for checking...but then onwards the problem starts..<br />
<br />
Fon asked me password and i typed 12345...immediatly phone got locked and asked for PUK... I called customer care from another cell and got the code and entered it..nd evrythng got solved and the phon locking featur was turned off...<br />
<br />
Now what is happening is that, phone is asking me password at whatever time it wants..fon is asking me password always..when i enter 12345 , it shows pass code error, but then that window got closed and the phone is working as always...after sometime again
 phone is asking me password which i dont know..:O<br />
<br />
what to do?? What can i do?? Y my fon s behaving lyk dis??<br />
<br />
No memory card encryption...

<p>Sorry to hear this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although <strong>all</strong> user data would be <strong>deleted</strong> I would firstly suggest carrying out a three key depressed power on "hard reset" as described here as there will be no lock code request carry it out:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/911B2710-1214-4A8C-BDA9-D302610019B1">http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Eseries-and-Communicators/This-is-how-you-Hard-Reset-your-E72-push-button-method/m-p/578369/highlight/true#M53631</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If still issues would suggest trying to re-install existing device software using either standalone Nokia Software Updater or Nokia Suite upon PC.</p>

<br />
im really thankfull for your concern..<br />
<br />
As u said i had the hard reset, but it also in vein..after reset also phone is asking me lock code..phone again asked me lock code when the phone restarts after the reset...<br />
<br />
I tried to update FW through nokia suit..its also of no use... what is happening is when i start the updater , its showing something like this, '' serching downloaded update files '' and after sometime it found a file and the update is finishing in 10-12mints..
 No new software download is happening..its just reinsatlling the old files...and after the update also, that lock issue persists..<br />
<br />
Now i have a doubt, is it bcz of the corrupted FW file..?? Y nokia suit is not downloading the new files (ie, of around 150mb,right ??) ???

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the answer to your query maybe that latest versions of Nokia Software Updater and presumably Nokia Suite can
<em><strong>cache</strong></em> the software download of ~150MB <em>locally</em> so that it only takes shorter time to
<em><strong>re-install</strong></em>&nbsp;existing software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can't explain why you are getting nowhere with this issue and don't know whether Nokia Care facility would:-</p>
<p>1) Hard reset device</p>
<p>2) Reset lock code to default</p>
<p>3) Use <em><strong>re-furbish</strong></em> option to restore device to "Out of box" state</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or whether there is a different sequence of procedures in a situation such as yours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that Care facility uses different software with options of "<em><strong>recovery</strong></em>" or "<em><strong>re-furbish</strong></em>".</p>

;( what do u mean by that RE-FURBISH ?? Sorry, I dont knw what it is...<br />
<br />
Nokia care people told me that , they had done the hard reset.. I asked them whether they got my old lock code...and they told me, they didnt get that code, but reset it to the default 12345..

<h2>            Adding Minutes and Seconds in a different format</h2>
                    So I have a document created by a co-worker that has a time row and times are written as 3m 9s, 7m 19s, 1m 12s, and so on and so on, I have been asked to total up these times, I have thought of a few ways, using a calculator add up the seconds, then add
 up the minutes and do the math and go from there, pretty grueling and annoying, the other way was to format the times, but it doesn't read like that so I have been having to go for each one and do 0:3:9, 0:7:19, 0:1:12, and so forth and so forth, which is
 effective but slightly annoying, I have nothing over an hour to put in so having to put the 0 first is irritating but totally doable, and just personal peeve if I select the time up in the preview it reads 12:03:09 AM, but that's just a personal annoyance.
 So, I have said a lot but is there a way to add a field that says 3m 9s and add it to another field that reads 7m 19s to make it add 10m 28s. I may have opened another can of worms because if it does all add up how to I get it so it r

            <p>Hi,</p>

<p>3. In the Find What box, type m i.e. m and space</p>
<p>4. Click on Replace All</p>

<h2>            bad parameter error when executing mail splitter macro</h2>
                    <p>There is a mail splitter macro that we have been using for years and all of a sudden it doesn't work - the error says Bad Parameter then ok or help as the only options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to step into the macro and it pauses at the first line when I say STEP INTO, then when I press the play button to continue it just says the BAD PARAMETER error again.&nbsp; I have attached the macro and the text that is underlined &amp; in bold letters is
 where the highlighter was when I was doing the STEP INTO and it falls over then.&nbsp; When I make that line a comment then the splitter works but the styling and sizes are incorrect.</p>

I select the .pst file and as soon as I select Import, Outlook hangs almost immediately and consistently and the Activity Monitor shows 99.9% cpu "(Not Responding)"<br />

            Any child folders of a parent folder will keep those settings. You'll have to set each folder for Sent, but you'll find that soon the Received Date on new email will show the correct date.<br />
<br />
You can edit the Arrange by option. If I have a special way I want to view some folder, I create a custom arrangement so it's easy to select this option from the pull down.<br />
