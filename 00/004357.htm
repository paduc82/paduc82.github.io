<h2>            Whay cant I set large icons as the default when inserting photos in word</h2>
                    <p>I use word a lot to produce photos in report format for Building Surveys. I used to be able to set up the file explorer on insert of photos in word to
<em>large icons</em> so that I could see the photos fully before inserting. Since the latest update this no longer stays as a large icon but reverts to a list. This is problematic when inserting large numbers of photos. Simply I have to click to set the photos
 as large icons every time I insert a photo. This slows me down greatly. </p>
<p>I have seen much written about this on forums of all kinds and most suggest setting default in file explorer options. But this does set the default to file explorer but not file explorer in the insert photos section.
</p>
<p>Oddly and for no apparent reason every now and then it does default to large icons but the returns to lists soon after.
</p>
<p>Its all very frustrating. As a heavy user of Word and excel it never ceases to amaze me that when I had set up a system that works well form me, Microsoft do an update and it all charges. This results in me having to waste precious hours
 trying to work out how to do the thing all over again!!!</p>

<p>Here, the display of the contents of a folder selected when using the Insert Picture dialog is consistently as it is set for that folder in the File Explorer. &nbsp; There are two folders from which I usually insert pictures, one being the default Picture folder
 for which I have the display set to Large icons, and the other being a folder into which I save screen shots created by the use of Snagit and I have that folder set to display its contents as Extra large icons and that is the way that I see the contents of
 those folders in the Insert Picture dialog.&nbsp; That to me, indicates that it is not an attribute of the Insert Picture dialog, but rather, that dialog makes use of the way the contents of the folder have been set to be displayed in the File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not getting consistent results, it may be a Windows issue and posting about it in the Windows forum might turn up something from someone over there.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 10162 Analysis - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian j spencer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 10162 Analysis</h2>
                    <p>This isn't about a subjective opinion of the OS itself so I'll dispense with the "I like it and here's why" rhetoric and get right to the point of being a part of the testing phase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pc used for testing was chosen for a few reasons but primarily in an attempt to ensure that the OS failed. It's a 2007 model Gateway G5654 with 3 gigs of dual-channel DDR2, a 160 gig sata drive, nvidia onboard graphics, amd dual core that initially came
 with Vista Home Premium but lived comfortably as a linux/apache server until a recent upgrade to linux caused a driver conflict that broke the video output. Reason #2 why this machine was a prime candidate for Windows 10: a salvage operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation was straight forward and done via a 32 gig USB flash drive. Near the end of installation, I received the typical error message: "Critical Error - Start Menu and Cortana aren't working right now. Please sign out and we'll try to fix it next
 time you sign in."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unplugged the wifi adapter and the ethernet, signed out/back in and the system completed installation without further issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon taking the OS for a trial run, I noticed immediately that this particular installation was a bit buggy, particularly at the Start Menu. I have no control once the menu is open and it simply remains open for a few seconds, denying me the ability to click
 either apps to the right or links to the left, then closes. I am able to access installed programs, of course, through File Explorer so OS is still functional without the Start Menu. The revisit of the Start Menu is nice, especially for those of us who rely
 on our workstations, and it will be even nicer once I can actually utilize it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana flickers wildly but not all the time. It seems to depend on how many processes I have running at a given time which affords Windows 10 the benefit of the doubt in considering that it's a hardware issue. This is, after all, a relic of a machine that
 has absolutely no right to be doing anything other than serving web apps. But it is and that gets me to the next observation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is clearly light enough to accommodate low-end **** - the kind you find gracing the electronics section of the local walmart. There's performance without even having to turn off UI eye-candy and there's no loss in available resources to programs
 like 3ds Max. And that brings me to my next observation:<br />
<br />
Compatibility Mode seems to have been finessed to the point of absolute purpose. I installed 3ds Max 9 (the only version I have on standby that's 32-bit to run on this installation) and it crashed. In the past, Compatibility Mode seemed to be an exercise in
 roulette but, in Windows 10, it works. I set CM to run 3ds Max in Win 7 compatible and it took right off without an issue. Windows 10 even recognized that the program needed a few prerequisites of the .NET persuasion and went ahead and dl'd and installed those
 without having to be told to do so. Very nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media Player also seems to have been streamlined to be much faster in indexing. Windows 10 was able to add 4k+ songs to the library in just a couple of minutes whereas older versions could take 10+ minutes. As well, I was surprised to discover that
 my playlists had made the trip... from a totally different machine running Win 7. I saved playlists but I had no idea that they would be saved with the music library on the external drive. That deserves a big thanks for forethought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Feedback App, at least for me, is broken. I'm getting notifications but I'm not able to submit replies... which is why I'm here. The answer to the big questions are:<br />
<br />
Based on observation and the time I've spent in practical usage, I feel as though the quality of this technical release ranks among the highest that Microsoft has achieved to-date. Impressive UI overall. It's a clean, light OS that clearly has end-user operation
 in-mind from concept to creation.<br />
<br />
As well, I am actively recommending the upgrade to friends and family. Windows 10 is the best of both worlds between Windows 7 and Windows 8 in functionality and... daring to walk on the subjective wild side... it's just damned cool looking through-and-through!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally and to be fair, I also installed the technical release on an old Dell laptop - Inspiron 1501. Still was hoping that the OS would break at installation but it didn't. I had to unplug the net as seems to be the norm but all went without a hitch. In
 fact, I have no issues to report at all on that install because everything seems to be functioning accordingly, right down to the stable Cortana and functional/customizable Start Menu. That's way beyond backwards compatibility to be supporting a nearly decade
 old pile of Dell...</p>

            <p>I wanted to see if running the 64-bit Win 10 would have any affect on functionality since the system has a 64-bit processor and came installed with Vista 64. I'm pleased to say that both Cortana and Start Menu are fully functional on this install.
<br />
</p>
<p>I did encounter an issue during installation: during setup of the 160 gig sata, Windows 10 install accepted the drive, allowed for formatting and partition but subsequently refused to acknowledge the drive and output this - "Error: We couldn't create a new
 partition or locate an existing one. For more information, see the Setup log files."</p>
<p>
</p><p>After about 10 minutes of trying to reformat/repartition, I remembered that I had the HP tablet next to me, ran a search for the error here and discovered that the trick was merely to reboot and, upon doing so, Windows 10 install would recognize the drive
 and move forward. It did and without further issues (save for the usual having to unplug from the net to get rid of the Cortana/Start Menu error at install completion).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I've installed and successfully ran 3ds Max 2016, Corel Draw X7, Visual Studio 2013, Dreamweaver CS6 and the typical drive/partition/archive utilities, WAMP server and Comodo anti-virus/firewall... all without compatibility issues, without performance
 issues and without stability issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Between the 2 installs, I have to acknowledge the distinct difference in stability and performance. The 64-bit is far more stable and responsive than the 32-bit. Of course, this should probably be taken with a grain of salt because pc-tech ranges dramatically.
 What works best for this system may be what refuses to function on another. In any event, I'm even more excited about this release than I was initially.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also note that IE (a.k.a. "Edge") seems to be a drastic improvement over its predecessors. As a web-dev, I can assure you that developing CSS-rich content for IE, in the past, has been nothing if not an exercise in banging ones' head against the
 desk repeatedly. Although I note that the HTML5 range input object is being represented will but still somewhat handling CSS3 properties differently than other major browsers, it is handling CSS3 that hasn't been specifically targeted to -ms- filters. That
 gives me hope that, one day, I'll be able to write one style sheet and have it translate into a predictable outcome across IE and everyone else who already seems to follow a set standard. Keep on keepin' on in that respect.</p>

<h2>            How to permanently block nuisance sender</h2>
                    I constantly receive e-mails from unwanted senders which appear in my junk mail and then I remove them to the blocked senders list but one sender in particular just changes his address by altering the letters around and so I still get the messages. The
 senders name remains the same but the email address constantly changes.

<p>Have you checked your PC Clock to be sure the time and date are correct? If not correct you need to reset the clock/calendar&nbsp;to the correct date, time and time zone and reboot the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</p>

<h2>            Right-click or Shift&#43;Click on link to open new IE window within maximization, how should I do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As well known, the maximized settings of "Internet Explorer" are stored in Window_Placement value&nbsp;under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main registry key.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/044685dc-2cf8-4022-9fd9-8fff4735ff42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/044685dc-2cf8-4022-9fd9-8fff4735ff42" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>On my computer, I usually perform the below .reg file, namely I can import the below file to maximize IE window:</p>
<p><br />
MyIESize.reg</p>
<p><br />
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p><br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main]<br />
"Window_Placement"=hex:2c,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,03,00,00,00,ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,\<br />
&nbsp; ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,04,00,00,d8,02,00,\<br />
&nbsp; 00</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, from the taskbar click or right-click IE's icon&nbsp;and then select from shortcut menu, or&nbsp;select&nbsp;a shortcut from the Start menu, to open a new IE window, it will automatically maximized.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But whenever from a IE window I right-click a link and then select "Open in new window", or hold down the Shift key while Click a link, the opened new IE window's sizes always do not satisfy me, namely the new IE window's&nbsp;size cannot reach to maximization,
 - this is a trouble.</p>
<p><br />
For example, I open <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.google.com</a> main page, can be seen, there is "Gmail" link.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9343ea37-c8ac-4b38-bcba-736b25069f3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9343ea37-c8ac-4b38-bcba-736b25069f3e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I right-click on "Gmail" link and then select "Open in new window" (or hold down the Shift key while Click on "Gmail" link).</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1137d33c-a1bf-4434-9230-4a606cf8d98e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1137d33c-a1bf-4434-9230-4a606cf8d98e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see, it is not maximized.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/525c063b-a934-43f2-b454-ff91fcb12040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/525c063b-a934-43f2-b454-ff91fcb12040" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But I just wanna this window also always opens maximized, how should I do?</p>

<p>Hi Flavien,</p>
<p>To investigate the issue, please follow the steps below and let us know the outcome：</p>
<p>1. Temporarily turn off proxy and&nbsp;fire wall&nbsp;settings.</p>
<p>2. Remove the download package and download a new one to see if there is any improvement. Also, provide us with the size of the downloaded Office folder.</p>
<p>3. A screenshot of the path of the office folder. Also, try using the local path to download the office folder and check the outcome.</p>
<p>4. I notice you added two logging level elements and Shared Computer Activation is set to be disabled by default even if you don't add the elements. Thus, &nbsp;to see if the problem is related to the elements below, could you firstly remove them and check the
 outcome?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Logging Level="Standard"/&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Logging Level="Standard" Path="%temp%" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Property Name="AUTOACTIVATE" Value="1"/&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Property Name="FORCEAPPSHUTDOWN" Value="TRUE"/&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Property Name="SharedComputerLicensing" Value="0"/&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Property Name="PinIconsToTaskbar" Value="TRUE"/&gt;</p>

<p>hi flavien,</p>
<p>from the configuration file mentioned in your post, we can see that the “office” folder is included with the network drive path (as highlighted below), the “office” folder is not required to be mentioned in the path because this folder appears automatically
 once we run the “setup.exe /download configuration.xml” command.</p>
<p>&lt;configuration&gt;<br />
&lt;add sourcepath="\\bambou\office365installer<span>\office</span>"officeclientedition="32" channel ="current"&gt;<br />
&lt;product id="o365proplusretail"&gt;<br />
&lt;language id="fr-fr"/&gt;<br />
&lt;excludeapp id="groove"/&gt;<br />
&lt;/product&gt;<br />
&lt;/add&gt;<br />
&lt;updates enabled="true" channel="current"/&gt;<br />
&lt;logging level="standard"/&gt;<br />
&lt;logging level="standard" path="%temp%" /&gt;<br />
&lt;property name="autoactivate" value="1"/&gt;<br />
&lt;property name="forceappshutdown" value="true"/&gt;<br />
&lt;property name="sharedcomputerlicensing" value="0"/&gt;<br />
&lt;property name="piniconstotaskbar" value="true"/&gt;<br />
&lt;/configuration&gt;</p>
<p>this may be the cause of the issue; please change &lt;add sourcepath="\\bambou\office365installer\<span>office</span>"officeclientedition="32" channel ="current"&gt; to &lt;add sourcepath="\\bambou\office365installer" officeclientedition="32"
 channel ="current"&gt; and then try again.</p>
<p>if this didn’t work, we would suggest you to remove the source path (as shown below) from the xml files in both the folders i.e.
<strong>"office365" </strong><strong>and " office2016installer" </strong>and then try to install.</p>
<p>&lt;configuration&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;add officeclientedition="32" channel="current"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;product id="o365proplusretail"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;language id="fr-fr" /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/product&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/add&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/configuration&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/043554dd-890c-4af5-ab8b-939c15107f9f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/043554dd-890c-4af5-ab8b-939c15107f9f" /></a></p>
<p><b>note</b>: the office will be downloaded in the local drive (e.g. c drive). when the source path is removed from the configuration file.</p>

<p>Hi Flavien,</p>
<p>As you mentioned you want to install only Excel2016 on the RDS server, in this case, the configuration file mentions the Value=1 for the Shared Computing Licensing (like: &lt;Property Name="SharedComputerLicensing" Value="1"/&gt;). It is mentioned as ‘0’ in your
 primary post and add the Exclude app property to exclude the other Office apps.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>&lt;ExcludeApp ID="Groove"/&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ExcludeApp ID="Word"/&gt;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So on</p>
<p>You can also use the <a href="http://officedev.github.io/Office-IT-Pro-Deployment-Scripts/XmlEditor.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
configuration XML editor</a> to create the configuration file.</p>

<p>I've got good news</p>
<p>So from the begining.</p>
<p>On a server i've created a shared folder "Office365" with the setup.exe and different xml file.</p>
<p>- one xml file for the download : (i've deleted the path ) &nbsp;- &gt; donwload_32.xml</p>
<p>&lt;Configuration&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Add OfficeClientEdition="32" Channel="Current"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Language ID="fr-fr" /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/Product&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/Add&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/Configuration&gt;</p>
<p>-one xml for the configuration : (i've deleted the path) &nbsp;-&gt; installation_32.xml</p>
<p>&lt;Configuration&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Add OfficeClientEdition="32" Channel="Current"&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail"&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Language ID="fr-fr"/&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;ExcludeApp ID="Groove"/&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ExcludeApp ID="Access"/&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;ExcludeApp ID="InfoPath"/&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/Product&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/Add&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt;Property Name="AUTOACTIVATE" Value="1"/&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt;Property Name="FORCEAPPSHUTDOWN" Value="FALSE"/&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt;Property Name="SharedComputerLicensing" Value="1"/&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt;Property Name="PinIconsToTaskbar" Value="TRUE"/&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/Configuration&gt;</p>
<p>After on the computer, i've launched the following command :</p>
<p>\\bambou\Office365\setup /configure \\bambou\Office365\installation_32.xml</p>
<p>RESULT : it's working so the path should be the problem on all errors i've got.</p>
<p>Now I need to deploy by GPO the oneclick Office365 to install Office 365 on the computers without Groove, Access, InfoPath.</p>
<p>and I need on a RDS server to install only Excel. But how to activate it after, because users will used only excel on this server to launch some huge excel files.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Flavien</p>

            <p>hi flavien,</p>
<p>firstly, i would like to summarize the whole situation, so the other community members can understand if they run into the similar problem.</p>
<p>starting from the beginning, you wanted to install office 2016 on windows computer and excel 2016 (excluding other office apps) on server. you used two xml files, one for downloading and another for configuring.</p>
<p>initially, you were getting error code: 0-1008 (0), which was resolved after you’ve deleted the source path from the configuration file. you were able to successfully install the office 2016 on windows computer but you received error 30088-1021 (0) when
 you installed excel 2016 (64-bit) on rds, and 32-bit installation was working though.</p>
<p>now you have two issues:</p>
<p>first, how to activate excel 2016 on rds after the installation, for multiple users?</p>
<p>to do this, please follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>open excel&gt;click ‘sign in’
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/667aa4b7-553c-434a-8996-0ecce33379a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/667aa4b7-553c-434a-8996-0ecce33379a1" /></a></p>
</li><li>users will get the prompt to enter the office 365 work account email address and password to activate excel.
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94ca6a85-6fb5-4780-b417-1c04f951e77b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94ca6a85-6fb5-4780-b417-1c04f951e77b" /></a></p>
<p>second, you receive error 30088-1021 (0) when you are trying to install excel 2016 (64-bit). usually,&nbsp;<strong>error code 30088-1021(0)</strong>&nbsp;occurs due to the system files corruption or previous installation files not removed properly.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: in the article, please follow till step 3 (including all the sub-steps of step 3).</p>

<p>Hi Neha,</p>
<p>I don't understand why but now nothing is working.</p>
<p>The xml file for the RDS &amp; for the computers.</p>
<p>I've got the error 30088-1021 (0) and check everything for the article but nothing is working.</p>
<p>I've deleted the Office folder with the data without success.</p>
<p>Don't know what happened.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            If you select them in the Folder list (ctrl+6), do they start showing in the Calendar module? If not, the resetnavpane switch should fix it.
<br />
<br />Close Outlook. Right-click on the Start button and choose Run or press Windows key + R  to open the Run command. Type or paste the following into the Open field and press Enter or click OK to restart Outlook. (There is a space before /.)
<br />
<br />outlook.exe /resetnavpane 
<br />
<br />Note: This will wipe out all folders on Favorites in Mail module and reset the Calendar and Contacts modules to the default format.

<p>I've had various issues with store on every update of insiders preview, the only way I've been able to get it to work properly was to open up powershell and run this command &nbsp;: &nbsp;Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode
 -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open up powershell with admin rights, copy and paste the powershell command at the prompt then enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let it run might take a couple of minutes or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

    <title>Change document size from A 4 to A5 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cmsinx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change document size from A 4 to A5</h2>
                    Suzanne, I have originated a doc &nbsp;(Word 2010) as A4 but I want to save a copy as A5 so that when it is attached to an e mail it will print as A5. When I try to save the doc as A5 from its original A4 it splits the doc across two pages (ish). &nbsp;How do I
 change the size of an existing doc (in this case A4-&gt;A5)? Thanks for any help.

            Well, you can't put ten pounds in a five-pound sack! While you can use "2 pages per sheet" or&nbsp;"Scale&nbsp;to Paper Size"&nbsp;in the Print dialog to print the A4 sheet as A5, just saving as A5 (or using "2 pages per sheet" in the Page Setup dialog) does not reduce
 it; you have to do this manually, by reducing the font size of all paragraphs proportionally.

<h2>            Where o&#39; where did my emails go&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am a new user. I bought an AT&amp;T Tilt running WM6 and ActiveSynch 4.5. I am synching between a Work PC (Contacts and Calender) and Home PC (Contacts, Emails, and Favorites).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning on my drive into work I did a send recieve on my POP email. I recieved about 8 emails. I read about 4 or them and deleted 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I arrived at work, I plugged in the usb cable from my Work PC and it ran through synch. And when I went to look at my emails again they were all GONE. Where did they go? If the Work PC is NOT set to synch the Emails why would the synch
 have done anything to them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, when I run another send/recieve it is not retrieving the emails again. Are those emails now gone for good? Is there a setting to leave the emails on the server when retrieved on my Tilt?</p>

<p>Ok, so this morning I watched as I hit the send/receive on my Tilt POP email....all of the read emails from yesterday disappeared from the inbox...and the new days unread emails appeared. ANd, when I goto the deleted folder it is empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am really confused on the functionality of things at this point. Why does it act this way? Can I change it to NOT behave like this?</p>

<h3> bluesky311  say:</h3>
<h2>            transpose rows into columns</h2>
                    
<div>Can anyone help me. I am working on a spreadsheet with about 3000 rows and 2 columns (A &amp; B) in Excel 2007. The rows repeat themselves in group of 5 as following: (row1,column A)= last name; (row 2,column A)= first name; (row3,column A)= address; (row4,column
 A)= title; (row5,column A)=group name; (row6, colunmA)=blank. This series repeats until row number 3000. Column B is filled with the correspondent info for each row above. What I need to do is to transpose the rows into columns, so that the column headings
 will be: last name, first name, address, title and group name and the data that was previously displayed in column B will be transposed accordingly under the new column headings. Hpw can I do it using a function or macro? I would appreciate any help.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Did your data change since Sunday?</p>
<p>You wrote in your first post:<br />
"The rows repeat themselves in group of 5 as following: (row1,column A)= last name; (row 2,column A)= first name; (row3,column A)= address; (row4,column A)= title; (row5,column A)=group name; (row6, colunmA)=blank."</p>
<p>You wrote in your second post:<br />
the series repeats in group of 4: last name, first name, address, and a blank row.</p>
<p><br />
You did not say what the sheet name is that holds this data.</p>
<p>So, here is what you can do.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1<br />
</strong>Copy this macro:</p>
<p>Sub bluesky()<br />
With Application<br />
.ScreenUpdating = False<br />
.DisplayAlerts = False<br />
.EnableEvents = False<br />
Dim area As Range, cell As Range, xRow&amp;, strSheet$, asn$, iCol%<br />
asn = ActiveSheet.Name<br />
strSheet = "zzzCompilation"<br />
On Error Resume Next<br />
Sheets(strSheet).Delete<br />
Err.Clear<br />
Sheets.Add(After:=Sheets(Sheets.Count)).Name = strSheet<br />
Range("A1:E1").Value = Array("Last Name", "First Name", "Address", "Title", "Group Name")<br />
xRow = 2<br />
For Each area In Sheets(asn).Columns(1).SpecialCells(2).Areas<br />
iCol = 1<br />
For Each cell In area.Cells(1, 2).Resize(area.Rows.Count, 1)<br />
cell.Copy Cells(xRow, iCol)<br />
iCol = iCol + 1<br />
Next cell<br />
xRow = xRow + 1<br />
Next area<br />
Columns.AutoFit<br />
.EnableEvents = True<br />
.DisplayAlerts = True<br />
.ScreenUpdating = True<br />
End With<br />
End Sub</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Step 2</strong><br />
Activate to select the worksheet that holds the data.&nbsp; You do not need to select any cell ranges, just activate the worksheet that holds the data and select any cell.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong><br />
From your worksheet, press Alt+F11.&nbsp;&nbsp; CAREFUL, that's ALT + F11.</p>
<p>From the menu bar at the top of the screen, click Insert &gt; Module.</p>
<p>Click into the large white area that is the new module you just inserted, and press Ctrl+V to paste the macro into it that you copied from Step 1.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong><br />
On your keyboard, press Alt + Q to return to the worksheet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong><br />
On your keyboard, press ALT + F8.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6<br />
</strong>Select the macro named "bluesky" and click the Run button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently, there are two problems with that.&nbsp; 1.)&nbsp; Wunderlist servers are having problems right now.&nbsp; 2.)&nbsp; There is a problem with my Wunderlist App Account; it won't fully open.&nbsp; It trys to open for about a half second, then it flips to my Start screen
 tiles (charms).&nbsp; Wunderlist has been aware of this weirdness by emails for about two weeks.&nbsp; Even though I can access Account through Wunderlist website, there is no Cortana listed.&nbsp; I haven't asked Wunderlist about this Cortana thing, yet, because they're
 already trying to help me with the other thing (above).&nbsp; Nevertheless, the screenshot, that I included, tells the whole story.&nbsp; OFF should be OFF, shouldn't it?</p>
<p>EDIT:&nbsp; Hey, wait a minute.&nbsp; I just tried your link, saw Cortana, tapped OFF, "Cortana", the word, disappeared.&nbsp; So, maybe your link did work.&nbsp; I'll know tomorrow.&nbsp; (An early&nbsp; "thanks", but I'll get back here tomorrow, probably, to mark as Answer (if worked).</p>

<p>I am guessing this screenshot is from Cortana. You say Wunderlist are having issues with their servers - I would think that the disconnection from Cortana is not being propagated to the phone from the servers, which is why you cannot get rid of it. I still
 think it should be done from Wunderlist, not from Cortana, it's just the command not getting through due the server issues - same is probably happening when you try from the Cortana end = it's just not getting through to Wunderlist. In short, the disconnection

<p>I am guessing this screenshot is from Cortana. You say Wunderlist are having issues with their servers - I would think that the disconnection from Cortana is not being propagated to the phone from the servers, which is why you cannot get rid of it. I still
 think it should be done from Wunderlist, not from Cortana, it's just the command not getting through due the server issues - same is probably happening when you try from the Cortana end = it's just not getting through to Wunderlist. In short, the disconnection
 has to happen in the cloud, it can't be done locally - don't ask me why, it's just my assumption based on previous experience with similar apps.</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind help.&nbsp; Yes, the above, screenshot, is Cortana, or Action Center; don't remember name right now.I did send another email to Wunderlist, about this new issue.</p>

Which version of Office Word have you upgraded from?</p>
<p>
What is the file extension of the Labels, i.e. .doc or .docx?</p>
<p>
Mention exactly what happens when you print the labels?</p>
<div>Print to a normal paper (A4) and check if the formatting prints fine.
<p>
If the problem is with formatting, you may refer to the following thread and check if the suggestions help:</p>

<p>No. What you show in the screen shot is available only in the Windows Office programs. It isn't included in Mac Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an alternative, use the ▼ on the right edge of the <strong>Paste</strong> button on the
<strong>Home</strong> tab of the Ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option is to add the <strong>Paste Special</strong> tool to the QAT, but that only works to do the same as selecting
<em><strong>Paste Special</strong></em> from the contextual menu which is provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, some Paste Special options are available <em>after</em> pasting by using the
<strong>Paste Options</strong> button which appears at the lower right corner of the pasted content.</p>

                    <p>I think it is so dumb to not have my picture on skype be able to move. I always loved having it in the upper left corner. Having it forced to be in the bottom right is just stupid. I understand that there is nothing that can be done unless/until the developers
 fix this atrocity.</p>

            The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is, for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As might know, engineering resources are always limited, especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect is, starting separate, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.

            <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a fix to this,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that this fix removes stored passwords for Windows and Office ( you can easily re-add them again)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to </p>
<p>C:\Users\XXXXX\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replace XXXXX with your user name</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one folder in this location which starts S-1 ,delete it and restart your machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your machine will rebuild the folder (This is for Web Credentials)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you re-enter web passwords this will store them again</p>
<p>
</p><p>you should now find that you can access your Web Credentials folder again</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 build 10532 and this solution works for me</p>
<p>

<h2>            So what happens if I delete the Junk Email Retention Policy ....</h2>
                    
<p>So what happens if I delete the Junk Email Retention Policy in the Office 365 Admin Center.&nbsp; Now my "default MRM policy" has no entry for Junk Email.</p>
<p>Does that mean that there is NO retention policy for email in the Junk Email folder?&nbsp; Or is there one of unlimited duration (i.e. email in that folder never auto-purges)?</p>
<p><br />
Confusing.</p>

<p><span>hi helpstar55,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>there are two way to delete junk email retention tag in office 365 admin center: remove it from “default mrm policy” in
<b>retention policy </b>or delete it in <b>retention tag</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>1. if you remove the tag from “default mrm policy” in
<b>retention policy </b>as the screenshot below, the junk email folder will still use the junk email retention policy.</span></p>
<p><span>because when a retention tag is removed from the retention policy applied to a mailbox, the tag is no longer available to the user and can't be applied to items in the mailbox.
 but the existing items that have been stamped with that tag continue to be processed by the managed folder assistant based on those settings and any retention action specified in the tag is applied to those messages.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=8662c198-1732-4462-a32f-e23f652a45cc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d8662c198-1732-4462-a32f-e23f652a45cc" /></a></p>
<p><span>2. if you delete the tag in retention tag as the screenshot below, there is no retention policy tag in the junk email folder so it will use default policy tag (its type is default
 in the “default mrm policy”).</span></p>
<p><span>because when you delete a tag, the tag definition stored in active directory is removed. this causes the managed folder assistant to process all items in a mailbox and restamp
 the ones that have the removed tag applied. depending on the number of mailboxes and messages, this process may significantly consume resources on all mailbox servers that contain mailboxes with retention policies that include the removed tag.</span></p>

<p>Hi Joel:</p>
<p>Just to confirm.</p>
<p>With respect to your bullet #1, if I remove the tag from the “Default MRM Policy," is the consequence as follows --&gt; for mailboxes that already had a JUNK folder, will the ENTIRE junk folder (including newly arrived items in the future) continue to follow
 the old policy (even though it is no longer visible in the Default MRM Policy)?</p>
<p>OR does this just apply to mail that remain in the Junk folder after the policy is removed (and NOT newly arrived mail that hits that folder NOR newly created mailboxes).</p>
        </p>

<p><span>hi helpstar55,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>after you remove the
<b>junk email retention tag</b> from the “default mrm policy”,&nbsp;only the existing items will continue to be processed by
<b>junk email retention tag</b> because they have been stamped by the<b> junk email retention tag</b> before the tag is removed. new items will not be stamped by the<b> junk email retention tag,</b> so they will be automatically processed by the
<b>default policy tag</b> which is the default tag applied to your entire mailbox.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>about your questions, may i confirm if you want emails in the junk mail folder never to be auto-purged? if so, you can follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. sign in to
</span><a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">office 365 exchange admin center</span></a><span> with an office 365 admin account.</span></p>
<p><span>2. click
<b>compliance management-&gt; retention tags-&gt;</b> delete the <b>junk email </b>tag.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. create a new tag by selecting
<b>applied automatically to a default folder </b>as the following screenshot shows:
</span></p>
<p><span>(1) enter the name.</span></p>
<p><span><span>(2) select
<b>junk email </b>in <b>apply this tag to the following default folder.</b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(3) select
<b>delete and allow recovery </b>in<b> retention action.</b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(4) select
<b>never </b>in<b> retention period.</b></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e67da94b-b7fd-4f63-ae6e-bb9b7a22c51d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de67da94b-b7fd-4f63-ae6e-bb9b7a22c51d" /></a></p>
<p><span>4. click
<b>retention policies-&gt; </b>edit <b>default mrm policy-&gt; </b>click <b>add-&gt; </b>select the created junk email retention tag-&gt;<b> add-&gt; ok-&gt; save</b>.
</span></p>
<p><span>5. if you want your retention policy to take effect quickly, you can run powershell or you can wait for several days for it to become automatically effective:</span></p>
<p><span>(1)
</span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">connect to exchange online using remote powershell</span></a></p>

<p><span>6. assign your retention policy in your mailbox.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            If you want to go back to your old OS then download The Windows Device Recovery Tool on a PC and follow the instructions and you can rollback to Windows 8.1 which is what you would have had before let us know how you go or if you need more help rgds Roy

    <title>IE opening 71 new tabs when clicking Learn More button in a - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            IE opening 71 new tabs when clicking Learn More button in a smartscreen notification popup</h2>
                    <p>I think that I have found a bug in Internet Explorer latest version with all updates on Windows 10 Technical Preview Build 9926. These are the steps to replicate it. Run the following steps with "Enhanced Protected Mode" and "64 bit processes for Enhanced
 Protected Mode" options enabled and with "Enable Experimental Web Platform Features" in the about:flags page on Enabled (not Automatic).</p>

<li>Visit this link: <a href="http://www.amtso.org/check-desktop-malware-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.amtso.org/check-desktop-malware-download</a></li><li>Click on the "Download the EICAR.COM Tesfile" button</li><li>Click on run in the IE&nbsp;popup asking you if you want to run or save the file.</li><li>After you click on "run", the popup changes with a warning popup from SmartScreen filter that the file is unsafe to download.</li><li>Now click on the blue "Learn more" button inside the warning.</li><li>And watch the show- IE opens 71 blank new tabs.</li></ol>
<p>You can see screenshots here: <a href="http://1drv.ms/1zYjOly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://1drv.ms/1zYjOly</a></p>
