<h2>            Windows Tech Preview for Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <div>
<p><strong>Customer service from Microsoft</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>About 10 days ago I was having problems with my Windows 10 Pro automatic updates, specifically I wasn't getting ANY updates. Now as most might know if you do NOT get those updates Windows 10 starts to fall apart. Which is exactly what began to happen
 to my laptop.</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>SO I contacted the Tech rep in chat here at Microsoft and asked him about it. I was informed that he was sporry but could not fix it and suggested I roll back my system to my previous OS and reinstall windows 10 pro to get it to work.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I rolled back my system to my previous OS which happened to be Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Evaluation Copy build 10162. In doing so I lost everything in my personal folders, passwords, music, videos, documents, bookmarks, ETC.</strong><br />
<strong>When I tried downloading Windows 10 pro media creation tool it would start, begin the download and crash right out of my system.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>So I again contacted Windows tech in chat and that's when things went down hill quickly.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Between the automatic " I'm Sorry for the inconvenience" rhetoric and dogma I became totally confused by the both lack of technical knowledge and inability to go beyond any action other than to ask for my product code for my Windows and tell me (
 again ) how sorry they were.</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>NOW I can figure out when I have found someone who isn't the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree so I chose to not argue with the lil human AI any further and found another Tech rep to speak with....with the same results as before.</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>21 DIFFERENT tech reps... 9 STRAIGHT days and over 60 HOURS in chat attempting to explain things like :
</strong></p>
<p><strong>No Mr. tech rep they stopped putting product code stickers&nbsp; or print out codes on cards years ago and it doesn't matter how many times you ask for me to look it is not just going to appear there because you believe it so. ( They began embedding the
 product codes into the BIOS of most systems more than a couple years back as we all know )&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yes I DO have a product code and it IS valid and NO you do NOT need to check if it is so because it has NOTHING to do&nbsp; with downloading and running a media creation tool. ( Having a windows 8.1 product code while attempting to download and install
 Windows 10 Pro without even RUNNING it yet is intransigence into the extreme )</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Suffice to say I am NOT happy with the "help" they gave but after ALL that time I FINALLY got this procedure out of them. I needed to contact the people who made my computer and input the original preinstalled Windows 8.1 and get the individual product
 code for my laptop. THEN I had to download Windows 8.1 and reinstall IT before I could do anything ( I had used windows 8.1 for all of maybe 2 hours on first getting my laptop new before updating directly to windows tech preview) and once 8.1 was installed
 THEN I could reinstall windows 10 pro...</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>But The same problem downloading windows 8.1 is the same problem I had downloading windows 10 pro</strong><br />
<strong>It won't do it and sits at 0% download and spins and spins and spins and spins and nothing is ever downloaded.</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>SO Back to the tech reps to find out whats wrong ( I didn't expect much by now but it is the only option a person in a wheel chair and unable to speak because of neck cancer has ) I spoke to one who once again HAD to waste my time and his trying everything
 I told him would not work thru remote access and oh yeah.. Asking for the Windows 8.1 product key AGAIN.</strong><br />
<strong>After another 3 hours wasted he told me he was going to refer me to a lvl 2 tech rep ( YIPPIE ) and I had to call this phone number.. ( Ummm remember me saying can't talk above a whisper because of neck cancer??? well he WAS told..6 times in 3 hours
 I think ) I told him flat out that it was impossible to do that AGAIN.. which I thought got thru to him as he said they would contact me in 48 hours ( MORE time wasted ) thru my email. ( YIPPEI!!!)
</strong><br />
<strong>2 days later.</strong><br />
<strong>I get 3 different emails from Microsoft saying their tech rep will be CALLING me about my computer problems ( so much for Yippie) I replied to each one that i CANNOT do phone calls and why..... The time for my lvl 2 tech rep came and went.... No contact</strong><br />
<strong>A few hours ago I get another email telling ME that they were unable to call/contact me by phone ( DUH! ) and gave ME phones numbers to call THEM back on.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Huh?????</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>THIS is how they treat a handicapped person.</strong><br />
<strong>THIS is how they treat a person who endured the bugs, reloads n restarts all thru the whole build of windows 10 till it's release date.</strong><br />
<strong>THIS is how they listen to the problems while pushing their own agenda and being " sorry for the inconvenience "</strong><br />
<strong>THIS is how they treat people who only want to do things the open and right way.</strong><br />
<strong>THIS is the WASTED 21 techs, 9 days, 60+ hours of MY time as well as theirs and I STILL do NOT have an ability to download and install windows 8.1 MUCH LESS Windows 10 pro just to get back to the status quo ante that I was at BEFORE I followed the instructions
 of their tech reps.</strong><br />
<strong>THIS is the kind of "Customer Service" that a person who asks for help from Microsoft gets when they try to do things the way that they are supposed to.</strong><br />

            <p>When you installed Windows 10, did you wipe all of the partitions from the disk drive?&nbsp; Maybe there is a way to restore factory settings from an OEM restore partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any ISO's of Windows 8 or 10 to work with? You could try installing it on another partition just for the purpose of getting the Media Creation Tool for Windows 10 or 8 to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else able to create install media for you on another computer?</p>

            <p>I did the commands you mentioned. but the internet connection has never been the problem. I download stuff daily and everything comes in just they way it is supposed to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am suspecting is that because I rolled my system back to the previous OS which is a tech preview. Microsoft has decided that it is no longer valid software and has locked me out from using it to download any updates or upgrades.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;I did an install over my tech preview just as Microsoft said to do. My HD has never been partitioned out other than any the windows instillation did. I have 444 GB HD in my laptop and a 1 TB external USB HD also but from what the Techs have told me THEY
 cannot partition it in any way to help me ( Oh and they are sorry too ) but even if that were one problem ( not saying it isn't) I still have the inability to DL anything from Microsoft because ( as I mentioned above) which I would have to do before attempting
 a partition for instillation. They stopped recognizing me rolled back tech preview as Microsoft software and as you can see by the date posted and "help" given by THEM ( they obviously are aware of it) is non existent.</p>
<p>This is how they treat those who try and do things the right way and go the extra distance by installing the Beta software to begin with.</p>

            <p>Builds 9926 to 10130 of Pro Insider Preview expire October 1st, but&nbsp;can still be activated using the 10074 product key.&nbsp; Since the download tools will not run on your current install, you may have to use other ways to get your system working.&nbsp; It is not
 impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a 4GB to 32GB USB flash drive, you can use it to create&nbsp;recovery USB media.&nbsp; First, is your Build 10162 currently activated?&nbsp; If so then a Reset, using the recovery drive media will probably auto-activate.&nbsp; To create the USB media, run recoverydrive.exe.&nbsp;
 Insert a thumb drive size 4-32GB, which will be formatted as FAT32.&nbsp; Choose to include System files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above&nbsp;is successful, you can now boot your computer with this USB, as long as you know how to choose the USB as a boot option on your laptop.&nbsp; This will give you Recovery options, such as Reset Windows.&nbsp; You can also choose&nbsp;Reset this PC under Recovery
 in Settings - Update &amp; Security, but the recovery drive media is good to have first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should first backup your data if you choose to Reset Windows, but it is possible to preserve it during the process.&nbsp; Booting with the recovery drive media will give you a way to totally wipe and repartition your laptop hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you reinstall Windows, you should then gain the ability to create the official Windows media and can upgrade from 10162 to 10240.&nbsp; As long as 10162 is activated 10240 should also be, as long as no product key is used during or after the upgrade.</p>

            <p>My 10162 is and has been activated right from the time I rolled it back. BTW thank you for telling me the deadline of Oct 1. thats one missing piece of information no one else in the hours wasted with tech reps seemed to know anything about nor did they
 bother to find the information out. </p>
<p>I DO have whats called a ' Windows.old" file on my main HD. I asked about that cuz it seems to have a saved copy of all my lost bookmarks, data and such. but I was told to delete it as it was useless . Suffice to say I chose not to since my faith in those
 peoples abilities is at a world class low.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I do not have a flash drive in such a small limited range.. when I chose to get a back up drive I went a bit bigger and got a 1 TB Seagate external USB HD to use to back up my files on.. However due to those self same tech reps I was forced
 to format it so that ( as they said ) it could be used as the boot device you mentioned.. Now those files are gone as well and I have that 1 TB HD blank, One idea I asked of was if it could be partitioned down to what I was told to be a 4-6 GB drive and install
 the boot to that baby partition. I was told this cannot be done. but again my confidence is not high since all the other mistakes made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was also thinking of trying an upgrade to one of the different tech previews you mentioned and checking my windows update there IS one right in the que.... but alas that also refuses to download ( along with various other updates also in that que) so once
 again I am at an impasse and thinking it really is the 10162 build that is the root cause of every problem</p>

<p>I just mean the small keychain-size thumb drives for saving data on.&nbsp; I bought a few 16GB Lexar USB 3 thumb drives for $9.99 each recently on sale.&nbsp; So it is not expensive to get a small USB flash drive.&nbsp; 4GB is big enough for a recovery drive to reinstall
 Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows.old saves files for rolling back to the previous OS, but also other data files and file that&nbsp;the install detects might contain user data.&nbsp; As you said, there may be useful data there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The simplest solution at this point might be to choose "Reset this PC" under Recovery in Settings - Update &amp; Security.&nbsp; You can choose whether to preserve data or not.&nbsp; This should reinstall 10162 and restore your ability to create the official Windows 10
 ISO file using the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; Then you can create the official install media and upgrade to 10240 again.</p>

tasks.office.com. <br />
<br />
If the issue persists, please share the following information with us:<br />
1. The screenshot of your symptom.<br />
2. The place you open Planner.<br />
<br />

                    The Microsoft Office button should appear in the upper lefthand corner of the screen in Word, and it did for the first few weeks that I ran the program. It looks like the new&nbsp;red, yellow, green and&nbsp;blue windows&nbsp;office 2010 symbol inside a circle. Next
 to it are the Save, Undo, and Redo commands. Now it has dissapeared and I need to use it to edit documents&nbsp;for a computer class.

<h2>            VLC Player coming to Windows Phone</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Got an email from the VLC team about a real Windows Phone 8 version of VLC. If they get enough sponsers, we'll be able to play pretty much any media format under the sun without conversion!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1061646928/vlc-for-the-new-windows-8-user-experience-metro?ref=search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1061646928/vlc-for-the-new-windows-8-user-experience-metro?ref=search</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Update #1: VLC for Windows Phone 8 and updates regarding Windows Store</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear backers,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last few days, we achieved the following progress:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first important news is that a port of VLC to Windows Phone 8 appears to be easier than expected. While the roadmap is about Windows 8 for Intel followed by a version for Windows RT, it appears to be feasible to publish another version with a specific
 interface for Windows Phone shortly after, since the WP8 APIs are way more similar to Windows 8 than WP7 ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, this fundraiser will help developping a version of VLC for Windows Phone 8. Interestingly, while WP8 offers the same programming interfaces available to Windows 8 &amp; RT apps, it is less restrictive in some regards. Notably our existing networking
 code is going to run as is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, we've been in touch with Microsoft representatives, who are thrilled a bout our endeavor and ready to collaborate with us. They are looking into ways of supporting us directly through non-financial matters, notably hardware, technical and design help.
 This is great news.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, we've been in touch with several designers and some hardware chip vendors about this project.</p>
<p>Regarding admision to the Windows Store, we will need to stick to Microsofts rules and pass a check called WACK. As published in our "Challenges and Risks" section, we will try very hard to fulfill its requirements in order to be published on the Windows
 Store. Therefore, as this seems the biggest challenge, we have already been working on that aspect, during the last days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A significant number of backers asked about legal implications of a publication of VLC on the Windows Store. So far, the Windows Store terms and conditions seem to be compatible with the GNU GPL. About the capability of distributing codecs from the Store,
 we hope to be able to do it, but we are not sure about it yet. We would like to invite you to have a look at at our generic Legal page on videolan.org, which should answer most questions:
<a href="http://videolan.org/legal.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://videolan.org/legal.html</a> You are welcome to get in touch if you require more information.</p>
<p>We are proud of this campaign's progress so far and we hope make it within the next 18 days.</p>
<p>We are going to publish more updates this week, including imagery of the current UI mockups as well as a video demonstrating our ideas for Windows Phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>Jean-Baptiste &amp; Felix for the VLC for Windows 8 team</p>

<p>Agreed but much nicer to be able to play anything without converting it!</p>

            <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I will provide you the steps to determine the cause of the issue so that we can fix the issue.
<br />
I have a couple of questions before we proceed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Does this happen only with Word or even with other Office applications?<br />
2. Where you able to work with Word earlier?<br />
3. Were there any changes made to the computer recently?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Try opening Outlook in safe mode and check. Follow the steps:<br />
1. Click on <b>Start</b> -&gt; <b>All Programs</b>.<br />
2. Go to <b>Accessories</b> -&gt; Click on <b>RUN</b>.<br />
3. Type <b>Winword /safe </b>(leave a space after Winword) -&gt; Click <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Word safe works without crashing, then disable the add-ins and check. Refer the following steps on how to disable the add-ins from Word&nbsp;2010:<br />
1. Open Word.<br />
2. Go to <b>File</b> -&gt; <b>Options</b> -&gt; <b>Add-Ins</b>.<br />
3. Select Com <b>Add-ins</b> -&gt; Click on <b>GO</b>.<br />
4. Uncheck the available Add-ins -&gt; Click on <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If word safe does not help, then try changing the default printer and check. Refer the link on How to change the default printer:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-default-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-default-printer</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If changing the default printer works, then contact the printer manufacturer and update the printer drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above steps do not help, then provide additional information and I will be happy to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

    <title>Excel FORESCAST Results Incorrect When Value is at Cusp of Threshold - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel FORESCAST Results Incorrect When Value is at Cusp of Threshold</h2>
                    <p>I will show a very simplistic example, however to resolve the issue, I have tried expanding the values to actual numbers rather than in the thousands ('000) and have tried rounding in several areas in the FORECAST formula as a well as the data values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok so I can have a value from 0 - 900,000.00. Let's say the value is 299,875.00</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to convert the value of 299,875 into a value range between 0 - 10 based on the following thresholds:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Band I. Values 0.00 - 299,999.99 =&nbsp; Range of 0 - 3.33</p>
<p>Band II. Values 300,000.00 - 600,000.00 =&nbsp; Range of 3.34 - 6.66</p>
<p>Band III. Values 600,000.01 - 900,000.00 =&nbsp; Range of 6.67 - 10&nbsp; .....&nbsp; Note, I cap the value to 900,000.00 and my MAX value is 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using 299,875.00 the FORECAST Value should be 3.33 or less (3.33 to be exact). I keep getting the FORECAST result of 3.34.
</p>
<p>If a value of 299,859,000.00 or Less is applied, FORECAST will result in a value of 3.33, correctly. Any value from 299,860,000.00 - 299,9999,9999.99 results in a value of 3.34.</p>
<p>Given my Ranges on a 10 point scale and the threshold of &lt; 300k FORECAST should derive a value of 3.33</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be some kind of internall rounding up within the FORECAST as it executes, but as noted above, I have tried various "ROUND" fnctions and multiple number of decimal places and formats and to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate whomever takes the time to read and assist me on this.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Scott</p>

<p>@Scott....&nbsp; Since you neglect to show us how you&nbsp;(mis)use FORECAST to get a result of 3.34 (rounded?), it is difficult for us to explain your misunderstanding and misuse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to imagine some possible misuses, but I cannot coerce FORECAST to produce a value that is rounded to 3.34.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please show us the concrete example of using FORECAST that results in 3.34 (rounded, I presume).&nbsp; If you have cell references, shows us their values displayed to 15 significant digits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to linearly interpolate the proper "band" (band I, in this case), the correct use of FORECAST is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=FORECAST(299875, {0, 3.33}, {0, 299999.99})</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Excel 2010, the result is 3.32861261095375, which is less than 3.33 and which rounds to 3.33.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, we can generalize the formula so that you do not have to hardcode each pair of band limits.&nbsp; Let us know if you need help&nbsp;with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two possible misuses....</p>
<p>
</p><p>=FORECAST(299875, {0, 3.33, 3.34, 6.66, 6.67, 10},<br />
{0, 299999.99, 300000, 600000, 600000.01, 900000})</p>
<p>
</p><p>=FORECAST(299875, {0, 10}, {0, 900000})</p>
<p>
</p><p>They result in 3.33224773735826 and 3.33194444444444 respectively.&nbsp; Greater than 3.33, yes.&nbsp; But neither rounds to 3.34.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are not exactly the same as the first formula above because of the forced rounding of the band-wise limits.&nbsp; Instead, the latter two formulas&nbsp;interpolate a line that "best fits" the specified data points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Caveat:&nbsp; Your band-wise limits make sense only if you round the data point (e.g. 299875) to 2 decimal places.&nbsp; Otherwise, you have discontinuities between the bands.</p>

<p>Hi Joe</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay and thank you for all of your detailed feedback. I should have added more words as I was not implying I was not the root cause of the issue and that it was the function. I was just trying to detail what it "seemed" like to be better descript.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So admittedly I am not giving you all of the info as I believe you have the answers; however I want to show you what I am working with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give my scenario below, I prefer to try a FORECAST that looks like the following you noted, "=FORECAST(299875, {0, 3.33, 3.34, 6.66, 6.67, 10},&nbsp; {0, 299999.99, 300000, 600000, 600000.01, 900000})"</p>
<p>The format and templates used heavily on my end just have the floor, ceiling, and lowest value in the middle and upper ranges. For example you can see we do not refer to 3.33 or 6.66.
</p>
<p>I can modify the $ to not be represented in thousands. Bt below is how we currently use the FORECAST. SD should be 3.33 too not 3.34 as it is below 600k.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Andres,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to get the results via the FORECAST function ins excel (this is just a simplified example and I have several worksheets doing various forecasts).; therefore I would prefer not just dividing but the upper bound range. Make sense?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in my embedded XLS example above, using the various boundaries and the number of boundaries* * *, I should get 3.33 when my field value = 299.86 - 299.99 (it works &lt; 299.86).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*** joeu2004 showed via FORECAST if&nbsp; use all defined upper &amp; lower boundaires; however I'd like to see a solution for just the 4 boundary values in the range row (1st row) in mye xample. joeu2004 showed 0,333, 3.334, 6.66, 6.67, 10. My range values are 0,
 3.34, 6.67, and 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is not likely that using FORECAST with more than 2 data points will get the exact results that you expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I tried to explain previously, when there are more than 2 data points, FORECAST interpolates along a "best fit" line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, that line might not go through any of the specified data points.&nbsp; Likewise, interpolating data between the specified data points might not stay within the limits that you intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to accomplish what you expect is to do pairwise interpolations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suppose X1:X5 contains 0, 3.34, 6.67, 10 and 11, and Y1:Y5 contains 0, 300000, 600000.01, 900000 and 900001.&nbsp; Then:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=FORECAST(ROUND(A1,2), OFFSET($Y$1, MATCH(ROUND(A1,2), $X$1:$X$4, 1) - 1, 0, 2, 1),</p>
<p>OFFSET($X$1, MATCH(ROUND(A1,2), $X$1:$X$4, 1) - 1, 0, 2, 1))</p>
<p>
</p><p>provides the pairwise interpolation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The values in X5:Y5 are arbitrary.&nbsp;&nbsp;They work (i.e. do not alter the result&nbsp;for A1=10)&nbsp;because you said the max (rounded) value in A1 is&nbsp;10 (Y4).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that does not return 299999.99 for 3.33 and 660000 for 6.66, which I thought was your requirement and original concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For that, you would need the pairwise data points that I specified in an earlier response in this thread, to wit:&nbsp; X1:X7 is 0, 3.33, 3.34, 6.66, 6.67, 10&nbsp;and 11, and Y1:Y7 is 0, 299999.99, 300000, 600000, 600000.01, 900000 and 900001.&nbsp; Change the ranges
 appropriately in the formula above.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>[EDIT] Note the correction to the X and Y ranges.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>PS....&nbsp; Normally, I avoid using OFFSET because it is a "volatile" function; so that formula and any cells that are directly or indirectly dependent are recalculated every time any cell in the workbook is edited.&nbsp; That can great adversely impact recalculation
 performance if there are very many instances of the formula.&nbsp; Alternatively, calculate MATCH(...)-1 in a&nbsp;"helper" cell (e.g. B1) and replace OFFSET with INDEX($Y$1:$Y$5, B1, 1):INDEX($Y$5, B1+1, 1), for example.</p>

<p>Understood and thank you very much. I appreciate your time and all of the details. Your first pairwise interpolation I will test around to verify or validate other existing boundaries subjectively defined &amp; used. As far as my immediate need I think I am
 good.</p>

<p>Sorry, no, that makes no sense. Your <span>
<span>are so focused on FORECAST, you overlook the mathematical background. Have a look:</span></span></p>

<p>Do you see the Trendline formula and R? It fits perfectly!
<strong>y = 90 * x</strong> or the opposite: <strong>x = y / 90</strong></p>
<p>A2:&nbsp; =B2/90</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is just a linear scale, there is no need for a forecast and it makes no sense.</p>

            Understood and appreciate this. There is another scenario we use FORECAST so I guess for consistency this XLS I inherited was done accordingly. This other scenario is when we get many varying ranges with a value and we want to determine a normalized value
 based on out 10 point scale versus the input of other scales (can be %, #'s, etc and whose ranges can be 100% - 95% or numbers such a 0 - 5, etc.)

    <title>Display Flickering in Outlook 2007 when creating a PDF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pigeoneer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display Flickering in Outlook 2007 when creating a PDF</h2>
                    
<p>Within Outlook 2007, when I try to convert an email to PDF the system becomes unstable and the screen flashes/flickers at a high rate between the main Outlook mail window and the PDF file name window.&nbsp; You can do nothing but dismiss the application process
 within Task Mgr.</p>
<p>Occasionally in the past, I have had flickering within Outlook when the junk mail window pops up.</p>
<p>Something makes me think this is related to my display card as I don't recall this happening before.&nbsp; The display card is an Nvidia GeForce 9800 GT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for fielding my inquiry.&nbsp; I reported the flickering back in January when my MS product (both Office 2007 &amp; W7) software was still within warranty.&nbsp; But the problem was so sporadic that it was difficult to determine whether the changes were effective
 in the long run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this is the FIRST time I ever had a need to create a PDF of my email.&nbsp; But EVERY time I do anything within the Adobe PDF add-in button at the top of Outlook, I get this violent flickering mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Problems with CK-100 in 2003 Chrysler Grand Voyager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robert66---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with CK-100 in 2003 Chrysler Grand Voyager</h2>
                    
<p><font>I just installed a CK-100 in my 2003 Chrysler Grand Voyager using a ISO adapter cable from KRAM. The installation of the cables was easy. I used the configuration in which the CK-100 uses the car speakers and both phone
 and music from the phone are switched via the CK-100.</font></p>
<p><font>On testing the&nbsp;CK-100 I ecountered the following problems:</font></p>
<p><font>1. when using the phone (Nokia 5800), the front speakers are used for the phone and work OK, but the rear speakers make a "static" noise which is quite irritating.</font></p>
<p><font>2. when the phone is not in use my right rear speaker makes a soft clicking noise (approx. a click per second) which is irritating. This speaker also stopped transmitting musice from my car radio.</font></p>
<p><font>3. When audio is played from my phone it uses the front speakers and everything is OK. In this situation I have to use the volume control of my Nokia 5800, the nav wheel does not&nbsp;work in this mode. Is this normal?</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>Hope someone can help me.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Regards,</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Dannyboy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems you know a bit about this car kit and so i thought i would try and get some help from you. I am an installer and I have installed the nokia CK-100 Bluetooth car kit into three vehicles. In one I used my LG phone to test the kit with once the install
 was complete. When I connected it, it&nbsp;would disconnect straight away. When I tried the customers Nokia it worked fine. In a second vehicle, the customer has returned saying his is doing the same thing after two weeks of functioning normally. He has a Nokia
 and once you turn on the ignition it says "connecting" then a second later says "connected" before it can finish saying that word it says "disconnected" and then stays disconnected till we try&nbsp;initiating connection again. This happens with my phone as well.
 I can't get the unit to function properly. I tried CLEARING THE PAIRING LIST as per the instruction kit, but even with the car off and holding the button for 5 seconds the unit tries to connect the same as before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I stop Outlook from opening vCards - All Contacts deleted</h2>
                    I no longer use Outlook for the Mac but it is still installed on my Mac. &nbsp;I recently downloaded a vCard from a website and when I opened the vCard Outlook tried to open. &nbsp;I tried to immediately cancel but a window appeared saying "rebuilding database".
 &nbsp;This resulted in all my contacts (over 2,000) in my Apple Address Book (ver. 6.0, Lion 10.7.1) being deleted. &nbsp;I sync my Apple Address Book with my Gmail Contacts (Google App). &nbsp;All my Gmail contacts were also deleted. &nbsp;I have restored all my contacts to
 both my Apple Address Book and Gmail, but I never want this to happen again. &nbsp;Needless to say I am not very happy with Outlook for the Mac. &nbsp;How do I remove Outlook for the Mac but not the other Office apps?

            Office for Mac has no uninstall application. Therefore, it has no application to simply remove Outlook. However, if you install the entire Office for Mac suite and later delete one of the applications manually by dragging it to the Trash then subsequent
 updaters may think your installation is damaged and ask you to re-install.
<div><br />
<div>The cleanest solution is to remove Office for Mac and then reinstall it. You can customize which applications are installed (omitting Outlook) when you reinstall.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have an <a href="http://www.officeformachelp.com/office/install/remove-office/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office for Mac removal package at the bottom of this page</a> that you can use to remove the software. Once you're removed Office then reinstall it without Outlook. Be sure to run the AutoUpdate application to download all updates and apply them again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

            Had this issue on 10074 and 10122 and as a long shot tried foxit reader instead of acrobat and amazingly it worked - preview now functions in file explorer and outlook. Also issue with not being able to delete pdf files being previewed in file explorer
 was fixed too.

 It seems all other Office applications do this.</p>

            <p>So the beauty of Windows 8 is that all you have to do is setup one machine and then when you log on to another device (in this case your Surface), as long as you use the<strong> SAME Microsoft ID</strong>, all of your contacts, calendar, setting will automatically
 appear on the other devices.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've setup several PC, 2 Slates and 2 Windows Phones.&nbsp; everything is&nbsp;just automatically&nbsp;there ... very cool!</p>

            <p>Hi AnkurArora,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based from what I understand, you already changed your old profile name to&nbsp;a new one. When you sent a message, it still displays your old profile name on the recipients end. Let me assist you in resolving it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to&nbsp;have a screenshot of what you have on your end as this is important so that we could get a better idea about the issue. Here are the following screenshots that&nbsp;I would like to have:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Your profile name. You may have this by going to this <a href="https://profile.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>- Please send a test message to your own account and have a screenshot of the message focusing on your profile name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may post these details in the private message area. To view it, please sign in using a Microsoft account and click&nbsp;<strong>Private Messages</strong> tab across
<strong>All Replies</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can use an email client like Windows Live Mail to set up a display name for your sent messages. Please refer to the link and article I posted below to know where to download the application and how to add your email account.</p>

            Hello Bernard,<br />
<br />
To further clarify, do you still have 2008 installed on your Mac? We generally don't recommend deleting databases, rather we advise uninstalling the app.<br />
<br />
Keep us posted.<br />
<br />
Thank you.

            When I installed Microsoft office 2011 I presume that Office 2008 was uninstalled. Maybe I am wrong. I &nbsp;don't see the app Office 2008, but still there is that database.&nbsp;

            Hi Bernard,<br />
<br />
To safely remove all remnants of your previous installation of Office, I recommend following the steps in this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Troubleshoot-Office-2011-for-Mac-issues-by-completely-uninstalling-before-you-reinstall-ba8d8d13-0015-4eea-b60b-7719c2cedd17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. The steps also applies to Office 2008.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.<br />

Thank you.
