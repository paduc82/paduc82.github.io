<h2>            Photos in camera roll not importing</h2>
                    So my wife came to me and said her phone was acting strange. Upon investigation, I found that she had 0 memory left in the "usage" tab in settings! Upon further investigation, it stated that she had 2.4 Gigs of "saved" messages! I didn't even know messages
 could be "saved." So I decided to import all her photos off her phone onto our PC (Acer 5250-0450 running Windows 7- 64bit) and plugged the phone into the computer, and autoplay opened up as usual, however it beeped and said "no pictures found on this device"....but
 here I am looking at 142 pictures in the camera roll, not yet on my computer, and autoplay is saying there's nothing there to import! This makes no sense. This leads directly into the next issue along the same "storage" lines....when I open iTunes with my
 wife's phone connected (mine as well) it shows TONS of space used up for "documents and data" and "other" yet there is no option to select theses areas of storage and make deletions or adjustments to reclaim any space (we

            <p>Because you mention iTunes and "camera roll," I assume that you have an iPhone of some sort.&nbsp; Look for help or ask your question here --&gt;
<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/community/iphone/using_iphone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://discussions.apple.com/community/iphone/using_iphone</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The space on your iPhone that iTunes shows as "other" is particularly difficult to deal with.&nbsp; There are many, many posts on this topic.&nbsp; See, e.g.,
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=iphone+reduce+other+space&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.google.com/search?q=iphone+reduce+other+space&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as pictures go, I have never used the "automatic" Windows photo importing tools to transfer pictures from iPhone to Windows, and it may be that these tools are "confused" by the file structure on the iPhone.&nbsp; See if the following works for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect your iPhone to the computer and wait for the "Autoplay" window to open.&nbsp; It should look like this:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94190cca-8836-40a1-b50c-cf858d2883bf" /><br />
<br />
</li><li>Click "Open device to view files" and you should see something like this (notice that this iPhone is almost completely full, which is why the bar is red):<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11d158c3-d372-468e-96ed-0a96ba298e45" /><br />
<br />
</li><li>Double click on that entry and you should see a folder named DCIM:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f98b94f4-0cef-4327-8baf-3189539a8c86" /><br />
<br />
</li><li>Double click on the DCIM folder and you should see another folder with a seemingly random name:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66e46aef-2c87-4265-bbf2-16905fe92018" /><br />
<br />
</li><li>Double-click on this folder and you should finally see your pictures.&nbsp; Copy/paste or drag'n'drop them to a folder on your computer.&nbsp; You can then delete them as desired by using the appropriate commands on your phone (I suggest NOT deleting the files on
 your phone by using Windows):<br />

            Sorry, your screen cap of Word 2016 looks just like mine does.  MS thinks the ribbon is sooper important. So important that it is worth wasting 1/3 of our usable screen area ... it's not like our text is important at all ...
<br />
<br />The ribbon in your capture of File Explorer appears to be taking up more space than mine does.
<br />
<br />Tip: you can double click on any of the tabs on the ribbon to shrink/expand the ribbon.

    <title>High CPU usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> readyornot  say:</h3>
<h2>            High CPU usage</h2>
                    <p>I've upgraded two PCs (Surface Pro 2 and an HP desktop) from Win8.1 to Win10, and they're both having the same problem with high CPU usage. After a cold boot, their CPUs site between 0-2% while idling. Then for no reason I can tell they'll both jump to 45-60%
 and stay there non-stop until I reboot. All the processes/apps reporting heavy use aren't specific programs I'm familiar with (e.g. Edge, IE, Word, Reader, etc.) but all system to be systems related, (e.g. various Windows services, host services, etc.) Ignoring
 the issue of impacting performance, the real problem is with the Surface Pro 2. When I put the computer into sleep OR hibernate mode, the Surface wakes up later (with the lid closed) and then run very hot, spinning up the fan and draining the battery in a
 few hours. A couple things to note. First, it doesn't matter how I put the Surface into sleep/hibernate; I've tried programming the "close lid" and "power button" options to sleep and to hibernate; and I've tried manually select sleep and hibernate from the
 power menu. Second, I've tried letting it go to sleep after the timeout period. Third, the Surface (and the PC, for that matter) does this even when I have the power plug in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is making the Surface virtually unusable because it's always dead when I pull it out to use it. Does anyone have any idea how to fix this? I've read through lots of threads on high CPU usage issues but none of them seem to have resolutions, or
 at least not ones that seem to relate to my situation. Oh, and one more thing, from what I can tell the Search Indexer does not appear to be contributing the&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the assistance.</p>

            <p>I don't understand why my CPU sitting at 40-60% utilization while idle is 'normal behavior'. It certainly wasn't normal under any prior versions of Windows. Also, your reply, while appreciated, doesn't address the problems this is creating with regard to
 my Surface Pro 2 not going to sleep and staying asleep. FYI, I'm running the most current versions of all drives that I could find and I have the most current version of the BIOS. But to be clear, this is happening on all my computers not just one of them.</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 Print spooler not running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garyandrews  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Print spooler not running</h2>
                    I have recently upgraded to Win 10 all appeared ok and initially everything including my 2 printers worked, however after a couple of days the printers stopped working,&nbsp;we made no changes to either hardware or software in this time. I have checked for
 problems on the internet and found that is usually related to the print spooler. Checking in local services I found that the print spooler was not running so I tried to start it manually. The spooler failed to start showing the message "Windows could not start
 the print Spooler service on Local Computer &nbsp;Error 0x800706b9: Not enough resources are available to complete this operation". Further research led me to&nbsp;clear the spool/printers file and then run SFC which found and replaced some corrupted resource files.
 This has still not fixed the problem so I still have no&nbsp;printers - its like windows 8 all over again!&nbsp;Any Ideas anyone?

<p>Hi Frank N St31n,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That works, but I was able to "un-gray" and get both monitors working before you replied.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was switch the cabling w/ j5create device from my #1 (hp) monitor to the #2 (dell) monitor, leaving the computer end connections in tact. That went nowhere, but when I switched the cables back. both monitors became active!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a related question, re win 7 desktop &amp; my win 10 laptop:</p>
<p>The monitors are designated #1 monitor &amp; #2 monitor. I may have programmed my hp monitor as #1, and my dell monitor as #2 at one time, but since have changed so that my #2 dell monitor is positioned directly in front of me, and my #1 hp monitor is positioned
 to the left. This positioning prevented me from dragging files to the left, i.e. from #2 monitor to #1 monitor. That did clear up today, but I'm not certain how.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to e-number the monitors from the dialog box "Change Displays" &lt; Displays &lt; Control Panel, but was not able to do so. If you know of another way to make the change, let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, JKSJIM&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Limt Internet access to three sites only</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I'm setting up three kiosk PCs with Windows XP Pro on them. I need to restrict access to three and three sites only. No other web sites should be accessible. I know I can block certain web sites using the HOST file, but in this instance here, I need to
 allow only three web sites. These PCs are not on a domain, but is there a way to use Group Policy on each PC to do this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Once I do this, I do not ewant users to be able to edit the setting without administrative access either. Help!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which browser is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content Advisor allows you to control the types of Internet content that can be viewed on your computer. Depending on how you configure it, Content Advisor uses ratings that websites voluntarily provide to block or allow certain content. Because not all
 websites are rated, unrated websites are automatically blocked (but you can choose to allow them). Once you've adjusted the settings and turn Content Advisor on, it checks websites as you visit them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the link mentioned below if you use Internet Explorer. </p>

    <title>Is there a webcam with built-in microphone that works with windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danieldaskus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a webcam with built-in microphone that works with windows 10 yet&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    My PC is now 6 months old and I'm up to 31 different webcams with built-in microphones that will not work with Windows 10. I get video but no audio and they all do the same thing whether recording or talking with Skype. I've tried all the fixes and had
 the Microsoft techs take control of my PC for 3 hours and they couldn't fix the issue. When you go to the device manager it shows the microphone is enabled but it doesn't pick up anything, so we set the sensitivity to 100 and it begins to pick up sound and
 as soon as you close the device manager it stops picking up sound. When you go back to the device manager the input level has reset to zero again, tried many different drivers and the issue still remains. The best answer I got was from a senior software technician
 from CNET that told me Windows 10 is the worst operating system as far as peripherals are concerned, every update causes issues but the webcam issue has been there for over a year and no fix and manufacturers aren't updating s

<p>... I have several different very old (and some cheap) logitech cameras (with built in Microphones) that have NO ISSUE working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds like you may benefit from a CLEAN install of Windows and the installation of proper hardware device drivers. &nbsp;Get a cheap SSD and try it - see if you can get one of your cameras to work.</p>

            Microsoft techs tried the exact thing you just posted, they were unable to get it to work. I found that I'm not the only one, Dell told me that every single windows 10 PC with the latest build and creators update has this issue. There are no more drivers
 to try. The generic drivers will allow about 30 seconds of recording before the sound stops, it seems that when you set the microphone level it works fine until you go to record and then no sound. Go back to the device manager and the microphone levels rest
 back to zero on their own, Dell has said it is a known issue with Windows 10 and Microsoft doesn't have a fix.&nbsp; There are some registry fixes for PCs that upgraded to windows 10 but for machines built with 10 from the start the issue can't be fixed so I'm
 hoping there is at least a new camera on the market that has resolved the issue or an external microphone that will work.

<p>So you booted your computer from a USB stick and formatted everything and cleanly installed Windows and visited the Dell web site and downloaded the Windows 10 supported drivers for your Dell computer and installed them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said - have several older Logitech cameras I use for Skype (or my kids do) quite often with no problem with WIndows 10 on Dell and other systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, list the 31 cameras. &nbsp;I am curious.</p>

            My sincere apologies. Skype doesn't provide the flexibility to delete more than one contact at a time. You will need to click on one contact individually and remove contact. 
<br />
<br />Hence, you will have to do it for all your contacts one by one. (You should not take extreme step to delete entire account for this)

    <title>Many wireless connection issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dantycoon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Many wireless connection issues</h2>
                    
<p>Any help here is appreciated. I'm at my wit's end trying to fix this problem. Maybe someone here can help me out. (Sorry if there's a random 'p' after some numbers or something. I'm having all sorts of computer problems today and whenever I type a number,
 the keyboard thinks I'm holding p after I let go of the number, until I hit another key...strange, isn't it?)</p>
<p>I'm using a Linksys Wireless N adapter with Windows 7 64 bit. The model number is WMP300N. The story of problems with this POS adapter goes back a few years, but I'll keep it brief...ish.</p>
<p>With an older, out of date driver, I get sound pops constantly. I've been able to track it down to a high DPC latency with the driver I was using. So I thought, "no problem! I'll just have Windows download the newest driver for me, since it's nifty like
 that and all." It downloads a Broadcom 802.11n driver, version 5.30.21.0. It installs, and *boom* no connections are available anymore. Obviously, it's not that my router just suddenly stopped working while I was installing the driver, because a roll-back
 to the previous driver makes it work again. I know it's not my router that's the problem because there's absolutely no other networks available to connect to, whereas there's usually at least one other one I can see with the previous driver.</p>
<p>So I look around the internet, and I find a driver after a few hours of searching that actually WORKS. No high DPC latency, and I can connect to the router. Fantastic! It's a little out of date, but if it works, don't touch it, right?</p>
<p>Fast forward to this week and now I'm having weird connection issues. As in, I can connect to the router, but I can't get to the internet. No web page loads, except for ones I'm already on. For example, I open up google, and search for something. Once I
 start searching for something, the weird connection issue pops back up again, but I can't tell because websites I'm already on (google) continue to work. I go to a different web site google links me to, and all of a sudden I can't go onto any web page at all,
 because I wasn't already there. Now I have to wait a few minutes before the issue sorts itself out.</p>
<p>So today I go looking for drivers...again. This time, I find that Linksys has new drivers for the WMP300N, released in May. "Oh, good," I think, "Maybe NOW I can actually get this thing to work." WRONG! I try to install the driver and Windows gives me an
 error saying "The requested device registry key does not exist."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's my story. Still paying attention? There's one of three ways I can think of to fix this problem:</p>
<p>Method 1: Find a way to fix the official Linksys driver install problem. This is way I'd like to go first of all, since I like to hope that official = better. But I have a feeling that even if I got this to work, I'd still have DPC latency issues. But I'd
 like to get this out of the way first.</p>
<p>Method 2: Fix my intermittent connection problems with the driver that has no DPC latency issues.</p>
<p>Method 3: Fix the broadcom driver issue where I cannot connect to any network at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully I've been good at explaining my problem, and if you need more description of the issue, let me know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>"Few years, that means that the Adapter is pre_Draft. They never meant to ""work"". It was marked gap stoppers until the feuding sides will agree on a Standard.</p>
<p>Ther are more current n adpaters that work reasonably well.</p>
<p>You are wasting your time on a piece of plastic + silicon, and few grams of metal.</p>
<p>There are PCI-N Draft_2 that are in better shape for $25-$30.</p>

<p>The adapter was marked as N-Draft.</p>
<p>I was hoping not to have to buy another adapter since I'm kind of low on money at the moment. It's really not worth it to buy another adapter for the computer, since it goes without use for months at a time, followed by weeks of use before shutting off for
 another few months. There's a reason for the awkward computer schedule, though, I assure you.</p>
<p>I mean, if worse comes to worse, I might buy a new adapter for it when I come back to the computer next time. But for now, I'd like to see if I can get help with these major annoyances. I can work through the connection problems for now, but I doubt I'll
 want to put up with it when I get back.</p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hi rubyrt,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>LWS is a Logitech Webcam Software. I see on the Logitech Forums that many users have fixed their issue by uninstalling and re-installing the software as an Administrator and also
 running the software in Compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>1. In the Programs list, right-click the program that you are troubleshooting, and then click Run as Administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a
 confirmation, type the password, or click Continue. If the program now runs correctly, the program requires administrative permissions to function.
</span></p>
<p><span>Access the below links to know more about it:
<br />
</span><a href="http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Webcams/LWS-exe-has-stopped-working-Vista-x64/m-p/382192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Webcams/LWS-exe-has-stopped-working-Vista-x64/m-p/382192</span></a><span>

<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. If the issue still persists, try installing the software
<span>in Windows Vista SP2 compatibility mode as an Administrator.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps below to install this software in Windows Vista SP2 Compatibility mode:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Right click on the setup file.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Go to properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Click on Compatibility mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Place a check mark the box in the box in front of “Run this program in compatibility mode for” and from the drop down menu choose Windows Vista
 SP2.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. Place a check mark on "Run as an Administrator" under privileges level and click on Apply and then Ok.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f. Now double click on the setup file to initiate the install.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can find more information about compatibility modes in the articles below:</span></span></p>

<p>First, does the Windows Explorer shortcut still work? &nbsp;If so, you can easily remove the .lnk from the name by hiding file extensions. &nbsp;Type<strong>folder</strong>&nbsp;into your Start menu, choose Folder options, then check the option for "hide file extensions
 for known file types" in the options.</p>

    <title>Adding a new account to my xbox one - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> extz xx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding a new account to my xbox one</h2>
                    On the 1st of November 2018 @XboxSupport on twitter reported that they were working to address sign-in related problems on the xbox one. They then followed this tweet with another describing a temporary fix, "In the meantime, please try removing your profile
 from your Xbox One &amp; select 'No-Barriers' or 'Use a Passkey' when you add your xbox live profile back." I followed this advice and removed my account from my xbox but when I attempted to add my account back it told me to check my connection. So I went onto
 the network settings and pressed Test network connection and it told me everything was good and that I was connected yet I repeatedly got the error code "0x87dd001a" when I tried to add my account. Occasionally it would let me connect to xbox live but then
 I got the error message "0x80a40008" telling me that there was a problem. I tried for hours to add my account and it eventually worked as soon as I rang Xbox Support. Now I am having this problem again as of yesterday (07/11

<p>Hi ExTz xx!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us! Sorry to hear you are having difficulties in adding your account to your console. In order for the profiles/accounts to be added to the console, you would need a steady connection to your network. You may wish to check your
 network connection to see if you receive any error messages since the second error code you received (<a href="https://support.xbox.com/error-code-lookup?code=0x80a40008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">0x80a40008</a>) usually occurs due to a connectivity
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you are connecting wirelessly (via wifi), you may experiences some connection issues if you have been connected to that network for some time. Wireless signals and devices can be thought of as performing a handshake of sorts when they connect and,
 over time, can loosen and either become spotty in delivering signal or cut out altogether. Should you be connected by wifi to your console, I recommend a physical power cycle of the console (do not plug back in until after the wifi is back up) while unplugging
 your router or network hardware for a minimum of 5 minutes simultaneously, then set your network up again on the console. This should refresh the connection and give you a stronger signal and connection, then you can attempt to sign back in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To perform a physical power cycle:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>&nbsp;on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.
</li><li>
Unplug the console's power cable. Wait 10 seconds.
<p><strong>Important</strong> Be sure to wait 10 seconds. This step resets the power supply.
</p>
</li><li>
Plug the console power cable back in. </li><li>
Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>&nbsp;on your console to turn on the Xbox One.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a wired connection, you may wish to check your Ethernet cable to ensure that it is performing well by switching it out with a different one to see if you get a different result. That being said, a hardwired Ethernet connection for your console
 is highly recommended since it greatly increases speeds and reduces lag, especially if you play multiplayer games online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give these a try and let us know the results. I hope that this is helpful!</p>

<p>I tried all these solutions when I first encountered this problem and nothing helped. Yesterday and today I also tried these solutions and again nothing helped. Whenever I test my network connection the xbox tells me "Everything is good</p>
<p>Your console is connected to the Internet". Upon trying to test my connection to multiplayer I am told "unable to finish multiplayer tests</p>
<p>Back up and try the test again. If it still does not work, there may be a problem with your network. (0x0000000000000000)".</p>
