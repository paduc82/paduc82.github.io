<h2>            Windows 7 Freezes &#64; Startup in Every Mode. Unable to get past log-in screen.</h2>
                    Alright, my husband's Asus laptop running on Windows 7 Home freezes at log-in screen in every mode.&nbsp; I have attempted numerous options via the F8 menu with no luck.&nbsp; When I boot the laptop it first goes to a "Windows Recovery Error" screen. I have tried
 running in every mode countless times and none get past the login screen without freezing.&nbsp; I completed a system restore through the System Recovery Options menu which did nothing.&nbsp; Multiple attempts at /scannow in command prompt which all resulted with the
 same error "There is a system repair pending which requires a reboot to complete. Restart windows and run sfc again".&nbsp; Then tried "sfc /scannow /offbootdir=f:\ /offwindir=f:\windows" which resulted with "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but
 was unable to fix some of them".&nbsp; I am stuck and could really use some suggestions on what to try next. Nothing I do will get me to the desktop and no blue screen errors at any point.

<h2>            Recent Items on start menu always empty</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows 7 using with Outlook 2010. The recent items on my start menu is always empty.&nbsp; Does not appear to be saving any of my documents in that location.</p>
<p>This is a feature I use often so any help at all would be wonderful. It's a brand new laptop and Office was installed on it a few days ago. I imported a few documents and worked on them etc. with no problem.</p>
<p>I should say that in the Office apps (Word/Excel) the recent docs there is fine. Any suggestionis please?</p>

<h2>            Multiple icons showing in smallest size when using Extra Large Icons</h2>
                    <p>I've seen multiple posts on several forums and I have tried all of the steps provided in those posts but it is not resolving my issue. I have the exact same issue as the user in
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/general-discussion/208746-desktop-icons-show-wrong-size.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
THIS THREAD</a>. I have tried the icon database rebuild, I have tried resetting folder view settings to default, I have tried ie4uinit.exe - ClearIconCache from elevated command prompt, I have tried Disk Cleanup and checked the box to delete icon cache and
 I have tried different cache size amounts (500, 1024, 2048 &amp; 4096) using the steps
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2396571/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>. I've tried these all from normal boot and safe mode. I've tried these all from normal boot and safe mode. The batch file I used does the following:<br />

echo.<br />
start explorer.exe<br />
pause<br />
exit /B<br />
<br />
I've gone as far as to deleting all of the game folders on my desktop, ran the above batch commands, set the Max Cached Icons string to 1024, rebooted, recreated the game folders on the desktop, created shortcuts to every executable manually by right-clicking
 in the folders (while in extra large icon mode already so that when the shortcut appears, it is already choosing 256 size) and selecting new shortcut, pointing it to the executables then opening properties on each shortcut and setting the icons to the 256
 icons on my D drive. Every shortcut displayed correctly for a single reboot. All the commands in the batches and the reg entry should have resolved this. I don't know what else to do. The icons that have the problem keep changing every time I restart the PC.
 I can rename the icon file that a shortcut is currently using and edit the shortcut to point to the newly renamed icon file, it displays correctly. If I rename the icon back to what it was (or never rename it and just change the icon to a different one and
 then back to the old one again) and change the shortcut icon back to the icon file that I have changed back to its previous name, the icon shows incorrectly again. It's like the icon database rebuild does nothing. I don't get it.<br />
<br />
The shortcuts in questions are inside folders on my desktop (not public - my specific user). The desktop icons all display fine in the standard 64x64 and scale fine when ctrl+mouse wheel'd but the icons inside the folders on the desktop randomly decide whether
 or not they will display correctly. I've chosen custom icons for almost all of the shortcuts aside from the defaults that Steam assigned the shortcuts it created. Coincidentally, those Steam icons are only 128x128 yet they are scaling to 256x256 without issue
 until Windows randomly chooses one of those icons to display incorrectly. I'm using icons that I either created off PNGs that were far above 256x256 and converted to 32-bit 256x256 icons using iConvertIcons.com with 32-bit Windows icons as the only options,
 or I downloaded ICO files that other users created on deviantART in 256x256 or 512x512 sizes. After I convert PNGs to ICOs, I verify in the details tab of the icon file that it indeed says it is 256x256. Every single shortcut has displayed the icons correctly
 at one point. Every time I restart Windows or put it to sleep and resume, a different set of icons is then showing incorrectly whereas icons that may have been showing incorrectly before are now showing correctly. It seems totally random.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            <p>I am having the same issue as the OP.&nbsp; I store custom game icons in separate folder, was on desktop but tried moving folder to see if that helped, and randomly different shortcut Icons will not resize correctly.&nbsp; They seem to be stuck on medium size.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the Icons and remade them several times but they keep reverting to medium size.&nbsp; Also, it seems that every couple of restarts different icons will become "stuck" on medium size.&nbsp; This has been going on for awhile and I recently reinstalled
 Windows 7 on to a new drive and it started happening again.&nbsp; Does anyone have a fix for this yet?</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I still could not find any fix. Since the problem does not only occur with Steam internet shortcuts but for any game I install as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This site does not let me find and contact the other people in this thread as well so I have no idea. Microsoft Support constantly says "Hey! Our product is perfect, go ask Steam or the Game Developer about it!".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yeah, no solution up until now.</p>

 but I felt I had to provide my fix for all you poor **** still having this issue like me (as it carried over into Win10 as well). I finally fixed this for both my Win7 and Win10 setups doing the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<ol>
<li>Create a new task in Task Scheduler<br />
</li><li>Set it to use highest privileges (this will prevent that shield icon from showing up on the shortcut)<br />
</li><li>Set the Action to be "Start a program" with the following attributes:
<ul>
<li>Program/script:<span> </span>
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe"</li><li>Add arguments:<span> </span>
-applaunch [Steam Game ID]</li><li>Start in:<span> </span>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\<br />
</li></ul>
</li><li>Make a shortcut with the following attributes:
<ul>
<li>Target:<span> </span>C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe /run /tn "Name of Task"</li><li>Start in:<span> </span>C:\Windows\System32</li></ul>
</li></ol>
 the task action will be to run "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" with an argument of "-applaunch 224420".</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">Note: I created a sub folder in the task scheduler called 'Game Shortcuts' so they weren't
 all mixed up with my other Windows tasks so I had to include "\Game Shortcuts\" in front of all my task names to make it work. So for the above example, I had created the task as "AfterfallInsanity" so my shortcut is C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe /run /tn
 "\Game Shortcuts\AfterfallInsanity".</span><br />
<br />
 and have to do this for them all. Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            &#91;...&#93; this location &#34;R&#58;&#92;&#34; is not available. &#91;...&#93;</h2>
                    When installing a new weather program "vws_install.exe" that is in D:\My Documents I get the following error message in a pop up window.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<i>Error:&nbsp; This installer needs access to "My Documents".&nbsp; However, this location "R:\" is not available.&nbsp; Ensure that this directory exists and is available and run the installer again.&nbsp;
</i><br />
<br />
However, My Documents already exists on my D: drive and I no longer have a drive named R: and I don't want a drive named R:.&nbsp; (I may have had an external drive from an old PC with My Documents on it at one time that was named R:) &nbsp; I boot from C:&nbsp; which is
 a SSD and my data is on an internal 1TB drive named D:.&nbsp; I am running Windows 8 Pro on a HP h8-1400t and it has been working fine for several months.&nbsp; (fine = normal Windows issues and reboot to fix.)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I may have seem a similar type of message regarding "<i>location ?:\ is not available</i>" in the past but either worked around it somehow or just skipped whatever I was trying to do.&nbsp; Now I definitely want to get this weather station software installed and
 need help.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I read a post somewhere regarding a bad register entry causing this problem and it gave some cryptic directions about how to fix it.&nbsp; This problem does not seem to be unique to me but my specific circumstances may be unique.&nbsp; I have installed other programs
 without having this problem. &nbsp; I am very hesitant to edit my registry and would need very specific instructions if I was to do so.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Please help.&nbsp; Many thanks.&nbsp; John&nbsp; <br />

<p>The only way Win 8 would know you used to have a drive R:\ would be if the info was somehow stored in the installer or related file... Are you using the actual installer, or a shortcut that still has the old address..</p>

            i'm not sure i understand your question.&nbsp; the computer and disk have histories.&nbsp; i have attached several different disks internally and externally in the past.&nbsp; the pc came with win 7 and i added the 180GB SSD as the C: boot drive with a clean install
 of win 8 pro.&nbsp; then after much grief got my data onto what is now the internal D: 1TB drive.&nbsp; that drive has probably been attached to different computers with different drive letters in the past. &nbsp; Things have been fine for a few months.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I recently bought a Davis weather station and down loaded the software program mentioned above.&nbsp; I open it as administrator and get the error message.&nbsp; i don't know anything about installers, new or old.&nbsp; please advise.&nbsp; i'm totally stuck.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;

            also, i agree that some part of my pc thinks that My Documents is on R:&nbsp;&nbsp; fyi, my MS Office programs all work fine with the data and all other My "folder name" being on the internal D:&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I nave no idea what part of my system is confused about the R: and My Documents.&nbsp; The register?&nbsp; Installer?&nbsp; something else?&nbsp;

Your help is appreciated.&nbsp; Unfortunately i still need more help.&nbsp; <br />

            i have also used disk manager to change D: to R: and reboot.&nbsp; After that I use disk manager to change it back to D: and reboot again.&nbsp; This does NOT clear up the problem.&nbsp; FYI

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any history on your machine concerning different drives and letters most likely isn't the problem...</p>
<p>At least as far as registry keys and stuff goes...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some programs when they are installed, set themselves up with a default location to save files for example.</p>
<p>If you were to try and then access those same files later on a different drive, or a different letter, they would probably fail...</p>
<p>This is controlled by the preferences in the program...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A shortcut is just an Icon with an address that directs your double click to the actual location of the file.</p>
<p>It would be comparable to&nbsp;the My Documents Icon on your Desktop...</p>
<p>It's not a folder... it contains the address of the folder...</p>
<p>If you right click on a Shortcut and select Properties, you will see a line that says "TARGET"...</p>
<p>This is the location that will be launched or opened when you double click the Icon...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Installer is an application, or .exe type file, and will say so if you select Properties.</p>
<p>You could create a "SHORTCUT" to it to put on your Desktop for instance, by right clicking on it and selecting CREATE SHORTCUT...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where did you download the software to? ...meaning the drive or folder...</p>
<p>Try copying and pasting it to your Desktop and see if that helps...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could also try renaming the drive again and rebooting, but don't change it back before attempting to install the program... This would be a last resort, or just a point of curiosity...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you did a clean install of Win 8, there would be no record of your previous drive lettering of any type in the registry...</p>

<h2>            Not the average &#34;No Audio Device Installed&#34; problem</h2>
                    I've had a problem with my sound for over a month now and have not been able to resolve the problem. Before I reformat, I was was hoping one last time to get some advice on how to fix the problem I'm having with my SigmaTel on-board sound card.<br />
<br />
It all started when I tried to install a USB headset (Jabra GN9350). Vista detected the device and it appeared to install the drivers for it. However, the headset didn't work (no sound), so I removed/uninstalled the headset from the system. Ever since then,
 I've had no sound. My sound card is properly configured in the device manager, it displays "SigmaTel High Definition Audio CODEC" when I mouse over my sound icon in the sys tray (that has a red X), but when I go to the volume mixer, it says "No audio device
 is installed". When I double-click the sound icon, it thinks for a split second, then nothing. Going to the playback devices, it shows my sound card as working with the default green check. However, nothing I do in this window has any effect. Can't configure
 the speakers, test, or disable.<br />
<br />
I have since done EVERYTHING there is to do. Uninstall/reinstall the drivers. Install a completely new PCI sound card. Tried running the "fixit" application MS offers to fix sound, but it doesn't detect any problems (although it does list a "USB audio device"
 that isn't attached anymore among the list of things to check). Tried the million different "fixes" available on the net. My audio service is running. I've spent DAYS on this problem... it's almost becoming an obsession. I'm pretty sure it's a problem in Windows,
 not with the hardware. <br />
<br />
Please for the love of God, can someone help me? Thanks...

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I am posting this troubleshooter to be sure you have done it all, and would not hurt to start at the top and<br />
work through it anyway as you might have just missed the one step that solves the issue and it often takes<br />
many.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see<br />
if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take several
<br />
tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
<strong>Also Right Click Speaker near clock - Playback Devices - right click in the box area - check<br />
Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and on the&nbsp;lower Right click Properties<br />
check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also do same for Configure on Lower Left of<br />
that box. Repeat this section for headphones if needed later.</strong><br />
<br />
In Control Panel you can also look for an Audio Manager along with the Sound Settings.<br />

<br />
You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data)<br />
<br />
If you do not have a Vista DVD you can borrow a friends (same 32 or 64 bit) and use your product key.<br />
(For a complete clean re-install you would need an OEM version of the DVD is your System maker uses<br />
OEM methods.)<br />

            Thanks for the info SpiritX. Although I have already done this stuff, I went through your list again. The only area that really pertained to my problem was the first part. I did a clean reinstall of the latest drivers from Dell. Didn't help. As mentioned
 before, my Audio Service is running and set to automatic. I even tried stopping it and restarting it.<br />
<br />
If it helps, when I double-click on the sound icon in the tray, sndvol.exe appears for a second in the process list, but then just shuts down. Nothing happens when I click 'configure' in the Sound manager.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to avoid a reformat if at all possible. I have 250+ GBs of stuff and backing up is a real pain. Any other, more in-depth suggestions? Although I don't think it's an audio driver problem, is there a way to completely flush out any and all old drivers
 or registry entries pertaining to current and past audio device installations?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the continued help!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You really need to do it all, its a checklist not a menu.<br />
<br />
Once you have exhausted those you can check with the System maker and/or the actual device maker<br />
for the actual Registry entries that you should have for the drive and also for any firmware updates.<br />
<br />
Also you can check here and especially with anyone that has the same drive to see what firmware they<br />
are running and for the actual Registry entries you need.<br />
<br />
Note there are more Registry entries that pertain to the drive than just the ones mentioned for the high<br />
and low filters.<br />

    <title>Taskbar ends in the middle problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Taskbar ends in the middle problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've got the following problem (Sorry but I don't have time to search tons of sites where to put the issue or to find where the windows support resides.)</p>
<p>I use a 2 in 1 device with clean Windows 10 pro installation. When I swipe down and up through the bottom edge of the display, during the up movement there is a huge chance of this happening:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75e3b4e8-3789-4a0d-b8c2-b74be99ef734?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75e3b4e8-3789-4a0d-b8c2-b74be99ef734?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The taskbar transforms into this and the right side is clickable but dead (it does nothing except for showing you a context menu on right click) Sometimes keyboard layout button peeks half way from the edge of the display in the middle of that dead zone.
 The rest of the icons seem to be shifted to the bottom where nothing can ever reach them.</p>
<p>Restarting the explorer.exe process temporairly resolves the issue, until the next swipe motion does the same.</p>
<p>Thank you for help or fix.</p>

            Hi PatrikStaro≈à 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Looks like bad driver for you display adapter.
<br />Try this...
<br />
<br />Select the Start button, type Device Manager, and select it from the list of results. 
<br />Expand Display Adapter then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select Update Driver. 
<br />Select Search automatically for updated driver software and follow the on-screen instructions to update the drivers. 
<br />If no updates were found, then right-click on the mouse select Uninstall. 
<br />Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />And if none of the above works then best to go to the vendors site and download the latest drivers for your device.
<br />So for example, if your computer is a Dell Latitude then you would go here.
<br /><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/latitude-3570-laptop/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/produ...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure to download the drivers for the system type of your machine.
<br />To find this out go search and type system.
<br />Look for the system type.
<br />It will either be 32bit or 64bit.

<p>Hello Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to update all of the drivers and I succeeded. However, the issue is persistant. It however happens only when some applcation is overlaying the taskbar. With enough (2 to 4) swipes up and down in the bottom right region, the taskbar goes wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thing it is a software issue and microsoft should implement a fix in the next update. I can help with the tests or more relevant information.</p>

            This should probably fix your issue:<br />
A simple PowerShell command to re-obtain licenses for your windows store apps is all you require!<br />
<br />
1. Click Start<br />
2. Type PowerShell<br />
3. Right Click PowerShell (Desktop App)<br />
4. Choose Run as Administrator<br />
5. Copy this by selecting the text and then pressing Ctrl+C
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">6. Paste it into the PowerShell with Ctrl+V</p>
8. You may see several Red Errors- around 3 or 4, ignore these- they are normal.<br />
9. Close PowerShell.<br />
10. See if your issue was solved, open Microsoft Edge.<br />
11. (optional) Click the helpful button here if it worked! (:</p>

<h2>            How do I install the new patch on a unbootable computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My computer was hit this update problem, getting stuck at the auto repair choose keyboard message. &nbsp;Keyboards and mouse not working. &nbsp;I used a Windows 10 ISO USB drive to try and solve the unbootable Windows 10 problems. &nbsp;I got in and was able to restore
 to a previous point. &nbsp;However upon restarting, the system applied the update again, prompting the same unbootable state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I apply a downloadable patch if I can't even get into Windows?</p>

            What you should be doing is blocking that update from installing.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />So, what you will need do is restore your Windows installation to an earlier to point then apply the block.

<p>Just a little update.&nbsp; The ISO USB final got me on through repair (I forgot to unplug for the restart).&nbsp; Now I am running an older processor (AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor +5800 3.00 GHz) and was wondering if that was part of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Malwarebytes Anti Malware along side Windows Defender, both of with have corrected the registry key problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update still show pending.&nbsp; But I am afraid that disabling it will put me at risk of infection.&nbsp; Any suggestions on what to do?</p>

<p>AMD Athlon 64 was indeed a part of the problem.</p>
<p>This month's updates have screwed up AMD based systems and Microsoft released a newer patch to rectify that issue.</p>

In windows live mail 2012 you can delete the signature by going to file(upper left)&gt;options&gt;mail&gt;signatures.&nbsp; Delete the one you want to remove.<br />

<h3> hwa222  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft office home and student 2007 installs every time an attachment is opened</h2>
                    I am running Vista Home Premium SP2 on a new Dell computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I installed Office 2007 Home and Student after I got the computer with no obvious problem, but now whenever I try to open an email attachment or use Windows Explorer to open an exiting document
 file I get a window that says "please wait while windows configures Microsoft home and student 2007" and there is a long delay before the file opens. If I open the application first and then use Office to open a saved file&nbsp;it works OK.<br />
<br />
I have installed, uninstalled and reinstalled Office 2007 Home and Student several times with no success in correcting the problem. I have looked at&nbsp;prior posts recommending the Windows Installer CleanUp Utility, but the link says not to use the utility program
 on Office 2007 products.&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301</span></a>&nbsp;Should I run this anyway?

            Like Dave_P_B, Dell Dock&nbsp;on my computer&nbsp;had no problem quickly opening the applications. I suspected Dell Dock, so as part of my effort to correct this, I uninstalled both Office 2007 Home and Student and Dell Dock as well as IE8 and&nbsp;various Windows updates.
 I then reinstalled Office 2007. I still had the same problem, so I put everything back the way it was. My computer is up to date with all Windows updates and a fresh reinstall of Dell Dock. Everything works fine except for this problem.<br />
<br />
The Office 2007 software works fine on my wife's laptop. (not a Dell)

                    <p>So recently after the new huge window update my PC has had this problem where every 1-3 seconds the whole thing will stutter, for example if I were to move my mouse across the screen the mouse would stop and start across the screen - whenever the stutter
 happens it also affects the audio distorting it, this overall makes watching YouTube, playing games, etc impossible. I've looked around and can't find a fix so I really need some help.</p>

            So after waiting for Microsoft to reply...of which didn't really happen I decided to fix it myself, really simple - instead of using wireless internet connection, use an Ethernet and the problem will go away!&nbsp;

<h2>            Microsoft windows search filter host is using too much &#40;20-40&#37;&#41; of my CPU and the Indexing Fix doesn&#39;t seem to  work.</h2>
                    <p>I have already google it and landed on this &nbsp;page:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-performance/microsoft-windows-search-filter-host-is-burning-my/bae4c974-5b47-4ab2-b17d-c599853f00f1?rtAction=1495848963482">Solution Page</a>.<br />
But it didn't work for me, it will go to 4-5% for couple of minutes and back at it again and it is the same scene after restarting. What should i do? any fix?</p>

<p>Hi Hashik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you tried to rebuild your index. Have you modified the indexed location as well? If not, go to I<strong>ndexing Option</strong> again and click
<strong>Modify</strong>. Uncheck everything except drive C then click <strong>OK</strong>. Choose
<strong>Advanced </strong>and rebuild your index. Restart your device afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the steps above will not make a difference, repost the question in <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=win10itprohardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TechNet Forum</a> for a detailed troubleshooting involving registry settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise as necessary.</p>

<p>Hey John, Thanks for the reply.<br />
</p>
<p>Yes, i have already tried doing so and it didn't work out for me. When ever i restart or wait for a few minutes it will go back to 40 or 50% use and above screens are "after" doing what you've suggested, i.e un-checking everything except C drive.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Results verified by WinDBG, DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView.</strong><br />
<br />
The Bug_Check was 9F CAUSE&nbsp;usbccgp.sys which is a Windows component which means<br />
something else drove it into Fault. Further analysis only pointed to other Microsoft components.<br />
<br />

<p>Probably caused by : usbccgp.sys<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Check with Dell Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums<br />
about any known issues. Update the <strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>low level chipset drivers</strong>, and the
<strong>major on-board<br />
and separate device drivers</strong>. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update
<br />
those without Dump in their names (see driver update methods below).<br />
<br />
BiosVersion = A07&nbsp; <br />
BiosReleaseDate = 08/04/2010 &lt;- check for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and<br />
the major on-board and separate device drivers.<br />

<strong>2.</strong> As needed use ALL the other&nbsp;methods in the troubleshooter below.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> After&nbsp;using ALL the&nbsp;methods if the issues continue then run&nbsp;DriverVerifier to see if&nbsp;it can<br />
indicate a&nbsp;CAUSE (see&nbsp;Driver Verifier methods below).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
=========================================================<br />
<br />
Are you using any Roxio or Nero programs? These have been known to cause this problem even<br />
if they were working well for a long period of time. If so check with their support.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Check these :</p>

<p>Check with these utilities to see if any information can be gathered : (Be sure to run this since there<br />
may well be other Bug_Check codes.)<br />
<br />
This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information<br />
<br />
<strong>BlueScreenView</strong> - Free -&nbsp;scans all your minidump files created during 'blue screen of death' crashes,<br />
and displays the information about all crashes in one table.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</span></a><br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
MyEventViewer can be checked at the time of the BlueScreen (BSOD) to within a second or so of the<br />
time of the BSOD to provide more information as to possible cause - see TIP.<br />
<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer</strong> - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.<br />
<strong>TIP</strong> - Options - Advanced Filter allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file -<br />
set it to a bit before and&nbsp;after the time of the BSOD.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html</span></a><br />
<br />
------------</p>
<p><strong>AppCrashView </strong>- Free -&nbsp;a small utility for Windows Vista and Windows 7 that displays the details of all<br />
application crashes occurred in your system. The crashes information is extracted from the .wer<br />
files created by the Windows Error Reporting (WER) component of the operating system every<br />
time that a crash is occurred. AppCrashView also allows you to easily save the crashes list to<br />
text/csv/html/xml file. <br />

<br />

<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see<br />
if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable<br />
and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC<br />
and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power.<br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link<br />
above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update your major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            MSi Laptop S6000 Windows 7 &#40;64-bit&#41; Wireless Problem. Wireless keeps turning off after sleep mode and unable to figure out how to change the settings. </h2>
                    
<p>I own a MSi Laptop S6000 Windows 7 (64-bit). My problem is that anytime that my laptop goes to sleep mode (when I close the lid or after inactivity) the wireless connection is cut off and in some cases the wireless card is shut off. I end up turning on the
 wireless card with the</p>
<p>Function F8 button and then have to reconnect with my wireless network.</p>
<p>After sleep mode, I have to reconnect to the wireless network (without turning on the card).</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I have tried numerous steps to remedy this problem including unchecking the "turn off this device to save power" button in properties and made sure that my laptop ALWAYS connects to the network by making it the #1 on the priority list and checking the connect
 to this network even when it's not broadcasting.</p>
<p>Yet I still have been unable to remedy this solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please Help if you can. I appreciate your time in advance...happy 2011!</p>

<p>Assuming that the signal is strong, and that there is No electrical environmental noise.</p>
<p>Check the Computer's support site and make sure that you are using the latest Drivers*** for the Network cards.</p>
<p>Check the Router's support, and make sure that your using the latest firmware for the Router.</p>
<p>Uncheck the Network Card's Power Saving (I.e., do not let the card save power).</p>
<p>There might be some variations on where the Power saving setting is.</p>
<p>Here are few examples, YMMV, look around in your systems.</p>
<p>Example, <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/example/powersave.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/example/powersave.jpg</a></p>

<p><strong>***On&nbsp; Drivers Update</strong> .<br />
<br />
Try to install the latest drivers of the card from the support page of the&nbsp; manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Download the drivers and unpack them to a folder of your choice.<br />
<br />
In the Device manger, right click on the adapter.<br />
<br />
Click on Update Drivers, and choose the Browse my computer for drivers, <br />
<br />
Choose let me pick from a list, Click on&nbsp; Have a Disk and point to the folder with the Drivers.</p>
