                    my printer has all its cartridges full. it acts as if printing but the paper comes blank. It used to work perfectly on my win 7 until suddenly it started to give me blank papers supposed to be printed

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the printer prints blank page and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is the printer connected to domain network?</li><li>Is it connected through USB or wireless?</li><li>Do you remember making any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li></ul>
<p>The issue can be caused due to incompatible/missing/corrupted printer driver, any sort of disconnection with the computer etc. We can try the following methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run the printer troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Open the Printer troubleshooter by clicking the <span>
<strong>Start</strong></span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" />, and then clicking
<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>. In the search box, type
<span><strong>troubleshooter</strong></span>, and then click <span>
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong></span>. Under <strong><span>Hardware and Sound</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>Use a printer</span></strong>.</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To make sure you have the most up-to-date troubleshooters from the Windows Online Troubleshooting Service, your computer should be connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Visit the printer manufacturer's support website and install the latest printer driver available for the same model for Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the driver here: <strong><a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?oid=58773&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;platform=OSF_W_7-32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Epson Stylus CX7800 All-in-One Printer
</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Download the correct architecture of operating system (32Bit or 64Bit)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Install any pending Windows updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>. Click
<strong>System &amp; Security</strong>, and then under <strong>Windows Update </strong>
and click <strong>Check for updates</strong></p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Dear Niranjan ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your thorough answer. I am much obliged.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am sorry to advise that I tried the 3 methods you&nbsp;mentioned above,&nbsp;to no avail. My printer is still&nbsp;printing blank papers although It&nbsp;responds as if printing normally!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The troubleshooting gave the following error: </p>
<p><strong>Printer Epson Stylus CX7800 is not shared with the homegroup. sharing the printer with the homegroup will allow other computers to use the printer.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I therefore pressed next&nbsp;and the troubleshooter did give me the <strong>FIXED</strong> icon for the sharing of the homegropup&nbsp;, However to no avail.</p>
<p><em>I must emphasize here&nbsp;<strong>that the scanner of the printer works perfectly!</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I downloaded the driver from the link you supplied in your answer and the download was achieved perfectly. However the printer still&nbsp;performed the same: blank paper!</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) &nbsp;I later downloaded&nbsp;one pending important update , also to no avail!</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The printer is connected through USB. I am sorry to ask you define what do you mean by
<em>connected to domain network. </em>To my understanding I don't have any blog and therefore any domain. It is merely connected to my computer with no other sophistication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- No specific change made in the computer prior to the issue except that one of the cartridges was almost empty.&nbsp;Nevertheless the printer&nbsp;did respond to the printing order. Unfortunately&nbsp;it gave a blank paper; although it printed correctly the time before
 with the same almost empty cartridge. I changed all the cartridges ever since , to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I have an&nbsp;</em><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">hp professional laptop (windows 7).
</span></em></strong><em>M</em><em>y other Samsung laptop with windows&nbsp;10&nbsp;responds in&nbsp;the same way (i.e. blank paper) when I try to print on the same printer.</em></p>
<p>I hope this helps you have a pertinent opinion. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Friendly Regards,</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>This could be due to the printer not being shared in the Homegroup. I would request you to refer to the article below and share printer in your Homegroup so you can print from other computers connected to the printer.</p>

</p><p>Apparently, <strong>sharing the printer with the homegroup did allow the black color printing! However there were no way to latch the color printing.&nbsp; I cannot have any of the three colors printout. Head cleaning was done to no avail.

<p>Great game, a little hard to follow at times, like Burst Axe I never played the first one, but by the end of the game you should get the story behind it. And the game play is fairly good could be better though, the combat system is unique(at least to me).
 For a RPG the world is not very expansive but this is more than made up for buy the story telling and decision making that effects the game way more the just prime colored lights.

<p>I wish it was more of a blend of Skyrim and Dragons Dogma as far as controls go but I just couldn't get into it. TW3 looks really good but they better have the controls more refined. Also TW2 graphics were a little harsh.</p>

<p>I hope they release a 1&amp;2 collection for the X1 and PS4 before 3 comes out. &nbsp;It would be a shame for people to get only 1/3 of the intended trilogy storyline. &nbsp;I generally do not like playing PC games but I bought The Witcher a few years back and it was
 awesome. &nbsp;Bought the 2nd on the 360.</p>

<p>"The Witcher 2" is a great linear action adventure game that does a fairly good job of aping an actual RPG with stuff like an Inventory and Skill trees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However there's only one role you can play in the game and that is Gerald the Witcher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The path is linear but has forks.&nbsp; It's not unlike "The House Of The Dead 2" where when you died it showed the path you took, which turn you made at a branch and where you ended up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It shows it's age on the 360 a little bit (it is an older game) but still has some of the best facial animation you'll see on any platform and overall delivers a decent action adventure experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Defiantely worth picking up and playing.</p>

            Hi Andrew.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are a lot of problems we see daily here with Account Corruption in Windows 10.  
<br />
<br /> I'll give you everything possible to try for sign-in failure so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br />
<br />This could also be due to account corruption so see the fixes here:
<br /><a href="https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profile-windows-10-9139/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profi...</a>
<br /> 
<br />To access another account to try to fix corruption, or create a new Admin account to replace a corrupted account, see these steps to enable the hidden Built-in Administrator used for emergencies like this.  First try whichever method works here:  
<br />
<br />If it blocks these by requiring a password, then first see this tutorial for enabling Built-in Admin from Log-in Screen.  <a href="https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-administrator-account-in-windows-10-without-login/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-admin...</a>
<br />
<br />It may also be necessary to create bootable media to access Command Prompt at boot to use Option Five to enable Built-in Administrator,  or to Reset or do the Clean install:<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Command Prompt to attempt enabling Built-in Administrator.  
<br />
<br />Restart PC, Sign into new Admin account, elevate the desired account by typing netplwiz in Start Search, opening the wizard, highlight desired account (tick box if necessary first), then under Properties &gt; Group Membership, change to Administrator. Save that and then if desired highlight and remove the old Admin account.
<br />
<br />If these fail then create a new Admin Account to sign into and test, move your files over and when ready delete the old account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>.... It is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

    <title>No Signal - PC to TV HDMI connection. HELP&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yek2  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Signal - PC to TV HDMI connection. HELP&#33;</h2>
                    Hello!&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm having a bit of a problem with my HDMI connection and was hoping that someone could help me fix it. I have a Samsung 32 inch 450 Series LCD TV that has two HDMI ports and a gateway computer with windows 7 installed on it. I have previously hooked my
 computer and tv up via HDMI to HDMI and it worked perfectly fine for months. I moved a few days ago and when i tried to re-hook everything up the TV kept telling me that there is no signal.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I've tried:&nbsp;</div>
<div>I've bought another HDMI cord and it still gives me the same response</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried to check the display resolutions but it won't even give me the HDMI option</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>VGA works completely fine</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My drivers are all up to date</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried both ports on my TV with no luck...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>ANY HELP WILL BE AMAZING!!&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

<div>second, most Samsungs have menus where you can select the active input port. is</div>

            <p>Unfortunately, I do not have anything that can connect via HDMI. As for selecting the active input port, yes i have done that as well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a little odd, because when I do connect it the tv seems to detect it because the port that has been connected lights up but when i select it, it gives me no signal.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Cannot get Brother DCP L2540DW printer to be recognized by Win 7 Pro 64-bit OS ... installation process gives error w&#47;o any way to correct</h2>
                    <p>Did the following:</p>
<p>1. Downloaded the correct version entire software .EXE file for this printer into Downloads folder</p>
<p>2. Ran the .EXE file, got error msg to close applications and start again.&nbsp; So removed old printer software from STart-up programs list, did a re-start</p>
<p>3. Ran .EXE program again... got "Error 5"&nbsp; dv_____ something without any suggestions on what to do to make it work</p>
<p>4. Ran again, same thing as 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This new printer shows up in Other Devices but says Driver Missing ... that was the whole !@#$% point of going to Brother's website and downloading entire software suite (for print, scan, etc functions)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trouble-shooting and searching for Driver Updates produced NOTHING</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrated at what should be a simple process!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions welcomed</p>

<p>Please provide the complete text of the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you intend to connect the printer (USB? wi-fi?)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the scanner function work from the computer (i.e., not scanning a document using the printer's front panel controls)?</p>

</p><p>I assume from your comment about "Other Devices" that there is an entry for the printer in Device Manager.&nbsp; The following may work:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the Brother download page for your printer (<a href="http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadlist.aspx?c=us&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=dcpl2540dw_us_as&amp;os=93" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadlist.aspx?c=us&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=dcpl2540dw_us_as&amp;os=93</a>),
 select the proper version of Windows and then download the "Add Printer Wizard Driver" (<a href="http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadend.aspx?c=us&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=dcpl2540dw_us_as&amp;os=93&amp;dlid=dlf100999_000&amp;flang=4&amp;type3=407" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadend.aspx?c=us&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=dcpl2540dw_us_as&amp;os=93&amp;dlid=dlf100999_000&amp;flang=4&amp;type3=407</a>).&nbsp;
 It may be best if you save the downloaded file in its own new (temporary) folder.&nbsp;
<br />
</li><li>Run the downloaded file to extract the driver files.&nbsp; </li><li>Right-click on the printer entry in Device Manager and select "Update Driver"</li><li>Click "Browse my computer for driver software"</li><li>Click "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer" and click Next</li><li>Click the "Have Disk" button</li><li>Browse to the folder where you saved the extracted files in Step 2 and select the *.inf file.&nbsp; It should be named brprxxxx.inf (you may not see the .inf if you have Windows Explorer set to hide file extensions for known file type).&nbsp; Click "Open"</li><li>Click OK and complete the wizard</li></ol>

<h2>            How can I get tabcal.exe to load&#63; It will not load or allow me to reset the calibration settings</h2>
                    Just as the question title states, tabcal.exe won't load when I try to reset the calibration settings or if I try to launch it from run. It will launch if I go to tablet pc settings and select the calibrate option, but I can't seem to get it to calibrate
 as well as the default settings.&nbsp;

<div>Hi! Sorry I did not provide sufficient details the first time around.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) MS Surface Pro 64gb&nbsp;</div>
<div>2) Since I got it</div>
<div>3) Just MS defender and spybot search and destroy (which is not setup to run in background or anything like that)</div>
<div>4) If I try to calibrate through tablet pc settings -&gt; calibrate pen, it launches and operates normally. However, I cannot get as good of a calibration as I did when it was stock, so I am now trying to reset it. If I try to reset calibration or launch
 via run or by running the .exe in explorer, it will request admin rights and then never launch. No process/service appears in task manager either.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me know if you need any other details.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>

Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I cannot find the touch screen drivers in device manager. Even after enabling show hidden devices, nothing comes up specifically as the touch screen. Under human interface devices, there are about 16 entries that say HID-compliant device. Similarly, under
 mouse and pointing devices, it shows 7 HID-compliant mouses. What section should it fall under?</div>

            To anyone else who may come by this, I resolved this issue by uninstalling the second HID-compliant mouse under mice and other pointing devices. You will know you uninstalled the correct one because the trackpad on the keyboard will also stop working.
 After a reboot, everything is reinstalled and tabcal works perfectly. Strange issue though, considering it has happened on both Surface Pros I've owned (returned the first one to get a 128gb version).

<h2>            The User Name or Password is incorrect</h2>
                    I was using my laptop when it suddenly shut down and said it was installing Windows updates.&nbsp; When I restarted the computer, it shows my User name, but tells me my password in incorrect.&nbsp; I tried switching to another user to see if I could log in as a
 guest user, but got the same message.&nbsp; The only answer I found on this forum was answered when Windows 7 was in beta testing, so it didn't provide the solution.&nbsp; My new laptop is pretty useless if I can't get past the login screen.&nbsp; Please help!

    <title>Enhancement recommendation or request on how to access and use it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garykendrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enhancement recommendation or request on how to access and use it</h2>
                    <p>I had converted 100% from Windows over to Apple Mac (OSX) years ago as the result of a keylogger intrusion and security concern about&nbsp;Microsoft Windows products.&nbsp; Since Windows 10 I have purchased a Windows 10, Lenovo Yoga 2 in 1 laptop and while I like
 it very much and it's actually brought me back to windows one thing I miss most is some conveniences that Apple gives me in OSX.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance say you are typing in either a Web Browser. like now when I'm typing this question, or a word processor or other
 application and you right click on a word.&nbsp; Apple Mac OSX gives you the ability to do many things from the right click such as spell check, word substitution or definition or&nbsp;other features.&nbsp; With Windows I'm having to copy the word then open up a separate
 dictionary just to get a definition or other use for the word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there the feature in Windows 10 where when you right click a word you have the option to obtain a definition of the word or say choose an alternate word with similar meaning or do other functions?&nbsp; If that exist how do I make sure that I enable it for
 my applications to use?&nbsp; If it doesn't exist then consider it an enhancement request.</p>

            <p>Yes it is and has been in Word as you indicated however my concern was with Edge and other applications apart from Microsoft Word.&nbsp; In the Apple products, for each application/program they have a "Services" tab which allows creation of macros or shortcuts
 to accomplish all kinds of things.&nbsp; However the feature I am seeking from Edge or Microsoft to carry from application to application would be the ability to offer alternatives, correct spelling etc.&nbsp; On some applications, like Edge, there is the selection
 (when you right click) to Ask Cortana which when chosen does provide a definition of the word highlighted.&nbsp; Other than that and on most I get the option to "select all", "cut", "copy", "paste" and "inspect element".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a setting or location in Windows setup where you can define certain choices be made across from application to application that is what I'm seeking to know.&nbsp; I have no problem with Word, Excel, or other Office applications but the same courtesy
 does not seem&nbsp;to apply across all applications.&nbsp; If that capability exist I'd like to know how to get it to apply across the board, on all applications.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Wifi not working properly on my laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sabster55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi not working properly on my laptop</h2>
                    Ok. I'm at a total loss here. My modem is on and all the correct lights are doing what they've always done. Every other device in the house (phones, tablets, consoles, and the tv) are connected and not having even a blip of a problem. My laptop is connected
 and has been for two weeks and I've been able to use it with no problem. Suddenly, I open a browser window and get a message saying its unable to connect to the Internet. Fist thing I do is check through my connections. Modem? Working. Laptop wifi? On. Showing
 connected to network and says it has Internet connection. Okay... So I run a diagnostic and it comes back saying it can't find anything wrong. I tried going to multiple different sites just invade but not a single one of them worked. Now i just am baffled.
 Any suggestions would be welcome.&nbsp;

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually <br />
using the methods&nbsp;below is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System <br />
maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows 7&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests <br />
one just HIDE it as they are almost alway old and you can look for drivers<br />
manually as needed.</p>

Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />

            Hi  Michell, it sounds like a graphics card issue . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager - Accessible by right clicking your Start Button 
<br />Expand the Display Devices section 
<br />Right click your graphics card and choose properties 
<br />On the driver tab, choose 'Roll Back Driver' 
<br />
<br />If the Roll back option is grayed out, try updating the driver . ..       
        </p>

            Check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update, including BIOS, Chipset, Sound, Network, USB3, Bluetooth and all others.  Compare to the one present installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu..  You can take your time until they are all updated.  <br /><br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  <br /><br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  <br /><br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates

            Debe instalar las versiones de 32 y 64 bits de Visual C ++ 2015 Redistributable. Algunas aplicaciones a veces requieren ambas arquitecturas para funcionar con éxito, especialmente los juegos.
<br />
<br />Solo instale Visual C ++ 2017 Redistributable si la aplicación lo requiere. He leído algunos informes donde la instalación de la versión 2017 entra en conflicto con 2015 y antes.
<br />
<br />Los desarrolladores están empezando a apuntar a ese tiempo de ejecución, pero hay aplicaciones que pronto comenzarán a usarlo.
<br />
<br />======================================
<br />You should install both 32 and 64 bit versions of the Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable. Some applications will sometimes require both architectures in order to successfully work, especially games. 
<br />
<br />Only install the Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable if required by application. I have read some reports where installing the 2017 version conflicts with 2015 and earlier. 
<br />
<br />Developers are just starting to target that runtime but there are apps out there that will soon that start using it.

<h2>            xerox phaser 8860mfp not working on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a xerox 8860 mfp, has been working on our network without fail. Purchased new laptop with Windows 10 about 6 weeks ago. Connected the computer to the printer via TCP/IP - not problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of this week I have not been able to print on the Xerox from the laptop. Printing works from other computers on the network (XP, MAC). I can pull up the printer with it's IP; I cna even ping the printer with command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I try (uninstall/reinstall, delete driver, update driver, replace driver, restart printer, full shutdown of printer) I cannot print from the W10 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has someone had the same problem - solution?</p>
<p>

    <title>Need help with using Sony Bravia TV as a monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinstapleton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help with using Sony Bravia TV as a monitor</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I have a problem and am hoping someone can give me some help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm wanting to use my Sony Bravia TV as a monitor for my desk top, mainly just to stream/play movies, but when I connect it up and select 1920*1080 resolution, its doesn't display to the edges of the screen.&nbsp; I'm using a Dell dimension 8400, which has a
 new graphics card in it. A asus 5450 with native HDMI connector. Its also been upgraded to Windows 7.&nbsp; I've tried changing various settings but no joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, when I remove the desktop from the screen and plug my Dell Inspiron 1525 laptop into it, it instantly displays right to the edge, with nothing cropped off.&nbsp; The laptop only has a basic graphics card, but has the HDMI output also.&nbsp; The only other difference
 is its running Windows Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I know the TV can display a full 1920*1080 image, but just can't get it to work with my desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help as its driving me crazy lol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers Martin</p>

            <p><span>Hi Martin,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From the issue description I understand that you have issues with using Sony Bravia TV as monitor on Windows 7 computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>-What is the model number of the Sony Bravia?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You need to change the screen resolution settings in Windows.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-resolution</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Most HDTV sets use the 16:9 widescreen format, so you'll want to choose a screen resolution where the shape of the picture matches the wide format of your HDTV.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: If your computer's video card has been designed to work well with HDTV, it might come with its own software for setting screen resolution to match the 16:9 format.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can try is updating display drivers on the computer and check if it helps.</span><span><br />

<p>I'm thinking its to do with a driver needing updated.&nbsp; I installed Windows 7 onto my laptop just to check it wasn't an OS problem, and it worked fine.&nbsp; So installed slim driver onto my desktop just to update the drivers and it did need a graphics card driver
 update.&nbsp; But every time I try to install the driver it comes up with an error message "incomplete build".</p>

<p>ok so my xbox never froze b4 at all until this one day I ran into this kid online on gta.. and he said he was gonna make me xbox freeze n all this.. of course I didn't believe him because I thought xbox was better than that and would b able to prevent ppl
 from doing such a thing but I guess not? so anyway he did make it freeze and I reported him cause that's what xbox told me to do.. and that did nothing.. not surprised.. all he did was change his gamertag and he found me again later and kept following me around
 n making my xbox freeze so im guessing hes some kind of hacker? and now all the sudden my xbox freezes all the time? why?</p>

<h2>            &#91;Solved&#93; Problem with Desktop &#47; Explorer icons after uninstalling an unrelated driver</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>today I had to uninstall a third party driver (game controller) due to a problem it was causing and had to restart so the effects could take place. I got a short blue screen crash that was collecting information and afterwards windows proceeded to boot up
 as normal. But as I got to the desktop I noticed some icons looking wrong and started googling.
</p>
<p>(The icons):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b433789b-9fbe-45d0-bf5c-d5a0136e97ff?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b433789b-9fbe-45d0-bf5c-d5a0136e97ff?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><br />
(Icons not loading in explorer):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d151b805-3501-48b3-a352-791bdf1ad95a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d151b805-3501-48b3-a352-791bdf1ad95a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On google I found the suggestion to rebuild the icon cache (which didnt help) and while Im writing this I currently run sfc /scannow.<br />
<br />
So my questions are why did this happen? (Maybe a driver or something in the registry got deleted when I uninstalled the driver?) And (if sfc /scannow didnt fix it already) How can I fix this now? And what can I learn for the future?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks alot for reading and I hope you guys know more than I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: sfc /scannow finished and the same thing occurs :(.</p>
<p>Edit 2: By also cleaning up the thumbnail cache the folder icon started to work properly again. Black Square on .OTF file still remains.</p>
<p>Edit 3: It seems like the black squares only affected 2 corrupted .otf files on my desktop and new files work properly again.</p>

<p><span>Hi Synthic,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might be due to user profile corruption or the driver not uninstalled completely.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>How was the driver installed on the PC?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>As clearing the thumbnail cache helped you to some extent, let us now update the display drivers and check if that makes any difference.

<p>Sadly it didnt help to switch the user. So its probably something driver-related.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im not sure if it helps you but the drivers were installed / uninstalled with the .bat files below and a folder that contains the drivers .cat .inf .sys and .dll files and a devcon.exe application.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Free Up Storage OnHP Stream 11 Running Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have and HP Stream 11 laptop running Windows 10 that will NOT free up storage. I have uninstalled everything that is not needed for the computer to run, and I have maybe 1 picture and about 3 small documents. I have tried to delete my temporary files (which
 is&nbsp;5.71 Gigabytes of space), but it won't delete the temporary files. I only have 28.2 Gigabytes of usable storage and&nbsp;19.91 of those 28.2&nbsp;Gigabytes are used up by the temporary files and the system. Would a factory reset help the problem? I have no important
 data on my laptop. My only worry is that the factory reset would erase the important programs, but I am probably wrong about that. If you know what to do, I'm all ears. Thanks.</p>

<p>Eu não achei por onde iniciar o fun labs também não. Tem a propaganda mas ela não cai na tela de acesso ao aplicativo.</p>
<p>Ontém tive que ir na opção de download e lá tinha a opção "iniciar agora". Foi o único jeito que achei de acessar.</p>
<p>Precisam corrigir isso.</p>

<h2>            Brightness settings work backwards</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Using windows 7 64bit on a dell XPS m1330 laptop. &nbsp;New behaviour as of this AM:</p>
<p>When my power cord is plugged in my screen is dim no matter what controls or menus I use to increase it. &nbsp;iI have checked the power plans I use and have checked my drivers, no luck.</p>
<p>When I pull the cord from my laptop the screen comes to full brightness! &nbsp;The only thing I can think of is that the slew of updates that hit this weekend did something.</p>
<p>Ideas anyone?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p>Mike,</p>
<p>Review the various brightness settings in Power Management and in BIOS. Check out the guide here for Dell XPS m1330:</p>

<p>1- Type <strong>power</strong>&nbsp;into your Start menu, then choose Power Options from the list.</p>
<p>2- Choose <em>Change Plan Settings</em>&nbsp;next to whatever power plan is currently selected.</p>
<p>3- You'll see two sliders for brightness: one for use when plugged in, and the other for battery usage. Adjust to your liking, then click<strong>Save Changes</strong>&nbsp;(if you just close the window, your changes will not be saved).</p>
