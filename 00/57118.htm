<p>Downloaded the demo from the Japanese marketplace, and wow, the game is pretty damn good. Good thing I did, because I never heard of it before and after searching it on Amazon it has a western release, which I'll definitely be purchasing to play the full
 game.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The cutscenes look cinematic and beautiful.</p>

<p>Better late than never. I've also found Wii gems that I never heard of. Such great fantastic games without much feedback from the western fanbase.</p>

<p>Yeah I struggled to find a PAL copy and ended up with the Games on Demand version. It's on Shopto for 360 and PS3 for £12.85 which I've since bought just to have a hard copy for both consoles. Fantastic game!</p>

    <title>Win 10 fonts jagged and thin - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Win 10 fonts jagged and thin</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone. I have this problem that i seriously have never heard about/seen before. I can't seem to find someone with the exact same problem aswell. The thing is; suddently som day while doing what i always do on my computer (play games, facebook or
 just being on Microsoft edge etc.), my fonts got edgy and thin, and had more space between them. This looks extremely ugly and is also very annoying sometimes. At that time i thought it was just some temporary glitch in Microsoft edge. So i restarted my computer,
 but it was still there. There i didn't really know what to do, so i kinda just ignored it (actually, the font looks like a halloween font, so i thought that might just be Microsoft messing with us). Now, i realized its not only in Microsoft edge, its also
 in other programs (internet explorer and steam etc.).</p>
<p>So now i decided to make a post about it. I hope you can help and here is some screenshots;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is steam; you can see how much space there is between some of the letters (which is not supposed to be like that in Danish either):

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10. </span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue might occur due to some problem with the display drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In order to assist you better, I would like to know the following query:</span></span></p>
<p><span>Does the issue occur only in Edge?</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue might occur due some problem with display drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to update display drivers and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Let us try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Update
<strong><span>Display Adapter.</span></strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><span>Windows key + X</span></strong> and click on

<strong><span>Update Driver Software</span></strong>.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If issue persist, I suggest you to try
<strong>method 2</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span><span>Download and Install the latest graphic drivers in
<strong>compatibility mode.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Right-click on the <strong>
driver setup file</strong> and click on <strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on the <strong>‘compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box
<strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

 sections in "settings," but there doesn't seem to be any solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have any possible solutions, please advise.&nbsp; Thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gerry

            Well, my fonts are suddently normal again, i have no idea what i did, but i forgot all about this post, probably because my fonts just turned normal and didn't annoy me anymore. One thing i remember i did (but can't remember if that fixed it) was to update
 windows. Just search for updates on windows update and try to update your computer :D

            <p>Hi ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got this problem myself in January 2017</p>
<p>The fonts are thin and scrawny. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I have tried so far:</p>
<p>Reinstalled driver</p>
<p>Went through the Clear Type settings procedure</p>
<p>Tried various setting in my screen menu</p>
<p>Tried a lot in Color Management in the properties for the screen card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Radeon 6670 and two screens.</p>
<p>The Dell screen works fine, but the Samsung screen is very ugly text wise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea, anybody?</p>

<p>I had the same problem after messing with some settings. Solved it by going to advanced system settings/performance/settings, and then selected 'Let Windows choose what's best for my computer'.</p>
<p>After a restart, it was back to normal.</p>

<h2>            Screen keeps going dark</h2>
                    My computer automatically installed updates about three or four days ago, and not the screen goes dark every couple minutes.&nbsp; I have changed the battery settings, reset the defaults, set them to maximum brightness and deactivated the dim the display after
 so many minutes and turn off display after so many minutes options.&nbsp; I have restarted the computer, but nothing helps.&nbsp; The screen does not go completely black- I can still faintly see what is on the screen, like the brightness is turned all the way down-
 but its not.&nbsp; I have tried to adjust the brightness when it does black by using the Function key, but it thinks that its all the way up.&nbsp; I have to close the lid and re-open it to get the screen to come back to full brightness.&nbsp; Someone help me please!&nbsp; I
 have tried to uninstall the updates, but it did not fix the problem.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I am using Windows 7 Home Premium. The most recent set of Windows 7 updates&nbsp; that were installed before the problem was KB971033.

<br />
In my case, disabling/enabling the video card in Device Manager did the trick, though if that doesn't work for you, be sure to make the recommended BIOS change, too (that alone had no effect here).

            <p>I am not using Microsoft Office.&nbsp; I simply go to my Pictures folder, find the clip art I want, click on it, a window comes up and I choose Print, another menu comes up with choices for printing. it only allows me to print one image on one piece of paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I had Windows 10, there was a program called Photo Printing Wizard and was already installed on my Windows 7.&nbsp; It was wonderful, and was eliminated when Windows 10 arrived.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Wizard program allowed me to put multiple images on one sheet of paper and had many choices for size and quantity. Also allowed me to reverse the print.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where did it go and how can I get it back??</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is a Dell Intel Inspiron, about 4 yrs. old and has plenty of space, works great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer is an Epson Artison 810 and works just fine.</p>

<h3> chrisrowley1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Numbers</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>For many years I have been using an Unlimted World Subscription which has two Skype Numbers attached as part of the package. When I was advised that this subscription would no longer be offered from 15 December I immediately signed up for Australia Unlimited
 Mobiles and Landlines, and then cancelled the Unlimited World subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: are my current numbers automatically linked to the new subscription? If not, why not? If not, what are the costs for those additional numbers and services such as Skype to Go, Call Messaging etc? I do not want to lose the number I have had
 for the past ten years in the change over to a new subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please.</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/169dfb0d-30f4-40b2-9909-bcf20da25853" title="ChrisRowley1">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>are my current numbers automatically linked to the new subscription? If not, why not?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>A: </em></strong><em>No. Technically, your Skype Number is part of the subscription package. Thus, it will also expire when your Unlimited World subscription expires.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>what are the costs for those additional numbers and services such as Skype to Go, Call Messaging etc? I do not want to lose the number I have had for the past ten years in the change over to a new subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>A:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>You will still&nbsp;</em><em>have the option to reactivate the Skype Number once it expires (there is a 90 days reservation). You will also see the costs/amount of your Skype Numbers on the process of reactivation as it depends
 on the validity that you choose.</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the numbers are linked to the subscription package does that mean that the new package automatically comes with a number (and that I can transfer it across from the previous package)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that mean that I can't do anything (transfer numbers, determine costs etc) until the Unlimited World subscription package concludes on 4 January?</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>If the numbers are linked to the subscription package does that mean that the new package automatically comes with a number (and that I can transfer it across from the previous package)?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Your Skype Number is part of the Unlimited World subscription package you have on your account. The Australia Unlimited subscription you purchase is not a package, therefore it does not include a Skype Number.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Does that mean that I can't do anything (transfer numbers, determine costs etc) until the Unlimited World subscription package concludes on 4 January?</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your prompt replies which are helpful in trying to understand the situation. Are you suggesting however that under the new arrangements that Skype can sell you a subscription without a number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I was new to Skype would I need to sign up for a subscription and then a number? Doesn't it make more sense to have a subscription with a number, so you can sue the service straight away and also give people your number to call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this stage I guess I will see what happens on 4 January when I try and sort out the number and bring it across to the new "subscription".</p>

<p>Calling subscription and Skype Number are different, they are just sometimes offered as a package plan. But since the subscription plan with Skype Number included will no longer be offered, users will really need to purchase a subscription and a Skype Number
 to be able to make and receive calls from/to mobiles/landlines.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I understand your answer, but I don't understand why subscriptions do not include a number. If I subscribe and do not have a&nbsp;number, how do I make calls and how do people contact me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Skype for many years with the Unlimited World Package and have been happy with the service. I will give the new approach a year and see if it measures up. Not sure how it will go if everything is an add on - take a subscription + add in a number
 + add in call forwarding etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We understand how important this is for you. As much as we would like to help you keep the subscription package, we do not have a control to it. As Skype can change a&nbsp;product and price anytime, depending on the demand.

<h2>            Windows 7 will not read data on my usb flash drive</h2>
                    I have a Lexar usb flash drive that I saved and backed up information from my XP system.&nbsp; Windows 7 recognizes the flash drive and installed driver and software according to the icons in the right lower corner.&nbsp; It is listed in the device manager as working
 properly.&nbsp; It eventually shows up when I open computer, but shows no data on the drive.&nbsp; It works in my laptop which has Vista.&nbsp; I tried it in another port and had the same problem.&nbsp; I have a keyboard, mouse and printer all plugged in the back in usb ports
 and they work fine.&nbsp; I have two ports in the front and am trying to use them for the flash drive.&nbsp; At this point what can I do?&nbsp;

            After loading the program, I went to the properties. &nbsp;One way to get there is to right click on the Quickbooks icon and click "properties' at the bottom. &nbsp; There is a tab labeled Compatibility, with a block for 'Compatibility Mode', with a checkbox that
 when you select it activates a drop down list with various programs modes you can run in. &nbsp;I chose Windows XP (Service Pack 3).
<div><br />
<div>Each time you start Quickbooks you will get a pop-up box asking for permission to proceed you have to agree to. &nbsp;Hope this helps!</div>

            Wanted to update that I did find a work-around, by running the program in compatibility mode. &nbsp;I understand the no support factor and eventually will get a new version, but until I can afford another software upgrade this will work.
<div><br />
<div>Just thought this info might help if anyone else wanted to know a work-around.</div>

<p>
</p><p>I've read that article before I posted my question to the community. I thought it&nbsp;only works if you transfer old XP to the newer windows 7 , 8 and 10 but, does it work&nbsp;when transferring files from
to a <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">new PC windows 10?</span></strong></p>

    <title>USB connection delays - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> warwick b  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB connection delays</h2>
                    Since some Windows 7 updates in May, my USB connections have taken a while to start up when plugged in (e.g. flash drive) or operated (e.g. printer). The delay isn't long (about 20 seconds) and after the first operation, I get instant access again. It
 just happens the first time I use a USB port after starting Windows. I'm wondering if this is a security measure that a recent Win 7 update has installed, or is it a bug that can be eradicated? My system is Win7 Pro 32-bit SP1.

<p><b><span>I located your original post…</span></b>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It appears that you are having difficulty with Windows Update, and an option device driver update. The error code
<b>0x800F020b</b> indicates that the “<i>device instance does not exist”</i>. This suggests that this optional device driver update does not necessarily apply to your system – as I assume your wireless internet is fully functional.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend that in this particular instance, given the error code, that you hide this update. Should you need to update this particular
 device driver in the future you can visit your computer manufactures website for drivers specific to your system. Or you can visit this device manufactures website as they as well have drivers available for download.</span></p>

<h2>            Upgraded U410 TO Windows 8 But Its Not Using SSD</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have upgraded my Lenovo U410 from Windows 7 to Windows 8.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've noticed that boot times and the general speed of the OS although very good, is nowhere near as good as my old W7. This is largely due to the fact that before I upgraded, my W7 was running on the SSD but this upgrade to W8 is on the HDD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IS there anyway to redo the whole process and make Windows 8 run on the SSD to make it faster??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Satheesh</p>

            <p>I suspect that the game has Digital Rights Management in it (i.e., copy protection) and that it is checking to make sure you physically have the disk so that it knows you're not a thief.&nbsp; Many game providers assume you are a thief and make you prove you
 are not by requiring that the disk be in the DVD drive when the game runs.&nbsp; What I do is to use a program like Alcohol 52%, a free program that can make a copy of a DVD/CD and include the copy protection in the image so that you can use a virtual DVD drive
 to mount the image file instead of having the real DVD mounted in a real drive.</p>

Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own this product since March 2018 and never had a problem with it. Yesterday, it stopped working, so I thought I had to replace the batteries. Today I bought new ones and, after a minute of innactivity, the keyboard doesn't respond. I tried to connect
 it to another computer, same story. No problem with numeric keyboard or mouse, I don't think there is any problem with the receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I extract the batteries and insert them again, it works again if I am actively using it. As I say, if I leave it for 60 seconds or so, keyboard stops working and the only way to make it work again is to switch the batteries position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All the best,</p>
<p />

            Another option you could try is a repair upgrade to see if it resolves what might be causing this.
