<h2>            Error in res&#58;&#47;&#47;ieframe.dll&#47;imageppg.ppg  in IE9 when trying to view image properties</h2>
                    <p>in this site <a href="http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/home</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I right-click to view properties of an image (example, the site's logo)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll get this error message "Object doesn't support this property or method"</p>
<p>Line 16&nbsp; res://ieframe.dll/imageppg.ppg</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT, this only happens in IE9 standards mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I toggle compatibility mode or switch to IE8 standard mode, the image properties dialog box opens up without no errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a bug in IE9's scripting engine? Why does it work in IE8/IE7 mode?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And why has the image properties dialog box got to do with javascript?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will this be fixed in IE10?</p>

    <title>Installing Office 365 Home Premium on family members computer. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installing Office 365 Home Premium on family members computer.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Account question:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just purchased Office 365.&nbsp; Intent was to install on a desktop, a laptop, one Surface Pro&nbsp;and two phones. The marketing seems to imply one subscription could be shared by a household, i.e 5 installs on PCs' + 5 mobile devices. The problem is they all have
 to use the same account. Not too bad for the PC's but the mobile devices have to look at the same Skydrive folder. Unless I am missing something this greatly reduces the value to me. Would appreciate if someone can set me straight.</p>
<p>What I am considering is creating a new account that we can share. &nbsp;The license is supposed to be transferrable but they don't explain how. If I could de-activate the installations I have and re-install under new account I could live with that.&nbsp;Any idea
 how I accomplish this?</p>

            Thanks for your response. I guess I did not explain my problem in enough detail. I understand how this can work on PCs,&nbsp;my issue is with mobile. When I installed and activated it on my phone I had no choice but to use my wife's credentials as that is what
 we used originally to activate Office 365. As far as I can see there is no way to now use Office 365 on my phone without&nbsp;using her sky drive. This is why&nbsp;I am thinking I need to re-do the whole thing with an account we can share.

            <p>Thanks, this kind of works. After resetting it seemed to let me sign in with my&nbsp;microsoft account.&nbsp; The issue now is I cannot "add a place". Before when I tapped OPEN on the action bar my wife's skydrive account showed up. Now a box appears and says "We
 encountered a problem and couldn't complete the task"&nbsp; hit the OK in this box and all there is on top is a + with Add a Place. I cannot select the + to add a a place.
</p>
<p>Makes it kind of hard if now impossible to access my skydrive files. It still seems like the only skydrive account that can be accessed is the one tied to the license holder.

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I had been using Bing Rewards program since it started.</p>
<p>I have not violated any of the "listed" ways to violate Terms of Use. Of course, they have unlisted reasons for immediately closing accounts.</p>
<p>That is the issue. The people replying to my email requests won't tell me specifically how I violated the ToU.</p>
<p>Now they say it is because "account was closed due to security and confidentiality restrictions".
</p>
<p>Yet, they still won't provide me the requested violation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is that all about? If they can establish that I knowingly, somehow, violated the ToU, then I will take the hit. I don't need the reward points, they were just a bonus.
</p>
<p>However, if this is an indicator of how Microsoft Support Services&nbsp;are going to behave in future, I may have to rethink which company I use.</p>

                    I purchase the HTC surround, only to find that it wasnt everything i wanted it to be. I was considering exchanging this phone but many of my friends convinced me not to change it. I was looking for somthing that was more in the Android world. I would really
 like to have a custom background, not just black or white and i would love to be able to have a customizable ringtone on this phone. I like the phone all around i just wish we could customize the phone to are liking. :) Does anybody else have these same feelings?

Yes, your two observations for missing features are already known to Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp; We (fellow WP7 enthusiasts) are hoping these features and functions are added via future software Updates.

    <title>Cannot sync Outlook Calendar w&#47; Moto Q9c but can sync music - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> citizen josh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot sync Outlook Calendar w&#47; Moto Q9c but can sync music</h2>
                    I am nonplussed. <br />
Everything was working fine yesterday and then I notice that the calendar on my Moto Q9c is empty. The only error I get is "<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/330461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">0x80004005</a>".<br />
I tried re-establishing the partnership via the Sync Center, but when I "Set up" a partnership, Windows Media Player takes the partnership. It tries to sync music on my computer. It appears (to this novice) that the phone fills with mp3 files and doesn't have
 the memory to complete the rest of the syncopation.<br />
<br />
As I kept toying with it, one of the sync errors told me to download dpcdll.dll but I don't know where to put the file. Is this even necessary?<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't even care about syncing music. I just want my calendar and contacts to sync. How do I solve this?<br />
How do I stop Windows Media from putting songs on my phone? When I end the partnership with it then my phone has no partnership.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, I am using Visa SP1, Windows Mobile 6 standard, Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1<br />

This problem may occur if a file that the Windows Product Activation (WPA) requires is damaged or missing. This behavior occurs if one or both of the following conditions are true:
<ul>
<li>A third-party backup utility or an antivirus program interferes with the installation of Windows XP.
</li><li>A file that WPA requires is manually modified. </li></ul>

    <title>How to remove the old Hotmail Groups&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikki.lk  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove the old Hotmail Groups&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So many, many years ago, my friends created a group on the old Hotmail and added me in it - it was basically a social group where we had threads, shared pictures, and all that other stuff. I've been using my Live Calendar and I see that the group has its
 own calendar. I was wondering if I could remove myself from the group? For the record, I do not see the group in my contacts list. I only see the group in my calendar (it won't remove itself even when I don't tick the box in "Show Calendar") and if I begin

<p>
</p><p><span>Then, in which part did you find the amount of PST files changed? When uploading the files by using</span>&nbsp;network upload to import PST files to Office 365 or &nbsp;drive shipping to import PST files to Office 365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will send you a private message to collect the command. Please also share some screenshots to describe the issue for me to better understand. Thanks for your time.</p>

    <title>Removing word from custom dictionary Windows Phone 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dymaxion.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing word from custom dictionary Windows Phone 8</h2>
                    <p>I accidentally clicked + in the keyboard prediction / correction bar.</p>
<p>I wish to remove this. </p>

<p>Now every time i type "goto the concert"</p>
<p>from the moment I type "goto the conc"</p>
<p>it tries to correct to "goto the concrt"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>very frustrating!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to reset my entire custom dictionary as has been suggested previously.</p>
<p>i suspect that resetting the typing predictions is even more wide reaching, and will actually reset the word prediction data also.</p>
<p>which is probably even worse!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not possible then it must be logged as a feature request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. Why does the letter "i" in English not get auto-corrected in the middle of a sentence to "I"? This is poor!!!</p>

<h2>            Discharged while charging and never charged anymore</h2>
                    <p>I got a BLU Win JR LTE while in United States in April 2015. Recently, I was out of home for long and my battery went dead. I needed to get some information off it urgently so I tried to use another similar charger to charge it but it never charged anymore.
 Got home and used its charger but it's remained blank and off since then. Unfortunately, the battery is in-built so there is not much I can do now. I have tried leaving it to charge with its charger but it's not just coming on anymore. It's not charging anymore.
 I need help to know what to do and if anyone has had a similar experience, how was it resolved? I'm back to my home country, Nigeria but will go back to the States next month.</p>
<p>

            I asked the question but now have an answer. If it works for u please let me know it helped. Now charge with its charger for at least 8 hours. Then press and hold the power button until it turns on. It should work fine. I accidentally did this. I was just
 frustrated and just left my finger on the power button and guess what? It just came on. Even if it doesn't light while charging never mind. Once 8 hours elapses just press and hold that power button. Let us know if it works for you

            I concur, that is agree with you, when you do press the power button it does seem to force the firmware to reset and power cycle it. I've observed the battery life is better than some similar specced Android phones that I have however, the charging cycle
 is too long sometimes (over eight hours) and also there is no way to calibrate the battery unless you download third party apps. Just my two cents. Thanks for posting!

    <title>Microsoft Edge disappeared off task bar - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge disappeared off task bar</h2>
                    <p>I noticed this week that the edge icon has disappeared off the taskbar. I can search through the 'ask me anything box' and access the internet fine but if I then open another program such as word or photoshop I cannot get back to the internet page unless
 I search for something else and up comes the page with my previous search in it. This was particularly annoying when I first noticed this problem as there was a you tube video playing and I clicked on something else, the youtube video continued playing in
 the background but it was not on the screen and I couldn't get to it. I have spent nearly two hours this afternoon trolling through various forums trying to find an answer but nothing has worked, I can't find the edge program on my computer in order to create
 a shortcut in the taskbar. Oh and the start tiles menu disappeared at the same time with all my live tiles on that have taken me ages to gather together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone help?</p>

<h2>            External user conflict</h2>
                    
<p>hi</p>
<p>i sent a sharing invitation to an external user. when that user received the invite, they accepted
<strong>while they were logged into microsoft account as another user. </strong>so the username in admin / sharing on 365 is the wrong user.
</p>
<p>i have deleted that unwanted user from admin panel. now i want to share the sharepoint site with the correct user again. but when i try to invite the user, the 365 system "finds" the old user. i cant completely remove the old user from the system, and i
 cant invite the user again with the correct email.</p>
<p>in this image you can see the old username is found, when typing the email address i want to add. the email address blacked out is correct, but the username is wrong.</p>

<p>hi dave,</p>
<p>if we share a site/library with an external user, and he logs in with his microsoft account successfully, office 365 will add a record in
<strong>user profile</strong>.<br />
could you go to sharepoint admin center and delete the user profile linked to the old user, then check it again?<br />
(office 365 admin center &gt; admin &gt; sharepoint &gt; user profile &gt; manage user profiles &gt; type the external user's name &gt; delete.)</p>

<p>Thanks for the info.</p>
<p>I have tried that. I searched for first name, middle name, last name and parts of the name, and for that user, no records were found. So nothing to delete.</p>
<p>Any other user I search for returns a result.</p>

<p>hi dave,</p>
<p>for this issue,&nbsp;could you share more information with us?</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>. more details about "<strong>they were&nbsp;logged into microsoft account as another user. so the username in admin / sharing on 365 is the wrong user.</strong> ".&nbsp; does this mean the external user's display name is usera, but after he accepted
 the invitation and logged in successfully, the display name shows in office 365 admin center &gt; users &gt; active users is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> usera?</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>. have you also tried searching the old user by tying his email address in user profile? what is the result?</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. if you can find his user profile in step 2, could you change his display name in user profile? (select edit my profile and change the name property)</p>

<p>Hi James</p>
<p>No I cant find it under email address either. The user was in the 365 admin &gt; active users list before, but I deleted it from there.</p>
<p>The problem is a issue with the invite system and Microsoft accounts. If you invite a user to your site, lets say *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, an email is sent to this address. The problem is that invite is NOT specific to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. So if Tom clicks on the invite link
 and then signs in with a Microsoft account to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, then he is added as a user to sharepoint / 365 UNDER THE WRONG NAME.</p>
<p>Its worse than that I think, because Tom can forward the invite email to a friend, or be 'hacked' and the email can find its way into other hands. So someone called *** Email address is removed for privacy *** can get into the system as a user.</p>
<p>In my case, Tom did not realize that someone was logged in in IE to a different account (Hotmail account) on a shared PC. So he accepted the invite, and now a user we don't know had access to the sharepoint site.
</p>
<p>So I have deleted it as I explained. But when I try to add Tom again, it only pops up with the incorrect user, and I cant add Tom.</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try running the following command in SharePoint Online Management Shell Windows PowerShell to remove the external user and then check the outcome.</p>
<p>1.Remove the user from SharePoint Online.</p>
<p>$user = Get-SPOExternalUser -Filter *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Remove-SPOExternalUser -UniqueIDs @($user.UniqueId)</p>
<p>For the details, please refer to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj730437.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>2.Run the following command to check if the external user would display.</p>
<p>Get-SPOUser -Site <a href="https://contoso.sharepoint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the user name still displays, you can run the folloiwng command to remove it. Please check the user's
<b>LoginName</b> in the result and replace the example in the following command. If it fails to run, check the command and run it again.</p>
<p>Remove-SPOUser -Site <a href="https://contoso.sharepoint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>someone_example.com#ext#@contoso.onmicrosoft.com</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install SharePoint Online Management Shell Windows PowerShell, please refer to</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please get back to us if you need any further assistance.</p>

            <p>I've also tried in both Edge and Chrome. Problem persists. Really annoying because if I click 'view' or 'download' the same problem happens. I want to click download and actually have it download not open up a blank window and do nothing. Can we get that
 fixed? I understand microsoft probably wants people to use the onedrive but it is really annoying to have to do 3-4 steps just to get the document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'download' problem happens with all file types, jpgs won't 'view' either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we get a solution soon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use this outlook for business and now since the change away from the old hotmail interface I amtrying to figure out how to migrate to gmail. Please save me from going through the trouble.<br />

            <p>This issue happens with all senders. My business partner forwards me emails from gmail and it doesn't work, and our distributor just sent me an email with a jpeg in the message and it didn't even show up in my browser.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm able to access the images via my cell phones outlook but not on my work computer or my computer at home. Appears to be all windows 10 devices don't allow me to access these jpegs, and the lightboxes don't actually load images.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says Outlook Mail in the top corner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll see if I can find the private message I sent and follow up to you with it, have more hands on deck. A timely resolution would be excellent, I'm obviously not the only person having this issue.&nbsp;</p>

            Excel Online (which is different from Excel desktop part of Office) can only open files from a cloud source (default is OneDrive or alternatively DropBox etc). You would need to move any "external files" (i.e. files stored somewhere on your computer) to OneDrive.etc first.

            I tried to do this, however every time I try to move a file to one drive I get a message that says office 10 is not working, however I can see it is open. Doing the research I get a bunch of suggestions from Sharepoint, Dropbox, (which I just tried).&nbsp;
 Before I downloaded office to one drive I used the version at the public library which perfect results.&nbsp; I would not have downloaded this product if I knew this was going to be such a hassell. FYI I am computer literate, however this has me stumped.&nbsp;

            Re: Confused about what you mean by "Before I downloaded office to one drive I used the version at the public library which perfect results." - specifically in reference to "downloaded office to onedrive".
<br />
<br />Office would not install itself to OneDrive - it would install to your "C:" drive.
<br />
<br />Something is not making sense with this description. If Office was installed, would suggest removing Office via the Office fixit tool as described in (just to eliminate as many extraneous issues as possible as quickly as possible)
<br />
<br />Uninstall Office 2013, Office 2016, or Office 365 from a PC
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2013-Office-2016-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />Once that's done, login into your MS Office account and download/install Office again (this assumes you purchased a subscription vs a perpetual license - otherwise rerun the setup program).

            Hi Franks, the issue you might be having is that Excel online only supports a subset of Office 2016 functionality.
<br />
<br />If your File(s) contain any of this functionality, your file will not open online
<br />
<br />For a list of the differences between the two versions, please see the web page below . . .

    <title>Microsoft Office 365 deactivating itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gardinermeredith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office 365 deactivating itself</h2>
                    I have this problem every now and then - maybe once a month or every two months - that I am required to "reactivate" my office 365 university edition and I'm not sure why. The product key doesn't work in this instance. I am using a mac. I can sign into
 microsoft ID and this usually works, but this requires an internet connection. If I don't have an internet connection it means I can't use office. I'm really frustrated by this and would like a new product key that works, but can't find contact details to
 contact Microsoft directly. Apologies for posting this on a forum.&nbsp;

            Because you can reactivate means you License Key is legit.<br />
<br />
This is an issue I talked about both on MS Forums and Adobe forums.<br />
If you don't have a reliable connection or poor connection you will run into this.<br />
<br />
My only suggestion is take take down the date. When you have to sign in. Then starting on 28th day after it last signed in,&nbsp; have Computer hooked up to the Internet, at least once a day. Repeat until the 32nd day. The phone home signal should detected. If you
 can't get timed just right you'll just have deal with signing in once a month.<br />

<h2>            Online Properties of files in Sharepoint Online not copied over when copying to another document library</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some advice on copying files from a document library to another document library.</p>
<p>Currently I'm trying to copy some files from a document library (lets say library A) to another document library (library B)</p>
<p>These files contain the extra online properties that was added on library A (shown on the columns). These columns or properties contains of different types (e.g. Choice, Text, Time, etc.)</p>
<p>I could copied the files over the library B, but the contents of these properties will be blank ...</p>
<p>Which resulted in loss of data ... and someone had to re-enter those data in.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96348a17-a3a2-419c-8a06-04913c783af1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96348a17-a3a2-419c-8a06-04913c783af1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I had ensure that all the setup or configuration are the same between this two libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting on our forum, I will try my best to help you.</p>
<p>First, I need to confirm if you try the following steps to copy files:</p>
<p>1. Select the files which you want to copy.</p>
<p>2. Click Copy to&gt;select the library which you want to copy to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, I have done the test, I could copy the property of files to another library.</p>
<p>But we need to create the same column on the library including the column name and column settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have created the same columns on two libraries, please provide the following information for further analysis:</p>
<p>1. Check if another browser also meet the issue.</p>
<p>2. Copy the files to a new library to check the result.</p>
<p>3. Create two simple libraries and simple columns to check the result.</p>
<p>4. The screenshot of two librariesâ€™ view as below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee767f31-9f85-4065-8b87-d88e84afdaef?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee767f31-9f85-4065-8b87-d88e84afdaef?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Qing,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was the intention.</p>
<p>After reading your post, I tried creating 2 dummy document libraries to test this as well.</p>
<p>It is as what you had mentioned, it does works...</p>
<p>However I am not getting the same results from the actual site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are however 2 differences between this 2 sites.</p>
<p>1) the number of columns</p>
<p>2) there are some unused columns in the library A which are not created in library B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will work on these and update here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Alex Ang</p>

<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Based on my test, if the columns which are not used on library A will not affect copying feature.</p>

<p>Hi Qing,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your suggestion, I encounter the issue when using another browser as well.</p>
<p>In fact I had tried on Chrome, IE, Edge and Firefox, but all produces the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created another document Library, lets call it Library C.<br />
I got all the columns setup as well.<br />
Ok. Here is the fun part.<br />
When i copied a file from Library B to Library C, the contents of all the columns are copied over!</p>
<p>But if i copy a file from Library A to Library C, the results is the same as when copying from Library A to B</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried the following:</p>
<p>1) copy a file from Library A to B. edit the contents of the columns in library B.</p>
<p>2) copy the same file from Library B to C - Results ok.</p>
<p>3) Copy the same file from Library C to A - Results: OK!</p>
<p>4) Copy the same file from Library B to A - Results: OK!</p>
<p>5) Edit column content the same file in Library A and then copy to Library B - Results: contents are not updated ...</p>
<p>6) Copy the same edited file from Library A to Library C - Results: contents are not updated as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ... i concluded there is some issues with Library A ...</p>
<p>I&nbsp; just don't know what is wrong with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear that we have narrowed down the issue is related to the special library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further analysis, I want to confirm how did you create the library, did you use Flow or Workflow?</p>
<p>Besides, I also want to collect the screenshot of the libraryâ€™s view.</p>

<p>Hi Qing,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about the late reply.</p>
<p>I was busy for the past few days.</p>
<p>Attached the current view for Library A (the one which has the issue)</p>
<p>Library B and C have the same view as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for flows and workflows, no there are no flows and workflows in these libraries at the moment but we do intend to implement them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is however 1 minor difference between Library A and Library B/ C.</p>
<p>The files for Library A were in a sub sub folder of the root folder in the library (e.g. shared document\folder A\folder B) while B and C were at the root.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to created a file at the root folder in Library A and copied over to B and C but the issue persisted. thus i do not think it is the cause of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had attached the library settings (columns) for Library A and B as well</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>According to the situation, I suggest you create a new library and move the documents of Library A to the new library, then adding the properties of files to the new library.</p>
<p>You can use the new library to replace Library A, as the issue only occurs on Library A, the issue may be related to Library A.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still need help, you can try returning to classic experience, then copy the files to check the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you try the followings to check if there is any improvement:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click OneDrive icon and select Preferences, under Account
 tab, stop sync all folders, then unlink this Mac and quit OneDrive.</span></li><li><span>Remove the synced folders from your Mac and empty trash.</span></li><li><span>Sign out of your Mac and sign in again, then add your account to OneDrive to check if the error exists.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I would like to confirm some information for troubleshooting:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does the error appear right after you add your account
 to OneDrive or after some other steps? Please share the detailed steps you perform before it prompts the error.</span></li><li><span>What about change a different destination folder for your OneDrive for Business files?</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
Please make sure the file path isn't too long, since there is a limitation of OneDrive for Business stating that the entire path, including the file name, must contain fewer than 255 characters.</p>
<ol>

<p>Hi Joanne,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve completed the first three steps and can confirm this has no affect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubleshooting steps I've taken;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Sync client is downloaded and installed.</li><li>Username and password entered successfully.</li><li>At the point of choosing the destination location for the OneDrive folder, it allows me to select where I want.
<ol>
<li>I choose the default area and press next (which is below the 255 characters).</li><li>I have tried changing from the default location but this does not rectify the issue.</li></ol>
</li><li>Upon pressing next, I am presented with the error message; <strong>'Sorry, we can't add your "OneDrive - localfilename" folder at the moment. Please try again'</strong></li><li>The only option available now is for me to close the application.</li><li>The error occurs on all Macâ€™s within the company.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ian</p>

<p>If so, please go to <span style="font-weight: bold">
Office 365 admin center</span>&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold">Admin centers</span>&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold">OneDrive admin center</span>, check whether the option

    <title>Office2007 Compatibility with Windows10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidwhitmore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office2007 Compatibility with Windows10</h2>
                    <p>Is Office2007 Student fully compatible with Windows10? How about Office2003 Professional? Will I be able to use it to its fullest?<br />
<br />
Side note here: You don't list Windows 10 in the System ListBox;&nbsp; Why not? Since this message started originally from the Windows10 Upgrade/Reserve page specifically because I wanted to know if I was going to have to purchase a newer Office product, it seems
 unusual that you aren't listing your new Operating System; I had to list it as 'Unknown', which bothered me a bit. Also, in 'Office Topic', I selected 'Install, Upgrade, and Activate' even though I wanted to know if Office2007, and 2003, is fully compatible
 with your new Operating System. How about an item called 'Use Full Product'?</p>

            I checked the Compatibility on my laptop with Windows 10 for 2007 Office Home and Student. &nbsp;It did not mention any compatibility issues so I assume all of it will work. I am not positive about Excel though. &nbsp;

I still have my copy of Office 2003 Professional from back when I was still programming. Currently, I use 2007 Student &amp; Home Office with both Word and Excel. When I bought my Desktop and both of my Laptops, Windows8 was just coming out; but neither computer
 came with it installed. I would have had to then purchase the new Operating System at some future date. Didn't understand why it wasn't available for new retail computers back then.
<br />
I was just trying to find out whether or not I was going to have to spring for whatever the new version of Office will be once I could finally upgrade my computers. I can afford it, but I didn't want to be forced to; if you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
Heck, I still have one computer that still has WindowsXP in it; to upgrade the Operating System would require me to purchase other new software. Said software was $15K if my computer was upgraded to Windows7, and they don't have anything available for Windows8/8.1
 yet. This software controls a specialized sewing/embroidery machine, and I really don't want to have to spend all that money or that kind of money every couple of years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great day.</p>

            <p>David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth, I have been playing with the Preview version of Office 2016 and I have not found a single thing that would induce me to fork out to upgrade from my Office 2007.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know about the licensing of Student&nbsp;&amp; Home Editions of Office 2007 but&nbsp;my single&nbsp;retail Edition is licensed for both my Desktop and my Laptop as long as it is me using it on both.&nbsp; Later versions of Office have different licensing conditions; I
 would have to buy two Office 2013 or 2016 licences to cover both computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2007 will continue in its current Extended support phase [meaning security updates only, no functional updates] until Tuesday 10th October 2017.&nbsp; So I will be sticking with it until then.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that will persuade me to upgrade at that stage will be the knowledge that hackers start investigating vulnerabilities in out-of-support applications so I'd have the constant concern that I was leaving my systems wide open to infiltration &amp;
 disruption.</p>

<h2>            Internet explorer is not on the &#34;Windows Features&#34; list</h2>
                    <p>This is a dilemma of my own doing. So get past telling me how stupid I am :).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To save space on a really full drive, I deleted Internet Explorer thinking naively that I wouldn't need it. I obviously forgot about those years when the govt was chastising Microsoft for baking IE so deeply into the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway</p>
<ul>
<li>Inetnet Explorer is NOT in the windows features list, so I can't simply check the box and bring it back</li><li>Doing a REPAIR or a RESET does not re-install it (so far)</li></ul>
<p>The only downside I'm aware of to not having it is that no add-ons will work in MS Outlook. (Which gives me a "wrong browser version installed" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there any way to get it back?</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no download install files for IE11 in Windows 10</li><li>&nbsp;Install files for IE11 on Windows 8.1 will not run</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I'd prefer not to have to do a clean install, but I have a feeling that will be the first answer I'm given. Is there a registry edit that will initiate a reinstall on my next update? Anything other than a clean wipe and re-install?</p>
<p>

            Hi Illuman.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can try running System File Checker and DISM to see if either finds and fixes it:  See Step 10 Here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If not I'd run a Repair Install which reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files, programs and most settings in place,  by installing the Media Creation Tool, open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.  This will solve most problems and also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />To avoid space crunch problems next I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips here for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root including C:\$Windows.~BT.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

<h2>            Re-installing Office problems</h2>
                    I've just had a new hard drive in my computer so am having to reinstall all my programmes. I purchased Office 2010 a while ago and of course they don't give you a helpful disc any more, just a download. I've retrieved all the downloaded files but I need
 the product key. I was told this would have been emailed to me but I can't find it on any of my email accounts. I've gone onto the website, where it suggests I wouldn't be able to use the product key a second time anyway and should instead sign into the Microsoft
 account I used to purchase Office. Well, I tried that, I went through all the accounts I have and none of them were apparently associated with Office. So now I'm stuck. Any help would be appreciated, as I really don't want to have to repurchase Office!<br />

            Sorry, I'm not quite sure what you mean by the type of license. I bought Office 2010 from the Microsoft website. But I've tried what it suggests about signing into my account and each time it says the account is not associated with Office, so I don't know
 how I purchased it then. It was a student deal of some sort so maybe that makes difference. I got it via the Open University.

<p>There are several versions of Office 2010 (Home &amp; Student, Pro, Pro Plus etc) and a number of license types (retail, Keycard etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you install MS Office, without entering the Key, it will install as a trial version, and if you then start Word, then File&gt;Help in the activation heading it will state the actual Office version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you then have the physical proof of purchase, the receipt, you will be able to obtain a replacement Key from MS (NB no receipt, no replacement key)</p>

            <p>I've tried looking in my emails for an email containing the Product Key but I don't seem to have one. I've been searching for emails from Microsoft, unless it was sent from some other address?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was the Home and Student version I had. I did also note the Product Key in a document but unfortunately it was stored on an external hard drive which also had problems (I'm really not friends with technology at the moment) so I don't know if it can be
 retrieved. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But even if I can find the Product Key, it will presumably say that it's already been used. The only solution given for this problem in the article linked above is go into the MS account used for the purchase, which doesn't work, perhaps because as you say
 it was some time ago and so an MS account wouldn't have been used. Clearly I don't have a receipt for the purchase; I would have loved to have bought a proper disc in a shop and then I wouldn't be having this problem, but I was told that was terribly last
 year and everyone just deals in downloads now. <br />

            This site isn't letting me edit the above for some reason. I have in fact got the email from the Open University acknowledging the purchase of Office 2010, but this email doesn't contain a Product Key.

</p><p>When you purchase an on-line download, you save the download, before running it, then copy that download to external media, eg a cd, and write the key on that disk</p>
