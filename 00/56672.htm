<h2>            Warranty policies.</h2>
                    <p>What&nbsp;are Microsoft's policies regarding hardware failures? I have a 1TB Xbox One that has been lightly used for 4 months? I don't know where to turn, I bought it from Amazon and they have like a week's warranty unless you buy a limited warranty. I've had years of good luck with all of my electronics so I foolishly ignored paying a bit extra for some safety. Any thoughts, remedies, whatever. I'm having the flicker and fail problem.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 type cover wont connect. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terekworley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 type cover wont connect.</h2>
                    Inhale a brand new surface pro 3 and a brand new type cover. I cannot get the type cover to connect or work at all. I have tried every fix I found online, soft restart, hard restart, I have all current updates. I noticed in device manager that under keyboard
 is just a HID keyboard device, and no type cover. one fix I saw was to uninstall the type cover driver, but I don't have one in the list. so I'm assuming that is the problem. I would really like a fix, since I just spent $1000 for the two items and they don't
 work.

            <p>Some time ago I had a Wireless G USB and it served me well for many years with XP.&nbsp; Don't remember the model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I switched to 7 some things failed regularly like if somebody sent me a PDF in an Outlook email or a ZIP file many times I could not open them (errors, corrupted, not a PDF etc.).&nbsp; I experimented and went back to XP and did not have the problem so I
 sought out newer drivers or things for Windows 7 but had the latest ones from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't notice any other problems but there could have been some that did not visualize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kept thinking it must be problems with the folks that were sending me things so ask them to send it again!</p>
<p>Sometimes I would have to switch back to XP just to get files from people. </p>
<p>XP always worked.</p>
<p>Windows 7 sometimes worked.</p>
<p><br />
Went through all the channel changing and stuff too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never got it figured out.&nbsp; Worked fine in XP, not with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrated and almost as an experiment I switched to this Belkin N300 device I got at Walmart for about $30 USD:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have NEVER had a problem with it and have not had a single issue with PDFs and ZIPs.</p>
<p><br />
I think I just plugged it in and it worked right away!</p>

            <p>Thank you for sharing this experience with us. It may have been an incompatibility issue with the Operating System and the adapter. For cases like that, it is usually the adapter's manufacturer who can provide the latest or the updated driver. You did mention
 that after changing the channel settings, things have greatly improved. Does this mean that the issue is now resolved?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're just here for any feedback.</p>

<h2>            How do I defrag system files on Windows 7&#63; I think it should be done before I upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>Hi. My Win 7 pro computer says the system files are 13% fragmented. How do I defrag system files?
</p>
<p>I also have a win 98 that runs really slowly and I suspect it may have the same problem as it seems to go through the booting process twice even putting 2 menu bars at the bottom of the screen on top of each other.
</p>
<p>I know just enough about the computers to be dangerous and just enough to try anything safe that will solve my problems. Thank you community for answering me!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the quick reply! I probably have 2 different issues or maybe no issue on the Win 7.
</p>
<p>1 It is a personal computer(win 7)</p>
<p>2 No popup messages but when I ran defrag it gave me two reports. one for files - no fragments and one for system that said 13% fragmented.&nbsp; I have never seen that before.
</p>
<p>3. The reason I included the win 98 in my comments was&nbsp;that it has gotten pokey and seems to go through the boot up process twice. I thought if my Win 7 has system fragments that my Win 98 may be really messed up since it is older. ...And messed up system
 files may be the reason that everything I do on it is slooow!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The links you sent me to seem to say that it is alright for system files to be fragmented and it won't affect operations of the computer. So I should not try to defrag them with a third party program.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I get my computers ready for Win 10 and get the update I will work on the xp machine. There are probably many reasons for a slow computer that seems to start windows twice.&nbsp; I don't know where to begin other then hopefully someone here has had the
 same problem and solved it. </p>
<p>Again thank you!</p>

            <p>Thanks ..I read the article and I think I can follow the directions. It doesn't say it is for Win98 but I can try.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be a while before I can get to try it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Also only Webroot Complete is on my computers. </p>
<p>I am pleased to have win10 on everything else now!</p>

<h2>            why does skype ask to update drivers&#63;</h2>
                    Helping a friend re-install Skype today. It keeps asking her to let it scan for updated drivers. Why? Why can't it just install?

<p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that Windows detected an update for your audio/video drivers. It is also recommended that you use the&nbsp;latest drivers to avoid having issues with Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.
<br />
Thank you!<br />

<h3> qprtypower  say:</h3>
<h2>            What happens if you come across a scammer other than blocking them, can they be reported to Skype etc... &#63;</h2>
                    I've come across a scammer that is on Skype and dating sites and is using stock pictures of a service woman from the USA who does great work, unlike the scammer. Is there a way to let others know including Skype because all I keep getting is referred back
 to this community, even from Microsoft. It's like no one wants to know and yet right above this posting it states about scammers posting fake numbers etc....&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for the reply Roger, but I'm afraid that doesn't help at all. I know all about blocking and reporting, but this scammer is still using said account, so whoever got the report which didn't allow for evidence etc.. to be added, hasn't done anything
 about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly, big companies don't care enough to get rid of scammers and yet post comments about being aware of them.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be highly recommended that you continue this with our live chat support in order for them to verify the account and take appropriate action towards the Skype account. I sent you a private message which contain further instructions on how you can
 reach out to our live chat support for them to provide you additional information about how you can report the alleged Skype account for spam and restrict it for you. You may view the message through your inbox using this link:<br />

<p>Benjie,</p>
<p>As stated in my reply to your private message, I don't feel right using lies to contact support. I shouldn't have to, and you certainly shouldn't be sending a screenshot to state that I or anyone else should contact them about payments etc... when you and
 I know that is nothing like why I'm contacting them. SCAMMERS lie and deceive, clearly you're happy to and tells other to, but I WON'T and don't appreciate a Skype moderator telling me this is how to do it!</p>
<p>As i also stated privately, you shouldn't have to lie or deceive in order to speak to someone, that's so WRONG!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I firstly apologize if there was a confusion in regards to the instructions on how we can reach out to our live chat support, I would like to clarify that those steps are the general steps on how you can connect with one of our live chat representative.
 You will only choose the appropriate option connected to your concern thus, selecting security and privacy instead of payments and billing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this clears up any unclear directions. Let me know if you have further clarifications.

<p>Benjie, you can stop it right now! It's not a feeling it's a FACT! You didn't provide me with one of the paths at all, you were telling me to select an option that I have no problem with at all! Funny how your private message states a differnet outcome for
 your so called help to what you print here in public.</p>
<p>Now that I've told you straight that I'm not impressed, you're trying to make light of it by claiming it's me and you weren't doing anything wrong. there wasn't CONFUSION or me FEELING IT WRONGLY, it was you steering me to contact support using a bogus reason,
 you and I both know that's what you did and it isn't right!</p>
STOP private messaging me and stop responding on this post too. I have no reason to want anything more from you and I'm actually disgusted by you now, and the fact that you're a moderator too, you really should be ashamed!

<h2>            Missing Network Drivers in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: W10 - Deleted Ethernet connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good evening,</p>
<p>I'm using a Zotac Pico&nbsp;320 as a WiFi/Ethernet bridge for my workstation.</p>
<p>It worked fine but (maybe after an auto-update) it suddendly&nbsp;stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to delete the bridge but accidentally deleted the ethernet connection instead.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;didn't show on available connection anymore (understandably) so I tried to uninstall and reinstall the lan driver.</p>
<p>Now the nic doesn't appear under device management anymore.</p>
<p>The only error I get is about "Unknown USB Device" and I suspect it could be the nic but I wasn't able to force&nbsp;install the driver.</p>
<p>The nic should be a Realtek USB Ethernet Controller All-In-One.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried a system restore but it didn't help.</p>
<p>Any ideas? :-)</p>
<p>I'm pretty much stuck right now :-)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Good evening Mr. Aramanda,</p>
<p>The name of the pc&nbsp;maker is Zotac, the model is Pico 320 :-)</p>
<p>The name of the&nbsp;nic maker is Realtek, the model is Realtek USB Ethernet Controller All-In-One.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the&nbsp;w10 drivers from the pc maker site and had a successful installation.</p>
<p>Still the nic couldn't be found on device manager.</p>
<p>I have downloaded the w10 drivers from Realtek itself and had a successful installation but&nbsp;again no nic on the device manager.</p>
<p>I even tried removing the drivers&nbsp;and reinstalling in compatibility mode but nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything else I could try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><em><strong>For us to further assist you, we would like to confirm if your two-step verification is enable.
</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no clue whether whatever this is is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just trying to enter my email and password, the way I have been doing this since Skype existed. I can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em><strong>Also, for&nbsp;a better view, kindly provide to us a screenshot of the following:
</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>error message when you tried to sign in using the new device.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I copy/pasted the entire error message. It is not a "new device" at all, just that I am suddenly logged out and need to sign in again, which fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>a successful sign in using a trusted or other device. </strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I provide a successful signing-in screenshot, if I am unable to sign in? I don't use other "devices". It's a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I don't use Skype when I don't trust the "device". This is my everyday PC and I use Skype on a daily basis.</p>
<p>It's just that the signing-in is broken. Even now when trying top reply it took me half an hour to get here. It says the e-mail is known or can't be looked up at the moment, so something you are doing you are doing wrong.</p>
<p>
Thanks for any pointers which allow me to access my account.<br />

<p>
</p><p>1. I don't know how to ascertain I have this.</p>
<p>2. My login process is entering my ID, which is an email address, a contact, and a password.</p>
<p>3. I am not using a different "device", whatever a device is. I am on my PC - as always. I have not changed anything, Skype has.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>regarding sign in issue kindly try to sign in to Skype using the Skype for Web</em></p>

</p><p>As I have stated above, I don't know what all these different versions of Skype are, so "Skype for web" means nothing to me. I am using the web so all of Skype is on the web.</p>
<p>My problem is signing into Skype, so I am not sure how exactly I should sign in when that is my problem. I am looking for a solution when I am unable to use Skype and only get above error message.</p>

</p><p>I know how important this is to you. However, for us to further isolate the case we will be needing your cooperation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The reason why we ask you to sign in to your account using Skype for Web; <strong>
<a href="https://web.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here.&nbsp;</a></strong>&nbsp;For us to check if this is a account specific issue or not. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I now understand that what you call "Skype for Web" is probably the browser-based Skype, not a stand-alone programme.</p>
<p>Great, we are making progress. </p>
<p>
</p><p>That is exactly where the problem occurred. That is where I saw the error message. In "Skype for Web". I don't install any other version of a Skype application on my "device". I don't quite understand what you mean by Skype "through" web. The world wide
 web is the internet. Skype only works on the web, the internet. No web = no Skype. But maybe you are using the word web instead of the word browser, which would explain the confusion. But the browser is where I get the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the first time I get the message. The last time the problem went away after a week or so.
</p>
<p>In general I have a problem logging on to Microsoft, as I am asked to provide an e-mail address and when I do I am told I can't log in because the e-mail already exists. Well I should hope so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thanks for your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem went away, just like the last couple of times. Without me doing anything.</p>
<p>It happens and then disappears again. Without warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try using different browsers and got the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Skype got really bad when it was bought by Microsoft, I no longer use the stand-alone application.</p>
<p>I use a different account with a laptop to make calls and there I use it for security reasons, but here I don't use the commercial calling functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems nobody knows anything about the source of the strange behaviour I am experiencing from time to time and I simply need to live with it.</p>

</p><p>Please note that Skype for Web is no longer supported on Firefox, this is a possible reason why you're having an issue. Also, one of the possible factor as well is your internet connection. With that being said, please try using a different internet connection
 and make sure your browsers are up-to-date.</p>

            Hi GO.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  This reinstalls WIndows while saving your files and apps in place; takes about an hour, resolves most problems.  It also brings it to the latest version by the most stable method.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />You can also try to reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            &#34;This app can&#39;t run on your PC&#34; on Windows Server 2012 Terminal Services</h2>
                    <p>We have a 32-bit application developed using MS Visual FoxPro 9.0 SP2.&nbsp; It works on Windows XP, Vista, Win7 and Win8 Pro and Windows Server 2003 and 2008 in Terminal Services.&nbsp; A client purchased and deployed a Windows Server 2012 as their terminal services
 computer.&nbsp; The application installed, and starts off ok.&nbsp; But after a while, it will no longer load.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every use gets "This app can't run on your PC", and the only way to clear this is to do a reboot of the machine.&nbsp; This includes the local and Domain administrator accounts.&nbsp; We have several Windows 8 Pro machines and I have never gotten this message with
 this application, so it seems like it is localized to Windows Server 2012.&nbsp; The server is fully patched.&nbsp; And it does not seem to be linked to a permissions problem.</p>

                    <p>The problem of the files with name to long is epidemic. It causes a lot of problems in the computer and are as difficult to find as to get rid of them. For the good and young geniuses that roam in the communities I beg for the following info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.- How do I find them?</p>
<p>2.- and how do I&nbsp;can erase them for good?</p>
<p>3.- How they come to be</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only contribution is that I have found (After a lot of work) them in a &nbsp;in the find them in the&nbsp;&nbsp;Ipod photo Cache. But I don have the Ipod program so I think I load from an external source.</p>
<p>Does anybody found a trusted source that explains how do them come to exist? I like to learn How and why. THANK YOU</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Editting tags and comments fields of a .mts file is not yet available when using Windows file explorer. We recommend that you use a tag editor that can edit tags and comments from the Windows Store.
<br />
<br />
Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.

    <title>Play&#47;Pause button on keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oopsicusmaximus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Play&#47;Pause button on keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my last Windows 10 Update on the 11th of April the function&nbsp;Play/Pause button on my keyboard has changed. Before the update, it used to only play or pause the music being played on Windows Media Player or&nbsp;MPC-HC and had no effect whatsoever on Youtube
 or Facebook videos being played in the Internet browser. Since the update, YT and FB video even have the priority, i.e. the&nbsp;Play/Pause button only effects the videos when there any open and only plays/pauses music in WMP or MPC HC when there are no videos
 open in browser. Is there a way to get stuff the way they were before update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Sari</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I didn't write very clearly. What I want is exactly the opposite of what the OP in your posted link wants. Since the recent windows update, my keyboard controls Youtube videos and I don't want it to. I only want it to control Windows Media Player.
 Thanks all the same for your help. :)<br />
