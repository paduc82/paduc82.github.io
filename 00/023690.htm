<h2>            Cant connect to exchange 2010 with outlook 2016</h2>
                    I have been transferred 9 times. Microsoft are absolutely incompetent. Why can I not connect to Exchange 2010 via Activesync with Outlook 2016? &nbsp;Its not a difficult question you would think. I want Outlook 2016 to connect to my company exchange server
 via EAS. Simple. If there is no solution I am dumping Microsoft Exchange and going to Google instead.&nbsp;

                    <p>Why am I constantly asked to list my latest credentials, and what the hell does it mean anyway?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been on the computer for just over an hour and a half, and have been reminded twice already to list my latest credentials, and twice I've been told I need to log into my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get these twin messages all day, sometimes as many as six times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like Microsoft is not only turning into Apple, but Facebook too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What with being forced to sign into my own computer, for the first time in 35 years, the constant nagging, and ads during games,&nbsp; I'll be glad to get back to OZ and get this OS off my computer, hopefully for ever.</p>

            <p>Hi Rikk,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are getting prompt to sign in with your latest credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For better understanding of the issue, please provide us following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Which build of Windows 10 are you working on?</li><li>Did the issue occurred after installing any 3<sup>rd</sup> party software?</li><li>When you say ‚Äú<span>the constant nagging, and ads during games‚Äù which games are you referring to?</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description of the issue, it seems there is some 3<sup>rd</sup> party software which could have caused this behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and see if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Perform Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot allows the Windows operating system to launch without any additional programs or services running when you turn the computer on. This allows you to determine if computer issues are caused by a program or service
 that starts up when you boot the machine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. You may follow the article mentioned to perform a clean boot.</span></p>

            I get the same message to logon to my Microsoft account&nbsp;on my HP laptop with the latest build (10049)&nbsp;at random times.&nbsp; I also got the messages with build 10041.&nbsp; I leave my computer on 24/7 so it is possible the message is appearing on a regular basis.&nbsp;
 If I click on the message it takes me to the accounts section of settings.&nbsp; But, there is no information presented there on what to do with respect to the message.&nbsp; If I ignore the message, it disappears after a few seconds and nothing happens.&nbsp; So, I just
 presumed it&nbsp;is a bug in the build.&nbsp; I have the same software on as I did with the original build with the exception of updates to the software.&nbsp;

<p>Unfortunately, this stock answer from Microsoft is singularly unhelpful. We are trying to help Microsoft iron out the last of the bugs, but they don't seem to have any grasp of the problems. Windows 10 will just end up as buggy as all the other Windows disasters.
 I too have this problem. It is not related to any other software, as I have the exact same setup on my Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 computers with no problems. Come on Microsoft, at least show SOME interest in the help others are trying to give you.</p>

<h2>            What is the point in being able to link workbooks if it causes workbooks to have unreadable content&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am consistently having problems with simple links&nbsp;between&nbsp;workbooks (vlookups between workbooks) such that every second time I open any linked workbooks, Excel needs to repair it [Repaired Records: Calculation properties from /xl/workbook.bin part (Workbook)],
 meaning I need to change the name, change the links and generally have to continually manage the mess Excel makes of linked files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why include functionality for links if Excel can't handle them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; This&nbsp;started with Excel 2007 and has got worse with 2010.&nbsp; Will I try 2013, I doubt it!</p>

<p>I understand your frustration and let me try to help you.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, I need more details:</p>
<p>Is the workbook linked to another workbook on a network location?</p>
<p>Does the file contain Macros (VBA)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us copy the content from the workbook and then re-link the workbook and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>You may also change the calculation mode to Manual and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>Go to <font>
Manual</span> in <span style="font-weight: bold">Calculation Options</span></font> section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also repair the Workbooks following the steps from the link below:</p>

<h2>            How do I allow controlled folder access in Windows Defender to an app that I trust &#40;such as LibreOffice&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have searched for ready-made answers, but all of them lead me to a Windows Defender page where I should find the words "Add an allowed app", but in my current version of Windows 10 I find different words in the same place: "Always protected with controlled
 folder access".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the unlikely event that it is just the words that have changed, I have entered the full addresses of the apps I want to allow through - such as C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 5\program\soffice.bin . This does not work: I still cannot save LibreOffice files
 inside controlled folders. And I still get the "Unauthorised changes blocked" message in notifications whenever I try to save these files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to retain the protection offered by controlled folder access while also being able to add apps that I trust. Solutions welcome - the easier the better.</p>

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>SharePoint only prompts for login if they need to access something - usually from an application that is logged into SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, I'd say it's OneDrive for Business that is prompting this, where it automatically runs when the computers starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please check whether there is a blue cloud icon on your notification area? If so, you can right click on the icon to go to it's
<strong>Settings </strong>and click on the <strong>Unlink this PC</strong> button on the
<strong>Account </strong>tab.</p>
<p>

<p>Are you saying that the leftmost button in the Send/Receive tab is not the send/receive button?</p>

<p>When you generate a new email there should be a send button on the new email form.</p>

            <p>This becomes a bit of an exercise in macro programming.&nbsp; I've helped some others in countries (one Central American country with numerous religious holidays and New Zealand that I can recall)&nbsp;other than the United States to build similar calendars based
 on their holidays.</p>
<p>The beginning point is obviously to gather a complete list of the holidays, but less obvious may be the need to detail the rules on how to determine the holiday.&nbsp; To give some examples from my experience:</p>
<p>New Year's Day:&nbsp; January 1&nbsp; (but if it falls on a Saturday, then it is observed on the previous Friday, and if it falls on Sunday, then it is observed on the following&nbsp;Monday)</p>
<p>Thanksgiving - the 4th Thursday in November.</p>
<p>Easter Sunday - this one potentially takes a whole bunch of math to do accurately - see
<a href="http://www.contextures.com/exceleastercalculation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.contextures.com/exceleastercalculation.html</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you may have different holidays that are based on a variety of rules (always on a specified date, always on the nth day of a week in a particular month, based on some complex relationship of phases of the sun, moon and your first born's eye color) and
 then you may have exceptions as with our observance of holidays whose actual dates fall on Saturday and/or Sunday.</p>

<h3> lornelsl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suggestion&#58;   A Software Mover Tool in Windows 10...</h2>
                    <p>I would like to see a tool in Windows 10 (perhaps as one of the&nbsp;Administrative Tools) that would easily allow a user to move an installed software program from its original location to a new location (new path on the same hard disk or new path on a different
 disk in the same computer).&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if a software program called "XYZ Software" was installed at&nbsp;"C:\Program Files\XYZ Software" and the user later wanted to move it to a new hard drive (say the "D:" drive) such that it would end up at "D:\More Programs\XYZ
 Software" all the user had to do was access the Software Mover Tool in the Administrative Tools of Windows 10.&nbsp; In this case, a simple User Interface would open that would allow the user to easily move the software program to any new location.&nbsp; The tool would
 automatically make all the required changes to the path names, windows registry, *.ini files, start-up files, log files, shortcuts, etc.&nbsp; Maybe a reboot would be necessary (mayby not) and then all the program files and supporting files and data would either
 be moved or have the correct path updated such that the program would work without any glitches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is at least one third party software program that claims to do this already for windows programs but it is not without glitches.&nbsp; However, if the OS had a built-in tool to do this, the efficacy of this built-in tool should be&nbsp;greatly improved over
 any third party software, as the OS is in a unique position to be able to track&nbsp;all paths, links, dlls, shortcuts, support files, etc. of the software at the time of the original installation and also track changes each time the software is used.</p>

<h2>            highlight cells that duplicate values &#62; 5 times</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way via the conditional formatting feature (or some other method) to highlight cells that contain the same value, but only if that same value appears 5 or more times?</p>

    <title>Excel Pivot Grand Total Shows Zero - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> md57780  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Pivot Grand Total Shows Zero</h2>
                    <p>I have created a basic Excel pivot. &nbsp;The data resides in a named range in one tab with the pivot on a separate tab of the same workbook. &nbsp;There are no formulas in the source data, and the pivot contains no calculated fields or items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the pivot definition, I have two fields added as rows. &nbsp;I have a single field added as column, with the values sums set to columns as well. &nbsp;I have four fields added as values. &nbsp;One value field is counting text, while the other three are getting the min,
 max and average of a numeric field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the screenshot below, the column categories calculate correctly. &nbsp;The totals for Avg, Max and Min calculate correctly. &nbsp;However, the Total Cnt shows the value of zero for the Grand Total Row as well as the first field row. &nbsp;The second field row does show
 the correct total count. &nbsp;When I double-click the zero values, Excel creates a new tab with the correct 46 items listed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/024316f6-e18d-400b-8d32-32faad888d1f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/024316f6-e18d-400b-8d32-32faad888d1f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I collapse the first field row, the Total Cnt for the first field row calculates correctly, but the grand total still shows zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65cc79d8-ed33-459a-947a-6f5124cb72bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65cc79d8-ed33-459a-947a-6f5124cb72bc" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many entries in the pivot. &nbsp;No matter how the pivot is filtered, the results always show zero in the Total Cnt except for the second field rows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the format option "For empty cells show:" is changed from "0" to "X", the cells show "X".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the pivot counting correctly at the second field row level, but failing to roll that correct count up the row levels, yet the drill-thru returns the correct entries?</p>

            <p>I found the issue, though I have not wrapped my mind around the reasoning it would yield a blank result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my Values section, my "Cnt" value field is based on the same field as the "SatelliteID" row field.&nbsp; When I change the "Cnt" field to count on a different field, it works.&nbsp; I substituted in the "Duration" field, which is the same field that the "Min",
 "Max", and "Avg" value fields are using.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If someone knows of a resource to where I can read up on this issue and the reasoning behind the calculation behavior, I would appreciate the information.</p>

            <p>Hi Vienna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn off the phone, Once the phone is off, Hold the Volume down key then plug the charger (charger should be connected to the power source ",) Once you see the exclamation ( !&nbsp;), remove your finger from the button.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Then press the following keys in, Volume Up, Volume Down, Power Key and Volume down. The phone will turn on automatically, this may take several minutes and it will show two gears that are spinning just wait for it to finish<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>One more thing all the files on the phone will be deleted but if you have a Microsoft account on the phone, check people.live.com to check the contact lists that you have and
<strong>OneDrive</strong> for the pictures, that's if you have a Microsoft account on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>** From another post from the forums**</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Why isn&#39;t my macro working&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good morning!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, how can I record a macro that works fine one minute and not the next?&nbsp; I have&nbsp;a macro that I want to run based on the response from the user.&nbsp; In this case, I'm asking the user to identify the&nbsp;month being reported.&nbsp; Since there are 12 months,
 there are 12 possible responses.&nbsp; I created a macro for each month independently and they work perfectly.&nbsp; But then when I copy and paste those same macros into one with Else If statements, they don't work properly.&nbsp; Here's what I'm trying to do:</p>
<p>If April is being reported, I want to show columns H, I, and J (April, May, and June) and clear the contents and hide July through December as well as some other columns out to the right.&nbsp; If May is being reported, I only want to show columns I and J (May
 and June) and hide and clear the contents of April, and July through December as well as the other columns out to the right.&nbsp; If the response is June, then only column J (June) should be shown and the data in all other months should be cleared and hidden.&nbsp;
 And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Disclaimer:&nbsp; I am a novice macro-writer and I know just enough to be dangerous!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that that's out of the way,&nbsp;here's the macro I've written to achieve those results (any and all suggestions are welcome at this point since I'm about to pull every hair out of my head from working on this for days -- Thank you!):&nbsp;

<h2>            Excel for Mac - Waterfall Chart - How to set totals&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to figure out how to set totals for a waterfall chart in Excel 2016 for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you create a waterfall chart, the values are automatically added as an Increase or a Decrease (see picture).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to select one of the values (in this case 2017) and format that value as a total (starting at 0 on the vertical axis)?</p>
<p><br />
Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Tina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have version 16.10 installed (see screenshot below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yes, with 2017 I mean the value 30.500,00 - this value is the resulting total and should be colored in grey and start on the vertical axis at value 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attached another screenshot of a waterfall chart (created with excel for windows) where you can see what it should look like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue with this waterfall is that I cannot change the number format of the values displayed in the vertical axis (for example the top value is displayed as 70000.000 and I do not find a way to change this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>

            @ Tina and Cliff - Your replies are rubbish. You should know Excel well enough to understand that these new features are in the process of being rolled out, and that they are working in version 16.12

 want it to capitalize the first letter of the first word of each new sentence.&nbsp; How would I make that change?

            <p>1. Stop hitting Enter. Let Word wrap your sentences around for you.</p>
<p>2. You can turn the feature off. Tools--&gt;Options, Autocorrect, Autoformat as you type. Uncheck it.</p>

            <p>As Anne suggests, Word will not capitalize the first letter of a line unless it is also the first letter of a paragraph (which Word assumes is the beginning of a sentence). If for some reason you do not want to use word wrap on your text (for example, if
 these are lines of a poem),&nbsp;you can use Shift+Enter to insert a line break&nbsp;instead of a paragraph break (Enter). Since Word will not see your new line as the beginning of a paragraph/sentence, it will not capitalize the first letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're typing something like dictionary entries (which <strong>are</strong> separate paragraphs but should not be capitalized), you can temporarily disable the option to capitalize the first letter of a sentence at
<strong>Tools | AutoCorrect Options | AutoCorrect: Capitalize first letter of sentences</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Defender removal tool freezes</h2>
                    <p>Defender found a virus. When attempting to remove it the removal tool freezes at about 3/4 of the way through. I've tried it multiple times now.</p>

<h2>            Use Outlook.com email on Exchange 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to use an outlook.com email address (which I do not want to lose) on a paid subscription on Exchange 365? &nbsp;I love my outlook.com email address but need the benefits that Exchange Sync does not offer (the only way Outlook can connect to Outlook.com)
 - hence my subscription to Hosted Exchange in the cloud (Exchange 365).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><span>Hello GrahamRamsay,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We heard that many community users resolved this problem by updating Outlook. Microsoft has released the newest version of Office: Version 1904 (Build 11601.20144). For your reference:

<p>
</p><p><span>Please kindly go to <strong>File</strong> &gt;

<p>

            No, it does not, and it hasn't worked for anyone else on here, despite Sylvie's pronouncement that many people have had success... the only thing you will learn here is that the Microsoft team apparently have no method to report a genuine problem or ask
 someone on the development side for help figuring out the problem. All their responses are cut-and-paste lip service. Very sad.

<p><span><span>Hi <span>GrahamRamsay,</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>I'd like to suggest you to try with switching to semi annual channel, since based on the version number, you have monthly channel.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Close all Office applications and open Command Prompt. Run the following commands:</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span><span>cd C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\ClickToRun</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>OfficeC2RClient.exe /changesetting Channel=Broad</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>OfficeC2RClient.exe /update user</span></span></span></span></span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After the steps, go to Outlook&gt; File&gt; Office account and check whetehr you switch to semi annual under About Outlook. After this, please check whether the issue persists after restarting your machine.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please feel free to keep us updated.<br />

<h3> nootrino  say:</h3>
<h2>            SaveAs dialog box hidden behind workbook - can&#39;t see it</h2>
                    <p>Recently upgraded to Office 2010 (32bit) /Windows 7.&nbsp; Have thousands of users that we support and so far hundreds have migrated to this profile.&nbsp; Noticed with some users though - not all - just a small percentage, when they click SaveAs in Excel 2010, the
 application freezes.&nbsp; On closer scrutiny we realized what was happening was the SaveAs dialog box was BEHIND the main Excel window.&nbsp; The only way to restore it is to click on the tab from the Taskbar or minimize all the windows to FIND the SaveAs Dialog box.&nbsp;
 Understandably this is causing these users to freak out.&nbsp; It is very unproductive and a nuisance to say the least.&nbsp; The only other variable here is that all these users have multiple monitors, usually 2-4.&nbsp; But for some, this happens in the their main monitor
 and/or the monitor that Excel is opened in and which has the focus.&nbsp; Even more strange is that this does not occur to everyone, just a handful of users so far who have reported the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a bug?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any feedback greatly appreciated.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS - someone also reported that they saw this behavior with Outlook as well, but I personally did not witness this...</p>

<h2>            iPhone 4 not seeing  BH-218 BT Headset</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>I bought a new BH-218 a week ago and it was working with my iPhone 4.<br />
Then, my iPhone became faulty and I got a replacement from Apple but my replaced iPhone can't see the BH-218 headset.<br />
I've since tried my Wife's iPhone 5 and my old Nokia phone and none can see the Headset during Bluetooth searching which is weird.<br />
Can someone help me? Thanks</div>

<p>I dont have your headset but I would do this;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. delete (reset) all former connected devices that had been done. Check manual how-to-do</p>
<p>2. after reset, hold the connecting button when searching for devices such as the fruit phone...</p>

<p>There is no button\power button to reset the BH-218.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that once you pair the BH-218 to one device, it can't be paired to another one device.</p>

</p><p>The question mark beside the profile photo of a Skype user indicates that they are not yet part of your contact list. Please try the following troubleshooting steps below.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Remove the contacts from your Contact list. </li><li>Re-launch the Skype application.</li><li>Re-add them to your contact list. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, rename your Skype folder to reset your Skype settings. Follow these steps below.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Quit Skype by selecting <strong>Skype</strong> &gt; <strong>Quit Skype</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>~/Library/Application Support </strong>and rename your Skype folder to Skype_Old.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to experience the issue after doing the suggestions above, please provide your exact Skype version and the macOS that runs on your device so we can look into this further.

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>But what do you mean by removing contact? Deleting them? </p>
<p>By deleting them I have to send a contact request again, meaning they will definitely know that i deleted/blocked them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I tried to send a contact request after unblocking one contact and the message: Please add me as a contact appeared in our chat window (although i even deleted this message before re-sending the request).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that unblocking was supposed to be possible without people knowing that they have been blocked. In this case they will know it. So this seems not a good solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or will they not see the request, although i see it in our chat window?</p>
<p>Will they see the contact request when i delete&nbsp;them and re-add them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running the latest Skype version (automatic updates) on Mac OS X 10.9.5.</p>

<p>Yes, removing a contact means deleting them from your Contact list. They will know that you have removed them since they will be notified by the contact request.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What about renaming your Skype folder? By doing this, you will reset your Skype settings. Have you tried it? Please let us know what happens.

<h2>            Observation</h2>
                    I have noticed an interesting situation when running Office 2013 home premium and Lync 2013 basic. I believe windows update thinks I have the business version, and I do not know how that will affect the home premium automatic updates.

            <p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lync 2013 is not part of Office 365 Home Premium, how was Lync 2013 installed, was it bundled with another Office 2013 suite or a standalone version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The updates for Lync 2013 should not have any effect with Office 365 Home Premium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information is helpful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I first installed Lync as from the download section of my company's corporate Microsoft online. But it killed my Outlook 365 home premium. So I had to uninstall, reconfigure, and the install Lync basic standalone. After that there were 29 Office 365 updates
 in Windows update, and usually home premium updates a different way.

            <p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply and sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you had to remove all traces of Office 365 as well as Lync and re-install it, the updates will be offered again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, if Office 365 Home Premium is installed as Click-to-Run version, then you will not be prompted for the updates.
</p>
<p>Refer to the section <span style="font-weight: bold">
<font>Click-to-Run v2.0: The experience</font></span> in the blog below for more information on the same:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/office-next/archive/2012/08/27/click-to-run-and-office-on-demand.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://blogs.office.com/b/office-next/archive/2012/08/27/click-to-run-and-office-on-demand.aspx</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also ensure there are no other versions of Office 365 installed on the computer, if present, remove all traces of Office 365 by running the fixit from the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now download and install Office 365 Home Premium by logging into
<a href="http://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>www.office.com/myaccount</font></a> with the registered email address and click Install Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the suggestions provided are helpful to you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
