</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last few weeks I have been having issues with syncing my onenote (desktop version). It would randomly shut off and when I try to reopen onenote only half of my notes would show. Each time I try to sync the folder the following error would appear
 "We're sorry, something went wrong during sync. We'll try again later. (Error code: 0xE4010688)". It is finals week for me and if possible I would love to be able to retrieve my missing updated notes if not I need the assurance that as I am taking my notes
 that they will not disappear withing 10 minutes of me writing them. Thanks</p>

<p>Hello sadeaji,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your notebooks are so important especially right now that it's finals week, I would suggest that you check your notes in
<a href="https://www.onenote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote online</a>. This way we can check if your notebooks are all there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>To further isolate your concern, are you using the OneNote 2016 or the OneNote app for Windows 10? To check the difference between the two,
</span><span>here's an article:&nbsp;</span><em><span><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-s-the-difference-between-onenote-and-onenote-2016-a624e692-b78b-4c09-b07f-46181958118f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>What's

</p><p><strong>We're sorry, something went wrong during sync. We'll try again later. (Error code: 0xE4010688)</strong> error messages usually occurs when our servers are experiencing high volume. Your notes are safe and there is no need for you to take any additional
 steps. OneNote will continue to reach out to the server to sync your notes until the server responds. In instances that the server is particularly overloaded this might take a while. We recognize that this is impacting your ability to get work done and we
 are working to ensure this happens less often in the future.<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're able to access your notebooks in OneNote online, I recommend that you view the server status through this
<a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. You would see an <strong>X</strong> mark along with a description beside the service if there's a problem within the server.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for the response! So far I have been using the desktop version of Onenote 2016 using the Windows 10 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to recover some of my notes but unfortunately not everything. I was not able to view the lost notes even on OneNote Online.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new issue has arised, now my OneNote keeps shutting down with an error message (0x20). I tried to look up resolutions to this forum but I haven't been able to find one concerning someone that is using a windows server.</p>

<p>Hello sadeaji,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to verify if you tried to look for your notebooks on <strong><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneDrive.com</a></strong>? If you havenâ€™t, please do so and check if the missing notebooks are there.
 If you need more information, you can check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Find-my-lost-notes-32CB2BD7-AFE7-44D2-A711-398A88421287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and follow the instructions provided on the
 Windows section. This is provided on the article: <strong><em>Find my lost notes</em></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message that you have provided has something to do with sync issues in OneNote. A shared folder that is not syncing is possible cause. Can you please provide a
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4?auth=1">screenshot</a></strong> of the error message? This way, we are going to updated
 with the situation. As an initial troubleshooting, you can try to uninstall and reinstall OneNote on Windows 10 to get an updated version of the OneNote app. You can follow this steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings. </strong></li><li>Choose <strong>Apps</strong>.</li><li>Look for the <strong>OneNote app</strong>.</li><li>Click on it, select<strong> Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Go to the<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/onenote/9wzdncrfhvjl?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Microsoft Store</strong></a>. </li><li>Search for the OneNote app.</li><li>Click on <strong>Get</strong> and install the app. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After this process, you may check the OneNote app, if the issue is still present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome, so we can continue to assist you. </p>

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply! I have been able to view my notebooks on onedrive.com as well as the desktop and app version of onenote. The issue is that some of my updated notes on a few of the notebooks are missing. So say if I took notes on a specific section
 on Monday-12/10 and then again on Tuesday-12/11; the updated notes from Tuesday-12/11 are no longer there but the original notes from Monday-12/10 are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I have been able to use the app version with no issue but I still prefer the desktop version and unfortunately the desktop version is still displaying the same error message. I attached a picture of the error message I keep getting with the desktop
 version.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I appreciate your response. Since you're still having issue regarding the changes that you've made on your notebook, I recommend that you check if you can see a
<strong>Misplaced Section</strong> option in OneNote 2016. Refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/resolve-misplaced-sections-in-onenote-32768b56-bc33-42fd-926e-7fccb1af3aa5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

article</a> when you're using OneNote for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I suggest that you create a new user profile to address the error codes you're getting in OneNote 2016. Here's a
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support link</a> on how to create a new user profile, then open OneNote 2016 on the new user profile, see if the issue still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know the result of the troubleshooting </p>

<h2>            Nokia 5230 Update problem</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having a problem when trying to update my Nokia 5230 using the Nokia Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note; my phone is plugged in, there is an update for my phone as the last time it was updated was when it made manufactured (nov 09). The USB mode is on 'PC suite'. I have downloaded all the latest versions of the Nokia Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click 'Update Phone Software", it takes me to the updater. When it comes to the 'Searching for a connected device', it hands for about 1-2 minutes, then says "Unable to find device".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>** EDIT **</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turns out, all the features on the Nokia PC Suite say that there is no Device connected. Yet the Pc Suite itself says there is.</p>

<p>Try updating the phone using nokia ovi suite using USB cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I works nicely with nokia 5230</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently bought Nokia 5230 and succesfully updated the phone Software to 20.0.005 using OVI suite through USB cable connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone book entries are not deleted by this version of phone software update for nokia 5230 (nokia does not say this, this is my personal experience) but it is always advisable to back up the phone book and all other data before going for a phone software
 update.</p>

<p>@David84 *#0000# is the code to check current FW version, &nbsp;but if you will check for software updates it'll tell you there is no update available until OTA (over the air) update available for your device, &nbsp;otherwise you can easily update with Nokia software
 updater (download it from nokia website) Remember to close OVI suite or PC suite before launching NSU.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After we signed up the non-profit free trail, to get the Office 365 non-profit subscription, a vanity domain needs to be verified in Office 365 first. Once the domain is verified, our validation
 team will check the nonprofit eligibility. Once approved, you can get all features in the non-profit plan.</span></p>

<h2>            Resetting Conditional Formatting using  VBA</h2>
                    <p>I'm looking for some help in a Workbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 5 sets of cells that I have Conditional Formatting on.</p>
<p>I have a VBA to make some formatting changes to the text within the cell, but once it has made the changes the cells that have been changed has been removed from the Conditional Formatting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will not list the Formula's or&nbsp;Formatting as this is not being changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is that in the <strong>Applies to</strong> section is being changed from...</p>
<p>Condition1: =$C$3:$J$3</p>
<p>Condition2: =$C$4:$J$4</p>
<p>Condition3: =$C$5:$J$5</p>
<p>Condition4: =$C$3:$J$5</p>
<p>Condition5: =$C$3:$J$7</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Into this...</p>
<p>Condition1: =$F$3:$J$3</p>
<p>Condition2: =$F$4:$J$4</p>
<p>Condition3: =$F$5:$J$5</p>
<p>Condition4: =$F$3:$J$5</p>
<p>Condition5: =$F$3:$J$7</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I want to do is add to the VBA that changes the <strong>Applies to</strong> section, to change the
<strong>Applies to</strong> back by changing the "<strong>F</strong>'s" back to "<strong>C</strong>'s", but I just cannot workout how to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do have other Conditional Formatting in other places in the Workbook, So I need to make sure that I apply the correction to the right set of Conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance with any help that can be given</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neil</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I think the Object Model for FormatConditions is broken - I get strange results when I test setting the AppliesTo property with something like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim fc As FormatCondition<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set fc = Range("B1").FormatConditions(1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fc.AppliesTo = Range("$A$1:$B$1")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(it actually deleted the value in a cell!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I think you'll want to clear the CF and reapply it to the desired range from scratch.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, be sure to have the correct cell Active (selected) when you apply CF (either in code or manually).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Rich</p>

    <title>Sending multiple email messages to Microsoft OneNote folder&#62;tab - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> would like to learn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sending multiple email messages to Microsoft OneNote folder&#62;tab</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the folder that contains the messages you want to send to Microsoft OneNote.</p>
<p>Open Microsoft One Note and Navigate to the folder and tab section you want to have those multiple messages go to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in-mind that even if you place a message(s) in the same folder and you want to place them in different Folders&gt;tabs, you can easily do this after you have them moved into OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can navigate between windows in many ways, but in order to do this we simply are going to select&nbsp;multiple messages in&nbsp;Outlook 2010 and drag them into&nbsp;OneNote (The tab you have open in OneNote).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means you may want to grab the top border of you outlook window while holding the mouse button down and "bump" the mouse to the left or right side of the screen so that window you grabbed then occupies half of the actual screen. Then do the same to
 the OneNote window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said there are many solutions, but I am writing this for those that are unfamiliar with other methods and this is a simple solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Important: When selecting your messages in Outlook, please be sure to order the massages by date,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">oldest (on top)&nbsp;to most current (at the very bottom)</span>. Then, select the 1st oldest message by highlighting it with a mouse-click, scroll down to the newest, hold the shift-key and select that message in the same
 manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All messages in-between will now be selected. This method will give you a&nbsp;chronological order and for the moment,&nbsp;it is the best way I have found to get them to stay orderd by date when they appear in the tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now grab your highlighted messages in the open Outlook folder and&nbsp;drag and drop them into the OneNote 2010 tab
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">you have open and waiting</span> on the other side of the screen. Again there are other ways to do this, but I am offering a simple solution to show you the concept and then yo can innovate from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the messages will display as an envelope message, but no worries here because you can right-click the message and select "Insert as printout".
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The problem is that&nbsp;OneNote will only let you right clock one message at a time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have the satisfaction of the drag and drop for removal, but lack the same behavior as selecting one message in Outlook and clicking the OneNote button in Outlook and having the message be formatted as an editable message/Printout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option above is to build a full solution when others read this and ad to it. I hope to have a real solid solution that gives us all what we want in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Some years ago, Microsoft switched from clip art distributed with software to online clipart. Then they decided to stop posting it online as well, preferring that you find your own through an online search. Office 2013 and 2016 don't have a clipart library
 feature at all, just a search option. You're not the only one annoyed by this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is Microsoft's page on the subject: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-clip-art-to-your-file-0a01ae25-973c-4c2c-8eaf-8c8e1f9ab530#OfficeVersion=2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Could not find Export specification in Access 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Could not find Export specification in Access 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi All ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are in the process of upgrading Access 2003 to&nbsp; Access 2013. What we did is open an empty Access database in 2013 then import a project programmed in Access 2003.&nbsp; After fix some issues most of the functions working well.&nbsp; There are some buttons on the
 form when clicked it should&nbsp; automatically export different files like .csv, .xle,.txt . Now if you click them it will give a message : could not find the xxxxxx export specification.&nbsp; It seems when import the whole .mdb file these specifications were not
 imported. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anybody here tell me how Access 2013 handles these export and import specifications created in previous version? I did a search in the&nbsp; questions and answers here and through google as well, but found nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>As Karl stated, "Don't choose any objects in the import dialog", so in fact you are not import any objects (tables, queries, forms, reports, macros or VBA code).&nbsp; Then you go into the options and select Import/Export Spec.&nbsp; At the end of the day, it will
 only import the Specs and nothing else.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Min IF not working</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to retrieve the earliest data from a column with multiple possible matches... I know the formula is alright and know there values that should match, but still getting the #N/A across the board... example below:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td>ID (a)</td>
<td>Name(b)</td>
<td>Date(c)</td>
<td>ID</td>
<td>Expected Result</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>AAAA</td>
<td>JonDoe</td>
<td>2011</td>
<td>AAA</td>
<td>{=min(if($a$1:$a$3=d1,$c$1:$c$3))}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>AAAA</td>
<td>JonDoe</td>
<td>2010</td>
<td>
</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>AAAA</td>
<td>JonDoe</td>
<td>2013</td>
<td>
</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>the only difference in regards to the example here is that are lots of values ~700, and the lookup range in another workbook/sheet, but still I think it should work but it is not... I have done this formula before and works, but now not sure what happened
 (FYI I just upgraded my office/excel to the 2016 version).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            If one of your 700 values is an error, that will force your formula to return the error. Look in the range used in the comparison (A1:A3 in your example).

<h2>            Rules in Outlook 2016 &#40;365&#41; stopped working and can&#39;t be accessed</h2>
                    Subscribed to Office 365 and successfully migrated my e-mails and rules from a previous version of Office less then a month ago (everything installed on a new HP laptop with factory preinstalled Windows 10 Home). At first, everything worked fine, and the
 rules were being applied automatically. Recently rules (mostly used for sorting the e-mails) suddenly stopped working, and attempts to access the rules management window result is displaying an error message saying that it is impossible due to a problem with
 the installation or some registry fault, and suggests to restart Outlook and try again. Restarting Outlook doesn't help, as well as reinstalling Outlook. How can I repair the rules access, and resume their normal operation?

            I too have this problem on a daily basis with Document Connection (DC).
<div><br />
<div>I choose to quit thus forcing DC to ignore any 'documents' that it feels I need to look after.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Next time I log on I tend to get a message to say I do not have permission to access that server.</div>
<div>No matter what i do from that point I cannot get any access.</div>
<div>The only solution when this happens is to Force Quit DC and restart it. Then things are fine again until I next log off and I must go through the palarva again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I looked at Joe's suggestion for an alternative posting site but feel that is rather too PC oriented and no posts relate to Mac approaches to sharepoint.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried deleting com.microsoft.DocumentConnection.plist from my user space and from the system library without any success.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I deleted Document Connection.mdccache with a little trepidation but the problem seems to return -&nbsp;</div>
<div>maybe not immediately but before long.</div>

            No it does not fix on restart.
<div><br />
<div>I always shut this Mac down at the end of the day.</div>
<div>Next day when I first invoke Document Connection it shows up with the login screen and the red message "Authentication failed" before anything is typed in.</div>
<div><br />
<div>No matter what I do from that point, the app will always give this message.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only solution is to force quite the app and from then on it is fine</div>
<div><br />
<div>At the end of any day that I have run the program, regardless of whether or not I have correctly saved any Sharepoint Doc used, on shutdown I am told that there are docs requiring saving - but none appear in any app.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A real pain</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any thoughts appreciated</div>

            I think the next thing I would try is to delete Document Connection's preferences (while no Office applications are running) and then try again.

            I'm having the exact same problem and can't find a solution.&nbsp; First off, Bob mentions deleting the mdccache file temporarily solving the issue.&nbsp; Can someone point me to it?&nbsp; I've tried deleting the cache from within the program under Preferences, but no
 luck.&nbsp; Jim, you mention deleting Doc Connection's preferences.&nbsp; Are you referring to the .plist file under ~/Library/Preferences or something else?&nbsp; if it's the former, i've tried that and no luck.<br />

            Hi eobx - yes, you are referring to the same preferences that I was.&nbsp;

<div>The error message is from the server, so it might be necessary to reboot or reset the host device. I doubt that there is much you can do on the client side to fix this problem.</div>

<p>
</p><p>I have only seen the error once so far. when the error did occur I later found out that Steam was no longer able to access web pages, such as the store, or any of the community pages. I did do a restart, and the problem disappeared.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a feature update now available for windows, I thought I got it installed, and windows is now at 17133.73, but&nbsp; windows&nbsp; update still says it needs to restart for an update. is windows past 17133.73 or is it just saying it needs to still install
 the update, but already has? </p>

    <title>Icons for MS Office 2013 applications - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taherte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Icons for MS Office 2013 applications</h2>
                    <p>I just did a recovery on my Windows 10 laptop and re-installed MS Office Professional Plus 2013. When I click on the start button and find the office app I want in the alphabetical list (e.g. Access in the A's), clicking on it does nothing. I found that
 the target location is incorrect and I know how to fix that, but the icon for the app is not correct. It is correct in the section under Microsoft Office in the M's and on the right side (the start menu). How can I correct the entries in the alphabetical list
 to have the correct icon? I can change the icon but I don't know where they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if I click on the start button and scroll down to Microsoft Office and expand that, Outlook is not listed. It is installed, configured, and working on the PC. Is there any way to add that?</p>

<h2>            Excel formula changes itself</h2>
                    I have a spread sheet that the formulas include mappings to other spread sheets. Both spread sheets are saved on a server in the same location. on the odd occasion, the formula changes and therefore becomes invalid. to better explain the formula look like
 this " ='\\olkas0110\users\my.name\[filename.xlsx]Sheet1'!$A$5 " when it changes it adds an additional " users" to the formula and so looks like this&nbsp; " ='\\olkas0110\users\users\my.name\[filename.xlsx]Sheet1'!$A$5 " why does it do this and how do I fix it?

                    <p>On Windows I can get to features by hitting ALT when they are in my Quick Access Toolbar, it's very fast. How do I do this on a Mac because Option is usually the ALT key on a Mac, but it's not working -- and that forces me to go to the menu bar or ribbon
 all the time to align objects which is a killer wrt to productivity.&nbsp;</p>

            On Mac, The option key on Many Mac Keyboards are double labeled Option / Alt. Try Holding down option Key in place of the alternate key. &nbsp; On a Laptop Machine, you might have to use the Fn (Function key) then the rest of the shortcut.

<p>I can't connect to the Exchange server 2012 of my accounts with my recent Outlook.</p>
<p>The IT person recommends me to downgrade to 14.5.5 or older so that it works again.
</p>
<p>Can I do this with my current license?</p>
<p>If yes, do I need to uninstall the complete office package?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I download this particular Office 14.5.5 version?</p>

    <title>Combining Character Styles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dexter314  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combining Character Styles</h2>
                    <p>Suppose I want to highlight every word that is the same in English and French. &nbsp;I'd like to use an underline, but that may change in the future, so I create a character style. Its called FrenchSame and its 'Font' is defined as simply an underline. It's "based
 on" <em>(underlying properties).&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>This works fine on regular text. &nbsp;But when applied to text formatted with the Character Style&nbsp;<strong>Strong</strong>, this is what happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="margin-left: 30px"><strong><span>After eating at the
</span></strong><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">restaurant</span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>we went to the
</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">theatre</span><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader2" style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The bolding that was applied by the Strong style disappears when the FrenchWord underlines are added, even though the FrenchWord style has no opinion about bolding:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7b4cbc3-688b-465a-902c-01f3048ba20f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7b4cbc3-688b-465a-902c-01f3048ba20f" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I've tried a series of approaches with Character styles, Linked styles, various "based on" choices, etc., but haven't hit on one that works. Is there a way to get a Character style to simply add on to (i.e. merge with) an existing Character style?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--Kirk</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Character style adds on fine when the existing text has a Paragraph style, or has a Linked style that is applied to the whole paragraph. The problem arises when the existing text has a Character style, or has a Linked style applied
 to only part of the paragraph.</p>

<p><strong>Strong </strong>is also a character style. I regularly use it when I want bold text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot merge two character styles, they overwrite each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your style is first applying the default paragraph font (which is not bold) and then adding underlining.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you base your style on underlying properties, the bold is not an underlying property.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A linked style applied to only part of a paragraph has the characteristics of a character style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Workaround:</p>
<p>Use a macro.</p>
<p>I am a big proponent of using styles for your formatting. However I can't see an easy Style solution for this.</p>
<p>Record a macro that underlines selected text and assign it to a keyboard shortcut.
</p>

    <title>External Data &#39;Connection Properties&#39; option does nothing when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristoffermadsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Data &#39;Connection Properties&#39; option does nothing when clicked</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble changing the refresh options of my excel file, as I am not able to display the options. The button is not greyed out, it simply does not open anything when pressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My setup is in a simple testing phase, I have a .mer file that is getting updated by my program, I have linked the fields from this file into excel. Refreshing manually works like it should and updates instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to <br />
Data &gt; Refresh All (arrow) &gt; Connection Properties<br />
And click it, nothing happens. What does happen is that if I try to refresh after clicking it, the program crashes, so I'm guessing there is some sort of hang for the options opening.<br />
<br />
I am working on Mac<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

            Addendum!<br />
I fixed it using a script instead. I simply recorded the refresh with the macro record, and added that macro to a timer, giving me the desired effect.<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping me find the answer!<br />

<p>It sounds like you may be using a very early build of Excel 2016. Go to the Excel menu and choose About Excel. Make sure you have version 16.12 or later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you set up the data connection between Excel and the .mer file? What is a .mer file? Do you have an ODBC driver for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data connection and refresh options apply to web query and ODBC connections.

                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I have been receiving about 20 or so e mails per day this past week,threatening an attack on my business website if I don't pay Â£1900</p>
<p>bitcoin by the first of june 2019.The threat is ,sending abusive emails to all my contacts,blogs detrimental to me, quoting ridiculous numbers these emails will be sent to.300.000 PEOPLE! and 900.000 emails,My biggest annoyance is the fact they are sent
 from my own e mail address into my contact page of my website.My data base is very small not even 20 contacts on it!So if&nbsp; these idiots do manage to execute their threats,i will end up with the biggest contact list in the world!!once I have apologised to all
 involved business couldnt be better!Morons! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of these emails are SCAM and fake, there is technique known as email spoofing when they pretend email is your email or from trusted source. You should mark all those emails as Junk or Spam and check security of your mail server and everything else.</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />From the description, it sounds as if your document is protected for filling in forms.
<br />
<br />I do not have a Mac and am writing from my experiences with the Windows version. That version is similar, but the two are not the same. While I've used Word on a Mac, that was a long time ago. Nevertheless, I hope that I can be of some help.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards

<h2>            PowerPoint auto-shrink the Slide Master background graphic during print out.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that since&nbsp;16.0.7167.2026 built, the PowerPoint would auto-shrink the slide master background graphic, during printout to the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how it presents in PowerPoint:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d05d609d-5c03-4b89-8f71-c8c82bba3904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d05d609d-5c03-4b89-8f71-c8c82bba3904" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the printed out (see the scanned printout):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8dbfd20-c4e5-45f7-8d4c-f792668750c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8dbfd20-c4e5-45f7-8d4c-f792668750c5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what happened in the Slide Master, which it had a solid rectangle to patch/cover the text (which was revealed in the physical print out due to the background image shrinkage)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07889bab-daef-40ec-9f39-5466a42d08b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07889bab-daef-40ec-9f39-5466a42d08b9" /></a></p>

            <p>Very odd, indeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like the rectangle on the Master printed at the correct size but the rest of the master and slide content got shrunk.</p>

Cropping did not solve the issue, now the shrinking "position" has changed slightly (see the scanned printout)</p>

<p>
</p><p>On a side note, i've done another test on a HP printer (the previous printouts were on FujiXerox)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HP P1606dn LaserJet could print as it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the FujiXerox DocuCentre C6680 or C4475 still won't work.<br />

            &gt;&gt; Both printer properties do not have "Scale to Fit" options.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's an option in the PowerPoint print dialog, not the printer properties.<br />
<br />
To find it, choose File | Print then click the downward-pointing triangle next to "Full Page Slides".&nbsp; The "Scale to Fit Paper" option is there.&nbsp; Try printing with that enabled and disabled (or rather, since we know it doesn't work right however it's set now,
 set it oppositely and try that).<br />
<br />
<br />
It'd be worth changing the "High Quality" option (same place) as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't repro the problem here (Win7, PPT 16.0.7070.2036) with an HP OfficeJet 8100 printer (both fit to page settings work ok).<br />
<br />
<br />
ISTR that a number of people have had problems with FujiXerox printers (or let's say PowerPoint has had problems with the printer?).
<br />
<br />
<br />
In any case, it's worth checking to see if there are updated printer drivers available.<br />
<br />
<br />
Possible workarounds until you find a real solution: <br />
<br />
<br />
- Save the file as a PDF, then print from the PDF.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Copy the background elements on the master slide then Paste Special, As PNG and then delete the original.&nbsp; Use the PNG version instead.&nbsp; That "flattens" the rather complex graphic you're starting with ... as a test, I ungrouped it several times to get to
 its base components.&nbsp; It's got bazillions of individual objects.&nbsp; That might be what's making the printer driver throw wobblies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bazillions.&nbsp; Wobblies.&nbsp; Pardon the extreme technojargon.&nbsp; ;-)<br />

            <p>Hi Steve,<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for spending so much of time on this minor issue that is really tricky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I had already tried <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
"Scale to Fit Paper" option as well as the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"High Quality" option .</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
The printer driver has already been updated to the latest version since months ago, as an effort to ensure the printer compatibility with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the print out still has the 'shrunk' background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Yes there are quite a number of people affected by this issue, as the powerpoint template is our company's default template to use.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The flatten PNG solution works - but I don't know how many PowerPoint files I would need to change/flatten for all the users.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I had attempted to print the file on a stable release (16.0.7070.2033), (to be exact, I had uninstall my First Release, installed with Stable release, and printed a copy) it printed as it was displayed. (i.e. no shrinking issue)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I guess this is beyond something we can troubleshoot around (since this is really tricky and happened only on FujiXerox + recent Office 365 First release)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worst come to worst, I might just reinstall Office 365 stable release on affected users' PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks very much Steve, let's hope Microsoft product team will pick this up and fix it. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone, I need a little help I have an Excel 2013 spreadsheet&nbsp;that uses the following code. As you cans see this code hides certain fixed rows based on a selection in cell B8.&nbsp;But I have now been asked to allow a user to added as many row as they want
 to and maintain the formatting that is in the first row cells.&nbsp; The problem is that the number of row can change based on how many rows the user inputs.&nbsp; I do not know how to code a button to input rows (one at a time)&nbsp;and maintain the formatting and how to
 still hide rows based on the selection in cell B8.&nbsp; Could really use some help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Instead of specifying the number of rows, what about always having one spare row below the records in each section and then when a user enters some data in the spare row, the system will automatically add another row below it ready for another record.</p>

 will automatically add another row below it ready for another record. would be great.&nbsp; Could this be done for additional sections too i.e. row 31, 45 sections.&nbsp; Also would the hide part still would in the code.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The blank row at the bottom of each record section must remain. If Deleted, then the code will fail. I have temporarily inserted a message note&nbsp;in the cell in column B
<em>"Do not delete the blank row below the data. (this message can be deleted)"</em> and as per the note, you can delete the message because it is only there for your initial&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the user commences inserting a new record and enters data in column A of the blank row, another blank row will be inserted below ready for the next record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a user inadvertently commences to enter data in column A and the additional row is inserted, the entire row where the user has commenced entering data can be deleted and it will just leave the one blank row at the bottom of the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The start of each data section&nbsp;and the blank row at the bottom of each data section are named ranges. You can see the names by selecting Formulas ribbon -&gt; Name Manager. Each time a blank row is inserted, the code re-assigns the defined name to the new blank
 row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rows that are to be hidden are referenced in relation to the named ranges.</p>
