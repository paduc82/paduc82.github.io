<h2>            Excel 2013 on Win 7&#58; Clustered Column chart &#47; fill on negative values</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Office 2013 on Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A formula in my data set yields percentages that could be either positive or negative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A pivot table feeds a Clustered Column chart that depicts both positive and negative values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scope: I want the negative values to show up in red / I already formatted data series / fill / solid fill + invert if negative + Blue for positives and Red for Negatives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem: Every time I open the .xlsx file, negative column fill color defaults back to white no matter what I try... Any suggestions???
</p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our tech support guys&nbsp;tried the same file in a number of different PC's&nbsp; around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens it is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>not</strong></span> happening only in my&nbsp;PC so a full reinstall will not solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching on the web it looks like it is a known problem in version&nbsp;2013 (please fix it!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I received this link from our tech support to a Vb solution to the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/invert-if-negative-bug-fix-justin-Newport</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to Justin Newport who shared his solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Only drawback is you need to at least understand a bit of VBA and the VB Editor to make it work.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">The solution uses the "<em>On-Open</em>" event to trigger VBA that forces the fill color you define for
<em>"BackColor" within</em> your code.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">In my case, I removed the line of code that relates to the "<em>ForeColor</em>" as I wanted to be able to change it as needed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>And it works like a charm...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>btw. I could've switched to a Stacked Column, but that one does not allow me to have Data Labels located at the outside end, where I wanted them to be...</p>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business - fit for purpose&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I first tried OneDrive for Business about a year ago.&nbsp; Naively I thought, perhaps somewhat similar as personal OneDrive.&nbsp; Needed someplace to have an online storage for my workfiles and make use of sharing capabilities with coleagues and clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My god, was I mistaken:&nbsp;Worked at it for 6 months:&nbsp;limit of 20,000 files,&nbsp;2 gig maximum, diassallowed file types, length of names, not at all user friendly, synch problems, remedies that did not work, remedies that were not remedies (start again), useless
 sharing capabilities.&nbsp; So I gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded Office 365 to 2016 version, and thought, why not try again.&nbsp; Nothing has changed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wasted 2 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; How could Microsoft even sell such an unfit for purpose product?&nbsp; They should refund every customer that has ever tried to use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be the way some software companies are going.&nbsp;&nbsp; They find a gap in their product lineup, so they fill it with&nbsp;a peice of&nbsp;software that kinda does the intended job, perhaps rename it, and do nothing to fix it.&nbsp; In the case of odfb, the same
 problems exist today as for its entire life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have never seen a piece of software that has attracted such a large volume of negative forum reporting and very little positive reporting.</p>

            OneDrive for Business even today is still not fir for business usage. Large ODfB users will find some files won't sync. Even now I'm troubleshooting such an issue, I copied some of none syncing the files out, let ODfB revise the count of none syncing files
 down, copied them back and guess what. ODfB deleted some of those files.....Jesus please Help me!

<p>uhm... I have some colleagues ask me support for some folders and files not sync, delete files and they appear again.</p>
<p>We think, in our company, that OneDrive is not reliable.</p>
<p>We will change system...</p>
<p>In the next days I will ask to Microsoft for a Support and&nbsp;explanation for this situation...</p>
<p>I will notify here the answer if it's good for other!!!</p>

            I am experiencing exactly the same problem. I have now had three diff codes sent to me none which work when I place the in the required box. I can't access any emails which I need to do so on a daily basis. It sates the codes are being automatically sent
 to an old mobile number despite me saying this is no longer in use. Why do people have to mess with what is working well I don't know.

<h2>            MMS problems</h2>
                    I have a Nokia Lumia 920 and I have had it for about 1 month, at the time of writing, and ever since I have had it I have had problems when trying to send or receive a picture attached to a text. My Access Point settings are as they were when I got the
 phone on a 2 year contract from Tesco Mobile, it had selected Tesco. I thought about trying to change them but none of the others listed had anything to do with the provider I am with, besides my internet and Email all work fine. Whenever I get sent an MMS
 message I get a message from O2 (despite the fact I am&nbsp;with Tesco) with a hyperlink to a part of the O2 site which never loads the picture, it just buffers indefinitely (even with Wi-Fi). I thought the message should show up in the thread, but it doesn't even
 tell me there is an MMS. Also photo's that are sent to me on Facebook don't show up in the thread, I don't know if they should or not. Whenever I attempt to send a picture, it appears to send and the tells me 5 minutes that it

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Little bit of history:</p>
<p>Tesco mobile is a son/daughter of O2, so that is why you are redirected to their page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MMS is provided by mobile operator, so you will need to contact them for settings.

<h2>            Microsoft Word 365 Font Malfunction</h2>
                    <p>When I convert the font to an Arabic dotted font , the whole document becomes disfigured! It also results in Microsoft Word operating slowly!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This wasn't happening before I formatted my computer. Since formatting it I've reinstalled office and now experiencing this fault.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Creating a Table of References in Table Format</h2>
                    <p>I want to create a reference section to my document that is in the form of a table rather that just a list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the concept&nbsp;of a Table of Contents as an example, I would like it to look like this:.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Style 1</p>
<p>

<p style="margin-left: 60px">

<tr>
<td>Style 5</td>
<td>Style 8</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to do this as a ToC but cant seem to work out how I could format it in this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possibel to do this or, if not, does anyone know of an alternative method</p>

<h2>            Incomplete loading of internet page</h2>
                    
<p>I have a netbook and a desktop.&nbsp; Netbook is wireless.&nbsp; I can load a page on the netbook, but exact page will not load on the desktop.&nbsp; Exact same internet address on both computers.&nbsp; Page on netbook fully loads, but on desktop parts of the page will be missing.&nbsp;
 Example:&nbsp; when I load American Express bank home page on netbook the current interest rate for their savings account will show.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;go to this page on desktop page will load but interest rate information is missing, otherwise page is exactly&nbsp;the same as&nbsp;on
 netbook.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t reliably backup macros, autotext, quickparts</h2>
                    <p>In order to safeguard my macros, autotext and quickparts, I've been backing up the relevant files (normal.dot, normalemail.dot, building blocks ) from&nbsp;%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Templates</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I restore the backed up files to&nbsp;</p>
<p>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Templates<br />
</p>
<p>they often do not have the backed up data (macros etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been restarting the machine before and after to ensure it isn't some kind of memory effect at work.</p>
<p>To make it more puzzling, it is not consistent: ....sometimes it does work. More often it doesn't</p>

<h2>            Outlook password prompt after migration Exchange Online</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>

<p>We've an hybrid environment between Exchange Online and Exchange 2010 and with a ADFS for the federation services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After an user is migrated to Exchange Online, the user has a password prompt. If the user enter its password, the prompt is gone forever. We would like to remove this password prompt.</p>
<p>The modern authentication is activated on the Exchange Online side and the for Office 2013 with the correct registry key. The ADFS website is in the trusted zone with full permissions.</p>
<p>I don't know why Outlook asks for the password. On the network level, I see that the blocking step is after contacting autodiscover-s.outlook.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone has an idea?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi JulienBROCHET8872,</p>
<p>When the modern authentication is activated, users need to type in the password at the first time. After that, the password prompt will not appear again until the user changes his password in Azure AD. It is by design. Given the situation, would you mind

<p>Hello !</p>
<p>Thanks for the response. But I don't understand why the password is needed. The STS is responsible for any authentication. Password are not synchronized into Azure AD. For me, even for the first connection, if Outlook needs my credentials, why can It be
 a seamless experience where Outlook is talking with my STS with an OAuth protocol (as it's activated on both side)?</p>
<p>I found nowhere explication of this prompt or if it's normal or not.</p>

            Hi bv1,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            <p>Have you tried opening it at all?&nbsp; What program tries to open it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot change a file's format by simply changing the filetype indicator - that's like changing your own name from Kaz to Zak - only the name changed, you are still you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing I would do is to open Excel and use File --&gt; Open and browse to that file and select it to be opened.&nbsp; If it opens, then good - more about that later.&nbsp; If it complains about the file format being wrong, then there are other issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file opened above, then something has just mis-associated .xlsx type files with some graphic file application.&nbsp; You can fix this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Browse to the file, Right-click on it and choose Open With... and follow the prompts to eventually select Excel to open it with and be sure and click the "Always open files of this type with ..." option.&nbsp; That should get the icon straightened out for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it did not open directly from Excel and told you that the file format was wrong, get in touch with whoever sent you the email and tell them that they apparently sent you a bad file, to please send it again and make sure it is an Excel file.</p>

    <title>How can I get Word to give me the word count when it is restored - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul rittman  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get Word to give me the word count when it is restored &#40;down&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Not sure how to describe this. Often, when I open a Word document, I want to see the word count. I can see it easily enough when it is maximized; but when it is only half the screen (what is called Restored?), I can't see it. I can see a few other statistics
 about the document, when it is restored, but not the word count.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: OK I see that I can push the word count towards the left of the document window (whether it is restored or maximized) by removing items that MS Word is set to tell me along that bottom row.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I suppose I can live with that, but is there another way to get Word to give me the word count, without removing more and more items to the left of the Word Count?</p>

            <p>Click the Review tab on the ribbon. The Word Count button in the Proofing group will show the count (it's the same dialog you would get by clicking the word count on the status bar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the status bar count is concerned, I've always found that three of the six possible items to the left of the word count -- vertical page position, line number, and column -- are usually useless. If you rarely or never use sections or restart page
 numbering, you can also dispense with the formatted page number and the section number. That will place the word count within an inch of the left edge of the Word window.</p>

<h2>            Powerful hardware but no good games available for lumia 620</h2>
                    I migrated to WP8 recently, earlier I had Xperia mini pro running android ICS, now I own a lumia 620. Happy to own a windows phone but I don't understand why graphic rich games are not available for lumia 620, I can see them listed for 820,920. For example,
 am not able to install asphalt 7 in my 620 :( . To my surprise my old android with single core 1Ghz and adreno 205 GPU is able to run this beautiful game But lumia 620 having double hardware capacity 1Ghz S4plus dual core and powerful Adreno 305 can't.? ICS
 and WP 8 are very different OS but why games are not optimised for lumia 620?

            <p>There is no solution, but some info that might help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The arrival of these games is a sign that wp is finally gaining traction among game developers. So far, most windows phones sold have been 820 and 920, which is why they may have not bothered to optimize the games for lower RAM devices. In fact, the first
 512 MB ram device started selling only a week ago in India. Once the 512 RAM devices gain traction just like the 820s and 920s of the windows phone world, games will be optimized to run on them too.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it makes you feel any better, I have a 820 but I cannot play Spiderman game from Gameloft because it wants some 4 plus GB free space. How upset do you think I would be :D It is just a matter of waiting for the game to be updated and I am sure it will
 happen. </p>

            csrss.exe is a Windows process called Client Server Runtime Process. But to be 100% sure you need to check location where it is loaded from because some writers of malware programs, such as viruses, worms, and Trojans deliberately give their processes
 the same file name to escape detection, see here: http://www.file.net/process/csrss.exe.html

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an X2-02 with firmware version 10.90.</p>
<p>I searched the web for any update available to, perhaps get ride of&nbsp;bugs, and I did found one here:
<a href="http://www.btusers.com.ar/nan/nokia/releases.php?id=2218645&amp;rid=6975978703&amp;pid=3682065312&amp;firm=10.91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>It's the version 10.91</p>
<p>But when I&nbsp;tried&nbsp;to install it using Nokia Suite (v. 3.3.89), I got the message: no update available for your device!!!</p>
<p>How this is possible!!?? There's one on the net! And&nbsp;some&nbsp;people did the update (perhaps by using commercial Boxes... don't know)</p>
<p>So I'm here to ask Nokia to fix this issue so we can update our devices.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>(sorry for my english)</p>

            You appear to have an extra 0 between x and 8. Please confirm.
<br />
<br />I have seen 3 80070070 codes, each with a different extension code. But apparently all 3 of them are indicating that there is not enough free space on the HD.
<br />
<br />What is the total size of your HD?
<br />How much free space do you have on the HD? 
<br />
<br />Here is a collection of tips and tools you can use to help cleanup your HD to free up space.

<h2>            Error while sharing Restricted link to external user</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am trying to share a file/folder with an external resource. I am creating a Restricted link and sharing the same to the external resource. Now this resource when tries
 to open the link, he gets this error message </span><span>“Access Denied” or “Sorry, you don’t have access to this page. Approval awaiting.".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please make me understand this problem and solution to this too.</span></p>
<p>Points:</p>
<p>a. Am I missing some permission level in my site/library.&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. Do I need to give edit rights to Everyone in the Site permissions too. If I give this, will anyone who doesn't even have user credentials will be able to access this file.</p>
<p>c. If nothing works, Do I always have to to to Access Rights Request and give permissions? But I want to avoid this step.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please suggest....</span></p>

<p><span>You may first want to check the permission level for the shared file/folder. To do this, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Navigate to your SharePoint site.</span></li><li><span>Go to document library, click the ellipses beside the shared document&gt;Share</span></li><li><span>Go to ‘Shared with’&gt;Advanced, as shown below</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64365f0a-4bfc-41d1-90c9-c5c38a8c60a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64365f0a-4bfc-41d1-90c9-c5c38a8c60a6" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. On the ribbon, click Permissions&gt;Check Permissions.</span>
</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8179484f-c965-44ab-b983-6c01e6e1c8bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8179484f-c965-44ab-b983-6c01e6e1c8bb" /></a></p>
<p><span>Enter the name of the external user with whom you shared the document and click ‘Check now’. See which permission you have given to the user.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can try sharing the file/folder by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>In SharePoint Online site, go to document library.</span></li><li><span>Click ellipses beside the document, which you wish to share&gt; Share.</span></li><li><span>Enter the email address of the external user, select ‘Edit’ and View’, as per your requirement.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once the external user will receive the email, he will be required to sign with his log in credentials.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As far as the points are concerned, here is the clarification:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Please try the steps above to share the file and then check the outcome.</span></li><li><span>As you only wanted to share the file/folder, you don’t have to change the permission in Site Permission.
</span></li><li><span>If you have given the permission for a file, you don’t have to go to Access Rights and Initiation to grant the access. We have to grant permission only when user is trying to access the Site.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

    <title>Office365&#58; How to share contacts &#38; calendar within an - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeanmcr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office365&#58; How to share contacts &#38; calendar within an organization</h2>
                    <p>Sounds like a straight forward thing to expect in 2018.<br />
</p>
<p>I found this topic which is really to the point:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10157/sharing-calendar-and-contacts-in-office-365</p>
<p>
</p><p>It explains perfectly what to do.<br />
<br />
There's just a small font note at some point, stating:&nbsp;<strong>Note: You cannot access shared contacts list for a shared mailbox from Outlook Web App</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Duh! that's exactly what I was trying to do. What the hell? <br />
Does that means I cannot access the shared contacts from Office365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joke apart, any info on how to achieve this would be welcome.</p>

<p>Hi JeanMCR,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your details. Based on the link you provided, it is impossible to access shared contacts list for a shared mailbox from Outlook Web App. As a workaround, you can do it in Outlook 2016 desktop client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand you want the feature in Outlook Web App. In this situation, you can share your thoughts with our related engineers via
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/313228--outlook-on-the-web-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook on the Web UserVoice</a>. Your understanding will be much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>

    <title>Build 16281 Fails to mount ISO image files. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnny_55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 16281 Fails to mount ISO image files.</h2>
                    <p>Wondering if anyone else has this issue. After updating my test laptop with Build 16281 and also the previous build, I could no longer mount ISO image files. Went ahead and did a clean install of 16281 but the issue still remains. Was never an issue for
 me before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reported to Feedback Hub so hopefully will be corrected soon.</p>

</p><blockquote>I just copied the iso for Windows 10 pro x64 insiders build 16278 (didn't make one for 16281) to a flash drive and was able to successfully mount and execute the setup.exe file from within Windows 10 pro x64 insiders build 16281. &nbsp;It worked the
 same as it has in the past. &nbsp;This is not using a virtual machine. </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And you were able to do that directly from the flash card? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I could mount the image was to copy it to the hard drive on Build 16281. I did try multiple ISO images with all the same result from the flash card as some other members here. Using the same flash card I could mount it on my main computer running
 release version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something has changed since Build 16251, as reported by&nbsp;<span>Matt Yantis. I can only confirm this on Builds 16278 and 16281 which was clean installed using rufus.</span></p>

<p>Yes, directly from the flash drive.</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1 L2TP VPN through a NAT-T environment configuration</h2>
                    <p>I'm running a L2TP/IPsec VPN behind a NAT-T router/firewall, and have configured appropriate ports for port forwarding to the VPN server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've discovered that the Windows Platform requires a registry entry in order to work in this environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/926179/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/926179/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I'm currently unable to connect the Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1 (Nokia Lumia 920)&nbsp;to the VPN, and I'm assuming this is because I'm missing a setting to support the NAT-T environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to support this connectivity for a Windows Phone?&nbsp; Is there a planned update to support this type of environment?</p>
