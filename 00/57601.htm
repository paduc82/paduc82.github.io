            <p>OK I find the solution on the below site and it works -) The idea is that the Windows Creator update has modify the logitech&nbsp;wheel g920 registry: in the g920 registry in "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\GameInput\Devices", we have to modify the "RacingWheel" value (some bytes has been reversed).
</p>
<p>=&gt; It would be nice that the microsoft installer team takes care in the future Windows updates to no more modify this registry with bad values. </p>

    <title>File Explorer opens new folders in new windows, occasionally opening - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lightdiscordant  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Explorer opens new folders in new windows, occasionally opening multiple new windows, despite folder options.</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 10 Pro 64-bit, and recently I keep encountering an error where whenever I try to open a folder through File Explorer it will open it in a new window instead of the same one. In fact, typically it will open the folder in&nbsp;<em>two</em>
 new windows. I've gone through the folder options unchecking and rechecking the "open each folder in the same window" and "Double-click to open an item," but it hasn't helped. I've likewise tried "reset folders" and restoring all the View options to defaults.
 I've also run the sfc /scannow command through the Command Prompt (running as administrator, of course), but it failed to find any problems. I've run a full scan with Kaspersky Labs Antivirus and found nothing, so I trust that the issue isn't a virus or anything
 similar. What research I've done suggests it's a corruption somewhere in the User or System profiles, but aside from the "sfc /scannow" that didn't help I can't seem to find any Windows 10 solutions to the problem. What should my next step in trying to diagnose
 and fix this be?

<p>2. On the ‚ÄúMouse Properties‚Äù window, in the ‚ÄúDouble-Click speed‚Äù section, move the slider to adjust the speed</p>
<p>3. Click ‚ÄúApply‚Äù and then click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the above did not help, I would suggest you to follow the below recommended methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>

    <title>Networking username &#38; password in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pmsg1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Networking username &#38; password in Windows 10</h2>
                    I just updated one of my laptops to Windows 10. Now it will not connect to my Windows 7 Pro desktop. Well, it will connect to it via Media player, but it will not connect to files. When I try to connect to the Win 7 computer any other way it pops up a
 username and password box. When I enter my username and password and press enter it says that the username or password are not correct. I have tried rebooting both computers to no avail. The Win 7 machine shows up in the my network section but it will not
 connect. When my laptop was Windows 7 Home before I upgraded last night, it connected just fine to all of the other computers on my network. Am I missing a setting change or firewall setting that needs to be changed or added to make it work? Please help. Thank
 you in advance!

            <p>Okay, <br />
<br />
I ran the troubleshooter. However, I am not having trouble with internet connections. I am having trouble with shared files. I ran the shared files troubleshooter and the result is: "You don't have permissions to access the share." Prior to Win 10, all we had
 to do was have the same username/password on all of the computers in order to share files. What is different now? And how can I fix it?

            Thanks for the reply Davmax1589. I tried your idea and it doesn't work. The&nbsp;first time I&nbsp;tried to connect to the Win 7's files after rebooting them with your suggestion, it did connect to the&nbsp;Win 7&nbsp;network connection.&nbsp;It actually showed the shared files.&nbsp;When
 I&nbsp;clicked on one of the shared files it brought up the&nbsp;password pop up box again and I could not progress.&nbsp;I then closed the File Explorer window and&nbsp;started a new one, and it was back to the&nbsp;username/password box just from clicking onto the computer from
 network connections again just like before the change.&nbsp;I have no problem connecting to the files on the computer that was updated to Win 10, but to go the other direction it did not work. I tried a suggestion on another thread and it worked. I just had to
 rename my the other computer. I just added an "a" to the computer's name and now they connect both directions just fine. The only thing I can figure is that it may have not been

            You can recover the password&nbsp;if you start the lost password process and IF you know your account name and you made sure that your account details include a phone number (preferred mobile for receive a code by text) and or an alternate email address, both
 can be used to verify that you are legit by receiving a code that you then enter to verify you.&nbsp;If you do not know your user/account name create another account and make sure to include all the required details in the account and record the user name for future
 reference.

<h2>            skype cuts off when dialing,</h2>
                    When I dial my friend it cuts off after about 15 secs, is this because my brother put credit on my account and it has now run out, if so how do I get free skype again?

<p>1. Not a good idea. If he used his own credit card on your account he now won't be able to use it to fund his own account.2 Yes - that's the reason.</p>

    <title>Games in fullscreen mode stutter and image is tearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ò≥æÒÄÒúóµªµΩ∫æ≤  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games in fullscreen mode stutter and image is tearing</h2>
                    I have a problem with my Windows 10 1809.Whenever I decide to launch a game in fullscreen mode it has an awful stuttering and image tearing to it.Problem can be solved by turning vsync on or by switching off fullscreen optimization in properties of exe
 file of the game.The thing is I cant play with vsync on,because of the input lag and overall lagginess it gives to a game.Also,directx 12 games have even worse problem with tearing (not only in fullscreen mode) and only turning on vsync can fix it.Had the
 same problem in 1803.My setup is laptop with i7-4700mq processor (intel HD Graphics 4600) and dedicated gtx 860m videocard working in Optimus.Can you recommend me solution that'll alow me to get rid of this stuttering for good and to launch directx 12&nbsp; games
 without vsync on?

            Hi Igor,
<br />Try to find correct video driver or at least try to reinstall current one.
<br />Check Windows system files by sfc /scannow command.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have latest drivers both for nvidia an intel.Had them reinstalled plenty.The problem always remains.I think,it could be in intel driver,because I launched a direcx 11 game with fullscreen optimization when only upgraded to 1809 without stuttering,then
 collapsed it without exiting,changed few options in intel's 3D panel,opend it again and stuttering reappeared.Issue with directx 12 is always present though.I've experienced this problem on a whole set of different drivers.I even tried to install once Nvidia's
 old driver back from 2015,but games wouldn't work with him,rendering horrible artifacts.Itry scan command now,I'll tell if it brought any good.This problem,if I remember it correctly,appeared with the creator update btw&nbsp;</p>

            I do not understand what you are doing with your link but downloading it will take a long time. Normally using Sky Drive such a file will take much less than a minute.

            <p>It's a full dump (438MB) so it takes some time to download.</p>
<p>Your PC is crashing in 'pssdklbf.sys' which is part of tbbMeter. So I will suggest you to uninstall tbbMeter.</p>
<p>tbbMeter is some sort of broadband monitor.</p>

            There is no such thing on my PC as tbbMeter. When BSOD appears it says it is to do with afd.sys and not pssdklbf.sys. Apparently afd.sys is to do with the network and it all started when i reinstalled my driver. The driver is up to date.<br />

<p>Alternatively try searching for free 3rd party viewer software on the web.</p>

            Nothing wrong....Windows 7 does not support animated .gif files.<br />
<br />
Have you tried the freeware IrfanView for viewing your animated .gif files?<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
IrfanView<br />
<a href="http://www.irfanview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.irfanview.com/</a><br />
(get the plug-ins too)<br />
<br />
To view .gif thumbs open IrfanView and go to...File / Thumbnails...and<br />
navigate to the folder the .gif files are archived in. Double left click a<br />
.gif to see it animate in the main view window.<br />
<br />
Also there's a free download at the following link that may be worth a try:<br />

            <p><span>Hi Kathy,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community forums!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From the description that you have posted, I understand that you need to set up email rules in Mail app.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Outlook is an email client from Microsoft which has an option of setting up email rules.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, you cannot set up rules in Windows 8 Mail App. There are only few options and settings; you can change on Mail app.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For more information on Mail App refer to these links:</span></p>

    <title>Transfer Win 10 license to a new PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vladimir jelovac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer Win 10 license to a new PC</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I bought a new PC and read that I can transfer my Windows 10 license to it and I have a few questions.<br />
<br />
#1 <br />
<br />
Few years ago I used Win 7 Pro license to install my two PC's.<br />
<br />
When FREE update came I upgraded both of them to Windows 10 x64 PRO.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I assembled a new PC which will replace one of them and I want to transfer the license to it from the one it is replacing.<br />
<br />
The question is if I transfer the activation license will I lose the activation on the second PC or not?<br />
<br />
#2<br />
<br />
What are the steps to do the actual license transfer?

<p>The simple answer to your question is no you cannot transfer your (free upgrade) licenses from 1PC device to the another, the free upgrade is tied to the original PC device (this was part of the original agreement) - (similar as for OEM version of the OS),
 for the rest of it's working life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to purchase a retail version / orkey, to get activation on your (gamma) PC.</p>

    <title>How do I change the keyboard hardware language &#40;Spanish to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georich15  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change the keyboard hardware language &#40;Spanish to English&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I am in Ecuador and just bought the Microsoft All In One keyboard but the layout is for Spanish. Does anyone know how I can change this to English or disable the Spanish? The default language on my Windows 8.1 machine is English so it is not a matter of
 changing the Language or Region settings. I think it is an issue of changing the keyboard hardware itself. Your help is greatly appreciated. I have been all over the city trying to find a US keyboard with no luck and deadlines loom, I want to get this one
 to work.

            Hi Georich,<br />
<br />
<br />
To be able to change the keyboard language, you must first download the language you want to change it to.<br />
<br />
Since you've mentioned that the default language of your device is English, you may follow the steps in changing the keyboard language under the "<strong>Change the default keyboard layout or input method</strong>" selection from this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17424/windows-change-keyboard-layout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it works.<br />

            Hello,<br />
<br />
If the only thing changed is the processor then no.&nbsp; You shouldnt have to reinstall.&nbsp; But if this requires a new mother board as well to complete the upgrade to the new processor then it would be advised to do a clean install.&nbsp; The reasons would be due to the
 fact that Windows would not have the proper drivers for the new mother board in place and it would cause issues, if Windows even booted at all after the change.&nbsp; If it does you might notice lag and other things not operating properly.&nbsp; As the new hardware
 profile/drivers would not match those used at the time of install.<br />

            Hi Smudge,<br />
<br />
Skype history remains same when ever you log-in to different computers using same id. you need not back-up or sync the Skype history if you are using same id on different computers. If you are using different id and you want to back-up the data, Try the following
 steps.<br />
<br />
<p>Type <strong>%APPDATA%\Skype</strong> in RUN to open Skype‚Äôs Appdata folder, there you will able to see the folders in the name of usernames used to login in that local system. Make sure you have exit the Skype application from tray or you can choose to
 sign out. Then just copy the folder with your username to your desired location for backup.</p>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<p>1. Press Windows + R &gt;&nbsp;<strong>%APPDATA%\Skype</strong></p>
<p>2. find the folder which is same as your username.</p>
<p>3. copy and paste it in your backup location.</p>
<p>You can use the same folder in another computer to have the chat history there in another computer.</p>
<p>If you are using any cloud file sync service (like Dropbox, SkyDrive, Google Drive, etc.) between different computers, you may use that to sync that between different computers and backup as well.</p>
<p>In case you are concerned about <strong>security</strong> about using Skype in shared computer, you can delete your Skype username folder to erase all trace you have had in that computer related to Skype.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Hope this helps! Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.<br />

            <p>Hi Vijay B</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logging in with the same ID on the PC, or the Laptop, produces 2 different chat histories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should the <strong>chatsync</strong> folder in the <strong>Skype\(My ID)</strong> folder contain the same files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your reply&nbsp; implies that Skype is storing chat history somewhere other than on the local computer and downloading it as part of the login process.&nbsp; Otherwise I do not see how things can be synchronised between 2 PCs unless it happens when you login.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, the history on my 2 PCs is definitely not synced.</p>

            <p>Vijay's answer is correct, but it is not the complete answer. The correct part is that messages are synced between devices (these days using OneDrive by default I think), this is&nbsp;however only valid for officially the last 30 days*, though I have messages
 that go back three months on a synced device. Not sure if I have simply been using Skype on this one for three months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have an older laptop that has messages that go way back, over 2 years. So this is an important nuance to Vijay's answer. Devices that have been running Skype for a longer period have locally saved chat history for that period, and only 30 days of
 that is synced.</p>
<p>Meaning, if you are migrating to a different device and want to keep that (longer) local chat history, you DO have to manually copy it.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 flickering screen, have to pay for repair&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I got this pro4 when I took a computer class in school. I found the screen flickers when I turn the brightness under 40.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to Toronto (I was living in Hamilton) to exchange three or four times but unfortunately all those pro4 has the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The store staff told me it will be fine after update. I trusted them and waited until now, out of warranty.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This video was right after the update last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVs1HEM-XAo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVs1HEM-XAo&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/iVs1HEM-XAo?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/iVs1HEM-XAo?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>I left massage here, got a suggestion to call support centre and I did. The support centre said this is not the flickering screen they will exchange for free. So I have to pay more then 400 dollars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know. Maybe I'm too censorious. But my old computer and my friends' computer never have this kind of flicker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just want to ask if anyone's pro4 have this kind of flicker? How to deal with it? Thank you! It is ruining my eyesight.</p>

            Hello LinWang3,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for bringing this up. To be able to understand the issue better, let us know more details by answering the following questions:<br />
<br />
‚Ä¢ Were there any changes made prior to this issue aside from installing Windows update/s?<br />
‚Ä¢ How frequent is the screen flickering? What's the duration (or length of time) when this issue happened?<br />
‚Ä¢ Does the issue happened after waking the device from sleep/hibernation or from normal startup?<br />
‚Ä¢ What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?<br />
<br />
To help solve this issue, let's try a force shutdown/restart of your Surface. Performing a Forced Shutdown is like removing the battery from a laptop or unplugging a desktop PC. It resets the hardware and clears all the cache and memory for your hardware. To
 do this, here's how:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*The Surface may boot to UEFI. This is normal. Exit the UEFI without any changes made.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't help, you can check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12374/windows-10-troubleshoot-screen-flickering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to troubleshoot screen flickering of your Surface Pro 4.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.

</span></span></span><span>I think it happens every time when you using the computer under lower brightness no matter how I start the pro4.</span></p>

            Thanks for getting back to us. We would like to add few more questions. Did you attempt to adjust the brightness to 30% and up? Were there any changes? Usually, some flickering issues occur if the brightness level is set either from medium or up to high
 level.<br />
<br />
Since you have checked the hyperlink provided, did you notice if the Task Manager flickers? By the way, you mentioned that you uninstall the display adapter under 'Safe Mode'. Did you check as well if it flickers on that mode? If it still flickers, there's
 a chance that this is a software issue.<br />
<br />
To know if it's already hardware issue, we suggest that you boot your Surface to UEFI. UEFI is an environment that exists completely outside of Windows and other installed applications. You can check it
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023531/surface-how-to-use-surface-uefi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> on how to go to the UEFI settings. Once you are on the interface (or settings), please observe if it's flickering
 as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep us posted on the outcome.

<p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have to close the automatic brightness mode because it is usually low. I tried to adjust brightness to 30%. It is most stable situation but if I use the computer for longer then 20 minutes I can still notice the little flicker especially when I look
 at white web page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The Task Manager flickers as the whole screen does.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The safe mode and UEFI both cannot adjust brightness. I just tried UEFI. It will turn the brightness over 50% I think. The frequency of the flicker is different. When brightness is under 20%, the screen flickers at fast speed. Under UEFI, the screen will
 suddenly become brighter for 1 second and then go back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I don't want to solve this problem by adjust the brightness to over 30%. </p>
<p>First, I use computer everyday for a long time. Brighter screen makes my eyes uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>Second, if all the computers of all the brands have this problem, I won't be so upset with Microsoft. I used my old computer Toshiba, my friends' Mac. They never have this problem. Even my classmate's Microsoft Pro3 doesn't flicker when its brightness is
 at 14-18%.</p>
<p>Third, I tried to delete all apps I had on this pro4, but the flicker never goes away. I don't think it's about software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you have solution to my problem. My vision decreased a lot since I changed to pro4. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Barb</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this method but it's not working. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b32a3d6d-bfaa-4545-9168-72ccfe583caa?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b32a3d6d-bfaa-4545-9168-72ccfe583caa?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And I think it may be different problem. His surface book only flickers when using battery but my pro4 flickers with or without charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pro4 is definitely a good product but this screen is driving me crazy. I went to store so many times but no one can find out the solution. Please help me solve the flickering screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
<p>

<h2>            A virus deleted my system32 folder on win7, how do I get it back&#63;</h2>
                    I was just on a website that I have been to many times before, and the Win7 Antispyware 2012 virus shut down my internet and deleted my system 32 file folder. I deleted the virus, but my system32 folder is gone. Is there any way i can get it back? There
 is nothing in my recycle bin.

            <p>Jennifer</p>
<p>I am a little sceptical about your claim that the malware has deleted your system32 folder on the basis that I think that your computer would not&nbsp;boot if the files in the folder had been deleted. I could be mistaken. Have you checked to see if they have
 been hidden?</p>
<p><span>You may need to show hidden files. Type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select View, Advanced Settings and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files"
 is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></p>

            &nbsp;If that folder were deleted, your system wouldn't boot, so I assume you made your post on another PC? &nbsp;If, after doing what Gerry suggests, it's still really not there, it's time to restore to factory settings or reinstall Windows, whichever is easiest.

<p><span>Go to your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; Drivers and Downloads Section &gt; Key in your Model number &gt; Look for latest Vista Drivers
 for it &gt; Download/install them.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />

<br />
<br />
</span><span>1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>

            Hmmmm..... Is your card reader an SD one? or does it support Micro SD. Maybe your Micro SD card came with an adapter, that would help if your card reader supports SD and not the Micro one :-)

<p><span>Hi 36spot,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the make/model number of your Printer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you try re-installing the drivers for your printer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Check the Print Spooler Service</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you see an error message about the print spooler, spooler subsystem, or spooler resources, you might need to change and then restart the Print
 Spooler service on your computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To change or restart the Print Spooler service</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Administrative Tools by clicking the<span>Start</span> button, clicking <span>Control Panel</span>, clicking&nbsp;<span>System and Maintenance</span>, and then clicking
<span>Administrative Tools</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Double-click&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Services</span>.
 If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 the&nbsp; <span>Print Spooler</span> service, and then click <span>Properties</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the&nbsp; <span>General</span> tab, next to <span>Startup type</span>, make sure that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Automatic</span> is selected.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 the service is not already running, under&nbsp; <span>Service status</span>, click<span>Start</span>, and then click<span>OK</span>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Check the status of LPD (Line printer daemon) and LPR (Line Printer) Ports</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; Go to Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Program and Features.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click

    <title>Skype login is not working but MS login is working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelmack1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype login is not working but MS login is working</h2>
                    Skype seems to have several issues today. I can log in to my MS windows account as evidenced by the fact that I'm writing this post, but sometimes Skype doesn't recognize that account any more.&nbsp; I'm positive I typed the account and password correctly.&nbsp;
 I recently "upgraded" to skype for windows10, but I liked the old version much better. But that's an issue for a different post.

            This is Qualcomm Atheros Driver. But there may be other drivers present in your minidump.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Hi Robert
<br />
<br />This is caused by the device driver for your Qualcom Atheros Network card
<br />
<br />You should go to the support page for your PC on the manufacturers website, then download and install the QualcomAtheros Network driver they recommend. That may well be an older driver, but it sill be compatible with your system . ..

            Hi Akiza, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything&nbsp;!
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Click this link:&nbsp;
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10&nbsp;
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes:&nbsp;
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot&nbsp;
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot&nbsp;
<br />3. If Available enable CSM&nbsp;
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot&nbsp;
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order&nbsp;
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>
