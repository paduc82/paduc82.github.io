<h2>            SAVE AS - NO PERMISSION</h2>
                    <p>I KEEP GETTING THE BOX THAT SAYS NO PERMISSION TO SAVE, BUT I HAVE GONE THROUGH EVERY FOLDER AND I WENT TO THE "GET INFO" AND MY SHARING PERMISSIONS ON EACH ONE IS READ AND WRITE. I EVEN HAD AN OFFICE PERSON ON PHONE TAKE OVER MY SCREEN AND LOOK.. YET, IT
 STILL IS HAPPENING 50% OF THE TIME, EVEN IF READ AND WRITE PERMISSIONS ARE ON..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT ELSE CAN I DO? ITS DRIVING ME BONKERS AS I NEED TO KEEP SOME OF THESE AS EXCEL FILES, NOT PDF. I HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I TRIED TO DO TWO SEPARATE TESTS AND THEY SEEMED TO WORK- BUT WHEN I TRIED TO SAVE AS WITH THE ' REAL' DOCUMENTS I STILL GOT THE ERROR.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>If you want an answer, you can choose to write a proper question, correctly capitalised, and put it in the Excel group. Note that your question needs to contain the full path and file name to which you are trying to save, or they won't be able to answer

            <p>John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am new here. I have never posted in a group forum in my life.. I didn't realize I was posting in the Word area first of all. I clicked on the Office 2016 version.. It didn't say WORD, it said OFFICE, which I assume is all Office programs</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to the CAPS, I hit caps and started typing and didn't realize. When I looked up half way through all the caps were on and I decided I didn't want to start all over. I didn't look at it as being rude and disrespectful. remember people who are
 coming on here to ask questions aren't 100% computer savy everytime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't need to help me- Ill get help- I have spent 8 hours on the phone about with Microsoft already trying to fix numerous issues excel has been having (no fault of mine) even after upgrading.. So I will have it figured out. But I thought I would be
 pro active and ask the community, but I see Microsoft is failing me yet again with their customer service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your response wasn't very professional either. Maybe you shouldn't assume someone is shouting and being disrespectful. It is not like I was cursing or blaming anyone- how do you know I am not just completely tech clueless..&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you John. I actually just spoke to Microsoft again. I guess Excel and El Capitain are having compatibility issues together.. So my problem was I had spaces in my folders.. So for example I had something like Jobs 2016, but it should have been jobs2016..
 This really sucks, but I guess for now Ill deal with it until they resolve the issues.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not surprised, a blank space is a valid character for folder and file names. I was surprised to read that Microsoft Support said it was a space that was causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes what appears to be a space is not really because it's actually holding an invisible character and the act of deleting the "space" actually deleted the true culprit... an invalid, non-displaying character.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By chance do you remember how you created the folder names for these files that will not save? Did you copy/paste them from another source? Sometimes the "copy" picks up these foreign characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the new file that will not save, have you tried retyping the folder names for all folders in the path? You don't have to change the folder names, just select them and retype the name. If you find when you select the labels to retype you see an extra
 blank character at the front or end of the name, that might be one of these foreign characters I am referring to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the name of the drive where you are saving these files? Using Finder navigate to one of these file that is giving you a problem, right click on the filename and then select Get Info. The info panel will open and on the panel next to "Where:" will
 be the path to file. Even though it is probably displayed on multiple lines, drag your cursor over it while holding down the left click button on your mouse or trackpad. With the name selected, paste it back into a reply to this posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to the answers to the first questions I asked how these path names were created, I'm also looking for two things... the name of your drive where this file is located and the full path to it that you will pickup from Finder's Get Info function.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created the folder/s by just going to the main folder and clicking on "new folder" each time. I may have once or twice "Saved As" and then created the folder within that space- it says 'new folder' on the lower left hand side, if that makes sense. So I
 did it in the one swoop of going to "save as". I definitely did not copy or paste any of the folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try and retype the folder name. I actually even removed the space too just incase, but it didn't help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For one of the folders this is the file name you asked for:</p>
<p>/Users/gideonperry/Documents/FANTASTIC THEATERS/VENDORS/Clipso</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main work folder is Fantastic Theaters. I then have either job names, or vendors such as this one. Clipso is a sub folder within the vendor folder... Then I have a folder named 2016Orders in this folder. This is the folder that is having issues.. Obviously
 there are other folders as well... But this is just one. When I look on my Sharing and Permissions it says I have "read &amp; Write" capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The name of &nbsp;my drive? I don't know how to find that- sorry Im a tad clueless with the real technical stuff. Im sure thats a simple question too. But Im assuming it is just on the computers hard drive in general as it is saved under gideonperry (husband).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please excuse my explaining. I am pretty decent with computers but the lingo is not exactly my strong suit.. Plus explaining it without someone sitting next to me sometimes makes it harder. I hope I made some sense above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again. This has been really frustrating. I have spent over 8-9 hours at this stage on phone with Excel.. And some issues keep coming up because they can't always be replicated while on the phone</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info. To get the name of the drive it should be on the Get Info panel that you opened to get the pathname. For some reason, it doesn't copy onto the clipboard. Most primary drives are named "Macintosh HD"... is that the name of yours?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned your husband, does he use this same computer and do you share certain folders in this path? Meaning can he add or edit files in one of the folders under your Documents directory?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using Time Machine or any other method of automatic backups?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - I'm trying to get some help from Microsoft. I can't promise anything but I am attempting to escalate the issue.</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>Yes, it is - &nbsp;Macintosh HD &gt; Users &gt; gideonperry &gt; Documents &gt; Fantastic Theaters &gt; Vendors &gt; Clipso.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that didn't show up early? So yes, it must be in correct area right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned my husband as in he was the admin/user, but I go by that as well. We basically use the one admin/user if that makes sense. Im sure it does :) &nbsp; I think I mentioned it because it shows his name in that "where" section as Im assuming admin..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im probably babbling there.. But Gideon (or myself) have all the correct permissions to read and write within all the folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do use time machine and we also use back blaze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to get someone from Microsoft. Ive literally talked to an "escalated" tech 3 times and it has sort of helped, but yet I'm still having the reoccurring issues. I try to do what he says to fix (no spaces for example) and it isn't working..
 I never had the issues with spaces on my other folder. It wasn't until I installed this new version of office that I had all the issues. That an El Capitain.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> pamhall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 - maintain compatibility</h2>
                    <p>I have just bought a new laptop running windows 8.1 64 bit and installed Office professional Plus 2013. When I go to Save as, I am not given the opportunity to "Maintain compatibility" (there is no check box). When I click on "Tools" in the Save as dialogue,
 I only see Map network drive and not the general options (which include passwords for modify and edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same version on my desktop (also running win 8.1 64 bit) and these options show there. They also show in Excel 2013 on the same laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if I go to the Options screen and go to advanced, there are no compatibility options &nbsp;listed at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? I desperately need the option to save a file as read-only on the laptop.</p>

                    Hotmail seemed to allow a maximum of 50 contacts to be emailed at one time. I have a contact list of 200 people that I email regularly. With Hotmail it wasn't too much of a problem because all I did was break the group of 200 into four groups of 50 and
 send the same email to each of the four groups. My question is: Does outlook.com have limits, or can I send an email to 200 contacts at once. Thanks.

<h2>            Zune 30gb MP3 won&#39;t accept anything I try to sync with it.</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a Zune 30gb off of Ebay, without realizing Zune had taken down their website and servers in 2017. I've been trying to put some music on the Zune but, I've been unsuccessful with every attempt. I've tried using the original software, resetting
 the Zune, turning it off and restarting the Zune software, and ive tried using Windows Media player hoping that maybe it'll recognize another Microsoft product (It doesnt). While using the original software i was able to finally rename it by selecting 'forget
 this device' under the sync settings. But i wasn't able to add music, playlists or anything to it. I can drag my .Mp3 files/playlists to the sync icon, it says its adding 1 song and when i go check it it's not there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Help!</p>

            Hi Jacob
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Saw someone at an event with one of these the other day and I noticed he had it synced with a Tablet running Windows 8.1.
<br />
<br />So, you might be seeing a compatibility issue with Windows 10.
<br />
<br />You are best off trying download and install the Zune software and try setting up your playlist in it:

            <p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The download will range between 2GB and 2.74GB depending on CPU architecture and language.</li><li>Once the build is downloaded, your PC will begin the installation and reboot. This reboot will be longer than normal but don‚Äôt worry.</li><li>When you log in for the first time after installing the new build, you‚Äôll go through those colorful ‚Äúinstalling your apps‚Äù screens again. This is because your account is being provisioned again. When it‚Äôs done it will be your same familiar system with all
 of your stuff.</li><li>Once you are logged back in after installing the new build, your system will take some time to catch back up and you may see extra activity or things that don‚Äôt quite work right ‚Äì for example the search index will need time to rebuild and OneDrive will
 need to sync. This should stabilize within the first couple hours of use.</li></ul>

<p>Unfortunately no, not for these preview builds. You will likely have to wait until the next major milestone.

                    I have two gmail apps accounts on my outlook. When I click on the header the content of the e-mail begins to download. This takes a few seconds but it is still annoying. I want my email to show up immediately in preview.

            Are these messages in the Inbox or a subfolder?<br />
<br />
By default in SP2 IMAP operates as "push mail". It always has an IMAP IDLE command outstanding against the server and will download new email the moment it arrives on the server. For this reason schedules are no longer needed for IMAP accounts. There is no
 longer a periodic poll for new mail to schedule.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;IDLE does not download all new mail the moment it arrives on the server‚Äî<span style="font-weight: bold">this only applies to the Inbox and the folder that you are currently viewing.</span> Instead, SP2 now provides a periodic poll, which is why Schedules are
 no longer needed.<br />
<br />
Even though some users had what seemed to be a successful upgrade to the SP2 database, issues in the Identity are causing concern. You might need to move to a new Identity. Follow directions here:<br />

I have tried PC suite 4.81 with no success. According to the Quick Guide of the data suite this data cable should work. However, the following note was found from the Support Guide for Nokia content copier:<br />
<br />
"Because the Nokia Connection Manager that comes with Nokia PC Suite 4.81 does not support DAU-9P cable anymore following Nokia phones are not supported anymore by the Nokia Content Copier: Nokia 5110/Nokia 5310/Nokia 6110/Nokia 6130/Nokia 6150."<br />
<br />
I have not been able to get the IR connection to work either.<br />
<br />
I am using Windows 2000 SP4.<br />
<br />

            I can¬¥t help you, sorry. Only to say that my old Nokia 6150, from 10-1998 still works without any fail! And on all that time, it was only necessary change once the battery for a new one, and it keep¬¥s working. Great phone.

<h2>            abusive emails from a comparative stranger</h2>
                    I have been receiving abusive emails from a particularly malicious person. Similar emails have also been sent to some of my colleagues. The emails contain obscenities and veiled death threats. I've asked the hotmail administrator to block the malicious
 sender and, as required, have provided an example of her handiwork - with no result so far! I think that such people should be blocked as they obviously take pleasure in causing distress to others. I've blocked the sender and all her messages go into my junk
 bin now but that's not enough. She should be shown that she cannot just send abusive emails to others!&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi M</span><span>weather</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updated information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you described, after you remove students from one class notebook successfully, you still cannot add them to another class notebooks. According to the red message in your second screenshot, the
 student's name is on the teacher list. So I would like to suggest you confirm if the user name has been added as a teacher in the class notebook already. In this case, you are not able to add him as both student and teacher.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please provide the student list and teacher list for the class notebook, so we can help check it again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Yoga&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Getting videos to appear in the Video Centre. What folder&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've put a video on my phone in My Videos, then My Videos/Downloads and it's not appearing in the Video Centre. I can open it from the File Manager fine. What directory does the Video Centre look in for files? I mainly ask because in the past when a video's
 in the Video Centre, the handset seems to grab licences automatically (it's an iPlayer file) but from the File Manager it does not do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, I'm sure I'm being dense.</p>

            &gt;&gt; The Outlook 2016 launcher insists on connecting an email account before I can open Outlook 2016. 
<br />You need to set up a profile the first time you run it, before Outlook will open. It will add the accounts as Microsoft Exchange accounts and sync down the contents of your mailbox. It won't sync contents of other folders in Outlook desktop up to the server. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; After I get Outlook 2016 set up and synchronizing with Outlook.com, I will have my various IMAP email accounts connected to both 2016 on my PC and Outlook.com. That seems to me at least a redundancy, and possibly a conflict problem. What is the recommended practice for dealing with that? 
<br />
<br />If you add the imap accounts to outlook and have them configured in Outlook.com as connected accounts, yes, it will be redundant and you'll have duplicates of all messages. 
<br />
<br />You won't be able to reply from Outlook desktop using the connected accounts currently - you'll need to log into outlook.com to reply. For this reason, my recommendation is to not use connected accounts for accounts you actively use to send email. Remove them as connected accounts and set them up in Outlook desktop. Connected accounts are great for addresses you need to monitor but not send mail to.

<h2>            PowerPoint for Android - Presenting in Portrait Mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a presentation that i need to present in the portrait mode (i.e. the width:height ratio of my slide template is 3:4 - it fits the size of standard tablets).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when i go to the slideshow mode in PowerPoint for Android, it rotates the slide. Instead of displaying in the portrait orientation, it always shows the slides in landscape mode - this means the slide are never full screen; instead they get scaled
 down to match the height of the landscape view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my device rotation is not locked. i can view PowerPoint in either orientation when it is in the edit mode. The moment i switch to the slideshow mode, it always rotated the slide to landscape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting to stop this from happening? my presentation consist of screenshots of a tablet in portrait mode - so i want to run the presentation in the portrait mode so my screenshots would fit to the full screen of the tablet</p>

            <p>This is happening across all devices (tabs/phones - tested with Apple, Samsung and HTC) for all presentations - the version of the PowerPoint is 16.0.7329.1015; the latest available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like a limitation in the application. The OS by default support screen rotations - so looks like PowerPoint intentionally stopped the portrait view in the slideshow mode ( because the edit mode supports both portrait and landscape views)&nbsp;

            <p>In case microsoft doesn't fix this soon; I got the job done through following workaround (labor intensive - I had to do it for all 100+ slides)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Prepare the slides in the portrait mode</p>
<p>2. Once you are done with the slide, changes go to the template size settings, and change the slide orientation from portrait to landscape (once you do this, the height and the width of the template would swap and the content won't fit to the slide) [Design
 -&gt; Slide Size -&gt; Custom Size]</p>
<p>3. Do the following for each slide </p>
<ol>
<li>Select all content in the slide (Ctrl + A)</li><li>Group all the content (Right Click -&gt; Group)</li><li>Go to size and position settings (Right Click -&gt; Size and Positions)</li><li>Set the rotation to 270 degrees</li><li>change the height and the width of the grouped object to match the size of the template</li><li>drag and fit the grouped object to correct portion on the slide (there's some sort of auto fit function which makes this easy)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>once you get the hang of it, each slide takes less than 1 minute </p>
<p>
</p><p>But hey, microsoft need to fix this problem - it's a pain in the back<br />

<p>Although it works, but this method would remove all animation you have designed for your content of group which is shaped in step 1 and 2.</p>

            I used a rotation lock app to temporarily prevent all my apps to switch to landscape, so it forced the presentation to open in portrait.

            It's called Adaptive Rotation Lock. It's a workaround but works fine for my needs until microsoft fixes the issue. You just open the app and lock your phone to Portrait before launching your presentation.

<h3> kim campbell84  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need help with something in Microsoft Access</h2>
                    I am creating a database for my job. In this database, I need to be able to put the employees and the trainings that they have attended, and other information related to the trainings. I started creating one that has a table for every required subject
 within the first 90 days, six months, and year or continued. I have not put any records into any of the tables yet though. I need to figure out how to make it work so when I do a query to run a report with one person's name, I will be able to get every training
 that they have been to, without having to do a database based on the trainings and a separate one based on the employees. &nbsp;If anyone can help me bounce ideas around, I would really appreciate it. Thanks in advance for any help!

            <p>I suggest you review some tutorials on setting up your tables and relationships. If you don't get these correct your application will be built on sand.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A database should have at least these&nbsp;tables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employees</li><li>Classes</li><li>EmployeeClasses (which students are registered in which classes)</li><li>ClassSchedule (linking classes to scheduled offerings)</li></ul>
<p>There could be several more tables such as required trainings etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's best to make a good guess at your tables and post back here to get some feedback.</p>

            <p>As Duane says, get your table design right FIRST. What you have is what's called "encoding data in table names" - having a table for every required subject is simply WRONG and will make your database a nightmare to manage!</p>

            <p>Good thing you haven't put any data intro tables yet, because your tables are not well designed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a separate table for each course is wrong design. It encodes data using the table, rather than a field in the table identifying the course.</p>
<div><br />
<p>let me explain that a database is a collection of tables. Each table defines a specific type of entity. So your point about not "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">having to do a database based on the trainings and a separate one based
 on the employees" doesn't make sense.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So, you appear to have 2 main entities here. Employees and Training courses. So you should, as Duane described, have a table of employees and a table of courses. An entity has attributes, these make up
 the fields in your tables. So attributes of the employee entity are things like first &amp; last name, DOH, etc. Attributes of a Course would be the name, a description, ehter its required and, if so, &nbsp;when it was required to be completed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The next thing you need is a record of&nbsp;which&nbsp;employee took&nbsp;which&nbsp;course and when. You have a many to many relationship between employees and courses (an employee can take multiple courses
 and a course can be given to multiple employees). So that's where the third table Duane mentioned comes in. That table Would contain the EmployeeID, the CourseID and an indication of when it was given.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">With the above structure, you can&nbsp;easily&nbsp;do reports for an individual employee, individual course or specific requirement.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The links John gave go into much greater depth about entities, attributes, normalization etc. So I strongly suggest you stop any design until you understand better how to design.</span></span></p>

            This is exactly what I was looking for. I thought what I was doing was too complicated and that there needed to be an easier way to do it. That is why I put the question out there. However, in the class that I took on Access, we only learned a one-to-many
 relationship, so I am not sure how to do a many-to-many relationship. Can you help?

            <p>A Many to Many relationship is just composed of two One to Many relationships. In your example, Duane's and Scott's suggested tables are Employees, Courses, and &nbsp;Enrollment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a one to many relationship from Employees to Enrollment - each employee can enroll in zero, one, or multiple Courses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's also a one to many relationship from Courses to Enrollment - each course can enroll zero, one or multiple Employees.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have all three tables populated (using Forms and Subforms as described in, among many other places, Crystal's tutorials in the link I posted), you can then create a Query joining all three tables to see who is enrolled where.</p>

            <p>Yes, this is much better. A couple of points. Don't use the generic ID name. Rename it TrainingID and EmployeeID. This will make it clear what it links back to. Description is a reserved word so don't use it for an object name, use TrainingDescription instead.
 You can set the Caption property to Description so that is what appears when you use the wizards to create forms and reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would add a multi field unique index on the combination of EmployeeID and TrainingID in CompletedTrainings so you ensure you don't get duplicates. If an employee can take a training more than once, then add the date field to that index.</p>

            <p>I never use Caption properties since when viewing query datasheets the actual field name is hidden. It's a matter of taste. I also don't use Input Masks (again just my opinion).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of us veteran programmers use some type of naming convention when creating tables, forms, reports, queries, etc. You should find one you can live with and use it religiously.</p>

            <p>Kim,</p>
<p>While in table design, you can create indexes by selecting one or more fields. One of the properties of the index is to make them unique. The Order Details table in Northwind has a multifield unique index on the OrderID and ProductID fields. This eliminates
 the possibility of an order having the same product multiple times.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb1f3ab2-127a-4080-abdc-b384b608c76b" /></p>

<h2>            Creating form fields</h2>
                    <p>It seems that creating form fields in word 2010 has changed drastically from previous versions of Word, and for the worse, I might add. It is a lot less user friendly and more cryptic and geared toward developers. Why should the average user have to add
 Visual Basic controls to a document to create form fields. There are several things that I cannot see how to do with form fields in 2010 that you could do easily in previous versions, like require that a field be numeric only or specifiy a maximum length.
 Also, in previous versions, you could require a number to be in a certain format like phone number 111-111-1111. ALso, I don't see how to highlight form fields as in previous versions so the user knows which fields to fill inI don't see how to do this is 2010
 short of writing some VB code to support a text box. </p>

            You can still add the old form fields (most of them, at least) by clicking the Legacy Tools button on the Developer tab. Pick the controls under "Legacy Forms" (and, specifically, do not choose the ActiveX controls).<br />
<br />
To display the Developer tab, click File tab | Options | Customize Ribbon and then click to select "Developer."

    <title>Aligning a poem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anabas910  say:</h3>
<h2>            Aligning a poem</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am helping a non-profit organization to format a book. There are hundreds of poetic verses in the book which needs to be formatted.
<br />
<br />
I am using shift enter to begin a new line in a paragraph and keeping everything justified. The paragraph marker is at the end in its own new line and this nicely aligns the poetic texts. So far so good.<br />
<br />
The problem is that there are hundreds of these poetic verses and I cannot have a fixed width for each one as the words will have too much white spaces in it and it does not look nice. Each poetic verse or paragraph will have its own width.
<br />
<br />
In Word 2013, I then drag the right margin towards left and this shows me how the poetic paragraph will look like and this is a great feature.<br />
<br />
But, I have to do this on every poem until line breaks into two and that is the point where I align each poem without breaking a line.
<br />
<br />
And, I have to do this manually for each one of these.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if a macro could be written that will determine the best right margin for the poem paragraph so that line does not wrap and break into two.<br />
<br />
I know it is difficult to describe it in words and but if you open this link, you would know what I really mean.<br />
<br />
http://www.zinox.com/files/sample.pdf<br />
<br />
In above page, there are 4 poetic verses in bold and each has their own width that I had to determine by dragging the right margin towards left. I wish that if there was a macro that would do this for me.
<br />
<br />
Any tips would be greatly appreciated to help me write a macro to accomplish this.<br />
<br />
For example, the macro would determine the best right margin of each line in the paragraph and the maximum right margin of all lines would be the one set for the selected poem. I have a feeling that there are smart people who can write such a macro but I am
 not that smart so asking for a help.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you &nbsp;

            <p>The goal is to have the verses left-aligned but visually centered on an average-length line. I've never figured any way to do this other than to change the left indent for each poem. What I would suggest, however, is that you define a series of styles with
 progressively larger left indents: say 0.5", 1", 1.5", and so on. Then apply the style that works best for a given poem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be clear, you should not be justifying poetry; the lines should be ragged right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people just center the whole thing, but that is lazy and incorrect, as the verses do need to have a uniform left margin.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Instead of taking the average line length, for typesetting poetry it seems more common to take the longest line for centering. That's more likely to convey a centered appearance for the poem as a whole.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, using the Left Indent control on Layout, keep trying point values until a second line is visually left-aligned with the centered line. Then apply that value to a selection of all lines above and below the centered line, at least in the current stanza.
 The value that seems to work can also be applied as the value of the indent for the centered line, once its centering is removed. That way the left alignment is exact for all lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is not so great about this overall approach is that it's dependent on the initial line length between the margins. Change the margins or the paper width and you have to start again. It doesn't work for table cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the poet has indented of the some lines him- or herself, I can only suggest uniform fixed spaces for their indents.

            As previously noted, individual lines should not be centered. The goal is to have the entire poem roughly centered, not necessarily on the longest line (which might even be run over) but on the general mass of the poem. Each stanza of the poem should be
 a single paragraph, so there will be a single left indent for the entire paragraph. As for runover lines, tabs are preferable to spaces.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>First I should say that it's the poet's own indented lines (perhaps every 2nd line, or the last 2 in a Shakespearean sonnet) for which a fixed space seems to be in order. Whether runover lines should be indented to the same value is another matter. Twice
 the indent is one approach I've noted for runover lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me apply Suzanne's advice in my own words. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't center a poem based on the longest line. Rather, center it visually for the poem as a whole. You could start with a stanza, but it's not necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within a poem, the line endings should all be manual line breaks, except possibly for the last one. Use the Left Indent control on Layout to push the stanza into the visual center. Record the indent value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the remaining stanzas. Apply the value in the Left Indent control to the other stanzas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that's all there is to it. So simple! And it works within a table cell, which is my present context. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>As for the poet's own indents:</em> use a fixed space of your choice for the desired indent. Copy it to other lines that the poet indented.*</p>
<p>______________</p>
<p>* I wouldn't use tabs because then you're dependent on tab settings, and that's too difficult to work with in a table.

<p>Not sure why you're using a table, but specific tab stops are always a better way to go, even though you do have to use
<strong>Ctrl+Tab</strong> to insert a tab in a table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, for lines that the poet has indented you could define a style with a hanging indent and no Spacing After and make each couplet a paragraph (adding Spacing After to the last paragraph in a stanza).</p>

            You can't, if you want that homescreen you need to buy a better more expensive model.<br />

    <title>Repeating records in report subform - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Repeating records in report subform</h2>
                    I&nbsp;have a report in access that uses a subform to report part of the information, but it is repeating the same record 27 times. How do I get it to report each record only once?

            <p>By correcting the error(s) in the query upon which it is based.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like help doing so, please open the report's Recordsource query in SQL view and post the SQL text here, perhaps with some explanation of the tables and their relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note also that reports can have Subreports but not Subforms - I gather that's what you meant?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information displays correctly in the query, but when the report runs, each report that has&nbsp;more than one entry in the attached sub report, will repeat itself by the number of entries in the report.</p>
<p>For example if the sub report has ten items, the report will replicate 10 times.&nbsp; What I am trying to do is make a report that has basically a sub report containing a table of items so that I do not have to send out several letters to each person.

            <p>The main report's record source query should not have a join to the subreport's table.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think your main report's record source could simply be:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>SELECT [Date of Inspection], Inspector, Nonconformance, Status, [Job Number]<br />
FROM Nonconformances&nbsp;<br />
WHERE Nonconformance Is Not Null AND Status &lt;&gt; "COMPLETE"<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike forms, a&nbsp;report's sorting must be specified in the report using the Sorting and Grouping feature, not a query's ORDER BY clause.&nbsp; (Reports mostly(?)&nbsp;ignore the query's sorting so it is a waste of time to sort the query)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Use the subreport control's Link Master/Child Fields properties to link the subreport records to the current main report record.</p>

            Thank you very much Marshall. That cured the repeating entries issue, but the reason the query was joined is because client information is stored ina separate table. How do I get the query to pick up that information so that the report can have the address
 and contact information for each person on it?

            <p>Are you saying that Table1 contains both Client info and Inspection info?&nbsp; If so, it sounds like you need to split that into two tables or some other table structure.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I've failed to understand what you are describing, you might be able to use an alternate approach without a subreport.&nbsp; Instead of the subreport, use you original record source query and the report's Sorting and Grouping feature to put the client info
 in a group header and the inspection/nonconformance info in the detail section.</p>

            <p>Table 1 has all the contact and project information in it. Nonconformance is a table that only lists outstanding items yet to be fixed. I joined the query, so that the report that is produced becomes a letter to customers telling them what outstanding issues
 they have. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the query pulls the contact and project information from table 1, then goes to nonconformance to produce the subreport that shows outstanding items. Am I approaching this the wrong way?</p>

            <p>Simply base your main report on Table1, and the subreport on the Nonconformance table; or - probably better - do as Marshall suggests, and base the entire report on a Query joining the two tables. Use the report's Sorting and Grouping dialog to put all the
 table 1 information into a Group Header, and put the nonconformance information in the detail section.</p>

            <p>You could probably get the report to work, one way or another, using that table structure.&nbsp; But it sounds like you have four entities to model.&nbsp; If that's what you have, you need a table for each of those entities and can use queries to join the first three
 into what you have now for the main report and the Projects table in your subreport.&nbsp; OTOH, I think I would join all these table and use Sorting and Grouping with a group header for each of the first three.</p>
