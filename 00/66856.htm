<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to internet through mobile hotspot.</h2>
                    <p>I'm having trouble connecting my Xbox 360 to the internet through my mobile hotspot (on my phone).&nbsp; When I test, it will connect to my network but not the internet.&nbsp; I've tried all of the troubleshooting suggestions both on the console and the xbox website.
 It has only connected once, and it said it needed an update,so I started the update and came back a few minutes later and it said that the internet was disconnected and now it won't let me connect again. Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>Well the problem is with mobile hotspots is that they are too slow and thenlatentcy&nbsp;</p>
<p>It most likely will not be fast enough</p>
<p>Your lagging out</p>
<p>You must have a consistent connection&nbsp;</p>
<p>An a mobile hotspot is not anconssitent one you will have to contact your isp for fixing latency issues but most likely you will only fail</p>
<p>With the connection test isnt a speedtest</p>
<p>Its just seeingnif you connect</p>
<p>A sustained connection is .a must</p>
<p>With hotspots its can go up qnd down and IF It stays below the thresholds for too long you will be disconnected</p>

<h2>            How to keep scanned images from being compressed when transferred</h2>
                    <p>original title: scanned uncompressed tiff file is jpeg compressed when copied from temp file
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I scan images as uncompressed tiff files. the scanner interface might show that the image is 40 megs and resides in a temp folder. When I transfer the image to the intended folder the file size is usually a quarter of the original, say 9-10 megs. When the image
 is opened in editing app it shows it is jpeg compressed. the result is very low quality. same image scanned uncompressed in other system is crystal clear.<br />
<br />
What can I do to keep windows from compressing the image on transfer. <br />
<br />
Using windows 7, scanner is a plustek<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help or suggestion<br />

            <p>Copying a&nbsp;photo from one folder to another in and of itself should <br />
not change the format or file size.<br />
<br />
How...exactly...are you transferring the photos from the temp folder <br />
and to where are you transferring them?<br />
<br />
Are the images in Color or B&amp;W....and what is your DPI setting?<br />
<br />
When you view the TIFF and the quality looks good...what app are <br />
you using to view the file.<br />
<br />
When you view the transferred JPEG and the quality looks bad...<br />
what app are you using to view the file?<br />
<br />
FWIW and you probably already know this...but there is no advantage<br />
in saving your scans in the TIFF format if you plan to immediately <br />
convert them to JPEG.</p>

            I'm making scanned images in color and b&amp;w all at 600 dpi. ultimately they'll be converted to bitmaps at 600 dpi. I have no need for jpegs as they are lossy. scanning grey or color allows me to have the best control over the image.<br />
<br />
I'm using the plustek book pavillion software to scan. once the scan is done it shows in the scan panel as waiting in a system temp folder. The software doesn't copy to the drive as it's made. When I click the transfer button the image is placed in the assigned
 folder and presumably it's when the jpg compression is implemented and the image size is reduced. BTW I had never seen a tiff with jpg compression before.<br />
<br />
When I transfer the files to work on them on the mac, and save-as with no compression, the files are at the size they should be but the image is shot.<br />
<br />
A few bitmap scans I made when transferred were compressed in their aspect ratio. Using ps 3 on a mac for all<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that windows 7 is protecting me from having too large a file, but at the great cost of quality. I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to disable this function. there can be no other cause as I tried scanning as bmps also and scanning directly
 to the editing software (very time consuming).<br />
<br />
I purchased a PC solely for scanning and it's turning out to be a big headache. took a while to let it allow me to read/write my own files!!<br />

            Thanks for the detailed reply.<br />
<br />
Just wondering...what is the model of your PlusTek scanner?<br />
<br />
I could certainly be incorrect but I don't think Windows 7 is causing this issue...<br />
I would suspect the PlusTek software. Have you checked the PlusTek support <br />
site for updated Windows 7 drivers?<br />
<br />
Just for experimental purposes...why not try scanning a photo as described <br />
in the following article:<br />

downloaded it . the result: it uninstalled the software. took a while for me to figure out how to reinstall. already talked to plustek tech support. they have been very helpful with other issues, but this seems to have stumped them. I expect their regular customer
 only requires batch scanning. I'm doing scans many with thin hairiines to convert to bitmap. results I get from a straightforward tiff&nbsp; are pretty good.<br />
<br />
tried your suggestion using fax/scan. Scans are LZW compressed by default, didn't find option to scan uncompressed. Option for multiple scans not available, essential as I'm scanning 2-500 images at a time.<br />
<br />
checking properties/details on an image does not report any compression implemented. The image I scanned with fax/scan was saved-as with no compression using PSE and the properties/detals indicates compression: uncompressed. I can't see anything but the system
 doing the evil deed.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, the files before they're transferred to the document folder are stored in a temp folder C:/user/if/app data/local/temps/ (and a surprise to me, as) 000.bmp.<br />
Tried to locate the folders, but system reports they don't exist. thought perhaps their properties would have some tag to compress items in it.<br />
<br />
I'm stumped!<br />
<br />
Again thanks for your help<br />

            <p>Hey</p>
<p>i am scanning a few photographs using my HP scanner. now while they are being scanned they usually show up a size of around 1.8-2mb with "uncompressed" written in brackets ( ).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but once they show up in the "my scans" folder they are reduced to around 500kb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>why so?</p>
<p>
</p><p>and how to ensure this doesn't happen so that the original quality of the photograph is maintained.</p>

            <div>this could be a hardware issue if you see this on released Windows (not on an</div>

            After a restart, it's appearing in the Device Manager list, with the Code 12 error - not enough free resources. I'm hoping that a 2-year-old, $1,200 pc wouldn't need to be replaced for $450.&nbsp;

            The only way to rule out a hardware issue is to do a complete wipe and reimage from a downloadable recovery image

            Thanks. I'll give that one a shot. But I think before I put another $450 into this device I'd invest in a USB Wifi dongle for $20. I don't mind saying that I'd be extremely disappointed in MS if it was a hardware issue.&nbsp;

            I struggled with this issue for an entire weekend. I ended up doing a complete wipe using a recovery image and my bluetooth and wifi chip was never recognized. I'm confident now that the hardware is toast. My gut feeling is that the computer got too hot
 while streaming to my TV using Miracast. I am going to route of bluetooth/wifi dongle and not buying another surface again.<br />

            If your system used to work, what do you think might have changed since the last time it worked properly?<br />
<br />
Does no sound mean you don't even hear the Windows startup and shutdown sounds (and you used to hear them, right)?<br />
<br />
Do you have another system you can plug your speakers into just to test and to see if your system makes a sound without the speakers plugged in (melodious sounds...&nbsp; not beeps.&nbsp; beeps come from somewhere else.).<br />
<br />
If you go to Control Panel, Sounds and Audio Devices, Sounds tab, can you play and hear any of the built in Windows sounds?<br />
<br />
Since we know the make and model, why not hop out to the Dell site and download the audio driver for your system and reinstall it...<br />
<br />
If it is already broken, it can't hurt (I don't think!):<br />

    <title>Minecraft graphics card issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gilleska  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft graphics card issue</h2>
                    Like many other people I've had trouble playing minecraft since upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; Admittedly I have a pretty old PC.&nbsp; The graphics card is an Intel 82945G Express Chipset Family (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.0).&nbsp; According to the Intel website
 there is no Windows 10 support for this card, which is not unexpected given the age of my PC.&nbsp; What I don't understand is why minecraft worked perfectly well with the same card before I switched to Windows 10, and why only minecraft appears to be affected.&nbsp;
 Everything else works fine.&nbsp; I guess there's nothing I can do except replace the graphics card altogether given that the manufacturer is not providing windows 10 drivers for this piece of hardware?&nbsp; Is there a coding work-around that will force Minecraft to
 accept my card?

            <p>A lot of people are being seduced into installing Win10&nbsp;on machines that are too old (a release date around May '05</p>
<p>for the Intel 82945G Express Chipset Family), &nbsp; because of MS's 'free' offer .</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did well to run Minecraft at all with an <em>integrated graphics</em> (<em>GMA 950</em>)&nbsp; of that vintage,</p>
<p>and I would have been somewhat surprised that driver support didn't stop with Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Unfortunately you cannot upgrade integrated graphics, and if&nbsp; you are using a laptop you cannot install
</p>
<p>a dedicated graphics card.</p>
<p>If you are using a desktop PC you also need to verify the power supply has adequate watts/amps for whichever</p>
<p>graphics card you install.</p>
<p>You also need to verify the motherboard has PCIe rather than AGP graphics slots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Why only Minecraft ? Perhaps the other games you have installed have lower requirements.
</p>
<p>eg- 'Point and click' style games with static, or mostly static, 2D screens may look nice, but don't require</p>
<p>much processing. Minecraft may look&nbsp; basic, but can be more system intensive than it looks.</p>

            <p>No need to, i already fixed the issue on 3 of my pc/ laptops. Just tell me what video card you got, you can see by going to run and type: dxdiag&nbsp; then click the second tab and you can see your graphics card.</p>

</p><p>I hope this was helpfull! just reply to me and i will be auto notified.</p>

<div>Your system is not completing the POST routine, which is the </div>
<div>Power-On-Self-Test.</div>
<div>This means that there is a hardware failure somewhere in the system, and we </div>
<div>need to isolate it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>First off</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disconnect ALL external devices (except the keyboard, mouse and monitor) - </div>
<div>especially USB-connected devices, such as thumb-drives, external hard </div>
<div>drives, and Mobile Dongles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Boot the system - do you get the same problem? If it boots without a </div>
<div>problem, re-attach each device one at a time, rebooting between each one - </div>
<div>one may show as either being faulty, or just inhibiting the POST. If so, </div>
<div>then remove it again, reboot to make sure that the system works, and carry </div>
<div>on with the rest. If you get to the end without any more problems then we've</div>
<div>probably identified the culprit - post back with details. If none of the </div>
<div>devices causes a problem - then we've pretty much solved it :)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If that doesn't work then please reply with your make and model number so </div>
<div>that we can download the manuals and instruct you on what to look for in the</div>
<div>BIOS/Setup interface.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It may simply be that you've been exploring in the BIOS, and flipped a </div>
<div>setting that you're not aware existed, but PLEASE, no fiddling in there </div>
<div>without instruction - you can turn your PC into a very expensive doorstop </div>
<div>doing that!</div>

 too fast to copy the message, to to Start / Control Panel / System / Advanced System Settings / Advanced / Startup and Recover / and uncheck the box to Automatically Restart.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also check the box to Write an Event to the System Log and
 select Complete Memory Dump and check Overwrite any existing file.<span>&nbsp;</span>This will freeze the program on the bluescreen so you have time to copy the information.<span>&nbsp;</span>Can you boot normally except when these events occur?</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You can also use Skydrive</span><span><a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml</span></a><span>&nbsp;to
 upload dump and text files related to the error which may help us identify the problem.&nbsp; Just post back the link to where they are.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shutdown (Start / Control
 Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To
 fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span>
 and Avast at:</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>. &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for
 the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going tostart / search box and type device
 manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details
 and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should get updated ones for the new hard drive and any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT
 from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></a><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Once
 you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></a><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span></span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></a><span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span></span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></a><span><span>.&nbsp; If it fails, test
 each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can stll boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            MOM.Implementation error message on startup</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
Have a new Compaq 615 AMD laptop with Windows 7 pre-installed (got it december 26, 2009), get the error message (in Swedish) that it cannot read the MOM. Implementation version 2.0.3503.18465, Culture=neutral, PublicKey Token=90ba9c70f846762e or one of its
 dependencies (?). Cannot access the file since used by another process. (Exception from HRESULT:0x80070020).<br />
<br />
Got this basically from the beginning, not sure what it is about? Have uninstalled trial versions of McAffee, Office, and installed Office Home/Student 2007. Installed mozilla thunderbird/firefox, Panda cloud,Windows live package. And drivers for my OKIprinter,
 namely drivers for Windows vista that was recommended since no drivers for win7 yet (works!). That's it I think, apart from updates from Windows update.<br />
<br />
Anything you can help me with on this forum?<br />
<br />
Thanks!!!

    <title>No Password prompt on every 1st Boot-Up of Windows 10 &#40;after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abhishek_gajare  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Password prompt on every 1st Boot-Up of Windows 10 &#40;after Anniversary Update&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a problem widely reported but still lurking out there without a fix. I hope my post will be different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the recent Anniversary Update, every time I boot up my Windows 10 PC for the 1st time, the Password Prompt box would go missing. I have noticed that in the event of such a thing even the Boot-Up sound does not occur.
</p>
<p>So my fix&nbsp;has been&nbsp;to restart the PC&nbsp;using the Power button option&nbsp;on the bottom-right corner of the login-screen&nbsp;and, upon restart, the Password Prompt box magically appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said this has been reported in many posts earlier. If somebody's got a fix for this by themselves please be kind enough to share it here. A personal thanks to those guys.</p>

            <p>Thanks DaveM121 for the reply. But no, SAFE BOOT is safely turned off/unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other possible fixes? Many have suggested a reset, which involves me re-installing all my apps, so no thanks!</p>

<li>How did you install Word in the PC?</li><li>When you say, "I don't have either", do you mean to say, you do not remember the email used or you never used any email?</li><li>Is Word a part of Microsoft Office package on your PC?</li><li>Did you install the trial version of Office?</li></ul>
<p>There could be several reasons for this cause based on the questions above. </p>

Thanks for your time and reply Anil,<br />
<br />
1- I'm getting these errors at each start-up of Windows.<br />
2- No, I don't think there is a performance issue with Windows or my PC.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I looked everywhere (i. e. eventid.net) on the net and even in the links you've posted, but there's no similar event id description as I am facing. There is another post in this community with the exact same problem that I have, but unfortunately
 that one is also without answer.<br />
<br />
<br />
I suspect something in the Windows registry must have been messed up, but I don't know what and where it is.<br />

<br />
I did run a full system virus and malware scan and no threat is detected. It is very unlikely that there's a malware problem present since antivirus constantly watches my system, is always active and does regular scheduled system scans.<br />
<br />
I re installed the firewall according to instruction you provided. However in the command prompt verify process I got conflicting reports although when I checked windows firewall in control panel it shows that it's running and ok. And to be on the safe side
 I disabled antivirus and its firewall prior to installing Windows firewall.<br />
<br />
Here are the queries which I made and responses I've got:<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The specified service does not exist as an installed service.<br />
<br />
Strange, isn't it? if an instance of the service is running, how come it is not installed?! and control panel shows it is running and ok?<br />
<br />
Anyway rebooted, still problem exists.<br />
<br />

            <p>Well, I should have asked if you had two firewalls, ok then, since you use the firewall with Kaspersky, you have to disable windows firewall, you can only have one.</p>

<p>how to turn off windows firewall</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for having a clean system, no one antivirus can catch everything, although Kaspersky is one of the better ones, but since so many infections are developed it is just helpful to check with a spyware and malware checker. As long as only the antivirus is
 in realtime and the others are on demand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In event viewer are they errors, warnings or information?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if error still exists after disabling firewall, check to see if Windows Firewall service is still running and disable that and reboot.</p>

Elizabeth,<br />
I followed your instructions, disabled&nbsp; Windows firewall, rebooted, but still I get the same errors; FYI hereby I post events logged in application section of event viewer. in other sections everything is OK. No warnings or errors.<br />
<br />
Yes, Windows is fully updated via Automatic updates, and I think the most recent one was a few days ago.<br />

I don't think the problem is related to Firewall at all. Since once I totally uninstalled it&nbsp;from the system and the problem still existed. As for the errors, only 2 of the events are really errors, rest of them are just information about fax service which
 is not installed on my system anyway, or about an Autodesk rendering service which is not active at the moment. So we're back at those two errors which I mentioned on my first post. And yes of course I searched&nbsp;the net for those event Ids, and if there was
 a solution I don't think I ended up here in this community. As I mentioned in my earlier post there was someone else with the exact same problem posted 2 years ago&nbsp;in this forum, and got no answer:

            Sorry, I could be of no further service, you can repost the question and reference this thread in your post, this will bump it up and someone else might have a better solution. :)

<h2>            Lost internet connection after re-docking laptops</h2>
                    <p>On some Windows 7 laptop (Lenovo T450) when removed from the docking station it switches over to Wi-Fi just fine.&nbsp; When it is re-docked&nbsp; it switches back to the wired LAN but it is not fully functional,&nbsp; Skype or Lync and SAP will not reconnect.&nbsp; Removing
 and reinstalling the Intel Ethernet 1218-LM works but I can’t do that every time someone docks.&nbsp; Any thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
