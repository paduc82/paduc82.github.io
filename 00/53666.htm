    <title>Live Mail 2012 security issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rfcomm2k_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live Mail 2012 security issue</h2>
                    <p>I have Live Mail 2012 build 16.4.3528.0331 installed with Microsoft Security Essentials with the latest updates installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I found another piece of spam in my inbox (not unusual). The existence of the spam is not what worries me. It is the fact that it supposedly&nbsp;came from a deceased friend of mine who has been dead for almost a decade. That is what prompted me
 to check my list of contacts and sure enough, there was his name which I had never removed. Of course, the email address in the spam was different from his, but the name was identical.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coincidence? I think not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously either I have settings in my PC that allowed a spammer to pick a name out of my contact list, or my spam/virus protection is not operating correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight here would be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I am all for making spam a capital offense punishable by torture. When you figure out all the manhours wasted trying to wade thru all the spam received, or trying to recover from virus attacks, I think it warrants such a violent punishment.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You are right - there is built-in security (not just spam protection). The settings can be modified inside Windows Live Mail from Tools, Security settings . More information about the protection can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/email/spam.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/email/spam.mspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Yes, you can use your own preferred protection software. The what and how depend on the name and version of that software. See:

            <p>If you're sure that your computer is and has always been clean of virus infections, then this is most probably a simple coincidence. We all have limited circles of friends, relations, colleagues and acquaintances, and there will always be some overlap between
 the contacts lists of members of those circles. It's highly likely that more than one of your contacts have or have had the same email address in their list as the one that this piece of spam ostensibly was sent from. If only one of those has had his contacts
 list stolen by criminals, what you have experienced is likely to happen. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You protect yourself by taking appropriate precautions to keep your computer free of infection, and for example by using complex passwords to protect any of your data that may be stored online. Others may not be so careful, and there's sadly nothing you
 can do about that.</p>

</p><p>I guess what I need to know is how to patch the hole in my protection that allowed this spammer to pick that name out of my list of contacts. As for other people that may have sent me mail in the past, it is HIGHLY unlikely that one of them has him in their

<p>Just an update. I am NOT interested in using my own preferred software protection. I want to use MSE but need assistance with settings.</p>

<h2>            Where did my login form go on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a recent update, I can turn on my computer and it takes me to the lock screen. When I press Enter, the screen zooms in slightly but the log-in form isn't there anymore. It just shows my lock screen background, internet connection, ease of access and
 the power options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried Ctrl+Alt+Delete to bring up the task manager. I tried removing the power from the laptop, removed the battery, drained the remaining charge by holding down power, then I plugged it all back in and that didn't help. I tried using an external monitor,
 that didn't work. I'm about to go into safe mode but I don't even know where to begin looking for this setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to re-enable it or get it to show?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I had this but because I tried to use Diagnostic Start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I did. (it seems to have worked for at least one other user) Select Power, hold down Shift and select Restart. This will re-start the device in Troubleshoot mode. Select Troubleshoot, Advanced options then&nbsp;Command Prompt. Now enable the built
 in Administrator account using <strong>net user administrator /active:yes </strong>
and press enter. Now close the command prompt and select the back arrow in the top left had corner until you are able to select Continue to start Windows 10 as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me this brought back login on the Welcome screen. It didn't seem to show the built in Administrator account but fixed the problem.</p>

            I read that somewhere else too, however each time I try it, I can't even get troubleshooter to show up on reboot. If I get it to show up, I'll try it

            <p>That's very strange. Holding down shift while selecting power and then restart is the standard way to get to Troubleshoot.
</p>
<p>The other way would be to boot from Windows 10 install media and select repair.</p>

            <p>Thinking about it there is another way.</p>
<p>When windows has started to the welcome screen press and hold the physical power until the device powers off. (about 8 secs) Power on again and do the same again. On the third power on it should start loading repair and that gives the Troubleshoot menu.</p>

================================================================</p>
<p><br />
Need a Windows 7 Installation DVD to perform the repair install</p>
<p><br />
As of February 6th, 2015 the Digital River links to the various versions of Windows 7 are no longer functioning, as an alternative (as long as you have your product key) you can use the link to Microsoft's Software Recovery web page:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery</a>
</p>
<p><br />
Note: You may receive a notice to contact the PC manufacture if you have an OEM key that came with your computer, but it can't hurt to try. Also note that this site may return an incorrect language for the product key you entered. Please read the wiki articles
 listed below as a possible solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Additional information and alternative resources:<br />
If you have a friend with a "Retail" version (Full or Upgrade media, just the media as you don't need their key) of the installation DVD (must be the same as your key was for: Home Premium, Pro or Ultimate) it will work with your "Retail" or "OEM" product key
 if you need to re-install or repair Windows.</p>

            Hi Abel.   I'm Greg, a volunteer and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />Any Product Key that's that cheap is no good.  Don't buy Windows from any less than large, reputable retailers or Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />Any Windows 8 PC that came preinstalled from the factory most likely has the Product Key embedded in the BIOS.  You can check this by running Produkey to look for a BIOS OEM Product Key (only). <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a>
<br />
<br />If there is one then you can use this to Clean Install Windows 8.1, folowing this tutorial which includes precise activation procedures in Step 4:  <a href="https://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2299-clean-install-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2299-clea...</a>
<br />The media is provided here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/cr...</a>
<br />
<br />If the PC meets basic Windows 10 specs you can also try Clean installing Windows 10 while skipping the Product Key, afterwards insert the Windows 8 embedded Product Key in Activation Settings.  This method to activate the free copy of Windows 10 is in an extended grace period until the first of the year and should work.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />If this is a Windows 8 or 8.1 PC that came with Windows 8/8.1 preinstalled from factory, then it should have an embedded Product Key you can use to reinstall.  I gave you steps to determine this and reinstall with that key.

<h2>            Windows7 Pro - HP Probook 4540s - No sound and the error-searching can not find the problem</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago, my sound suddenly disappeared. It has worked for years.</p>
<p>I succeeded to get it back, by using the error-searching, it was something disabled.</p>
<p>After restarting my computer next morning the sound was gone again, and &nbsp;this time, I have not found any errors by using the error-searching capabilities in Windows.</p>
<p>Volume is on top, but no sound.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you referring to troubleshooter when you say, "error-searching capabilities"?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Answer is yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think your method 1 was the first step I would have taken, now when you indicated the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But before I got this solutio.n from you, I tried to call HP Support, and got a very helpsam person, and together we started a tour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I tried to have the system play a system-sound, it was rejected, cause to that the sound-equipment was busy serving another task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I did not have any other task going, we went into SYSTEM and looked at what was under SOUND and found one entry, belonging to a program I installed years ago to convert videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I unistalled this driver - and bingo - I had my sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is the reason why I have not &nbsp;tried your solutions.</p>
<p>Thank you for the effort, I will save it for next time.</p>

            <p>Hi Abhishek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to a program not being set as default to view this type of file. I suggest you to set a program as default program and check.</p>

<p>Click on an app you want to set as default to open such file type</p>
<p>Click check the option "<strong>Always use this app to open .jpg files</strong> and click
<strong>OK</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method&nbsp;2: </strong>Install the updated display driver</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Check for Windows update regarding any update related to Display and install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To check for updates </strong></p>
<p>
</p><div>

<p><span>Open Windows Update by swiping in from the right edge of the screen (or, if you're using a mouse, pointing to the lower-right corner of the screen and moving the mouse pointer up), tapping or clicking
<span>Settings</span>, tapping or clicking <span>Change PC settings</span>, and then tapping or clicking
<span>Update and recovery</span>. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Check now</span>, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your PC.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>If updates are found, tap or click <span>Install updates</span>. </p>
<p>Read and accept the license terms, and then tap or click <span>Finish</span> if the update requires it.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Visit the computer manufacturer's support website and install the latest display driver available for the same computer model and for Windows 8.1 operating system.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Niranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I don't have a problem with opening JPEG files. I have seen this icon before and I was seeing this a lot yesterday because my pictures are now on an external HDD and are multi MB in size. I can understand that it will take some time
 for the thumbnail/preview to be rendered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is about the picture shown on the icon itself. Just like the standard Windows XP desktop wallpaper was the picture of a real place, I am trying to find out if the picture on the JPEG icon fie also belongs or is inspired by a real place. The picture
 resembles the landscapes of Norway a lot and that has made me curious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Abhishek</p>

    <title>Gift card Warning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> born in 1952  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gift card Warning</h2>
                    
<p>Don't ever purchase gift cards offered by the Microsoft store unless you want to be ripped off. The real money you give them for gift cards is not even close to the value of&nbsp; products you can receive back. Example: Forza Motorsport 6 on sale from the microsoft
 store for $39.95 for the physical game mailed to you that if you want can resell. If you want to use your gift card to purchase a the game you can only purchase the digital game that you cannot resell and maybe charged for the download from your ISP is&nbsp; $74.95.
 Does this make any sense to anyone? I bought $150 worth of gift cards to keep in my account for game purchases instead of using my credit card on each purchase. The first time I went to use them I bought COD Black Ops 3 for $59.00 that I thought would be taken
 off my $150 account money. To my surprise my credit card was charged instead.</p>
<p>Thinking this was a mistake by them I contacted support and they initially said they were sorry for their error and would fix it for me. After over an hour with chat support they said they couldn't do anything and I needed to call the Microsoft stores sales
 accounts department which they gave me the number for. Again they initially said they were sorry and would fix the problem. After another hour+ and a so called supervisor they said the gift cards were only for digital downloads and it was in their Terms of
 use fine print somewhere and when I asked where I could find that info they disconnected me. I called back and again was disconnected when I asked where I could find that info. On the 3rd call they said it had been explained to me and there is nothing more
 they can.... get this ... HELP ME WITH..... Help ME? Where ? When? all I can see is they helped themselves to my cash and have lied about their mysterious Terms of Use Policies. Never ever trust this company with your cash and never ever buy the phoney gift
 certificates unless you want to be ripped off!</p>

<h3> alanmick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail - Selecting &#34;Enter Selection Mode&#34; Blanks Out E-Mail Display</h2>
                    <p>In the Mail app, when I select "enter selection mode" the email text display to the right goes blank and displays "No message selected". So I select a message in the "selection mode" panel and - still "No message selected". If the message is selected, why
 doesn't it display? What is "selection mode" for? I don't understand it - Can anyone explain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mail app is pretty puzzling in other regards. I can "flag" an email, but I don't see any obvious way to sort or find flagged items. In fact, there doesn't seem to be any sort or find capability at all. It is pretty rudimentary and I can't find any information
 on what or where the typical features of a mail client can be accessed. Is this it? Or am I missing something?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Selection mode is an option wherein you'll be able to select multiple mails and be able to do actions such as move or delete. It will not give you a preview of what's inside the email. In your concern regarding sorting however, we do have that option on
 the mail app. It is located on the upper-right corner of the application once you log into it.</p>

    <title>Network adaptor disabled after Win 10 update KB3172985 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimforbesca  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network adaptor disabled after Win 10 update KB3172985</h2>
                    <p>During the last Windows 10 updates, KB3172985, KB3173428, (others KB3174060, KB890830)<br />
The Wired Network adapter is disabled - no internet access.<br />
Restoring to a Jun restore point (removing updates) resolves the issue.<br />
Tried to disable the updates, but they keep getting installed on restart.<br />
Microsoft Troubleshooting points to the driver.<br />
</p>
<p>Computer is an HP desktop: HP Compaq 6005 Pro SFF PC</p>
<p>Windows 10 installed in 2016 Mar</p>
<p>All previous updates worked with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot find any Win 10 drivers on the HP support page for an HP/Compact 6005 with Win 10.<br />
Cannot find a free site to download Broadcom NetXtreme Gi Eth driver from 17.2.1 to 17.4.0.0 (?)<br />
Broadcomm site has an even older version 17.2.0.2<br />
broadcom netxtreme gigabit ethernet adapter driver<br />
PCI\VEN_14E4&amp;DEV_1681&amp;SUBSYS_3047103C&amp;REV_10\4&amp;2d1d473b&amp;0&amp;0050<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\b57nd60a.sys<br />
<br />
Looked at the event logs under the device manager events.</p>
<p>After restarting after the update is installed:</p>
<p>The events for the Network adapter show event (error 441) when installing the Win 10 Jul updates<br />
After another restart event (error 411) shows the device does not start.<br />
Event 441 states the device cannot be migrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked the affected s/w when restoring last checkpoint.</p>
<p>Affected update is listed as KB3172985.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Main issue is that I cannot restart the computer (using sleep to turn off) because
</p>
<p>reboot's re-apply the updates even when I try to disable them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just found a register key that may work.<br />
</p>
<p>But now I can not get Win 10 updates, because I just have to remove them after restart.</p>
<p>Any way to remove just KB3172985?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>I tried all the suggestions</p>
<p>The HP site does not have drivers for Win 10</p>
<p>and Broadcomm site has even older drivers.<br />
I then tired to remove the updates, but this app does not remove the whole</p>
<p>update (KB3172985), rather a list of subset updates some of which cannot be removed (no uninstall menu).</p>
<p>Also this step creates a new restore point for each step which overwrote my</p>
<p>Jun restore point. </p>
<p>The computer is now un-usable for internet access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless there are other workarounds I can download to a USB, the only option I can see is to restore the computer back to Windows 7 (the OS it came with).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a site I can download Win 7 and enter my MS key to burn a disc to use</p>
<p>to recover the network access?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a system image of your Windows 7 computer will help you restore your device working state when you encounter a system issue. You may use any recording disc to save the file as long as the storage is sufficient. Additionally, you may follow the steps
 provided in this article on how to <em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17127/windows-back-up-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Back up and restore your PC">back up and restore your PC</a></strong></em>. Once you’re
 on the page, you may proceed with the steps under the <strong>To make a system image</strong> section, and then complete the process.
<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Note: </strong>If you save the system image on a hard drive or USB flash drive, it must be formatted to use the
<strong>NTFS file system</strong>.</em><br />
<br />
Let us know if you need additional assistance regarding your concern.<br />

<p>If you use DVD's, use only DVD+R. Do NOT use DVD-R.&nbsp; There is a crucial difference between the two.&nbsp; DVD+R is far superior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do this as a standard practice for all my clients.&nbsp; It takes from 2 to 6 DVD +Rs.&nbsp; I do it BEFORE any data or dynamic applications are installed.&nbsp; I have used these DVD image sets numerous times to recover PCs and they work very well.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>- Are the device drivers updated?</p>
<p>- Are all the Windows updates including the optional updates installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try these steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Run the Power troubleshooter. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000">This troubleshooter is an automated Windows 8.1 inbuilt tool which finds and fixes the common issues with the Power settingsin your computer. Perform these steps to run this tool and check if that helps.</font></font></p>

</span></span><font>Press “<strong>Windows Logo</strong>” + “<strong>W</strong>” keys from the keyboard.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font><strong>b)</strong></font><span> </span>

<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font><strong>f)</strong></font><span> </span>
</span></span><font>Click “<strong>Next</strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Now try to shut down the computer and check if the issue still persists</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">2. Visit the computer manufacturer website and download the latest chipset and BIOS update available and check if the issue persists.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">3.&nbsp;<font color="#000000">&nbsp;Place the computer in clean boot.</font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><em><strong>Note:</strong> </em>After you have finished troubleshooting, refer the article “How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot” for Windows 8, given under the section “More
 Information” to reset the computer to start as usual from the above link.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, refer to the steps provided in <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;docname=c03383935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had a similar problem, and after doing some searching I found a number of references to "Homegroup"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't use a Homegroup so it had never been activated. As a result,&nbsp;I didn't understand the connection, but after starting the Homegroup and then turning off\removing\disabling, or whatever the proper term, Sleep now works properly....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I read something about not sleeping due to the machine looking for a Homegroup that didn't exist...</p>
<p>If you actually use a Homegroup, this may not work for you, but turning it off and restarting might&nbsp;help...</p>

</p>
<p>I've read that this issue can happen if the computers on a Homegroup aren't all joined in the same fashion, or something similar...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The solution was to remove all of the machines on the Homegroup and then reconnect them...</p>

<p>I can't test this as I only have the one machine hooked up.</p>

            After updating to 8.1 there appears to be some issue with the function Home Group/file sharing stopping my machine from auto sleeping.
<div>This worked for me.</div>
<div>Disable IPV6 on the network adapter.</div>
<div>Restart the machine.</div>
<div>Re-enable IVP6 on the network adapter.</div>
<div>My PC then auto sleeps and wakes OK until it is shutdown and restarted, which seems to reset it back to the"non sleep mode".</div>
<div>IPV6 is a Home Group requirement, some people have found disconnecting their network card or leaving the Home Group has the same effect. This problem is all over the forums.</div>
<div>Chalk up another one to boys from Redmond.</div>

<h2>            Missing part of my product key sticker and can&#39;t install using a key from my locker</h2>
                    I just wipped my HD and realized when I went to put vista back on. That my kid pulled off half of the product key sticker on my computer. So I went ahead and installed it without a product key. I thought after it installed I could install the key from
 my locker that I bought upgrading to home preume. But I was wrong. Didn't work. I called Acer the OEM for my computer and they told me that I had to buy a new key. That just dose not seam right, I still have half of the sticker and almost all of the key. Is
 there any way to get it back.

            Unfortunately,&nbsp;Acer are the only ones that know anything about your Computer.<br />
<br />
Normally with Acer, you can do a Recovery Installation of the original Operating System&nbsp;without entering a Product Key.<br />

<h3> haplessprune65  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Update Required to use Kinect</h2>
                    
<p>I have just purchased the 360 w/Kinect but I can't get past the **Update Required** screen saying that&nbsp;I need to update the Kinect. I have followed the instructions on the update but the Text XBOX LiVE Connection gives me another problem. I have asked to
 apply an update for the XBOX LIVE. Again, I have tried this update too. This time I get a message that the Update Failed, status code 351F-0000-0080-0300-8007-0570. I have even looked this up on the website but it didn't help any either.</p>
<p>I have downloaded the update to a flash drive and tried it too. But the website said as soon as the console was turned on it would recognize it and start the update. But that didn't happen!</p>
<p>When I have tried to join XBOX LIVE for free from the game I get an error screen the the feature is temporarily unavailable status code 8b080008-2a163c39-88e4fcf1. Again I looked this sode up on the website but didn't find anything on it.</p>
<p>Should I just box this thing up and return it or is there a solutions out there?</p>

            <p>Hello Hungarian Paprika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I prefer CCleaner to the Windows Disk Cleanup utility is that CCleaner ‘clears out’ more than DiskCleanup does and, more importantly, for me, CCleaner also deletes all Windows.dat files. This is particularly important for security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you visit internet sites (any site) files are cached in the Temporary Internet Files folder, along with the History Folder. Both CCleaner and the Windows Disk Cleanup utility&nbsp;remove these files when asked to do so by the user. However, these temporary
 internet files etc., are also stored in a Index.Dat file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you have cleared out all of the temporary internet files and history folders using Disk Cleanup. The Index.Dat files will still contain information relating to your browsing habits. Now assume that someone got access to your PC, by using the information
 in the Index.Dat files they could trace all of your movements while you are on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing the Index.Dat files with CCleaner eliminates this source of vital information, thus making your PC more secure from prying eyes. Okay removing the Index.Dat files doesn’t prevent law enforcement agencies gaining access to this vital information.
 They have specialised software that will trawl through your hard drive and obtain all the information they need for criminal activity. But then the average computer user isn’t doing anything illegal, all they are trying to do is prevent any unauthorised person
 from having access to this information. So my main reason for using CCleaner is added security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand why Electronic Arts has suggested that you use CCleaner, especially to address the list of items you have supplied. These of course, with the exception of DNS Cache are enabled by default within CCleaner so CCleaner would automatically clean
 these out whenever you use the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Scan for Issues and Fix Selected issues options refer to the registry cleaner option of CCleaner. This, as I stated in my previous post, I would suggest that you do not use. Registry cleaner have been known to delete ‘legitimate’ registry entries and,
 as a consequence, render the PC unbootable. Microsoft, incidentally, do not recommend that you use registry cleaners. Registry cleaners are used at the owners’ risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>‘Keep an eye out for firewalls’ is an intriguing statement. Window has a built in firewall and it is essential for the well-being of your system. It should not, under any circumstances, be disabled. If an application require permission to make changes to
 the firewall a pop up message should usually appear asking for your permission to make the changes. Yes, by all means check what application is asking for permission and, if that program alien to you then refuse permission.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope this explanation helps.</span></p>
