<h2>            IE11 crashes when trying to play youtube videos &#40;any build after 14931.rs_prerelease 160916-7000&#41;</h2>
                    <p>IE11 crashes and cannot recover when playing videos on youtube.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had any playback issues with any build up to WIN10 PRO build&nbsp;14931.rs.&nbsp; Any build installed after that one, (I've had 2 and had to do a recovery back down) causes a pop up stating IE has experienced a problem.&nbsp; It then tries to recover, but fails.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried compatability settings, changing activeX, but still the problem persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to build 14391 eliminates the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            If you are on the recent 14959 build hit the reset browser button in internet options/advanced, re-launch and go back in advanced and uncheck auto crash recover and page prediction. There are notes about IE crashing in the Feedback hub but I've experienced
 no issues

    <title>Outlook 2013 is duplicating incoming emails from IMAP accounts. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geneannj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 is duplicating incoming emails from IMAP accounts.</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook 2013 on a Windows 7 Professional PC.</p>
<p>I have about 10 email accounts on a mixture of POP and IMAP. We had to transfer some accounts to IMAP because of the spam and some blacklisting.</p>
<p>I was using Outlook Express easily, so I set up Rules to pass all incoming emails into one Inbox, but some emails disappeared and the IMAP ones were no longer on the server, so I changed the IMAP accounts to pass copies of incoming emails instead, leaving
 the original in that address's IMAP inbox on my PC and therefore on the server.&nbsp; I had been clearing the server by deleting the emails in the inbox of the IMAP on my PC but when I thought I had a problem, I have left them to be able to check the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The copies transferred into the main Inbox for the main IMAP email are being duplicated, sometimes I have 3 copies.</p>
<p>It appears that something is causing the Rule for that particular IMAP email to be "run"&nbsp; again on "old" emails for no apparent reason creating another copy of those emails in the Inbox. This can happen several times, and it seems to be occurring weekly
 or fortnightly, apparently over the weekend, and covers the emails dated between a week and a month ago - a period of about 2-3 weeks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My Inbox numbers suddenly increase dramatically</p>
<p>2. I have many newly transferred-in emails which I have already deleted or "junked" days or weeks ago, so now have to go through them all and delete or junk them again - and this could happen again on the next occurrance</p>
<p>3. Many emails I have dealt with and "filed" in sub folders have reappeared and I have to double check they have been dealt with.
</p>
<p>4. This is causing me a GREAT deal of extra work and more than doubling my time in dealing with my emails.</p>
<p>5. It does only seem to happen to one, the most used, of the IMAP accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be grateful if someone can shed some light on why this is happening and how to stop it.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue seems to happen due to a corrupt IMAP account or corrupt rules which re-run again fortnightly or so and create this issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to resolve this issue, I would suggest you to test if the IMAP account in particular works fine. To do this we will configure your frequently used IMAP account experiencing
 this issue in a new Outlook Profile.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow these steps to create a new Outlook Profile:
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918</span></span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After creating the new Outlook Profile, setup your IMAP email account in the new Profile.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To setup the IMAP email account/s in the new Outlook profile you may refer the section
<strong>How to</strong> <strong>set up an email account</strong> in the above article.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Close and reopen Outlook 2013 in the new Profile and check if the emails are still duplicating. If not, then the old Outlook Profile is corrupt and you
 will have to continue using the new Outlook Profile as your default. Configure the other POP and IMAP account one at a time (testing each account as you configure them) in the new Outlook Profile.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Make sure to follow the step:
<strong>Turn on or off profile prompt </strong>from the instructions in the above mentioned article and make your new Outlook Profile as the default Profile (on the same window follow the steps
<strong>Set a default profile</strong>). After these steps are completed – close and reopen Outlook 2013. It should open in the new Profile.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Try the above step and let us know the result.

<h2>            Outlook - 2010 Email in Sent items but doesn&#39;t send</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am using Outlook 2010 and added a GoDaddy IMAP account.&nbsp; Yesterday I noticed after readding the account that emails were not sending but were still in my Sent Items box.&nbsp; I tested the smtp and it say there was a 553 error.&nbsp; I then input my username and password
 into the Sent Items tab of Internet Email settings and it started working.&nbsp; My question is why did the emails sent before not go to outbox and refuse to send?&nbsp; They actually went straight into my sent items box and yet they were never delivered.<br />
<br />

            <p>
The error 553, mostly occur because of relay errors.
</p>
<p>
Relaying occurs when an e-mail message is sent to an e-mail address whose domain (the name after the @ symbol, such as adatum.com) is not processed by the
<span>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): A common protocol that is used to send e-mail messages across the Internet.)</span>
 Or outgoing server that the sender is requesting to deliver the message. The SMTP server must connect to another SMTP server to relay the message.</p>
<p>
So ideally the email is sent in Outlook, but not delivered to the recipient. That is the reason the sent email shows up in the Sent Items folder in Outlook.</p>

<h2>            Open excel file using VBA from Powerpoint and auto run another macro within the excel file</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a presentation that links into various files within the same folder area.
</p>
<p>However my issue is on one of the hyperlinks I need the excel file that is linked to only open a certain print area within a sheet as a pdf and not the actual excel file itself</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to add a VBA to open the excel file destination, and within the excel file I have a marco set up so that the sheet I need converts to pdf, however, I cant seem to link the two, so that when accessing the file via the powerpoint that it automatically
 shows the pdf (i.e runs the 2 macros together)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason behind doing it this way instead of simply creating a pdf and linking the powerpoint to the pdf itself is that the excel file is an ongoing spreadsheet that several people input into daily so to capture the most up to date information I need the
 pdf to be produced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This is the VBA I have on the powerpoint: </strong></p>

<p>Set xlApp = CreateObject("Excel.Application")</p>
<p>xlApp.Visible = True<br />

xlWorkBook.sheets(1).Range("A8").Value = "Project No"</p>
<p>Set xlApp = Nothing<br />
Set xlWorkBook = Nothing</p>
<p>End Sub</p>

<h2>            What is the syntax to save a file to the working directory with VBA</h2>
                    I am running some code to save a worksheet to its own excel file. What is the syntax to allow the path to be generic, to save the file to&nbsp; the working directory, where the excel workbook file is located. In this example the workbook is in the directory
 "Excel Dashboard". What if the directory I want to save to is one folder below the working directory, "Excel Dashboard\Invoices"?<br />
<br />
Sub SaveInvWithNewName()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim NewFN As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Copy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NewFN = "D:\Documents\Dropbox\Excel Dashboards\Inv" &amp; Range("F3").Value &amp; ".xlsx"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs NewFN, FileFormat:=xlOpenXMLWorkbook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWorkbook.Close<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NextInvoice<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
I am writing the program on Win 7, but it will also be used on a Mac, will the syntax for the path need to be different?<br />

            <p>If I understand your question correctly, you would want to use this for the current directory...<br />
<br />
Application.Path &amp; "\"<br />
<br />
I am not sure whether the "Inv" part of your NewFN assignment is new text to be combined with the contents of F3 or whether it is a directory name (in which case your code line is missing a backslash that should go after it in order to separate the filename
 in F3 from the directory's name). My guess is you want this...<br />
<br />
NewFN = Application.Path &amp; "\" &amp; Range("F3").Value &amp; ".xlsx"</p>

            "Inv" is part of the NewFN assignment, so the new file might be Inv3001.xlsx. How would that change your code.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to save the file NewFN assignment to a directory below Application.Path &amp; "\", say a directory called Invoices.<br />
<br />
Will this same code work if the computer running the Excel file is a Mac.<br />
<br />
I get a dialog box when when I run the code that says:<br />
<br />
"The following features cannot be saved in macro-free workbooks:<br />
-VB Project<br />
To save a file with these features, click No, and then choose a macro-enabled file type int eh File Type list.<br />

Is there a way to suppress this dialog box, I always want to click Yes.<br />

            <p>Very clever Neha. :) </p>
<p>
</p><p>@doug929: The only downside to Neha's solution is it's not truly a shared workbook, but a read-only version of the specified data - and a snapshot in time, unable to be edited. If that's all you want, then this will work just fine. The alternative is to
 code a custom solution with VBA, use a database, or you could even create an Office Add-In to do this. In any case they get fairly complicated.&nbsp;</p>

 is everyone doing who are trying to migrate to OneDrive?</p>

            <p>Your options are limited if you use Excel. Right now you can share a workbook as a whole. That means if you want different people seeing different parts of a workbook, you would have to create their own workbook and share it with them. IMO this isn't a feasible
 option as it creates too much confusion and fractures data, which will lead to multiple issues down the road.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option would be to keep the data in a hidden sheet and use formulas to pull the data. For this option it's basically read only. Updating or adding new data becomes an issue without letting the user see the hidden data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In vanilla Excel I would use VBA. For this you wouldn't be able to use Excel Online, but would need to use desktop Excel. For this you'd need to define things like where the input data resides, where the output data resides, how updating of information should
 happen, where new data would go, how you want users to access the data, Excel version, operating system, things like that. It's not that we can't do that, but the scope of it is starting to grow and might be more than can be handled on a single forum thread.</p>

            I just think things like this should be up front when people are looking at Office 365 purchase. I do not believe anything I read says "hey, be careful, very few features work Online with Excel". What are all the people doing that have all their procedures
 and reports setup and then migrate them to be viewed online? I'm new to Office 365, am I missing something? &nbsp;

            <p>While the Excel team is constantly working on feature parity across the different versions, and the Online versions have taken leaps and bounds over the last few years, you're completely right there's a big feature difference between desktop Excel and Excel
 Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be fair, when Microsoft says there's something new with Excel, they're primarily talking about desktop Excel, the main version. Right now the other flavors are basically runners up, as they don't have all the same features, but desktop has them all. Also,
 Office 365 refers to desktop Excel as well, not Excel Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some resources for what's new regarding Office:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-s-new-in-Excel-2016-for-Windows-5fdb9208-ff33-45b6-9e08-1f5cdb3a6c73" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What's new in Excel</a></li><li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Excel/ct-p/Excel_Cat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Excel TechCommunity</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft posts updates to all Excel endpoints in the latter link, but honestly it can be difficult to find. And with the current model [of software], updates are pushed out at a much faster cadence than they were previously, sometimes monthly. If you want
 to be heard, there is a platform for that as well,&nbsp;<a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Excel Uservoice</a>.</p>

    <title>How to disable spell check in Skype for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vdeslandescl  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to disable spell check in Skype for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've just downloaded the Skype for Windows 10 app on my (obviously) Windows 10 computer. However, it uses spell check and auto corrects, and I just can't seem to find where to turn that off. I often type in different languages (not just English) and it keeps
 correcting and highlighting "mistakes" that are not, in fact, mistakes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried turning it off in Typing settings, but that didn't do the trick. It's still active on Skype (and even on here). Any idea of what I can do?</p>
<p>

Hmm... I have no idea how to check my version nor how I can auto-update, the whole Settings panel of the app is frustratingly bare. I know that the auto-correct in Windows has been turned off for over a year. I'll try restarting one more time just in case.

            Many times. Tried uninstalling and reinstalled. Tried enabling/disabling spell check in Devices &gt; Typing while the app is open, and when it's closed. I've restarted many times since I've submitted the question. Why is still autocorrecting?

    <title>Office excel 2010 will not open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michelle sheree  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office excel 2010 will not open</h2>
                    <p>Although there are many similar issues posted there are not quite the same as mine. So here goes..........</p>
<p>i always have automatic updates switched on from microsoft so my windows 7 is completely upto date.</p>
<p>i recently was having trouble opening certain files, no reason, they just stopped opening, because i use Windows 7 but office 2013 at work i just thought it was an xls xlxs or whatever the incompatibility was/still is. however this is not the case. i continued
 to open some files but eventually excel would not open any of my files. i tried to open excel on its own and it would open up. so whilst open i just went to open file and tried to open the files i needed. this didnt work, backing up that it might be a file
 incompatibility issue re 2010 and 2013. but a day later i returned to my pc and excel will not open any of my documents in full screen, i can see them as a little image when i scroll over the excel icon in the bottom left of my task bar but they just would
 not open up/expand. i have spent four weeks now reading everything adn trying everything but nothing works. i ahve competeley wiped the whole of office 2010 off my system twice in an attempt to reinstall any corrupted files, i have also tried the repair once
 instead of removal, still doesnt work. office word and powerpoint are ok. </p>
<p>any clues? i have office 2010 home and business edition. i am running windows 7 which is right up to date according to microsoft updates.</p>

            <p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try and follow few steps:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right Click on the excel then try looking for properties and then click on it and then look for compatablity then once located kindly click on change for all users then try CHANGING COMPATABLITY MODES,,,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't work then open Excel in safe mode which is simple press and hold the Shift Key while clicking on the excel Icon once prompted click on yes to go to safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once it opens look for the File option at the top left corner and then once you click over there kindly look for options and go for 'Advanced Options" and look for Disable Graphics acceleration and Ignore other applications which needs DDE try checking them
 and see what happens</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it works!!!</p>
<p>

<p>IP addresses are not physical, they are a configurable value set by the network administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, the C3-00 does not support fixed IP addresses (used by IP protocol), if you've meant that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most networks nowadays use DHCP to dynamically assign an IP address for network devices. Of course this requires a DHCP server that assigns the address. Practically all SOHO routers sold in the last decade provide this functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a fixed address for the device used by the IEEE 802 protocol family (that's a lower lever protocol used by the IP protocol) called MAC address. Now that we could call physical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing the MAC address allows you to instruct the DHCP server to always assign the same IP address to a device with a specified MAC address. (MAC to IP assignment)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can get the MAC address of the phone the next way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Settings-&gt;Connectivity-&gt;WLAN-&gt;Available WLANS</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone will detect nearby wifi stations, choose one, &nbsp;select&nbsp;<em>Options-&gt;Details</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press the select button to see details including Phone MAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hello
<div>Thanks for contacting regarding this issue. I am using outlook as my primary email client even for my official emails. It's causing me a very undesired situation. I have switched from gmail which is my long loved service due to the improved interface of
 outlook. com</div>
<div>Q1 --yes I am receiving bounced emails when sending emails to this domain.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Q2--yes I have tried from other account and even created a new account for sending to this domain but was unsuccessful. I have almost tried every possibility at my end including asking support from the host of this domain.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Looking forward.</div>

<h2>            Cannot change chat bubble colour in Skype for Windows 7, Version8.17.0.2</h2>
                    <p>I cannot change the chat bubble colour in Skype for Windows 7. I use it regularly to communicate with a couple of family members as well as coworkers while on my laptop. The theme colour will change from white to black and vice versa, but even though I choose
 different colours they don't actually change within the chats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have any issue with this on my mobile, just on my computer. My coworker recently updated to this latest edition of Skype on her laptop and it is able to change colour with no issue (she is on exact same OS).&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>As you can see below, the other person's chat bubbles stay white, even though I have changed the color to Fuchsia. All of my existing chats appear like this. Like I said, I can change the theme from light to dark and vice versa, but nothing happens when
 I change the color. This issue is only occurring on my laptop, color changing on mobile works fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I could not find that directory on my computer, for some reason. I tried renaming the folder found in Program Files (x86)\Microsoft to Skype for Desktop1, but that did nothing. I uninstalled and reinstalled twice more and nothing has worked. Must be a glitch
 with my machine or Windows OS. I'll just leave it as is on this machine. It's a nuisance, but not the end of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            In Word 2010 Mail Merge, is there a way to keep the merge field window open in order to select and insert the fields throughout the document.</h2>
                    When creating the merge document, in order to insert the various merge field from the data source, the window or menu list do not stay open so you are constantly having to reopen that list or window for each field you want to insert.&nbsp; Sometimes I get a
 window that does&nbsp;stay open, however the window will not allow you to navigate the document to select another location before inserting another field.

            <p>No, you can't keep it open.&nbsp; Using the drop-down list on the Insert Merge Field button is probably the quickest way of selecting a field, if you know the field names you can manually insert a field by pressing Ctrl+F9 to insert the curly field braces then
 typing</p>
<p>MERGEFIELD Fieldname</p>
<p>inside the curly braces, press F9 when you've done this to display the inserted merge field.</p>

<h2>            my documents, mu music, my pictures...etc</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I have one another comment, actually it is a question, and this question directly to you guys who develop and design windows,
</p>
<p>are you really using all these pre created folders like documents, videos, games..etc or you have your own folder structure on your hard dirves? I'm pretty sure most of the users out there create their own folder structure..so why you are still focusing
 on these folders?, for example I want "file explorer" to start on hard drives not on pre cretaed useless folders. Please do not get me wrong I'm just trying to understand if I'm the only one thinks this way.</p>
<p>you do not need to answer this, it is just my opinion. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>Okan</p>

            <p>I think these folders were originally created to give novices a starting point for their file systems. However, soon applications were searching for these folders and wouldn't load if they were not available. My big bug bear are the Library folders.. A great
 idea but in practice unless you manually link folders to them, they are worse than useless because if you rely on them you can lose track of your files completely. You just need an app to store its media in a strange location and you've had it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, I agree. Your digital file system, just as with paper filing, is your own, and follows what seems logical to you and the tasks you perform on your computer.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Even the novice person will first need to move their media to their hard drive before start, so they need to know that&nbsp;all those files&nbsp;need to be placed in proper locations in order&nbsp;to appear in&nbsp;that particular library.
</p>
<p>What logical for me is, all the applications(media player, photo viwer..etc)&nbsp;on windows should search entire hard drives(int/ext) for their proper media at launch, and place them on their specific libraries automatically. For example blizzard game client
 checks installed games at&nbsp;launch and finds them even though they are not in the windows registry(it takes around 3 minutes, and it does not matter the installation location)</p>
<p>anyway the reason I'm telling you this is there are dozens of 3rd party media players, photo viwers out there you name it, and I believe who makes the easiest and efficient one&nbsp;wins the competiton. I believe in "out of box" and maybe sometimes&nbsp;thinking should
 be like "out of windows"</p>
<p>
</p><p>and by the way these folders originally are located on "C" drive, and even the novice person after a week will partion the drive in two and will learn not to put personal&nbsp;files within the same partion with windows.</p>
<p>

            <p>i have NEVER used the default folders for pictures/music/etc</p>
<p>why?</p>
<p>because Windows and programs LOVE to fill those folders with their OWN folders, and their OWN files, they get in the way of ME finding MY own things, so they are worthless/useless always have been.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you know how many times users have asked me, "what IS this stuff?, i didn't put that in here??"</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is why users create their own folder structure, because they learn that things just "appear" in the default folders and they dont like it, it confuses them to no end.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">For IMAP accounts, you can use multiple computers and devices to check your email. Your mails are stored on the server and the sent email stays on the server so you can see it from any device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>POP3 email accounts downloads email from a server to a single computer, then it deletes it from the server. Since your messages get downloaded to a single computer or device and then it will be deleted deleted from the server, it can appear that a
 mail is missing or disappearing from your inbox if you try to check your mail from a different computer.</span></p>

to start downloading the update.</li></ol>
