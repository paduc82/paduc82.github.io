            BIOS - How to Enter the BIOS<br />
<br />
Every computer is different, when you first turn on the computer it should tell you what button to push to enter the BIOS. It's usually one of the following and you must push it within the first 5 seconds:
<br />
<br />
F1&nbsp; F2&nbsp; F10&nbsp; F12 ESC&nbsp; DEL <br />
<br />
Once in the BIOS you have to find the menu with memory remapping, it's different on each computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Enable the memory remapping feature</b><br />
<br />
Check the BIOS settings to see whether the memory remapping feature is enabled. Memory remapping gives Windows access to more memory. You can enable the memory remapping feature in the BIOS by booting to the system setup. See the User's Guide for your computer
 for instructions on how to boot to system setup on your computer. The name for the memory remapping feature may be different for different hardware vendors. This can be listed as memory remapping, memory extension, or something similar. Be aware that your
 computer may not support the memory remapping feature.<br />

<p>So I just upgraded my motherboard, processor, and RAM this evening and now I cannot get to desktop. When I start up my computer it goes in a loop until I decide to try and do a System Repair which leads to the following results listed below.<br />
<br />
I have made sure that all of the connections are correct and secure. <br />
Everything should be compatible. <br />
I have unplugged all unnecessary plugs-ins (mp3's, printers, etc.). <br />
I have tried to do a system restore, but it fails every time. <br />
I do not get the option to go into safe mode. <br />
<br />
If anyone can provide me with ANY help at all it would be highly appreciated!<br />

            Are you trying to boot your Windows installation used with the prior motherboard?&nbsp; If so,
<br />
this is to be expected.&nbsp; When NT derived versions of Windows are transferred to significantly different hardware (i,.e. without an identical or almost identical CPU and chip set) they will generally not be bootable.&nbsp; The HAL (hardware abstraction layer) is
 customized during the original installation.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Windows XP we can usually resolve this by doing an in-place repair reinstallation.&nbsp; Unfortunately that is not an option in Vista and Windows 7.<br />
&nbsp; There is one product in the market that can be used to do this kind of transfer (assuming the Windows version permits it and is not a BIOS locked OEM product for example) - Acronis Universal Restore, but it is an add on to very expensive business products.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll need to back up your data and do a clean reinstallation of Windows 7 to use the new hardware.&nbsp; If your Windows was an OEM release that will raise other technical and licensing issues.<br />

<h2>            Skype is unusable</h2>
                    Ever since the new version of skype was forced upon us, I have been having severe issues chatting with my friends.&nbsp; Up until today I was eventually able to connect and chat with them after restarting.&nbsp; Today I have restarted the program multiple times
 but my friends can't see what i type and I cannot see what they type.&nbsp; Odd thing is, if I skype from my phone I can see what I have said on my pc, but still cannot see my friends even though they are showing available.

            Hi DalbirDarpan<br /><br />Although I don't have a direct source, it looks like the HP pen supports Synaptics technology, which is different from the Surface Pen technology for the SP4.<br /><br />So no, they are not compatible .

<h2>            Hitman Absolution - Parental Controls</h2>
                    
<p>I'm in the UK, on a Pal Xbox 360 and unable to access contract mode. All I get is "online service is disabled on your Xbox Live account due to parental control restrictions". The parental controls were never turned on, so I tried turning them on and setting
 everything 'all games/unrated' etc. But still, same message. I never had a prompt for a passcode when the game launches or when trying to access Contracts. I've used the redeem code from the home panels and installed it, re-launched the game.. same error.
 I turned parental controls back off.. I've tried shoving the controller up my nose. None of these things have worked.</p>
<p>I contacted Square Enix support of they replied with 'The issue may be resolved by removing you gamertag and downloading it again, but to save you from having to back-up all your save files you may wish to speak to microsoft support to see if the have any
 information as to why this is happening.'</p>
<p>So.. why is this happening!?</p>

<p>Hey Bob and Jason,</p>
<p>You guys seem to have a copacetic conversation going on here, so I won't ask you to post in a different forum Jay.</p>
<p>So, to be clear, are you guys on Adult accounts? &nbsp;Typically, unrated content can't be accessed by non-Adult accounts due to the fact that it doesn't have a rating attached.</p>
<p>Let us know if you are on Adult accounts, and we'll go from there.</p>
<p>Thanks! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes I have had this account for 10 years. It's not a family account. This is the only problem I have ever had with this. I was with support team here yesterday here and they told me it was on the publisher not my Xbox. &nbsp;The settings have always been turned
 off. I tried using the custom option made a code still nothing. I have returned the settings to the off position and am now waiting.</p>

<p>I had a long chat with xbox live support, and there wasn't much that could be done. I've tinkered with everything and it looks like it's a Square problem. They've given me two messages: The first was about issues with the server not be online, then it became
 a parental control message.</p>

<p>Hey all,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just want to clarify, you set your account settings to adult with the following process:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to My Account in the top right corner of this page<br />
Click on the Privacy and Online Settings option</p>
<p>Then set the profile to Adult in that aspect</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let's be sure your console is also set to allow Mature content by going through this process:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the dashboard, go to Settings<br />
Then choose Family</p>
<p>Make sure Content Controls are set to Off</p>
<p>Then choose Save and Exit</p>
<p><br />
Last, lets also be sure your account is over the adult age of 18. This is something you can not check but if you put your actual again in when creating the account and you are less than 18 years old as of now, then that would be the issue. It would also help
 if you were logged in to Xbox LIVE while playing as opposed to being offline so there is clear verification that your account is set to Adult settings and all these changes save. Let us know if this helps. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Windows won&#39;t boot, always goes to startup repair, startup repair and safe mode fail, no recovery disks, and a failing harddrive.</h2>
                    I turned on my laptop today, and the scenario above has been playing out all day. Windows always loads up Startup Repair, but it takes a few minutes to get there. After maybe 10 - 15 minutes, I'm told that a hard disk problem prevents Windows from booting.
 I tried booting up in safe mode, but it takes me straight to startup repair (it stops checking files at something called drivers\fileinfo.sys before going to startup repair).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Startup Repair fails to fix anything, safe mode fails to boot up, and I have no recovery disks for my laptop. I've tried a recovery partition, but it doesn't' t work, instead skipping to the OS I want to use. Finally, I've gotten messages that my harddrive
 has been failing for the past month.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way I can fix this without having to buy a new hard drive or laptop? I really can't afford either at the moment (Windows came pre-installed on this laptop, and I can't afford Windows 7 Home Premium, either.) My laptop is a Toshiba Satellite
 L455-S5045. All help is greatly appreciated in this matter.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

            Sorry for the late reply, but it turns out my laptop is officially kaput. I managed to find someone who would take a look at the laptop, and they determined that my hard drive was beyond saving, and the internal motherboard was burnt out. Still, I appreciate
 your help in this matter.

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you are unable to launch Rise of Nations on Windows 10. It is possible that the game is incompatible with Windows 10 or your computer does not meet the system requirements needed by the game. To resolve your concern, you may
 run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter by following the steps on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. If the issue persist, you may change the recommended settings listed on the given link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also refer to the image below to check if your PC meets the system requirements needed by the game.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. There is a possibility that the current Windows Update version installed on your computer is incompatible with the device drivers. It is also possible that the game is corrupted or the installation is incomplete. To continue
 troubleshooting your concern, we suggest that you check for new Windows Update by following the steps on this

<p>
</p><p>You can also <span>temporarily disable the antivirus software and test the game again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Another option is to </span><span>repair damaged Windows files:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows key</strong> on your keyboard + <strong>X</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type the following command and hit <strong>Enter</strong>: <strong><em>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</em></strong></li><li>Type the following command and hit <strong>Enter</strong>: <em><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></em></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, reset the app by following the steps below:</p>

    <title>Windows 10 email client does&#39;t respect reply-to header - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pekkalylykorpi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 email client does&#39;t respect reply-to header</h2>
                    <p>I've found a problem (bug?) in Windows 10 email client when trying to answer to email message with reply-to header. It always answers just to sender. I tested it with Outlook 2016 on the same machine and everything works fine, messages will be sent where
 they were meant to be sent. So Outlook respects that header.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I just googled I found that other people have found that too (e.g. https://medium.com/@BraunDoug/windows-10-mail-client-broken-ignores-reply-to-header-f64b6a58365f and https://community.canvaslms.com/thread/11144).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any fix/work-around for this?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>We have community members who reported that the bug no longer exists with the new version of Windows Mail App. Kindly update the application to its latest version and check if it resolves the reply-to header issue. Follow these steps below to turn on the
 automatic updates of your Windows applications including your Windows Mail App:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. On the Start screen, select Store to open Windows Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Select the account menu (next to the search box), then select <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under <strong>App updates</strong>, set <strong>Update apps automatically</strong> to
<strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<p>

It appears that you have the most updated version because it was with version 17.8004.42017.0 that they said they have not encountered the reply-to header issue. Since the issue still persists, we recommend that you send your suggestions through our Feedback
 Hub so we can improve our service and reinstate the feature on our future updates.<br />
<br />
Please do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.

<p>I then tried to do a restart with chkdsk /r to repair bad sectors, would never go past 16%, always crashed. Is there a way to fix this? Can't find anything else, thank you in advance.<br />

    <title>Windows Defender platform update 4.18.1806.18062 repeats infinitely - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmitrybrant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender platform update 4.18.1806.18062 repeats infinitely and uses unbounded disk space.</h2>
                    <p>Today Windows showed me a notification that my disk was running out of space, which I thought was ludicrous, so I looked into which folders were using up the most space.&nbsp; That's when I noticed that the folder "Program Files\Windows Defender\platform" was
 in excess of <strong>75 GB</strong>, and was full of subfolders named "4.18.1806.18062-0",&nbsp;"4.18.1806.18062-1", "4.18.1806.18062-2", etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like there's a Windows Update item (Defender platform update - KB4052623) that has been trying to install itself unsuccessfully, and apparently it creates a new subfolder under "platform" every time it tries updating (?).&nbsp; The error given by Windows
 Update is&nbsp;0x80070643, and when trying to update using the Windows Update MiniTool, the error is 0x80240022.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution or workaround for this?&nbsp; I have tried all the usual Windows Update troubleshooter tools, scanning the filesystem, etc.&nbsp; I don't use any third-party AV tools, and I haven't changed anything in my system configuration recently.</p>

            Hello I am a fellow community member here to help. This must be frustrating. I would begin by reviewing the following troubleshooting guide

            Thanks, but I don't see anything in the troubleshooting guide that applies to this situation. The update refers to a platform update of Windows Defender itself, not a definition update.

<p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I'm not very familiar with Group Policy. I've opened the Group Policy Editor, but I have no idea where to add the "Allow" setting that is mentioned above.</p>

<p>I do not see "Windows Defender platform" in the Group Policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see "Computer Configuration" and "User Configuration".&nbsp; After some searching, the only things related to Windows Defender that I could find are under "Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Windows Components".</p>
<p>
</p><p>There I see "Windows Defender Antivirus", "Windows Defender Application Guard", and "Windows Defender SmartScreen".&nbsp; Each of these contains a bunch of specific policy settings, but right-clicking them doesn't give the option to "Allow" anything.&nbsp; The right-click
 menu includes options like "Edit", "Filter on", "Filter options", etc.</p>

Thank you for replying. I appreciate you for trying troubleshooting steps to fix issue.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try to follow these methods and check.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1. Clean Boot</strong><br />

                    My DVD drive is listed as hidden in device manager so no programs will recognize the drive and I can't use it. It's not listed under This PC and there are no yellow flags in device manager. I uninstalled it and restarted yet it still doesn't show. Now
 it doesn't even show under hidden devices. It's completely gone. Help.

            Hi Richard.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Disk Management, scroll down on the drive map to find the DVD drive, right click to assign a drive letter.  
<br />
<br />If it isn't showing then check the cables or reseat the drive in its bay to try to get it detected in the BIOS of UEFI firmware.  
<br />
<br />Other steps here to troubleshoot DVD:  
<br />
<br />First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-drive-not-working-missing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />Did the DVD drive work in that PC before?  If so this might have been caused by Windows Update.  Did you receive Windows Updates recently?  Check at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.  You can try uninstalling any affecting Updates there.
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />See if the problem returns with the Update reinstalling and if so uninstall it and block it using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />To attempt to repair this, go to Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Under DVD Device, click on Driver tab, see if Roll Back is available.  If not choose  Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Next right click Start button to open Disk Management, scroll down to find the DVD drive.  Does it have a driver letter?  If not right click to issue a drive letter so it shows up in File Explorer, save and exit.
<br />
<br />Run Hardware troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />FYI there is no DVD player in Windows 10, they want you to buy one from the store.  There are better free options here:  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/how-to-play-dvds-in-windows-10-for-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Try these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Open the Command Prompt with administrative privileges (Ctrl+Shift+Enter).
<br />
<br />2. Type the following command and hit Enter key:
<br />
<br />reg.exe add “HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi\Controller0” /f /v EnumDevice1 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001
<br />
<br />3. Exit the Command Prompt and hopefully reboot. Insert a disk to test and the DVD drive should shown now.
<br />
<br />See if this helps!

            Never get drivers from Windows Update. Get them from:<br />
<br />
1. The device mftr.'s website; OR<br />
2. The motherboard mftr.'s website if hardware is onboard; OR<br />
3. The OEM's website for your specific machine if you have an OEM computer (HP, Dell, Sony, etc.).<br />
<br />
Read the installation instructions on the website where you get the drivers.<br />
<br />
To find out what hardware is in your computer:<br />
<br />
1. Read any documentation you got when you bought the computer.<br />
2. If the computer is OEM, go to the OEM's website for your specific model machine and look at the specs (you'll be there to get the drivers anyway)<br />
3. Download, install and run a free system inventory program like Belarc Advisor or System Information for Windows.<br />

<h2>            Projecting to this PC - We are still trying to determine the feature capabilities</h2>
                    <p>Help needed ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to project my mobile phone screen to a laptop as part of a presentation
<strong>BUT&nbsp;</strong>I get the following message - <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
both</span> on my PC and the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5f569b2-7cd3-4a9a-8e11-eddcd11b8c85?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5f569b2-7cd3-4a9a-8e11-eddcd11b8c85?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Both the PC and the laptop are fully updated - I've scanned and tried various replies to this issue -<strong> BUT NONE WORK</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to get round the problem with AirServer Window 10 - but no success here either.</p>
<p>It would seem that there is something wrong/missing in the wifi setup?? But what?&nbsp; Wifi internet connection works fine (all good).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can cast the phone to the TV - but not to these Windows 10 machines - although there are plenty of YouTube videos showing this feature working!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So - your help/advice would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

            This feature currently only works with Android, if the phone is an IPhone then you’ll have to await Microsoft to update the feature.
<br />If the phone is android then have you connected the phone to the PC via Bluetooth?

    <title>Call of Duty Ghost &#38;quot&#59;disc read error imagefile7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike24forever  say:</h3>
<h2>            Call of Duty Ghost &#38;quot&#59;disc read error imagefile7 &#38;amp&#59; disc read error imagefile9&#38;quot&#59;  and error code &#38;&#35;39&#59;nml&#38;&#35;39&#59; on the Xbox One</h2>
                    After calling XBOX Support, I was directed to post my issue here. When trying to play the campaign in Call of Duty Ghost, the game would freeze and "disc read error imagefile9" would come up on the screen and go back to the screen with the ghost mask.
 This continued so I hard booted the system and the problem persisted. So I uninstalled the game and re-downloaded the game. When I tried to play multiplayer, I got "error code 'nml' and the above mention occurred again. I turned the system off and tried both
 multiplayer and campaign and got "disc read error imagefile7". The game is completely unplayable right now for me. This is the only game that I have had issues with, yet. Thanks in advance, Mike

<p>I'm very disappointed with Microsoft customer service. &nbsp;Even though the gentleman I spoke to on the phone was very polite, the fact that he had no answers for my issues and directed me to a forum for additional support where he said that it will be answered
 in a timely manner by a Microsoft employee. &nbsp; </p>

    <title>BSOD when running VMWare Player after Creators Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BSOD when running VMWare Player after Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>After Creators Update installed, I had to manually disable Hyper-V (even though Hyper-V is not installed in Windows Options - Thanks MS), in order to get VMWare player to recognize virtualization and allow 64-bit machines to operate again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after a few minutes of operation, I get the standard MS BSOD 0xe0000001 for item vmx86.sys, the needed driver for virtualization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Pro 64-bit OS, x64-based processor</p>
<p>8 GB Ram</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            It&nbsp;may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

<p>Hi Auggy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the minidump files for the last 4 times it crashed on me.&nbsp; I should note that before the system updated this morning, I had been running VMware Workstation Player 12 with no issues.</p>

<p>The minidump files showed a consistent Unknown bugcheck code (e0000001) that appears to be caused by the &nbsp;vmx86.sys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;vmware-vmx.exe is the process that crashed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the vmx86.sys and vmware-vmx.exe are components of VMware there may have been a corruption in the installation if the VMware software was present during the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event try uninstalling VMware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then apply the following update for Windows 10:</p>

<p>I have this issue as well and it's exactly the same error</p>
<p>Never had a single problem until recently after updating to latest creator update.</p>

            I've tried that as well, and have posted over in vmware communities about the issue with no response yet.&nbsp; I don't see how it can be a vmware issue myself, as vmware has been running absolutely fine on my machine for years, only crashing the system after
 MS issued it's Creators Update.<br />

<h2>            Billing Issues &#40;Games not showing in billing history&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey, I was curious as to why some of my 360 games weren't showing up in the Xbox One preview program, so I go and look into my purchase history, and I find that a LOT of games that I've bought over the years are not in the history.
 I know I bought them because you can't play someone else's purchases unless they are signed in. I hope this is the right forum for this question, but what could have happened, and what can be done to fix??</p>

<p>
</p><p>Many things can stop this add wireless display adapter from appearing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. VPN software (netgear ReadyCloud software also adds a hidden VPN device)</p>
<p>2. group policy settings if you are on a domain</p>
<p>3. firewall rules on a domain (you should not normally have to change the Windows firewall if you are a consumer not on a domain)</p>
<p>4. third party anti virus and/or firewalls - recommend completely uninstalling these, restarting, and then checking to see if you can add a wireless display.

<p>Many of the third party VPN solutions view WiFi Direct as a "Split Tunnel" and therefore a security risk and disable that functionality. Miracast a reliant on WiFi Direct to send the video singnal to the reciever. It is possible that the Built-in Sonic Wall
 Mobile Connect VPN will allow you to connect without the need of installing the Client. This can be found in the Modern UI Network Connections under VPN.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Other culprits are Hypervisors like VirtualBox that create virtual switches that also disable WiFi Direct.

</p><p>Hello Barb</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driving me crazy. I have gotten the screenbeam adapter and installed it. </p>
<p>The laptop running 8.1 installs it in device manager. The SBWD100b device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From my laptop I can update the firmware for the adapter and change the settings. But when I go to add the device from PC and Devices. It doesn't show. Also I have no add wireless display option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I sit at a "READY to connect screen'. It's like windows 8.1 is partially managing the device. No VPN and I Installed firewall software I was using.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please help. Actiontec support says its a windows problem. Because they actually deploy no software.</p>

</p><p>Not sure what you mean about firewall software. Do you/did you have third party firewall software and is it uninstalled now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a Surface tablet&nbsp;or do you have a laptop and if so, specific vendor and model number?</p>

            <p>I have a Surface Pro 3 and just got the Microsoft wireless display adapter.&nbsp; I know the adapter is working because my extra screen says "Ready to connect."&nbsp; But when I go to Devices -&gt; Project, I don't have an option to "Add a wireless display."&nbsp; Instead,
 I have "PC screen only," "Extend," "Duplicate, and "Second screen only."&nbsp; I've tried all of these options, but nothing appears on the WDA screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read the points about the VPN, etc. and I don't have those (as far as I know).&nbsp; Any other suggestions?</p>
