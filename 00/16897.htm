            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical preview.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Where are you trying to see the location? Is it Cortana or any app?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Firstly, I suggest you to check the region settings. Refer to the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Press Windows key +W.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Type Region &amp; click on Region &amp; language settings.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Check if the region selected in correct.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Turn off and on the Location settings. Refer to the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Press Windows key + W.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Type Location and click on Location settings.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Turn Off and then turn the location On and check if issue persists.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Ensure that&nbsp;Date and Time set correctly and check the issue status.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows key + W</strong>&nbsp;and type&nbsp;<strong>Date and Time</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Set Date and Time.</strong></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Click on Change&nbsp;<strong>Date and Time</strong>&nbsp;Button to&nbsp;<strong>change date and time.</strong></span></span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on Change&nbsp;<strong>Time Zone&nbsp;</strong>button to change Time Zone</span></span></li><li><span><span>Save the changes and check the issue status.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 4</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Synchronize their system clock with Internet Time and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>&nbsp;Click the&nbsp;<strong>Date and Time display&nbsp;</strong>on the Task bar followed by Change date and time settings.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Internet time&nbsp;</strong>tab.</span></span></li><li><span><span>In the&nbsp;<strong>Internet Time Settings&nbsp;</strong>window, mark the check box with label as Synchronize with an internet time server and specify the server name.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Save the changes by clicking on&nbsp;<strong>Ok</strong>.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The Windows team is aware of some issues trying to figure out locations and working to improve this. In order to help us gather more details can you submit the feedback through the Windows Feedback app following these steps (using the machine that gives
 the wrong location)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Windows Feedback</p>
<p>2. Start a new feedback item and select Problem</p>

    <title>Need option in Excel to treat text enclosed in quotes as text when - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Need option in Excel to treat text enclosed in quotes as text when opening csv files</h2>
                    <p>I've seen a number of threads related to this topic, but no solution for users who aren't accustomed to having to go through creating an import specification just to have a csv display correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many web applications allow users to download and simply
 open the the csv file instead of saving.</p>
<p>Why should they have to save with a txt format and then go through an import procedure?&nbsp;&nbsp; Why can't excel just display anything enclosed in quotes as text?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, why couldn't Excel prompt the user for a display preference whenever it sees numbers enclosed
 in quotes in a csv file?&nbsp; Or ask if they would like to save and open import wizard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or perhaps there could be a user option within the excel client under data or proofing that could enable display of anything enclosed in quotes in csv file as text.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would still be a pain for casual users who never use options, but it would be at least
 some improvement over current state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love to see feedback from MS Development team as to whether this would be feasible, or if there is a better solution.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested from my side for some times and the leading zero is dropped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an article I find: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/keeping-leading-zeros-and-large-numbers-1bf7b935-36e1-4985-842f-5dfa51f85fe7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Keeping leading zeros and large numbers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I add a ' before 0080081, it will show as '0080081 in Excel:</p>
<p>sku,cust_price</p>
<p>'0080081,43.45</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6fc1600-1d31-4f35-8ec1-4d5a71b4013e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6fc1600-1d31-4f35-8ec1-4d5a71b4013e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click into the formula bar and enter, the ' disappears, then I save the file and reopen it, it still shows 80081. If I just leave the ' there and save the file, it will show '0080081 after I save and reopen the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to suggest you send a feedback in Excel application by click the smile face, it will send the feedback to product team directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

    <title>Company-wide Skype account lockouts and useless support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vibe_804  say:</h3>
<h2>            Company-wide Skype account lockouts and useless support</h2>
                    <p>We are an Office 365 customer who wanted to use Skype internally at our company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We purchased Skype for Business licenses for all users, however this product is a joke. Skype for Business does not support being installed on more than 1 device, as conversation sync between devices does not work. This means that if a user installs Skype
 for Business on two devices and someone sends them a message, the Skype for Business servers *randomly* pick 1 of the 2 devices to start the conversation with. It's actually ridiculous and not fit for release, despite being a feature request for over 2 years
 with over 60,000 requests for a fix on skypefeedback &amp; Technet nothing has been done to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of this, we were forced to go back to the free Skype, which works perfectly, except Microsoft no longer lets you create free Skype accounts using Office 365 email addresses!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This basically means Microsoft does not let Office 365 customers use Skype at all:</p>
<p>Skype for business is completely broken, and you are not allowed to use Free Skype on 365.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We were forced to create all the staff at our company a sub-domain (@skype.domain.com) and create skype accounts using these non-365 email addresses. A frustrating work-around, but it seemed to work to begin with...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After about 10 days, staff randomly started having their Skype accounts "temporarily suspended". They can un-suspend the accounts by putting in their mobile numbers and requesting a one-time code, however this is now happening to ALL accounts every 10-15
 days!!! No further information is available on why or how this is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These accounts are used ONLY for text chat between a handful of computers and a couple of iPhones. The accounts are not suspicious any way, nor is any activity against any of the MS terms of service... The only Microsoft Support I can get for Skype is web-chat,
 where the staff are completely useless and insist this is because "two-step authentication" is turned on (even though it isn't)....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there ANYONE at Microsoft that can provide ANY support or assistance on what is wrong with these accounts? We are really at our wits end with Skype... I understand you filter support requests so you're not over-run by basic support stuff, but Microsoft
 have made it virtually impossible for our company to use Skype and impossible to get any proper support for it!</p>
<p>

<h3> dawg jk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Potential fake account set up in my name&#63;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Last night I received an email to my gmail account from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" asking my to verify my email address to finish the setup of an account. &nbsp;I didn't create an account using my gmail account.
 &nbsp;I've had a Microsoft account for quite awhile, but use Outlook.com email for it. &nbsp;The links in the email do not redirect, but go to legit account.live.com sites. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I did not take any action, because at almost the same time I received another email that my account had been renamed from my gmail.com account name to an "autlook.com" (same user ID on the front end), asking me if that was okay.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">When I go to account.live.com (typing URL on my own, not using links in email), it says that there is no account for "&lt;myusername&gt;@gmail.com" but there IS an account for &lt;myusername&gt;@autlook.com. &nbsp;Which, of course, I can't access.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Any ideas as to what may be going on? &nbsp;Is someone looking to hack into either my gmail or legit outlook.com accounts this way?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Has anyone heard of "autlook.com" or a similar type of scam?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The Zune Playlist file has the 3 letter file extension of ZPL - If you search your computer for *.ZPL you'll find where the Playlists are stored. Ussually stored in ?:\User\Music\Playlist - Open that folder and copy the playlist and rename the 3 letter file&nbsp;extension
 to WPL - This will import the playlist into Windows Media Player - At which point you can open up Windows Media Player and view the Playlist - You can then use Windows Media Player to sync the playlist content to you non-zune MP3 player.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that any items in the playlist are Zune Pass (DRM Protected) content they will not be sync'able and/or playable on the non-zune MP3 player.</p>
<p>This is a technical process and not recommended if you do not know what a 3 letter file extension is.</p>
<p>This also assumes that you can use Windows Media Player to "Sync" your non-zune MP3 player.</p>

<h2>            Can I completely delete Outlook 2010 and start over fresh&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I guess I asked this question in the wrong forum. I'm really frustrated right now because Outlook 2010 won't let me delete an Outlook Data file that it has as the default (can't change it). I've spent HOURS on this and would like to completely uninstall
 Outlook and start over with a fresh, empty version of it. I tried this yesterday and this morning, but it came back with the same accounts in it.</p>
<p>Why is there no simple "Uninstall" option btw? I had a hard time understanding the different options of "install on first use, operate from my computer, and not available" or whatever those choices were. IF I can do this complete uninstall, I'll need clear
 directions.</p>
<p>If I can't do the uninstall, can anyone tell me how in the world I can delete this Outlook data file and set a new default delivery location as the error message tells me I must do?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>ok try these things down the list. read carefully&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>With all these operations I recommend you <strong>
<em>TAKE OUT MEMORY CARD</em></strong> and <em><strong>DO A BACK UP OF YOUR STUFF!!!
</strong></em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>NOTE: In front of the hash key ( #) there is also a STAR key that people often miss and state that the code does not work.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><font color="#800080">1</font>.</span></strong>.<font color="#0000FF"><strong><span>
</span><span>*#7780#</span></strong></font> - <strong>
Restore factory settings</strong> - resets all the settings to the default ( you will not lose any data) Make sure you back up your data as you will lose all of it when you perform option 2 or 3 on this list. The default code for ALL operations listed here
 is <strong><font color="#FF0000">12345</font><font color="#993300">.</font></strong><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><font color="#0000FF"><span><font color="#800080">2</font>.*#7370#
</span></font></strong>-<strong> Reformat </strong>your phone (out of the box, tho keep in mind that most newer nokia phones at least n series, e series and s60 based phones have udp - user data preservation so not ALL data may be lost. still it is a good idea
 to always do a back up of your stuff.)3. This you perform as a last resort. Nothing else is working.If the phone is not showing any activity, proceed with hard formatting , turn off your phone, hold the following buttons while pressing the power button. (the
 default code is <font color="#FF0000"><strong>12345</strong></font>)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span><font color="#800080">3</font></span>. hard reset</strong> - hold the following buttons</span><span><font color="#339966"><strong><span>

</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>3

</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>talk/green</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong> key</strong></span></font>. turn on the phone and do not release those buttons
 until you see the Nokia boot up screen. once you feel the phone power up you can let go off the power button while still holding all three buttons ( for Nokia 5800XM - use the following buttons to do a hard reset, /<span>GREEN/<span><span><font color="#993300">RED</font></span><span>/<font color="#0000FF">CA</font><font color="#0000FF">MERA</font><span>
 keys pressed all at once on power up. this will only work on 5800's that have firmware version 20... and up. ) For Nokia N97 (unofficial version but works) is
</span><font color="#0000FF">SHIFT /SPACE BAR / BACKSPACE</font><span> while holding the power button. Again do not let go until you see the handshake screen.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If these codes are not working the only thing for you to do is contact your Nokia Care Center/Service for assistance.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you, the phone Reformat helped me after the restoring factory settings didn't. I have a Nokia 5800 and my "App. Update" wasn't loading properly and although really hesitant, I went ahead and although it went into "offline mode" its back perfect now,
 even the backup went smoothly. That was the thing I was most nervous about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm really appreciative. Happy New Year :smileyhappy:</p>

            <p>I don't understand steps 3., 4. and 5. of your procedure</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would expect that after copying the table in the WP document to the clipboard, you would go to the desired place in the Word document and then use Paste to paste the table into the Word document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to set the page size in Word to&nbsp;8.5 x 14 if you want to paste in a table that was originally on that size paper and will not fit on 8.5 x 11 (letter size) paper.</p>

                    I have a program that was originally written in Excel 2003.&nbsp; It was then upgraded to Excel 2007and finally to Excel 2010.&nbsp; Each time the program has worked without problems.&nbsp; Tonight, I upgraded to Excel 2013 and I received the error below:<br />

It may be possible to provide a workaround but we would need to see the code involved to be able to advise.&nbsp; You will probably have to step through the code from a point that you know it reaches successfully to find what operation causes the problem.</p>

<p>Such problems should sent to Microsoft Support as they indicate a bug in the product.<br />

            Dear jvjanice,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Remove your account first from Outlook app, uninstall it. Check for OS updates. Clear all cached apps and turn off your phone. Turn it on, connected to WiFi , download Outlook app from the Google store and add account using this guide <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-email-in-the-outlook-for-android-app-886db551-8dfa-4fd5-b835-f8e532091872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up...</a> If you will get the same error, try to connect to mobile data and try to add your account. 
<br />
<br />Also please try to login to your account on the phone browser and check if you are able to access it or not. Also please mention your domain ( domain comes after @, for example @outlook.com)

    <title>How come Instant Messages are sending delayed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How come Instant Messages are sending delayed&#63;</h2>
                    This issue has been ongoing for the past couple weeks now and it is beyond frustrating. My boyfriend and I haven't been getting our Skype Instant Messages. They either come in SUPER delayed (I'm talking hours, sometimes days) or just not at all. I noticed
 there was an issue with this already but it has since been marked as "resolved" since the 2nd of July. It is anything but resolved for us. We've both tried uninstalling and reinstalling. We don't know what to do. Why is this happening and is there anything
 that can be done to fix it? It is going on with ALL of our devices. I have a Mac and iOS, and he has Windows 10.&nbsp;

<h2>            switching accounts in Excel 350 for Business</h2>
                    When I bring up Excel spreadsheets in my desktop computer it is for account 1 and all is well.&nbsp; When I bring it up in my laptop it brings up account 2,&nbsp; which I don't want.&nbsp; I need to get account 1.&nbsp; so I click on "switch accounts"&nbsp; I get this scary message
 that if I remove account 2&nbsp; &nbsp;all sorts of scary things will happen and files will disappear!!&nbsp; I don't want to remove it,&nbsp; I just want to switch it.&nbsp; I actually would not mind removing it but am afraid that if files disappear I may need them in account 1.&nbsp;
 My original files are in One Drive on my desktop and should be accessible from five devises.&nbsp; I know I have accessed this account before on my laptop.&nbsp; I don't know why this is happening.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

<p>OMG Eli,&nbsp; I may have just found the problem.&nbsp; I went to computer B to get the screen shot you asked for,&nbsp; brought up Excel,&nbsp; and this time when I hit "switch accounts" my two accounts came up and I was able to switch to the desired account with no problem.&nbsp;
 The difference is that when I was trying it before,&nbsp; I had my excel account running on computer A at the same time that I tried to get it on computer B!!..&nbsp; This time I did not have Excel up on computer A and all went well on computer B.&nbsp; I guess it is not
 possible to work on Excel from two computers at the same time?&nbsp; Seems strange but I am happy to have my excel on my laptop when I need it.&nbsp; Thank you so much for your patience and time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh,&nbsp; and the account I am using is&nbsp; companyname.onmicrosoft.com</p>
<p>version 1812(build11126.20188 Click-to-run) monthly channel</p>
<p>and yes&nbsp; installed on both computers.&nbsp; I offer this cause I will no doubt have more problems in the future.&nbsp; thanks again</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have another open question in another spot on how to tuck all my 2018 spreadsheets on one drive into a single workbook or folder to make room for 2019.&nbsp; if you have any ideas about that</p>

 be need to be signed up as an Insider.&nbsp; I suggest selecting the Release Preview track in the first instance.&nbsp; Please keep us posted on whether this works out.

<strong>offline.&nbsp;</strong>Turn off your wifi and cellular data, and open upgrade advisor. You can see the enable windows 10 checkbox, tick it, and turn on wifi. Mine worked that way.

    <title>Turn off display of Network Provider on Nokia 5310 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shopkeeper---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn off display of Network Provider on Nokia 5310</h2>
                    
<p>How do I switch off the display of the Network Provider that appears in the top left hand corner of the screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I originally bought the unlocked phone and added a sim card the name did not appear but i'm sure I selected an option in settings somewhere to make it appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently switched sims in my phone from T-Mobile to Asda Mobile as the PAYG service is much cheaper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call me shallow but&nbsp;I don't think having 'Asda Mobile' displayed in the bright white text is particularly cool, especially when you are handing over your phone to a girl to get her number! :)</p>

            Thanks, tried that but it still there and still very uncool :)&nbsp;(I personally think that option is a bit flaky because when I first bought the phone there was no display info for the network provider ,once I put my sim in, no matter whether I selected on
 or off. Weird. Any other suggestion please?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't go to 'Display' straight from 'Menu' or find any 'Standby Mode Setting'?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the Compatibility Checker for Excel 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Info</strong> &gt; <strong>Check for Issues</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/257a1fcb-32ce-4acd-b562-e3c2dd2ff7df" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/257a1fcb-32ce-4acd-b562-e3c2dd2ff7df" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Pick <strong>Check Compatibility</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. To check for compatibility automatically from now on, check the <strong>Check compatibility when saving this workbook</strong> box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: You can also specify the versions of Excel you want to include when you check for compatibility. All versions are checked by default, so just uncheck the version you don't want to include.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Pin Individual Mailboxes to Start Screen</h2>
                    <p>I had an update last night on my Lumia 640XL and my phone just went all weird. &nbsp;I lost some of my mailboxes so I decided to reset my phone and start again. &nbsp;Now I can't seem to pin individual boxes to the start screen. &nbsp;I work for four different people and
 each have their own email address, I don't want them all linked in Outlook but this seems to be the only option it's giving me. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, just realised, my hotmail. inbox isn't updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time there's an update something else goes bits up, it's getting on my nerves. &nbsp;They fix one thing that doesn't need fixing and in the process screw up everything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone any ideas?</p>

            You can pin individual mailboxes to start from within outlook. Go to top left corner then hold on chosen account and a menu will appear with pin to start option. Do this for each account.

            Not sure why that is happening ... I never heard of that.&nbsp; I think I might try is to&nbsp;run Office Diagnostics (Detect &amp; Repair if running Office 2003) to see if there are errors in Outlook.

</p><p>I got this today, stating that it will close down my outlook account, is this legit or is it a scam?
</p>
This is the third email, the phrasing is a bit different every time, so it made me very unsure if it was legit or not?

<p>you don't have to steal it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's free to download on nokia's ovi.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can do it over your phone by launching ovi store. If you don't have ovi store, go to download! and select refresh. it will prompt you to download the store app. then it's just a matter of registering for free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or you can go to <a href="http://www.ovi.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.ovi.com</a> on your PC, look for the app then click it. it will have an option to send or share. sending will send an SMS to your phone with the link. open the link and it will take you to
 your app download.</p>

    <title>Excel Pivot Tables Frequency within Multiple Columns - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jstep6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Pivot Tables Frequency within Multiple Columns</h2>
                    I am new to Pivot Tables and am having some difficulty.&nbsp; I want to use my Pivot Table to count the number of times a given number was observed within the 4 different columns during a given year.&nbsp; In my data, I have a column with the year and 4 different
 columns with numbers that occurred for that year (there is a lot more to it but I will spare this).&nbsp; In my Pivot Table, I already have my columns setup as years and my rows as numbers (i.e. 1-10).&nbsp; I can get it to work with counting the frequency of a number
 in one column but when I try to add more columns, I get the wrong numbers (I checked with countifs).&nbsp; I know how to set up formulas using countifs, but would rather use Pivot Tables for ease of additional sorting by months, weeks, etc. later on.&nbsp; Also, I realize
 that I could rearrange my data to place all numbers in a single column, but it would take too much time.&nbsp; Is this possible and how do I do it?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe you need some settings to do:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select Menu &gt; Settings and Configuration &gt; Preferred access point — View the saved access points and choose the preferred WLAN access point.</p>
<p><br />
Select Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; WLAN &gt; Internet Connection :Ask first<br />
you are asked for the connection method every time you open an application that requires an Internet connection such as Browser or Mail.</p>
<p>Select Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Configuration&nbsp; &gt; Personal settings &gt;</p>
<p>Add &gt; Web &gt; account name "My Web" and use preferred access point "yes"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>that should make those settings as default like all the other phones...<br />
People who are not involve with this forum will not be aware on how to overcome this problem</p>
<p>next FW update should make this settings as the default and I want to request for the phone book, when we type a name, it should search all Initial of first, middle and last name....</p>
<p>not just the last/first name of the contact</p>

<p>Select Menu &gt; Settings and Configuration &gt; Preferred access point — View the saved access points and choose the preferred WLAN access point.﻿</p>
