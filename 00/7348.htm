<p>You might have to go back to an older backup copy. I would also check if the file can be opened on a different machine. Note also that Windows XP is no longer supported and that questions for Windows XP are best posted in a Windows XP forum.<br />

            <p>Dear Fennpeople,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using 'Windows Defender' only, on my laptop for about 2 years now. But still I do not have any kind of virus infections on my PC. I started using it from Windows 8.1 and today, even in Windows 10, it is protecting my computer without me having
 to switch to another spyware/virus protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I think 'Windows Defender' is all you need on your laptop. And since it's Windows 10, you'll be getting different important updates required for making your computer secure, so Windows Defender would be enough to protect your data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
        </p>

<p>Depending on whom you ask or which article you read, you'll get all kinds of different replies.</p>
<p>In the end you have to decide for yourself which Anti-Virus program you want to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 built-in Windows Defender is, IMO, as good as any other anti-virus solution.</p>
<p>But it's always a good idea to run occasional scans with on-demand scanners, see

<p>@Fennpeople: well, I am running my 64-bit 7 without any 3rd-party virus/spyware protection + vmware station (10, 8, 7, xp; OS; Ubuntu), and I did not suffer from any virus/badware problems. And you can, of course, learn how to make the best of some portable
 options like ClamWin Portable, Spybot. For more, you can <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/five-apps/five-portable-antivirus-and-antimalware-tools-to-carry-with-you-at-all-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I think that when a program is installed on a system, the viruses and other malware are specifically looking for a program to attack, they seem to be written so to bypass the Windows Defender&nbsp;,&nbsp; with out any disruptions. If its not there , It cant be found,
 therefore, just by passes in&nbsp;a quiet&nbsp;&nbsp;sort of way. I didn't have attacks when I was just using Windows Defender. Also sometime it acts like bate to a fish.. How ever, I think that there may be some random over looked protection programs,.&nbsp; &nbsp;that may be off
 the normal popular grid.&nbsp; Do your home work on anything that peaks your interest.</p>

            <p>I have been researching this issue as well and haven't found anything definitive. Does Windows provide a formal statement anywhere giving some kind of assurance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it is&nbsp;anecdotal, like the only other useful information I have been able to find, but I will share my experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my research, I haven't found any clear answers, but the vast majority of comments I have seen on the matter consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computers running only Windows Defender have been fine (anecdotally)</li><li>We don't know "for sure" and so it "might not" be good enough</li><li>In spite of warnings that it "might not" be good enough, I haven't really found stories about it "actually" not being good enough - Windows Defender seems to be as good as anything else out there</li></ul>
<p>Finally, this has been my own experience. In my home, we have an HP Envy 27 AIO desktop, a Surface Pro 4, a Surface Pro 3, two Surface 3s, and a Surface Pro 1 all running with only Windows Defender and Firewall. We have not had a single security or virus
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for me, I am comfortable with only Windows Defender.</p>

            <p>Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your statements throughout your post indicating that everything you've found in your research is anecdotal is key, since all such individual experience is inherently anecdotal and so becomes a personal opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The true problem though is that everything about PC security is personal experience and since antimalware is always the protection of last resort, it will always be blamed by the typical uneducated consumer as at fault for the failure to protect, even when
 the key reason for the failure was something else entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I mean here is that the true failure in most cases today isn't the operating system or security software, but rather something else often chosen by the PC owner or user&nbsp;such as:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>installing questionable 3rd-party software including alternative browsers&nbsp;w/inadequate security themselves</li><li>browsing the Internet in either an impaired state or by those like children with minimal comprehension</li><li>downloading files&nbsp;or accepting email attachments&nbsp;from an uncertain, untrusted&nbsp;source</li><li>other more direct social engineering of the PC user by websites or other methods.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.itnews.com.au/news/social-engineering-on-rise-as-vulnerabilities-decline-microsoft-384856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Social engineering on rise as vulnerabilities decline: Microsoft</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, getting the typical PC user to take any personal responsibility for their own mistakes is clearly impossible, so the assumption that the security application must be at fault will continue to be the norm for these uneducated individuals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Microsoft understands these things and also that it's impossible to truly protect the Windows operating system 100% of the time, they instead focus on providing the best security they can to protect their customers, while leaving the ultimate decision
 of which security program they use up to the customer himself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We are fully committed to protecting our consumer and business customers from malware. Our strong solutions provide the comprehensive defense needed against malicious code and attacks. Our support of antimalware partners helps in building a strong and diverse
 ecosystem to fight malware. "</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2013/10/09/our-commitment-to-microsoft-antimalware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Our commitment to Microsoft antimalware</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Even when zero-day malware is found to be attacking Windows directly via vulnerabilities, Microsoft does its best to provide protection using all of its resources until a true patch for the vulnerability can be delivered, as in the case of this currently
 ongoing&nbsp;limited attack which is due to be patched this coming "black" Tuesday Nov. 8th.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So the reason you can't find any simple answers or statements regarding either Windows Defender or the other Microsoft security products is that they don't exist, since if they did they'd clearly be questioned by those in the security community&nbsp;who understand
 these more difficult issues.</p>

            How do you know for a certainty that you don't have a key logger or trojan if all you are depending upon is Defender? According to AV Test and AV Comparatives, it is not enough.

I have completed both steps in full, and these have NOT rectified the problem.&nbsp; Once completed, I restarted my computer and tried to initiate a FULL scan though Windows Defender and, once again, it has been running for over 25 hours and not completed. Are there
 any more suggestions to resolve this issue?

    <title>Address Lists do not reflect the applied filter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopherherdt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Address Lists do not reflect the applied filter</h2>
                    
<p>I created 2 new address lists using the following PowerShell commands:</p>
<p><span>New-AddressList "Contoso"&nbsp;-RecipientFilter { CustomAttribute1 -eq "Contoso" }</span><br />
<span>New-AddressList "Fabrikam"&nbsp;-RecipientFilter { CustomAttribute1 -eq "Fabrikam" }</span></p>
<span>New-AddressList "Fabrikam"&nbsp;-RecipientFilter { CustomAttribute1 -eq "Fabrikam" }</span></p>
<p>When I view the Contoso address list in Outlook, it contains only 5 entries. However, there are 937 recipients that match that filter in my Exchange environment:
</p>
<p><span>Get-Recipient -Filter { CustomAttribute1 -eq 'Contoso' } | Measure</span></p>
<p><span><span>Why are only a small fraction of the matching recipients included in the address list?</span><br />

New-AddressList</a>,&nbsp; "This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange Server 2016."</p>
<p>It does still work with Exchange Online, but as with other cmdlets that are not full-supported by Exchange Online it appears that making a trivial change to the affected mail users or mailboxes will cause Exchange Online to pick up the changes. For example,
 if I set CustomAttribute10 to "test" (an attribute that does not have anything to do with my address list filter) for a user, that user then appears in the address list as expected.</p>

    <title>OneNote UWP - MS cloud only - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dcny666  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote UWP - MS cloud only</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community,<br />
<br />
I would like to hear and discuss about Microsoft‚Äôs plans to replace the current OneNote version with OneNote UWP or OneNote for Windows 10 App.<br />
<br />
We at my company are heavily using OneNote for sharing notes, ideas and knowledge within our company. We are using the possibility to share OneNote notebooks either on a team-share or on the Intranet.<br />
<br />
What I hear so far is that OneNote UWP will only be able to store data (notebooks) in the cloud, meaning the Microsoft cloud OneDrive.<br />
<br />
This is - probably for almost all companies I know - completely unacceptable and thus we start looking for a different product/solution.<br />
<br />
However, it would be acceptable to store the data in some cloud, meaning an on-premise cloud in the company own network, but not on Microsoft servers only. We cannot hand out our knowledge to Microsoft, even if they promise it will be safe on their servers.<br />
<br />
The other irritating thing about this is, that if this is consequent Microsoft strategy, as some of our employees believe, the next step might be that future versions of Word, Excel or PowerPoint also will only allow storage of documents, spreadsheets and presentations
 on Microsoft servers in OneDrive.<br />
<br />
This again might lead to changing strategies within companies to start looking for a complete replacement of the entire Microsoft Office Suite. Ok, I know... this will be difficult, but who knows what will be in 2-4 years...<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
</p>

<p>So after the hard reset, you were able to re-establish a partnership and start the sync.&nbsp; I am assuming all went well except for notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many are there?&nbsp; If there is a huge number, that can cause issues ... at least it has with mine.&nbsp; I had too many and was syncing on multiple computers.&nbsp; Evenntually I took eash note and placed them as a task ...now all is fine.</p>

Is the issue specific to a computer or is the same on all the computers?</span></div>

            <p>Hello Deepa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for helping me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find answers below</p>
<p>===================<br />
1. <span>Does the issue occur only with the PowerPoint or is it the same with other Office applications as well?&nbsp; ==&gt; We have further investigated that, this is&nbsp;happening across all the office apps, not with powerpoint for the machines in which this online
 picture insert option is not working.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. </span>Is the issue specific to a computer or is the same on all the computers?<span><br />
</span>==&gt; This issue is specific to computers, not user. There are some computers in which this is working completely fine, but in some computer this is not working at all, whoever log in to the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. <span>Is the computer connected to domain or network?</span></p>
<p><span>==&gt; Yes, all the systems are in same domain, may be in different location?</span></p>
<p><span>====================</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please let me know if you need any further details. I will be happy to help you out.</span></p>

<h2>            Selecting text turns it white and thus invisible</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running 2016 Word on El Capitan, all the latest update (Word and Apple) applied.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enter an existing or new document and select some text, the selected text turns white with a very light cream highlight...rendering the text invisible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure when this problem started but an MS update to office was applied in the past few days, so may be linked to the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? It's unusable as it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><b>NOTE:<span>&nbsp; </span></b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie ‚Äúsend to Bluetooth‚Äù, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my
 Office trouble shooting process. Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different ‚Äúrandom‚Äù symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It‚Äôs not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b><span>Uninstall Recent Software</span></b>
<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The following Skype links are an example of this issue</p>

<p>Starting in March 2012, "Skype click to Call" has been causing problems File Open problems, and Copy/Paste problems in Office Apps.
</p>
<p>The quick test for this problem is to close all open browsers. If the problem goes away it is probably Skype.</p>
<p>March 30 ‚Äì MS has released an update to Skype that fixes the problem. Go to the Skype site, download and install the newest version of the program.</p>

<b><span>Example of a problem caused by Bluetooth </span>
</b>
&lt;snip&gt;
<p>For anyone reading this, I figured out the problem after surfing the web for the past 3-4 weeks. Painful process. I have a paid version of Advanced SystemCare Pro, v5.2.0. 3-4 weeks ago, while scanning through it's vast offerings, I came across a feature
 I could activate called "Smart RAM". I turned it on and checked the 5 boxes it offers in the settings. The last of those 5 is "Clean Clipboard". I unchecked this box a few minutes ago and it fixed my issues. I now have no problems with copy/paste. Info only,
 it case it helps anyone.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span> </p>
<b><span>Example of a problem caused by Bluetooth </span>
</b>
<p>Alright, well, I found the answer to this final issue: I only needed to disable the Bluetooth add-in on Options. I have no idea why that would have been the problem, but I found it as a suggested fix
<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-microsoft-word-has-stopped-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Now every single thing opens quickly and without error. </p>
<p>Thanks for all your help everyone.</p>
<p>As a recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>My Office 2010 was a Click-to-Run version</li><li>Word suddenly giving me messages about "Downloading the Required Feature," freezing up, slowing down...</li><li>Ultimately had to uninstall Office</li><li>Reinstalled it from the Microsoft website with my product key, choosing the 64-bit version instead of the Click-to-Run version</li><li>Installed all new updates from Windows Updates</li><li>Restarted computer</li><li>Word working quickly with no messages, but became unresponsive when trying to open old files</li><li>Went to File-&gt;Options-&gt;Add-Ins-&gt;Go-&gt; and unchecked Bluetooth.</li><li>Everything seems to be back to normal, if not better than before.</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b><span>Black Blob during Copy / Paste</span></b>
<div>
<p>My problem is if I copy text from a web site or from Excel, Access etc into Word all I get is a black spot.</p>
<p>I have tried a repair install and checking all the settings against my laptop - where this function works properly.
</p>
<p>The problem is caused by a defective Bluetooth add-in for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, turn off the Com Addin.</p>
<p><b><span>Additional Notes:</span></b></p>
<ol>
<li><span>The defective Bluetooth add-in is usually installed by a Bluetooth driver. (In my case - Intel Centrino Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 + High Speed Adaptor (v1.1))</span></li><li><span>Updating your Bluetooth driver (or reverting to an older version) may also resolve the problem.</span></li><li><span>Unfortunately simply disabling the add-in through the Word options may result in a 3 second freeze when loading Word 2007. (If this is a problem, changing to a different bluetooth driver version may be the better option)</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b><span>Additional tip - Remove Older Printer Drivers</span></b>
<p>Oddly enough, this ended up being the cause of my problem. I had an older print driver installed on my Windows 7 machine and once I removed that driver, Word started working without any problems!</p>
<p>You can delete individual printer drivers by going into the registry. Note that simply going to Printers and Faxes and deleting a printer there does not delete the printer driver.</p>
<p>Follow <strong><span>Step 3</span></strong> in my previous post about a printer error to remove the printer drivers:</p>

<h2>            Loosing built-in camera during a video call</h2>
                    I am loosing my in-build camera during a <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">video</span> Skype chat on my MAC, even though it is in settings setup for Skype. What could that be? The camera is on, at the start, then after awhile, I loose it, then I click on the
 Camera symbol and it comes back, that happens many times and it is annoying. This started when I updated to the new version of Skype.

            No, to the best of my knowledge, you can't change the print order. Sorry.  The print options are limited, especially in outlook.com. Outlook on the desktop has slightly better options, but it still wont print in the desired order.

            While I think that it is a nice looking feature I can understand that a non-transparent window bar does not conform with the current design standard using the window space that used to be transparent for additional buttons&nbsp;and I'm already content with
 the fact that the taskbar is still transparent.

            <p>I would like to see Aero back also.</p>
<p>One of my first impression about Windows 8 was that the flat and two-dimensional design is not very nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my many reasons to stay on Windows 7 is the flat design.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is one of the reasons I never liked windows 8. Windows 7 looks so much more modern and nice.</p>
<p>So please brind this option back, don't force it but only give us a option to use the windows 7 look, just as you can use the classic (windows 9x) look in W7.<br />

The ability to choose would be welcomed, however.

Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We're glad to help you! <br />
<br />
I understand that you are having multiple issues in your Lumia 535 after upgrade to Windows 10. Have you tried to perform a soft reset? If not please do so.
<br />
<br />
<span>You can perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then, press and hold the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and<span><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;

 restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing soft reset please try to check if issues persist. If soft reset will not fix the issue we suggest
 you to perform hard reset. </span>You can reset your phone under Settings: <strong>
Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; about &gt; reset your phone</strong>. Make sure to back up all of your important files before
 performing soft reset.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if this helps. Thanks!

                    After reading all the posts concerning bluetooth connectivity I still cant get my Nokia N73 to work with my Laptop. My laptop model is Sony VAIO VGN-C2Z/B, Operating system is Windows Vista home premium, Version of PC Suite is 6.83.14.1, and my bluetooth
 stack is Bluetooth stack for windows version 1.01.00, Bluetooth specification 2.0, 1.2, 1.1 which came pre-installed.<br />
Can anybody help me or am I doomed to using the cable to connect(when it works!!!)<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

            Ok then in that case I can only assume that The Nokia N73 and Nokia PC suite are not compatible with Microsoft Vista! Time to change my phone to a company that has working software.<br />
Thank you

    <title>Outlook Password Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angrydf2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Password Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Outlook was working fine for me on my computer (PC, Windows 10, Office 2016 version 1904), but then after an unexpected, unwelcome, and automatic upgrade:</p>
<p>1. All the icons look different and the non-Outlook software works just fine.<br />
2. If I try to access Outlook via Yahoo (Verizon Yahoo!) I have no trouble, i.e. it takes my password just fine.</p>
<p>3. I can't get into Outlook on my PC <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">locally</span>. It keeps asking for my password, and whether I enter the (previous?) password sitting entered in the field for me, or my online Verizon Yahoo password, or if I just
 press "Cancel" the program waits a long time and eventually repeats the password request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find any help at live.com, outlook.com, office.com, or other microsoft.com pages. I was allowed to create more accounts, set up more passwords, read more access legalize, and spread my personal information more widely in the process, so it wasn't
 a total loss. The automatic help tool assumed I had Outlook or Office 365 and provided a lot of help for that; perhaps some day I'll own that software and the information will come in handy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's some way I could reverse the update and go back to the old software I could log into without incident, I would love to do that. But it sounds like a big ask.</p>

            1. They are rolling out new icons for the suite. 
<br />
<br />3. Do you use 2-factor or security key feature at yahoo? If so you need to use an app password.

<p>I think what Mauro is telling you is; No, there is no way to change Excel's default margins, but you can set custom margins and record your actions in a macro.</p>
<p>In Mauro's post, where he states "set wide margins" you need to go to File -&gt; Print and set custom margins for the "Wide" macro to whatever settings you like. Do the same for Narrow and Normal. You will then end up with 3 macros that you can call from 3
 buttons on your QAT.</p>
<p>Perhaps not quite what you wanted, but probably best we can do.</p>

<p><br />
Maybe I have not explained well:</p>
<p>Tab: View <br />
Macros--&gt;Record Macro... <br />
Macro name: Wide <br />
Store macro in: Personal Macro Workbook <br />
Ok <br />
Set wide margins</p>
<p><br />
Set wide margin, that means:</p>
<p>Tab: Page Layout <br />
Button: Margins <br />
Select: Custom Margins... <br />
Set wide margins <br />
Ok</p>
<p><br />
Then:</p>
<p>Tab: View <br />
Macros--&gt;Stop Record <br />
Macros--&gt;Record Macro... <br />
Macro name: Narrow<br />
Repeat for Narrow and Normal.</p>

            <p>What she wants is that every time you hit "New"&nbsp; the page will automatically come up with the margins the way&nbsp;you want them.&nbsp; For instance I never want header, I want my side margins to be .75 not .7, who decided to do that????&nbsp; I want my footer to be set
 to .5, who made it .3????&nbsp; That's stupid.&nbsp; We could do this in XP.&nbsp; Are you saying with all the advances in 2010,&nbsp; you can't change the margin defaults?????&nbsp; What are we paying for?

            <p>I have not found a way to adjust the predefined margins "Wide", "Narrow" and "Normal".</p>
<p>But if you open a blank workbook, change the margins to your preferred margins and safe in as "book.xlt" it in the "XLSTART" normally found in:</p>
<p>C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Microsoft\Excel\</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART</p>
<p>(if you copy and paste this path, it even work in for example German operating systems even so it will display the "German" path. Don't forget to change the username to YOUR Username)</p>
<p>It seems to take these margins for some new workbooks depending which way you go about of starting a new workbook.</p>
<p>I heard if you do the same and safe the workbook in the same folder under the new "sheet.xlt" it will apply these margins if you create a new sheet in a exiting workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have to agree. It is totally stupid that I cannot adjust these setting.</p>
<p>And Microsoft take note: Most of the world is using Metric system not Imperial. Even the US has a plan to change to metric. And yet:
</p>
<p>Microsoft uses Imperial (Inch) margins and recalculates them to centimeters! How stupid are "standard" margins like: 2.54cm, 1.91cm, 1.78cm, 0.76cm, 0.64cm, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not 1 round figure in sight!!!</p>

            If you want to change your personal default page margins, you can do so by following these steps:
<ol>
<li>Open a new blank Excel workbook.</li><li>Change the page margins for all the worksheets in the workbook. Make sure they reflect the page margins you want used as your default.&nbsp;
<br />
<em>NOTE: This does not change the Excel's default Normal. Wide or Narrow margins, just your default.&nbsp;</em></li><li>Make any other desired "default" changes in the workbook. This may include (but not be limited to) headers, footers, center horizontally or vertically, etc.</li><li>Choose <em>Save As </em>from the File menu. Excel displays the Save As dialog box.</li><li>In the Save As Type pull-down list at the bottom of the dialog box, select Excel Template (.xltx) or Excel Macro-Enabled Template (.xltm)
<br />
<em>NOTE: The option you select depends on whether you have macros in the workbook or not.</em></li><li>The file name you use should be <strong>Book.xltx</strong> or <strong>Book.xltm</strong> (depending, again, on whether it contains macros).</li><li>Save your newly created template in the <strong>XLStart </strong>folder. (Do not save it in the default template folder.)</li><li>Close Excel.</li></ol>
<p>Now when you open Excel, each worksheet you changed should have your personal default margins because Excel uses your template (Book.xltx or Book.xltm) as its model for new files.</p>
