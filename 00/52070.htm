<p>Maybe.&nbsp; I would use ProcMon to find out what the current implementation is.&nbsp; E.g. if there is an explicit Command line being used to do whatever it is that you are seeing, you&nbsp;might be able to just copy that and use it in a keyboard shortcut.&nbsp; Otherwise,
 does your keyboard have any kind of macro support?&nbsp; Then perhaps you could at least map one key to a multi-step procedure.</p>

            Option A:<br />
1.) Reboot the Operating System<br />
2.) Install the program<br />
<br />
Option B:<br />
1.) Open the Task Manager<br />
2.) Click on the Processes Tab to view a list of processes<br />
3.) Click on the Image Name and sort the processes by Name<br />
4.) Find the "msiexec.exe" process from the list of processes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is more than one "msiexec.exe" process from the list of processes, it means that you encountered a dead lock condition which causes the code 1500.<br />
5.) Right click the "msiexec.exe" process to open a context menu<br />
6.) Click on End Process Tree to kill any processes which links to the "msiexec.exe" process and including the "msiexec.exe" process itself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If these is more than one "msiexec.exe" process from the list of processes, repeat the step 5 and 6 to kill all the "msiexec.exe" processes.<br />
<br />
7.) Try to install the program again.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />

    <title>Tablet pen for Asus transformer tp550 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ulthwe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tablet pen for Asus transformer tp550</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>recently I bought a new Laptop/Tablet (Asus transformer tp550). Now would like to use a tablet pen. I want to write notes into PDFs and Powerpoint-presentations (its for studies). But I don't like to use the standard pens with the thick tip.</p>
<p>I would like to use a pen like the "Wacom Intuos Creative Stylus2" or something like this one. Is this even possible and do I need extra software to use the pen like I want? And if not, which pens can I use with my tablet?</p>
<p>There are just very little information provided by the sellers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<h2>            Nintendo&#58; Microsoft, Sony must react to us.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm posting this here because this is the most populated area:<br />
<br />
Sounds like Nintendo is nervous to me. Either that or really confident. What do you think?<a href="http://uk.gamespot.com/news/nintendo-microsoft-sony-must-react-to-us-6400594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Here is the article</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here is a bit of what they say:<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime is not fearful that the Wii U will become irrelevant if Microsoft and Sony launch new consoles next year as is&nbsp;<a href="http://uk.gamespot.com/news/next-xbox-playstation-4-due-in-2013-analysts-6380978" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">suspected</span></a>.
 In fact, the executive said he believes Nintendo has set the innovation bar with its Wii U, and Microsoft and Sony cannot rely solely on more advanced technology if they wish to succeed.<br />
<br />
"In the end, our competitors need to react to what we're doing in the marketplace and need to figure out what their innovation will be," Fils-Aime told GameSpot sister site<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10797_3-57554148-235/nintendos-fils-aime-microsoft-sony-need-to-react-to-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">CNET</span></a>.
 "It's likely that faster processors and pretty pictures won't be enough to motivate consumers. They need to react to what we've done and we need to continue innovating with the Wii U and we will."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I think that a"faster processors and pretty pictures" will be enough to motivate customers so I say he's nuts.</span></span></p>

<p>I don't know why they would be nervous; Nintendo consoles and games will sell no matter what, right? Either way, boastful or not, they shouldn't be talking like that. It sounds arrogant and suggesting Sony isn't doing anything in it's current state just
 makes me laugh. And Microsoft has Xbox Live: that has a huge demographic. </p>

<p>I used to love Reggie. But its the fact that he groups me and others as just "consumers" is one of the reasons I pretty much put down the Wii, only picking it up for one or two exclusives a year. Not out of principal, but because their game console reflects
 that. I may be a consumer, but I'm a gamer first. And I'm sure Reggie and Nintendo care about customer service, but they are servicing everyone, catering to everyone.--Putting real gamers behind everyone else.</p>

<p>The only Nintendo product I own is the 3DS XL. I play it quite often, but it'll probably be the last Nintendo product I purchase. I've never been interested in the Wii and I'm not interested in the Wii U either. Nintendo should be worried if both Microsoft
 and Sony release a new console next year. They'll see their sales go down like they always do.

<p>All I will say is that my Wii U is the only thing I've touched since I got it. &nbsp;Miiverse is outstanding and much better than I expected. &nbsp;I actually put about 30 hours into it last week. &nbsp;I look for the other guys to copy it. &nbsp;I also have had more fun with
 ZombiU and New SMB U then any other games released this year. &nbsp;This is just Reggie being Reggie, doing PR for attention. &nbsp;</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I also don't believe the PS4 or next Xbox will be vastly more powerful than the Wii U. &nbsp;Just viewing this realistically. &nbsp;Nintendo set the price for the next gen consoles at $300 to $350. &nbsp;Both Xbox and Sony will need to be around that to keep up in sales
 or else the Wii's success will repeat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is there really a lot of heat on the Wii U? I don't know anyone that's talking about it...I saw no Black Friday deals for it. I don't even see any gaming media heat on it...I see that big dumb screen controller thing and I wonder how I'm even supposed to
 use the damn thing...It's like using a tablet and the TV at the same time...looks too complicated (which is the opposite of what the Wii was)...</p>

<p>[quote user="isturbo1984"]-Putting real gamers behind everyone else.[/quote] Really? How so? In fact, I can name several games on the Wii I still haven't played that I really should. Tell me: have you played Zack and Wiki?
<br />
-<br />
And man, look how wonderful the DS is. Shame on Nintendo for having such a wonderful handheld system that caters to an huge audience with such variety. I still have a backlog of RPG's for that thing and it's going to get bigger when I pick up Okamiden, The
 world Ends With You, and Radiant Historia later this year. <br />
<br />
And Retro Studios! Metroid Prime Trilogy, anyone? How about Donkey Kong County Returns??? I can't wait to see what these guys do next!
<br />
<br />
Oh look, Bayonetta 2 is a Wii U exclusive. <br />
<br />
Also, so much irony in your post. You complain how Nintendo is "catering to everyone" and only views you as a "consumer" when this is EXACTLY what Activision does with Call of Duty.</p>

<p>As for Reggie, just one look at the guy will tell you all you need to know. He's a weird blow hard who sold his soul to Nintendo. He cannot be taken seriously about their products.</p>

<h3> chetgallaway  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I specify which folders that I want Windows Live Mail to check for new messages on&#62;</h2>
                    I have a few Hotmail and work accounts plugged into my Windows Live Mail 2011 and the checking for new email process seems ridiculously slow because it appears to be checking every single folder for new messages. I remember selecting/de-selecting which
 folders to download in the past but I can't find it anywhere now. I only want to download new messages from select folders and not every single folder which takes forever. How do I do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Managing your folders in Windows Live Mail makes your email messages became more optimized, if you want to create or apply message rules you&nbsp;here are the&nbsp;steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Windows Live Mail</strong>, click the <strong>Folders</strong> tab.</li><li>Click <strong>Message rules</strong>, and select <strong>News rules</strong> tab.</li><li>In here, you can manage and select conditions on where you want to put incoming messages.</li></ol>
<p>You can almost set any conditions for your emails using this feature. This also includes redirecting any incoming emails to your designated folder.</p>

            <p>Hi, first let me say thank you for trying to help, but it's not quite what I'm asking about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to control is which folders are checked for new messages when Windows Live Mail retrieves messages. I have many folders, so I don't want every single one getting checked for new messages...because it takes forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Know what I mean?<br />

</p><blockquote>I only want to download new messages from select folders and not every single folder ...

<p>Here are some suggestions to help you decide how best to proceed:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Properties</em>. On the IMAP tab, deselect
<em>Check for new messages in all folders</em> to download from the inbox alone.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Show or hide folders
</em>to open the <em>Show/Hide IMAP Folders</em> dialogue. Here you can specify which folders to see in the folder pane. Hidden folders won't synchronize.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Right-click on an IMAP folder in the folder pane and select <em>Synchronization settings</em>. Here you can elect not to synchronize the folder.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may find that these options don't work exactly as advertised, but they should give you some ideas. And, of course, none of them are set in stone. For example, I select and deselect option 1 every week or so to update less-used folders on some of my accounts.</p>

<h2>            Xbox controller charging from PC but bluetooth connected to Xbox&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm attempting to build a clean setup. I'm trying to design a really nice USB tower with clips to hold my controllers on the side while charging. What I want to know is can I have the USB hub plugged into my PC (thus creating a data connection) in order to charge the controller, while at the same time still be playing on xbox with bluetooth? Could I switch off the automatic data connection via cable from the PC? Could I reconnect the bluetooth after plugging in the cable? Is there any way this could work?</p><p>This way can always charge with the same method, ie the USB tower, but I can still choose whether the controller is connected via bluetooth&nbsp;to the PC or xbox. I currently have the Xbox One, which requires the dongle which I have to connect to PC, but I do plan on getting the Xbox One X when that comes out to reduce compatibility issues with this.</p>

<h2>            No Sound From Speakers - Only Headphones Windows 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    <p>I know there are similar posts, but no real solutions.&nbsp; This has to be a Windows 7 problem, as here are all of the "fixes" I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Uninstall/Reinstall sound drivers, latest drivers installed</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Speakers Replaced, New Cables</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Tried On-Board sound controller AND new PCIe sound card</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be an intermittent problem, as I occassionally get sound from the speakers, but when I reboot, the sound is gone.&nbsp; The Control Panel/Sound/Playback/Speakers show Speakers as the default device and I see the green bars moving.&nbsp; However, no sound
 coming from the speakers.&nbsp; I can plug into the headphone jack, and I can hear sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not seem to be a hardware issue as I have replaced all the hardware items, except the motherboard itself.&nbsp; The sound had worked fine for several years using the on-board sound controller.&nbsp; All of a sudden one day, the sound was jumping between Speakers
 and an HD Audio device.&nbsp; I uninstalled and reinstalled the sound drivers and this stopped the jumping, but then I got no sound from the speakers, only headphones.&nbsp; I tried new speakers, same problem.&nbsp; I disabled the on-board sound controller and installed
 a new sound card and new updated drivers.&nbsp; Same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've posted on the motherboard (Asus) forum, and they have no solution.&nbsp; Again, most of the hardware was replaced, so I suspect it is some kind of Windows 7 protocol error between the headphone jack and speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise me on what is going on and any kind of solution?</p>

            Have you tested the speakers in something other than&nbsp; your computer? Like an iPod or other mp3 player? It could very possibly be a short in the speaker wires.<br />

            <p>Yes, speakers and new cables work fine on my other PC.&nbsp; I do not think it is hardware related as all the sound components are new or replaced.&nbsp; Sound drivers are the latest and from the manufacturer, Asus.&nbsp; Tried on-board sound controller (Realtek) and new
 sound card (Asus Xonar).&nbsp; Same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No sound from speakers, only from headphone jacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen on other forums, including this one, that others seem to have a similar problem.&nbsp; It is intermittent, but mostly non-functioning.&nbsp; It seems to happen on different platforms - laptops and PCs from different manufacturers, such as Dell, HP, and
 happens all of a sudden after functioning properly for several years.&nbsp; There seems to be a common thread in Windows 7.&nbsp; I have done all the recommended "fixes" for hardware and drivers.&nbsp; Sometimes it seems like it is fixed, only to reboot and have the problem
 occur again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a built PC with a Asus Rampage Formula motherboard, using Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I think there is some problem with the headphone/speaker sensing protocol in Windows 7.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try setting up the speakers as the default audio output device and see if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Open the "<strong>Start</strong>" tab on the bottom of your screen and select "<strong>Control Panel</strong>."</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>b) Click on "<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>." You will then see the "<strong>Sound</strong>" tab. Underneath it, click on the option to "<strong>Manage Audio Devices</strong>" to be taken to the screen where you can change the audio device's settings.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>c) Click on the audio device that you would like to use. Now you have the ability to configure your device and set it to be used as default.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>d) Click "<strong>Set Default</strong>" to give the new audio device dominance over the computer's internal audio card.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be an hardware issue as the sound is coming from the speakers. Sometimes Jack doesn't support all speakers. I would Suggest you&nbsp;to contact the local tech shop and have a check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>facing similar problems on my DELL desktop.</p>
<p>Since I switched to Windows 10 my network connection (wired) regularly stops working.</p>
<p>Sometimes as frequent as every 15 minutes!</p>
<p>Often it works to "switch off" and reactivate&nbsp;the LAN adapter in the network center to re-establish the connection to the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the troubleshooter, but it's not able to find something that's wrong.</p>
<p>When I check for an updated driver, it tells me I have the most recent driver available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, what now? </p>
<p>Back to Windows 7?</p>
<p>(and hope things were not messed up by the Win10 switch?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Thomas</p>

            I am having the same problem with wireless.&nbsp; I've run the troubleshooter at least three times and it always says to check with the community.&nbsp; The easy way for me to reconnect is to go to the bottom right and click on notifications.&nbsp; That brings up a bunch
 of little squares and I click on the network one.&nbsp; It will show connected/no internet. I disconnect and then reconnect and it starts working again.&nbsp; The connect automatically box is checked.&nbsp; I'm sure glad I only upgraded one of my 3 computers.&nbsp; The others
 are going to stay on 7 until MS gets 10 figured out.&nbsp; I'm telling my friends not to upgrade.&nbsp; Those that have wish they hadn't.&nbsp; I don't think businesses will go to 10 as buggy as it is.&nbsp; MS will have to do something.&nbsp; Maybe go to 12 and skip 11 :-).<br />

    <title>Xbox Live Gold Membership not working with other accounts on same - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Live Gold Membership not working with other accounts on same machine</h2>
                    
<p>I just purchased and entered the code for a 12 month Xbox Live Gold membership on my Xbox One. &nbsp;It is supposed to let the other users on my machine (my kids) access the Xbox Live features. &nbsp;So far we have been unable to get them access to the Live features
 on games such as Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help us out?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Randy</p>

<p>Como o hd externo n e da microsoft, ele vai ler somente 32gb, seja qualquer hd externo, o de 250 é próprio para o xbox e funcionará normalmente. Tem como sim você usar os 500gb no xbox sim, so que você terá que fazer uns paranauê no pc e ficar criando pasta
 para instalar o jogo, procura ai que você vai ver.. </p>

            Did you even read the question? I have the 64 bit pro version installed, with 32 gbs of ddr 3 1866 which is what the motherboard supports. The OS says that I have 24 installed and only 19 is useable. If I were running the 32 bit why would I post the question?
 I also have 3 gbs ddr5 vram with and AMD 8350 8 core. It is looking very much like windows 10 is for portable devices. Not desktop working computers. I've had over 1000 error reports in 5 days. This is pretty sad for a roll out.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See these specialized steps for fixing Windows Hello on Surface:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023510/surface-troubleshoot-problems-with-windows-hello-on-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402351...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try these troubleshooting steps:  
<br />
<br />1) Turn off Fast Startup:  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />2) Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />  Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign In Options
<br />    Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />    After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />    Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />3)  Modify Group Policy Settings  (for Pro version only)
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />    Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />    Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />    Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />    Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />    Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />    Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />4) Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />    Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />    Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />    Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />    Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />    Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />    The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.
<br />
<br />5) Run Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />6) If nothing else helps then run a Fresh Start:  <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>windows search indexing &#38; cloned hdds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frankgr77  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows search indexing &#38; cloned hdds</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>I have two hdds syncronized.<br />
<br />
the last month one died, so i simply put in another one and cloned the working one.<br />
<br />
here is where the problem begins.<br />
<br />
i usually dont index both hdds, because they have identical content and they are slightly different models so i prefer indexing the newer faster model.<br />
<br />
well in the search index options if i choose the faster (newer), windows selects the slower one (older).<br />
<br />
i already know the reason.<br />
<br />
here you can read from another source:<br />
<br />
https://superuser.com/questions/1053452/why-does-windows-search-indexing-options-select-the-wrong-drive-if-its-cloned#<br />
<br />
<br />
so the origin of the problem is the IndexerVolumeGuid. Is it possible to change it&nbsp; without losing the data?<br />
<br />
<br />
thx<br />
<br />
<br />
bye.</p>

<p>Hi FrankGr77,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you plan to change the IndexerVolumeGuid? If you delete this file and then mount the volume again, a new one will be generated, a unique GUID, which should resolve the issue. However, just to be safe, it is recommended that you backup your data to
 prevent data loss.</p>
<p>

            Since the Recycle Bin automatically deletes the oldest files when it reaches the maximum size set by you, there is no point in emptying it manually.
<div><br />
<div>Here is how you can restore the missing documents:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Open Windows Explorer.</li><li>Navigate to the folder in which the deleted files used to reside. Do not open it.</li><li>Right-click this folder, then left-click "Restore previous versions".</li></ol>
<div>This action will restore the whole folder to the selected date.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This minor disaster would be a good opportunity to review your backup philosophy so that you could survive a major disaster (e.g. a disk crash) with a minimum of pain.</div>

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As stated on our FAQ, "If you want to report feedback on a specific bot, contact the bot developer directly. You'll find the name of the developer in the 'created by' section of the bot's profile."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In this case, I suggest you to delete the entire bot and re-add it and let's see if that'll help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for the response, I don't think it has anything to do with the Bot. It is working fine on the Desktop App. The issue is only with the Windows Store App.&nbsp; I tried all options like removing the Bot and adding back in etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is working fine with Desktop App. With Windows 10 App also it was working, I once did a Block and unBlock, after that it is not working on the Windows Store App. I think, though I unblocked the contact, Windows Store App(skype)
 is still thinking that it is Blocked, I guess.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bot is working fine with all other users and also to me until I did a Block and un-Block.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know.</p>
<p><br />
Cheers,<br />
krish</p>

<p>Thank you much for the suggestion, I tried this before and tried it again today. There is no change in the behaviour. I have 12.9.604.0 version of Skype App. By the way I also spent time in posting it into the Bot Group and they said they were going to contact
 the Skype group.&nbsp; Actually like ping-pong :-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder how the "state" could be different for different facets of the Application - like it works in Skype Web, Skype Desktop and not work on Skype Windows 10 App (across devices) - shouldn't all read the "state" from a central (and/or replicated) location
 ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty surprising.</p>

            I tried with different networks and the behaviour is same. I tried the Bot on Skype over Mac and it is working fine. ONLY on Windows 10 Store App version of Skype is not allowing me to Message, unfortunately that is what I use more. All my windows 10 updates
 are latest and updated. What to do now ?

<h2>            Strange file being downloaded on Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    All day I've been getting a bottom of the Edge browser popup that says "The publisher of skeleton.js couldn't be verified." This file, 'skeleton.js,' keeps being downloaded to my computer. Anybody know what's going on?
