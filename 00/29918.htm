<p>That's really a question you need to ask the Cannon company about instead.&nbsp; Their program might not even have that ability to save it as a PDF, but you'd need to check the owner's manual of your Cannon scanner (or call the Cannon support line) to find out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option is to save it in a format the scanner has the ability to save as, then convert it to a PDF.&nbsp; One way to do that would be to put the picture into Word, then choose file &gt; export.<br />

            When you scan something, it will ask you what form you want it to create it in and where to store it.

<h2>            Google Chrome , BSOD and Windows 10</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 and use Chrome for my browser. Every time I open Chrome, for the first time of the day, Windows 10 would give me the BSOD, restart and then work fine. I turned off the Chrome extensions Google Docs, Sheets and Slides and things seem to
 running normally now. No more BSOD. Is there anything else I should fix if I want to use Chrome with Win 10?

            <p>&nbsp;The SFC scan was the first thing I tried but it was unsuccessful. It just caused more problems. "Windows could not perform the operation" it said. Getting rid of the extension in Chrome that I don't use did the trick. I'm tempted to run the SFC scan again,
 but based on its performance history I'm thinking no. Do you think it is worth A try?</p>

<p>I tried running the SFC/scannow and got the same result as before. "...could not perform the requested operation.</p>
<p>Immediately after running, the BSOD has now returned "critical-process-died". Computer before scan=fine.</p>
<p>Computer after scan=broke. I've already spent several hours with MS techs to fix this. I've had enough; its going to the computer shop. Thanks for your help but its a bad sign when the MS tools are broken to start to fix a new broken OS.</p>

<h2>            Windows created a temporary paging file - pop up whenever i restart my computer</h2>
                    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>READ THE FIRST RESPONSE FOR THE SOLUTION THAT WORKED FOR ME! THANK YOU FOR READING! GOOD LUCK!</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>[System Properties] Windows created a temporary paging file.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>Now let me just start by saying that I consider myself a somewhat advanced pc user, I know a lot about computers. Last night, I spent a good 3-4 hours trying to solve this issue and I couldn't figure it out</em></strong>. I spent so much time
 browsing through forums and trying to fix this problem, but I just gave up and decided that I would try today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the idea of virtual memory, and why the pop up is, well, popping up, to a certain extent. - However, that is not why I'm here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I have tried so far - keep in mind that none of it has worked:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Regedit string below located @</span></strong> - 'Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regedit: Editing the PagingFiles value\string - the 2 values after 'c:\pagefile.sys' are 0 0&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried giving myself access to hidden windows files and I have tried deleteing the pagefile.sys, located in Local Disk (C:)</p>
<p>I have tried every combination of&nbsp;Control Panel\System and Security\System\Advanced system settings\</p>
<p>[performance]settings\Advanced\Change. From custom size to system managed size to no paging file, nothing fixes this issue I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried editing the Regedit value\string so it was 'c:\pagefile2.sys', so it wouldn't overwrite the pagefile.sys file, it would just make a second pagefile - pagefile2.sys in the Local Disk (C:) &nbsp;root folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried completely deleting the pagesile.sys in my (C:) root folder. Another way to get around it not overwriting the existing pagefile.sys whenever I try to set a Custom Memory Size, or whenever I choose System Managed, or even No Page File.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>An important note here is that I have tried this Admin Rights Command Prompt line:&nbsp;sc config afs start= disabled&nbsp;</strong>and I got this error code: [SC] OpenService FAILED 1060: The specified service does not exist as an installed service. This
 has worked for most people, but not for me, unfortunately. I have also tried specific workarounds to my issue that relates to this command prompt line failing, still no fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is, no matter what i try and do, whenever I restart my computer, the System Properties windows always pops up telling me that windows has created a temporary paging file. No matter what I do, this popup keeps showing up whenever I restart my computer,
 and when I look at the size of the 'Total paging file size for all drivers', it is always '0'</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Another important note is that I have a hunch that it could be because I right clicked Local Disk (C:)\properties and under Security I deleted every other user\group besides my own user (Users *********-PC\Users)&nbsp;</strong>Because of a different issue
 that I was having. Could this be causing my problem?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for helping, I appreciate any help that I can get! I just stumped and it's really frustrating and annoying, I spent so much time on it last night and I just couldn't get it..&nbsp;<strong>THANKS IN ADVANCE!</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Please ask questions,
 I will try my best to help you to help me haha</strong></p>
<p>

            <p>BOIZ N GRYLLS I FIXED IT HOLY S**T!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>No joke, literally the last time I turned off my pc before i went to work, whatever I did during that instance, fixed it.. O_O</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alright, so, I honestly feel really bad to whoever has this same issue - HERE'S WHAT FIXED IT FOR ME!:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So you basically have to force Windows to delete and make a fresh copy of the 'pagefile.sys'.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please note that this is what I followed for the most part:</strong>&nbsp;http://jackstromberg.com/2014/01/windows-7-windows-created-a-temporary-paging-file-on-your-computer-because-of-a-problem-that-occured-with-your-paging-file-configuration-when-you-started-your-computer/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please not that following that guide 100% to the end did not help ME, but it may help you. My solution followed that guide all the way till then, but I had to do a different thing, I'll go into that later.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, right-click&nbsp;<strong>Computer</strong>, and select&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong></li><li>
In the left pane, select&nbsp;<strong>Advanced system settings</strong></li><li>
On the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;tab, click the&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;button under&nbsp;<strong>Performance</strong></li><li>
On the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;tab, click the&nbsp;<strong>Change</strong>&nbsp;button under&nbsp;<strong>Virtual
 memory</strong></li><li>
Clear the&nbsp;<strong>Automatically manage paging file size for all drives</strong>&nbsp;check box and check&nbsp;<strong>No paging file</strong></li><li>
Click&nbsp;<strong>Set</strong>&nbsp;button next to&nbsp;<strong>No paging file</strong></li><li>
<strong>Click</strong>&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;on all open windows and&nbsp;<strong>restart</strong>&nbsp;your machine</li><li>
Open up&nbsp;<strong>Windows Explorer</strong></li><li>
Navigate to the root of your system drive (<strong>C:\</strong>)</li><li>
Enable the showing of System Files
<ol>
<li>
On the&nbsp;<strong>View</strong>&nbsp;menu, click&nbsp;<strong>Options</strong></li><li>
On the&nbsp;<strong>View</strong>&nbsp;tab, click<strong>&nbsp;Show All Files</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong></li></ol>
</li><li>
Delete the&nbsp;<strong>pagefile.sys</strong>&nbsp;file</li><li>
Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, right-click&nbsp;<strong>Computer</strong>, and select&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong></li><li>
In the left pane, select&nbsp;<strong>Advanced system settings</strong></li><li>
On the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;tab, click the&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;button under&nbsp;<strong>Performance</strong></li><li>
On the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;tab, click the&nbsp;<strong>Change</strong>&nbsp;button under&nbsp;<strong>Virtual
 memory</strong></li><li>
Check the&nbsp;<strong>Automatically manage paging file size for all drives</strong>&nbsp;checkbox and click OK</li><li>
Restart your machine</li></ol>
<p><strong>DO EVERYTHING UP TO STEP '11' - This i where MY fix for this issue worked, for ME. it will probably work for you too though lol.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>After step 11</strong>, hit the Windows Key + R and type in 'Regedit' - This will bring you the the Registry Editor.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>GO TO</strong>&nbsp;- 'Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management'<strong>. DELETE EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT PANEL! Note that you
 cannot delete '(Default)', or at least I couldn't, so just hit OK or whatever when it says that you can't delete it.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Now continue with the rest of the guide above</strong>, except instead of leaving the 'No paging file' box check, click on custom paging file size instead. For me, I did 1000 for min and 2000 for max. This is what worked for me. I don't want to fiddle
 around with these numbers because they worked for me and I don't want to risk having to do this over kek.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After clicking on Custom Paging File Size or whatever and you put in the numbers,&nbsp;<strong>MAKE SURE TO CLICK SET</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>AND BE SURE TO CHECK THE 'AUTOMATICALLY MANAGE PAGING FILE SIZE FOR ALL DRIVERS' CHECKBOX - which is located at the top of
 the window.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Hit 'OK' for every window, and apply for every window too (I think it only gives you to option to 'apply' in one windows, can't remember as of now)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Now at this point you should be able to observe that there is no pagefile.sys in your Local Disk (C:) drive root folder. At this point there should also only be 'Default' left in the the right panel of the Regedit window in '\Memory Management'.
 RESTART YOUR PC NOW AND PRAISE TO GABEN WHILE YOU CROSS YOUR FINGERS AND HOPE THAT WHEN YOUR PC BOOTS UP AND YOU GET TO YOUR DESKTOP THERE WON'T BE THAT **** ANNOYING POPUP :~)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I sincerely hope this fix works for you. I also hope you know that whoever is having this exact issue, I feel really bad for you: this is by far the worst and most&nbsp;irritating issue that I've had with any computer, ever.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>So I hope this fix works for you, if you're having this issue too. Thank you for reading. Good luck!</strong></p>

<h2>            Microsoft account tied to built-in admin account</h2>
                    <p>I seem to be in quite a pickle here, I upgraded my laptop, a few years ago from windows 7 to 10, recently my boss asked me to pass on my work to others, but there's a problem,&nbsp; My personal Microsoft account, somehow got linked to the built-in administrator
 account, the laptop is from a referb center, so I don't have backs to do a reinstall, also there files and programs that can't be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I migrated everything to a new admin account, problem is now I can't remove my MS account from the built in, and the account I converted to local about a year or so ago.&nbsp; I do a full reset, but I don't know if that blow out the product keys of the programs
 installed, just want my ms stuff out of them, I'm not signed into any apps I am aware of, yet my email listed under "Accounts used by other apps" all I have listed there is Manage, the pc been removed from http://accounts.microsoft.com. I spoke with MS about
 this, and it's been looping back to create a new account, anyone have any suggestions, is a clean install my only option here? I disable the built-in account, but my settings are still there.</p>

            Hi Stedmister
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Resetting the computer to factory state will not invalidate the license, it will remain activated. 
<br />
<br />You can also create an entirely new account with Administrator privilege, sign in then delete your old account. 
<br />
<br />Option 1: 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your info
<br />Click sign in with a local account instead
<br />
<br />Enter your current password
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Enter a name, password, confirm it, enter a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Sign out and Finish
<br />
<br />Sign into the account
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings (or press Windows key + i) &gt; click Update &amp; security
<br />
<br />Click Recovery then click Get Started under Reset this PC
<br />
<br />Since we are performing a clean install, I will be selecting the option Remove everything, if you don't want to do that, you can click Keep my files
<br />
<br />Reset offers two types of clean installs:
<br />
<br />Just remove my files - this option is quicker and recommended if you just want a fresh start and you plan to keep the computer.
<br />
<br />Remove files and clean the drive - if you plan to giveaway or resell your computer, this option ensures the computer is cleaned properly. Its takes a bit longer, but it is recommended if you plan to no longer use this computer.
<br />
<br />Since I will be using this computer, I will choose the first option.
<br />
<br />Click Reset to begin
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will restart
<br />
<br />Preparing to perform a reset
<br />
<br />Resetting - this might take some time depending on the amount of data
<br />
<br />Windows will check the drive for errors and fix them.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 performs a clean install again
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience (OOBE)
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience assist with personlizing your Windows experience such as creating a user account, connect to a wireless network and adjust privacy settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />Choose your country, language, keyboard layout and time zone then click Next
<br />
<br />Read and accept the End User License Agreement
<br />
<br />If you want to customize your privacy settings, you can do so now. Please note, you can always do this after setup (Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy). For now, lets use Use Express settings
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 restarts
<br />
<br />Setup your username, password and a hint then click Next
<br />
<br />There you have it, a clean installation of Windows
<br />
<br />Option 3:
<br />
<br />Create a new account, sign into that account then delete your old account from the new account.
<br />
<br />To delete the account after creating the new one, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Account &gt; Family &amp; other users
<br />Select the Account
<br />Click Remove account<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c570c83f-24de-414d-8268-1bb66b14dca9?upload=true" />

            The laptop belongs to the business, I do a reinstall but then I loose Office 2010, which I do't have the product key for. Files have been move, and I can't delete the account as it the built-in admin. This is a certified referb, Rct installed windows and
 other stuff, using their oem license, there no way for me to be without a pc for 2 weeks, as I need to ship it out. I A+ certified so I know my way around, if i had the keys for office I could reinstall but I don't.

<span>Since i had bought my system(HP Pavilion dv6-2125tx), there is an issue in it. Its something like this that when I use to connect to net using LAN server, my system simply hangs
 up. At that stage, keyboard &amp;&nbsp;touch pad&nbsp;don't respond to anything &amp; a strange&nbsp;irritating&nbsp;noise use to appear from speaker &amp; the display seems to be as if its freezes. At this stage the only option that is left is to press the power button &amp; shut it down &amp;
 then again start it. But, I didn't paid much attention to this considering it to be a hardware(LAN or hard drive) malfunctioning &amp;&nbsp;totally&nbsp;ignored it. Since 2 to 3 days, my left speaker too was not working fine. So, I finally showed it to one of&nbsp;authorized&nbsp;service
 center of HP. Over there, the guy told me that the source&nbsp;&nbsp;of all these issue of system hang up is because I had made multiple partition( in his sense, more than one) that even of type dynamic. He focused much on partition being type dynamic. So, for solution
 he told me to merge all these partition &amp; make just one more extra partition(beside one for OS, another for RECOVERY &amp; the third one of HP TOOLS),</span><span>&nbsp;otherwise my hard drive would
 crash permanently. Later, I had told him I had made such partition the day I bought it. Then at this very moment he very shockingly said that then my hard drive should have crashed by now and he is very surprised to see that it is still working. On the other
 hand, as an alternate solution he told that if I wish to make multiple partition then I should install Windows 7 home premium edition from a pirated disk( formatting the whole hard drive &amp; removing RECOVER &amp; HP-Tool drive completely) &nbsp;&amp; then register using
 the the key provided at the base of the system &amp; activate it. this would solve all the problem related to system hang up.</span></div>

<span>About my system-&nbsp;</span><span>In my system, as per the factory settings, there were three drives(partitions). One in which
 the OS was loaded, the other was of RECOVERY &amp; the third one was of just 100MB, containing some system files. The first partition was of approximately 450GB. So, from DISK&nbsp;MANAGEMENT&nbsp;tool, I shrinked this drive, by which I got nearly 230GB for free space,
 which was&nbsp;unallocated. In this total unallocated space, I had created three partitions, of some 100GB, 60GB &amp; 40GB, and left the remaining as unallocated. So, will there be any effect on the hard disk &amp; all other hardware of all these. Secondly, all these
 drives are of type dynamic. I too had seen this(partition of type dynamic)&nbsp;specifically in Windows 7 and i didn't got anything like this&nbsp;in XP &amp; Vista.</span></div>

<p><span><span><span>Hi tanuj anand,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Your problem of computer hanging does not seem to be related to multiple partitions on your computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>You should start with checking the<strong>event viewer</strong> that will help you
 analyze what could cause the computer to freeze</span>. This can be related to either a hardware malfunctioning or a Third Party service Interrupting.</span></span></span></p>

            If the drive will not eject when the computer is off and you've tried the paperclip, then the CD is stuck in the drive and the only way to get it out is to completely disassemble the drive. Or simply replace the drive and throw the whole thing out. The
 CD is undoubtedly ruined anyway.

<h2>            Unable to boot &#40;Blue Screen&#58; BAD_POOL_HEADER&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>original title: Unable to boot (BSoD: BAD_POOL_HEADER)</p>
<p>When I attempt to boot up Windows 7, i get a BSoD before it has finished loading that gives a BAD_POOL_HEADER</p>
<p>Attempting boot in Safe Mode, it just hangs while loading drivers (last successful driver to load is Classphp.sys)</p>
<p>Attempting to use a recovery/install cd to get into Windows repair will also causes the BSoD, so I am unable to perform a system restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've run SMART checks on my HD and everything appears to be healthy. I can also boot perfectly fine into Ubuntu and browse the Windows Files system.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi EtherealOne,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Since when you started facing the issue?<br />
2. What recent changes have you made to the computer?<br />
3. Have you done any driver updates or changes to the hardware before the issue appeared?<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>It seems to be a driver issue. You may try using the Last known good configuration. It is a<span>Windows</span> startup option that uses the most
 recent system settings that worked correctly. Every time you turn your computer off and<span>Windows</span> shuts down successfully, important system settings are saved in the registry. So it starts<span>Windows</span> with the last registry and driver configuration
 that worked successfully.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>You may refer to the below links for further assistance on the issue -<br />

<p>Hi there, thank you for your response</p>
<p>I unfortunately had already tried to use the last known good configuration. When using it, it ran a chkdsk and attempted to fix some errors regarding orphaned files but then after rebooting it still gives me a BlueScreen.</p>
<p>As far as I am aware, I have not installed any new software onto my Windows partition. Only performed some updates of components like AV. Before the PC crashed however, there was an error attempting to read a file on the disk. However, that file was deleted
 and did not appear to cause further problems.</p>

<h2>            Configuring Windows Update 30&#37; cpmplete-Unable to install updates</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows Update </p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that whenever I install a security update/patch of any sort, it is installing only 30% of the updates while shutting down and the rest is installed after the boot up.. Screen shows the exact same percentage whenever any update is installed. Is
 that percentage means that it is installing a certain module and it displays the percentage?? Curious to know the details behind it<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6eacc9b6-e0e4-4176-8cda-8f0d2a6323dc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6eacc9b6-e0e4-4176-8cda-8f0d2a6323dc" /></a>.</p>

            <p><strong><em>it is installing only 30% of the updates </em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You are misinterpreting what you see. The update or updates have installed. During shutdown or restart the updates are configured always to 30%. When the computer is next booted configuration completes with the percentage rising from 30% to 100%. What you
 are seeing is normal for a successful update.</p>

<h2>            is there a good thumbnail viewer that will allow me to view psd thumbnails in windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm having all sorts of problems finding a decent thumbnail viewer that won't cause problems in windows 7.&nbsp; I use PSP and a lot of the tubes that I use come is psd or other formats that Windows 7 simply won't let me see.&nbsp; Unlike XP or the earlier versions,
 there's not a "view thumbnails" in the drop-down menu.&nbsp; I've tried loading a couple of thumbnail viewers onto the computer (32 bit Dell Vostro 220s) and they cause all sorts of problems&nbsp;- like every time I try to file away tubes, I get a message that IE has
 shut down (even though it's not open) and it closes all my open files where I'm filing tubes.&nbsp; If IE is open, it really doesn't shut down.&nbsp; Other problems have included things like having the "thumbnail" thumbnail showing up in every single file that I open,
 which is really frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, at this point, I'm not sure which one to try and if there may be some registries that I need to download along with the viewer to make it work correctly.&nbsp; Any input would be greatly appreciated.</p>

 yourself?</p>

            1) go online and find a download source for "psicon.dll" and save to disk.<br />
<br />
2) find another source for "psddllregistry.reg" and save to disk. I got mine from filehut (formerly mediafire)<br />
<br />
3) make sure the.reg file saved as .reg file, sometimes it will automatically rename and add .txt - if that's the case, remove txt and ensure the file is indeed named .reg<br />
<br />
4) browse to c:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Shell -- you might not have "Shell" folder so if you don't, create it. if you don't have the "Adobe" Folder, you have issues with Photoshop and it won't be a WIndows problem. THis solution requires Adobe software,
 because the dll utilizes components from the Adobe software to render the thumbnail. And I suppose the reason why Windows has no support is because Adobe would insist they bundle their Trial or Light version of the software with Windows... I digress...<br />
<br />
5) Save the .dll file to this "Shell" folder<br />
<br />
6) Right click on the .reg file and select "Merge" -- if Windows is going into its usual&nbsp; hyperprotective mode with popups scaring you into not doing this, ignore - it is safe. Keep telling Windows that you know what you're doing and that, yes, you do want
 to continue, and that it should just shut up already.<br />
<br />
7) Reboot your computer. You just changed a harmless registry setting but Windows stil needs to reboot. If you are prompted to create a system restore point, be my guest but it's not necessary and only uses up disk space.<br />
<br />
Of course this can also be done via command line but I leave that up to a fellow nerd to talk about :-)<br />

<h2>            How does the Recovery Drive work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 laptop&nbsp;PCs, one originally came with Windows 8, upgraded to 8.1 then 10.</p>
<p>The second PC came with, I believe, 8 but could have been 8,1, not sure but upgraded to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Does the USB recovery flash drive create a restore to Win 10 or will it restore to the original 8? If so I guess I have to reinstall 10.&nbsp; Hope not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is actually restored? Everything on the computer or just a system recovery/restore?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you select the Create a Recovery Drive option, a recovery drive will be created for the installed version of Windows, not a previous version that may have been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an option to include System Files when you create the recovery drive, if you select this option, the recovery drive can be used to Reinstall Windows 10.</p>
<p>

    <title>How to Authorize my new computer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thebabycam  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Authorize my new computer&#63;</h2>
                    So I just got this new laptop, it had Windows 8 on it. I started it up, set it all up, then it sent me an Email to verify my account and authorize my PC (It's named CameronsPC). So I clicked the Email, clicked the link, and authorized it. I then went to
 download iTunes, but it's telling me I can't download music until I'be Authorized my PC. So I go back into my Email go back to the Email, and click the link again. But then it tells me the link has either expired or been consumed. It's only been a few hours
 so I doubt it expired. Which means I did confirm my account properly, but iTunes just wont register that. Does anyone know how to fix this so that I can use iTunes? Is there a way to get another link to authorize my account to see if it'll work?&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Cameron, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue that you are facing&nbsp;appears to be specifically related to the computer authorization in iTunes.&nbsp;As the issue you descripbed is&nbsp;within&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;you will need to work with Apple to address this issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information regarding authorizing you computer in iTunes is avaialble from their website at:

            Solution:<br />
Apples, iTunes and Oranges,&nbsp;Windows PC.<br />
First, is Authorization of PC with (Microsoft Account)&nbsp;e-Mail and password.<br />
Second, is Authorization of PC with (Apple iTunes Account) e-Mail and password.<br />
Tip: Change your authorized (iTunes account) to be the same as your Microsoft account e-Mail address and password. All your apps, (Windows and Apple iTunes),&nbsp;can use the same account e-Mail address, in&nbsp;this way, for authorization. Make sure you update the account
 info in the&nbsp;iTunes app.

I have been researching this for you and while I haven't found anything definitive it would seem that if you copied the project folder onto a USB drive you could then plug the USB into another PC and be able to use it in the photo app<br /><br />Hopefully this helps

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am not syet that i t applies to your system because I can clearly understand the overall topology.</p>
<p>However when frequently using Virtual computers, there can be an issue with SuperFetch&nbsp; trying to cacle files the size of .vhd (GB), so it might be disabled to ensure stable memory.</p>

            Thanks for your reply, Jack, but as I stated in my first post it happens on my hardware as well as my VM. &nbsp;Does Windows even know I am using a VM? &nbsp;Thanks, John.

<p>As far as the host Windows is concerned a virtual machine is just another running program.&nbsp; I don't believe SuperFetch would shut down just because you have allocated a large block of ram to one or more vms.&nbsp; Since a vm's memory stays allocated while it
 is running, there is no need to do any fetching anyway.</p>
<p>At least that subject never came up as a byproduct of vm usage in the virtual pc newsgroup back when I was an MVP for virtual machines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One Windows feature that does shut down based on large memory installed is hibernation (wake up time becomes unacceptibly long) so it is possible other features behave differently based on memory installed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cbarnhorst, thanks for your reply. &nbsp;I do not think the shutdown of the Superfetch service is due to running a VM. &nbsp;I use the VM only for testing the install image I then install it on my HW. &nbsp;During this testing I see the Superfetch service shut down (on
 VM) and I see the service shut down on my HW even though I am not and have not run a VM. &nbsp;I have hibernation turned off during install using&nbsp;PowerCfg /Hibernate off. &nbsp;Please see<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7performance/thread/cb27a1ba-00bf-4302-b7d5-1cc6581746a6/#22cb85da-de48-4f1b-9b3b-20f4f2612a03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this
 thread</a>. &nbsp;Here are two more events that I consistently see&nbsp;when&nbsp;Superfetch is shut down. &nbsp;Please tell me if there is a way to attach files to this forum. &nbsp;Thanks, John.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business &#40;Mac&#41; Duplicated Message</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue where messages in Skype for Business are being duplicated and each&nbsp;message appears as a separate chat instead of under one thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can fix this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest version of Skype for Business (Mac - 16.8.0.168)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Image Example Below:&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi </span><span>Daniel,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The situation you described could happen. I have done some tests on my side.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the sender sends you message via different devices/ applications, like Windows, Mac and iOS, it can cause this symptom.</span></p>
<p><span>And the sender can also open another window on his/her side when sending you the message.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the sender is not in the above situation, I’d like to confirm the following information</span><span>:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Please clarify how the sender sends the message.</span></li><li><span>Does the issue happen every time when you receive the message from every sender? If not, please clarify in which sitution the issue happens.</span></li><li><span>If possible, please test in another Skype for Business for Mac to check the issue.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Monique</span></p>

    <title>Computer Focus Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wiscy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer Focus Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello. So I'm currently having a mess of troubles with my computer but the first and biggest is the fact that rather frequently my computer is not registering clicks from my mouse on anything but whatever I had focus on when the issue occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meaning, I will have discord up and as I have a dual screen I'll move my mouse over to change the video I'm watching in youtube or to quick look up something and for some reason my computer won't register that I am clicking on the other application/window/anywhere
 that isn't discord. It's the same with the reverse where I will be in my internet browser and I want to respond to someone on discord or change songs on iTunes and it won't register that I'm clicking on the other applications. Alt+Tab doesn't work as it'll
 just go straight back to focusing on the initial application and I can't even click onto the taskbar. My mouse is moving on the screen and any videos that are playing will keep playing, it's just not letting me click.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting to a restore point from before the error started occurring, running a virus scan, uninstalling and reinstalling chrome, uninstalling anything downloaded since the error occurred, updating my video driver, restarting my computer, and
 messing with the Focus Assist. Nothing seems to be working. The only bandage fix I have right now is hitting ctrl+alt+del and hitting cancel when it asks me what I want to do. After that I can start using all the applications open on my display again... for
 about 2-3 minutes before it all happens over. It's starting to get a little frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 10</p>
<p>Video Driver: NVIDIA GeForce GTX</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist if you can.</p>

            Hi Wiscy
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />If its custom built, what is the make and model of the motherboard?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Mice and other pointing devices.
<br />Right click on the Mouse and click uninstall
<br />
<br />Press Alt + F4
<br />Press the Windows key + X
<br />Press the letter U
<br />Press the letter R
<br />
<br />Restart in Normal mode and see if the mouse works.
<br />
<br />It was an issue with the Synaptics drivers for my touchpad. I had to disable some Palm Check sensitivity, which I had read about a few days ago, but could not find the option.
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Press the 'M' key
<br />Press tab once
<br />Use the down arround to select Mice and other pointing devices.
<br />Press the right arrow to expand Mice and other pointing devices.
<br />Use the down arrow again to select your HID-Compliant mouse
<br />Press the right click menu key on your keyboard (usually located between the Alt and Control keys)
<br />Select uninstall
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Press Alt + F4
<br />Press the Windows key + X
<br />Press the letter U
<br />Press the letter R
<br />
<br />Restart
<br />
<br />Other things you can try.
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. This troubleshooter finds and fixes common problems with devices on your computer.
<br />
<br />Click Start.
<br />Type Troubleshooting, and select Troubleshooting in the results.
<br />In the new window, click Hardware and Sound.
<br />In the list of options, click on Hardware and Devices.
<br />Click Next and follow the on-screen instructions.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files. This allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
