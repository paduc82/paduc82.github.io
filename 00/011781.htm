<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 - blank page - settings grayed out - does not load sites</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm having a weird issue that started today with Internet Explorer 11 on my Windows 8.1 laptop.<br />
When I launch IE, it shows a blank page instead of the usual home page (bing.com in my case). If I try to type a URL, it does not load any site.<br />
Also the settings are all grayed out, so it does not even show the "Internet Options" available to click on.<br />
<br />
I already tried to:<br />
-&nbsp; reset the Internet Options (accessing it from the Control Panel)<br />
-&nbsp; Turn off Internet Explorer in the "Windows Features" and then back on.<br />
-&nbsp; Scan with Malwarebytes but found nothing <br />
<br />
Unfortunately I can't go to an earlier "Restore Point" as the Samsung Magician software disabled the system recovery option in my new SSD drive for "reliability"... well, I enabled it from now on.<br />
<br />
I have the latest patches installed on my laptop and IE was loading fine two days ago as I was using it to develop some code.<br />
I'm used to deal with computer problems, but I'm currently out of resources for this one.<br />
<br />
Could anybody give me a hint on how to repair IE?<br />
<br />

            =========================<br />
FIND THE ANSWER TO MY PROBLEM<br />
=========================<br />
<br />
I just wanted to come back and share what actually solved my problem completely. I found the solution within this thread:&nbsp;
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie11-windows_other/internet-explorer-any-version-opens-a-blank-window/815d7863-1e00-4183-be49-4b765f40e681">
internet-explorer-any-version-opens-a-blank-window</a><br />
<br />
In my particular case, it seemed to be a corrupted Internet Explorer profile, and I was able to fix it by opening REGEDIT and deleting the key
<span>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer]. Then, logging off and back on; upon logging back on, I opened the Internet Explorer and everything came back to work normally. Of course, as a safeguard, I recommend to Export the key for backup
 before completely getting rid of it.<br />
<br />
Just for the record, I rarely install add-on's to the browsers as long as I really need them. Most of my browsing is with Firefox or Chrome, although I use IE occasionally.<br />
<br />
The way I was able to confirm that it was a corrupted IE profile, was by logging using a different user in my computer, and then I was able to open IE normally.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for the replies.<br />

            IE 11 went blank after a bunch of spyware/adware got onto PC. &nbsp;After numerous malware scans and clean ups, everything worked in the OS, including Chrome browser, except IE still had a blank white screen. &nbsp;Deleting the reg key worked for me as well.

<h2>            Excel won&#39;t let me type in cells</h2>
                    <p>I have a PC with Windows 7 and the MS Office Suite 2010 that includes Excel. &nbsp;I have been using Excel successfully for years but a few weeks ago, it started giving me trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every single day, I have the problem where I cannot type in Excel. &nbsp;My text is not white. &nbsp;I don't have merged cells. &nbsp;I can't type in ANY cell. &nbsp;As I stated, this happens daily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have repaired the program several times. &nbsp;I have restarted my computer several times. &nbsp;After each of these troubleshooting techniques, I can only type for a short while before the problem returns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice that this problem persists when I use IE and occasionally when I use Google Chrome. &nbsp;Weird and I don't know why this would cause an issue. &nbsp;PLEASE HELP!</p>

            Following are likely solutions. (First you have already tried. I think option 2 should solve your problem)<br />
<br />
1. Please try to repair your Office as a quick fix.<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx<br />
<br />
2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
3. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.<br />
<br />
4. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
6. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
7. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
8. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
9. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
10. File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options.<br />
<br />
11. Review the KB articles - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758592 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2779852<br />
<br />
12. If none of above works, please uninstall the current installed Office, and reinstall it again. Before resorting to uninstall, make sure that you have the license keys.<br />
<br />
To uninstall the Office, follow the instructions in the following support article: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 &amp; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179/en-us<br />
<br />
Note: Ensure to save the Fix it on the desktop and then run the file.

<h2>            Xbox one game progress data missing</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my son has an Xbox 1S and he is concerned that a significant amount of game data associated with Forza Horizons has gone missing. &nbsp; I have done some basic trouble shooting with him and we find his Forza achievements are visible when he is signed in
 online but his garage is missing multiple vehicles that he had won previously and the data re unlocked Horizon Festival sites has also gone missing. &nbsp; &nbsp;A similar thing happened previously on our Xbox360 and Minecraft data. &nbsp;This isn't what I expect from a
 highly recommended gaming device from &nbsp;well respected manufacturer.</p>
<p><br />
Any ideas please? &nbsp; Thank you, John T<br />

<span>Make sure to use an <strong>alternate email address </strong>
that <strong>they have access with </strong>in order to receive the security code and
<strong>not</strong> the email address of the account that needs to be recover.</span></li><li>
<span><span>Even if the original information has changed, be sure to use the information that is&nbsp;associated with the account originally.&nbsp;</span></span><span>
</span></li><li>
<span>The 4 basic information <em>(First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove Online Identity) .</em></span></li></ul>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Also, make sure that your customer fill out information 100% sure and in the best of their knowledge. Just&nbsp;provide enough to pass this validation. The 4

<h2>            SharePoint&#58; Open file in new tab</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Documents-App where PowerPoint and Excel files are uploaded stored. When I click on them, office online opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that office online opens at the same chrome-tab as the SharePoint itself, which means that the SharePoint page disappears. I want that when people click on the file, office online opens in a new Chrome-tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible? Without coding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Yes, by default, if we click on the file, it will open in Office Online in the same page. To open the file in another tab, we can

    <title>Transferring Outlook 2007 Windows 7 files to Outlook 2016 Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flasny80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring Outlook 2007 Windows 7 files to Outlook 2016 Windows 10 as archive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I very recently had to replace a defunct Windows 7 PC using Outlook 2007.&nbsp;4 POP3 accounts,&nbsp;2 used daily, 2 occasionally,are consolidated in the same .pst files, Outlook. pst and Archive.pst, the default file names at the time. The PC itself has been discarded,
 but I have backups of all user files. I am now a&nbsp;using Windows 10 PC with a permanent license to Office Home and Business 2016, which includes Outlook,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I needed&nbsp;email ASAP&nbsp;and could not wait several days for the restoration of data to be complete, I set up Outlook. I then discovered that 1) The file paths to Outlook files apparently differ between the two Windows OS. 2) The default configuration
 for Outlook is now separate .pst files for each separate email&nbsp;address, and if I chose to override that, I would have to pick one .pst file created for one email address and direct everything to be saved there, not something named Outlook.pst. I don't recall
 this from previous installations of Outlook, but I only upgrade every several years when a PC stops functioning altogether. I anticipated problems migrating my existing email and attachments. But after some research, it seemed that separate .pst files are
 now recommended for security against data loss, etc, and I did not yet have access to my existing .pst files, so had no choice but to create new .pst files rather than transfer and add on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My cloud backup service was unable to restore Outlook automatically because of the changes in software and OS. I will move the .pst files manually. However I don't know 1) where to put them, since the file paths changed and 2) if Outlook can display them
 (and attachments,) given that I already have new .pst files. The existing ones from the old computer span several years up to several days ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, the easiest thing for me is if I can just drop the file somewhere and have everything accessible as archive folders. Will this happen&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;or can I set it up to happen? Merging differently configured files into one looks too technically
 complicated for my skill level. I could create one file by deleting all of the new files and replacing them with the existing Outlook.pst, but&nbsp;that requires some work in re-forwarding my most recent&nbsp;mail in Outlook 2016&nbsp;to myself, etc. If I cannot just make
 an archive, are there other options I haven't considered?&nbsp; I am an experienced. moderately computer literate user who can follow instructions and links, but am not ultra-technical. Thank you for any assistance.

<p>
</p><p>Your description is a tad "involved" to say the least for what in reality is a fairly simple task so just going to cover some of the basic items you raised</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - POP3 email accounts can either (1) have a separate PST file for each account or (2) use a single one (as you already know). In reference to using multiple PST's for safety purposes - I have all of my POP3 account delivered to a single &lt;Inbox&gt;
 and then have multiple additional PSTs for historical purposes. I don't use the "archive" process - just move items from the &lt;Inbox&gt; to the appropriate PST file/folder when taken out of the but everyone deals with historical data differently</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - A pst file can be saved to anywhere you want (I keep mine on a separate local hard drive) as opposed to Outlook "default" locations - easier to backup and don't have to worry about things on the odd occasions that I have to restore an image
 of that drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, just a matter of saving your old PST files to where you want and then just open each PST file in Outlook<br />
File --&gt; Open &amp; Export --&gt; Open Outlook Data File</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - Merging is not complicated - just need to decide on which of the PST files you want to be the "destination" for the merged data OR create a new PST file and use that as the "merged" data store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use a new PST file - just a matter of moving/copying folders to where you want them (I strongly suggest using the &lt;copy process&gt; leaving your original data intact. Alternatively, you can move/copy items to an existing folder in the destination
 PST file.</p>

<p>#4 - Not cleat about what you were referring to with ".........<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I could create one file by deleting all of the new files and replacing them with the existing Outlook.pst, but&nbsp;that

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
If you're talking about the POP3 accounts on your new system, then that's just a matter of changing the delivery location of the POP3 account via</span></p>

            different question for this board...but...<br />
<br />
I would craigslist your galaxy and then buy the 520, if that is available in your country.<br />
<br />
otherwise, being the cost of the 520 is so reasonable, you should be able to sell that galaxy even on the street through some of your friends.

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi Tamenflame,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest using the System File Checker to look for missing and corrupt files that could be causing this
 issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this doesnâ€™t help then you can reset Internet Explorer settings:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature from Control Panel, follow these steps:
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Exit all programs, including Internet Explorer (if it is running).
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>click
<strong>Start</strong> <span>Collapse this imageExpand this imag</span>. Type the following command in the
<strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press ENTER: </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>inetcpl.cpl<br />
</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span><br />
The <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box appears. </span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Advanced</strong> tab. </span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Under
<strong>Reset Internet Explorer settings</strong>, click <strong>Reset</strong>. Then click
<strong>Reset</strong> again. </span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>When Internet Explorer finishes resetting the settings, click
<strong>Close</strong> in the <strong>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</strong> dialog box.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Start Internet Explorer again.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the issue still persists, then go to step 3.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 3:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Uninstall and reinstall Internet Explorer and check if it resolves the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; To uninstall Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</span></span></span></p>

<strong>View by</strong> to <strong>Large icons</strong> at the top right of the Control Panel.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select
<strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong> in the left column of the Programs and Features window.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncheck
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong> and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click <strong>Restart Now</strong> to restart the computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reinstall Internet Explorer follow the same steps and check off Internet Explorer.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Restart Now for the changes to apply.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            &#39;Sorry, Word Online ran into a problem opening this document&#39; error</h2>
                    
<p>hi,</p>

<p>i've a word document stored in a shared document library on sharepoint 2013, office 365 version. &nbsp;there hasn't been any issues with the document, but when users attempt to open it in word online they get an error:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=16a435fd-05b8-475c-94c9-ae0b2069af70" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d16a435fd-05b8-475c-94c9-ae0b2069af70" /></a></p>
<p>as many users don't have word installed and rely on being able to access the document via word online i need to get this resolved asap.</p>
<p>any suggestions as to what is causing this and how i can resolve it?</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>An issue was posted to the Service Health Dashboard (SHD) as incident SP44800 starting at Tuesday, April 5, 2016, at 11:22 AM UTC. The user experience of this incident is: Affected users were unable to edit or render Office documents using Office Online.
 It has been resolved as of: Tuesday, April 5, 2016, at 3:15 PM UTC.</p>
<p>If you are still experiencing an issue, this may indicate either a scoping issue or an independent problem. Therefore, we would like to further confirm the situation from your side:</p>
<p>1. Does this currently happen to a specific document?</p>
<p>2. Try using Internet Explorer InPrivate Browsering and see if you can open the document.<br />
</p>
<p>3. Please also have a quick check on whether Excel or PowerPoint files can be opened properly using Office Online, considering the previous incident SP44800.</p>
<p>Let us know any updates when you have time and we will follow up on your case.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Rene</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>1. Yes it happens to a specific Word document. &nbsp;Other Word documents in the same library open fine in Word online. &nbsp;The document that won't open in Word online opens fine in Word.</p>
<p>2. Due to work policy InPrivate mode is disabled.</p>
<p>3. Excel, PowerPoint, and other Word files open properly.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>Given the scenario, I would like to explain that the features enabled in Word online and Word app are not exactly the same. You could try to rename the document and upload it to library to see the outcome. Besides, there is several file formats supported
 in Word Online, like .docx, .dotx, .doc, etc. Please refer to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Differences-between-using-a-document-in-the-browser-and-in-Word-3e863ce3-e82c-4211-8f97-5b33c36c55f8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Differences between using a document in the browser and in Word</a>. You could try to open the document in Word app and save it in another file format and upload it to library to see the outcome.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jared</p>

<p>Thanks, but that isn't helpful. &nbsp;As I've already explained, the document has previously opened in Word online without issue, I don't see how the difference between Word and Word online are at all relevant to this matter.</p>
<p>As it turns out this problem isn't an issue any more, it appears to have solved itself. &nbsp;This morning the document opened in Word online without any problems. &nbsp;Nothing has been done to the document so I've no idea what caused the problem or how the problem
 was fixed.</p>

 that the login and password was changed to the same as the other computer.&nbsp; I guess that this changed all my paths.&nbsp; Trusted locations are ok, except that drive "L" cannot be selected.&nbsp; How do I set the right path for the switchboard which seems to be the
 problem?

<p>It's very hard to say without seeing your database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the database while holding down the SHIFT key.&nbsp; Then use the Linked Table Manager to relink the tables.&nbsp; Then try again.</p>

<h2>            Cannot set backward value for trendline</h2>
                    <p>I try to edit a trendline to a diagram by setting its Backward value to 3. The value is reset to zero without error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>In a new Excel sheet, enter "Jun 16" in A1 and value 4 in A2.</li><li>Select both cells and drag the fill handle downwards file rows to B6.</li><li>Insert a 2D line diagram.</li><li>Add a linear trendline. You can use the Add Chart Elements button with the plus symbol next to the diagram.<br />
</li><li>Select the trendline to edit its properties, either by using "More Options" in the Add Chart Elements or by selecting it via the Chart Elements box in the Format tab.</li><li>In both the Forward and Backward fields, enter the Forecast value 3 .<br />
</li><li>Only the Forward value is used. The Backward value is reset to zero.</li></ol>

<p>That seems to be the way Excel behaves - one cannot forecast the past!!</p>
<p>I cheated - see screenshot</p>
<p>I followed your instructions to make the data, then inserted a new row 1</p>
<p>In A1, I entered 13/6/2017 (three days before your first date)</p>
<p>In B1 I used =FORECAST(A1,B2:B10,A2:A10)</p>
<p>Then I made an XY (not Line) chart of A1:B7 with makers and no line</p>
<p>Added the trendline with Forward set to 3 (first chart)</p>
<p>Formatted the first data point to specify no marker (second chart)</p>
<p>best wishes</p>
<p>PS you will need to use US format for&nbsp;dates I think</p>

            You need to create a new partnership for your new device. I suggest you delete the previous partnership on your computer and reboot before connecting your new device.

Thanks for even attempting to answer my post, but my issue isn't creating a new partnership.&nbsp; My issue is retrieving the sync'd info from an older partnership and transferring it to the new partnership IF the old partnership cannot be used on the new device.&nbsp;
 Thanks!!!

<p>If you had been syncing your old device with your PC, then when you setup the new partnership, that information will be brought over.&nbsp; Since your old device died, unless you have a backup and your new device is EXACTLY the same, you are out of luck in restoring
 previously installed programs.&nbsp; But, if you installed programs using the PC you are on, then they can easily be installed on your new device.</p>

<p>Make sense?</p>
