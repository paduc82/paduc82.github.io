    <title>Error 0xc0000005 in Office 2007 AND 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error 0xc0000005 in Office 2007 AND 2010</h2>
                    Just recently it seems after I had a update (but I can't pinpoint what happened to cause it), every time I try to print or change the font color in Excel, I get this error code.&nbsp; It also shows up immediately when I open Word.&nbsp; It keeps re-occurring and
 re-occurring in Word until I exit.&nbsp; In Excel, it's manageable.&nbsp; I can at least get through my homework and tests during the current finals week!<br />
<br />
I had Microsoft Office PRo 2007, but was able to upgrade to Microsoft 2010 through a digital download through my university's bookstore.&nbsp; The administration and the bookstore negotiated with Microsoft to offer it for free to current students.&nbsp; I only took the
 upgrade today because I thought that it would solve my 0xc0000005 problem.&nbsp; However, it is still happening.
<br />
<br />
I have no idea what's going on.&nbsp; I've read things about disabling the bluetooth add-on, but that didn't help. I have discovered that this error is pretty useless at pinpointing what's going on since it could be a myriad of things.&nbsp; Anything helps. I'm not an
 expert in computers. but my skill level is better than the average 55 year old woman who just got broadband internet.&nbsp; I was raised on a computer ;) I am willing to do whatever needs to be done in the registry or uninstalling .NET stuff.&nbsp; Geez, I run into
 SO many problems with .NET stuff.&nbsp; I've had to completely reinstall my OS after an "update" of it before. And try to do it while going to school.&nbsp; I'm an accounting major.&nbsp; Everything we do is in Excel!<br />
<br />
Again, sorry for the rant.&nbsp; I'm just at my wits end after spending almost 2 hours uninstalling 2007 then downloading and installing 2010 to find I still have the same problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks!!<br />

            So I ran the verifier, but I'm lost as to what to do next. I don't know how to interpret the results.&nbsp; I looked into researching them, but I don't know how to even find them. When I opend up Verifier and displayed the results,&nbsp; all the drivers' statuses
 said, "loaded," which as far as I have researched means their fine and verified.<br />
<br />
I'm feeling really dumb. I got the BSOD and it said, "SPECIAL_POOL_DETECTED_MEMORY_CORRUPTION."<br />
<br />
I tried updating my BIOS to the newer version that Dell has.&nbsp; I have a Dell N5110 with the A09 BIOS attempting to update to A10.<br />
<br />
However,<br />
I'm going to just do a clean install.&nbsp; I called Dell and they recommended restoring to factory settings.<br />
<br />
However, I have the mfr's restore to factory AND a Win 7 pro cd that I downloaded from Microsoft and burned the ISO.&nbsp; I hate Dell Bloatware.&nbsp; So if I used the restore to factory cd's, I'm going to have it.<br />
<br />
So, should I just pop the Win 7 dvd in and let it go? I've backed up everything.<br />
Thanks SOooo much!!<br />

<h2>            Continuously muted and cannot unmute when Skype for Business calls out to me</h2>
                    <p>When I use Skype for Business for iPhone for conference calls, I have no problems on VOIP but cannot unmute when Skype calls my cell phone. When I dial "*6" there is the announcement of "unmuted" then I am immediately muted again so no one can hear me. Sometimes
 it will say, "Presenter has muted you" even though no one has muted me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I experience this on every cellular call even when launched from Skype for Winows 100 but never on VOIP. When I transfer a VOIP call from Skype for Business (Windows 10) to my mobile, I see a message, "A presenter wants you to mute yourself" and there is
 no way to unmute myself in Skype for Business (Windows 10) or on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's broken with the "call out" (E5 SKU?) and how do I fix it?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To make sure the conference call feature is fine when Skype calls your cell phone, please create a test Skype for Business meeting and participate without VOIP. Check if other people can hear you without other presenter mute you.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, please provide the following information for us:</span></p>
<p><span>1. The detailed version of the Skype for Business for IOS client and your iPhone OS.</span></p>
<p><span>2. If you dial ‚Äú*6‚Äù to unmuted yourself twice, will other people hear you?</span></p>
<p><span>3. A screenshot of ‚ÄúA presenter wants you to mute yourself‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Does this issue happen before? </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Looking forward to your update.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Barry. Here's a good example following your advice where the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I scheduled a Skype meeting with only myself from Outlook on Windows 10 then joined the meeting on my laptop as a VOIP call where it worked fine. As soon as I transferred the call to by iPhone, the message pops up that "A presenter has muted you" with no
 way to unmute. Dialing "*6" has no impact. At best, I hear an "unmute" announcement followed immediately by "you have been muted," and the volume control on Skype for Business is not available (see below).</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>According to my knowledge, if you're a presenter, you can mute or unmute meeting participants. And by right-clicking the mic button again to unmute their audio and they will be prompted to unmute on their side to open the line.</span></p>

<p>I have a colleague who was having the same problem. Turns out his Skype for Business app didn't have access/permission to use his microphone. So it could be worth checking your app permissions (I'm not an iPhone user so can't guide you through that).</p>

<h2>            Update to 2016 RTM - Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft in a recent blog post mentioned that 2016 versions would be rolled out to O365 Personal/Home subscribers over a period. That seems fine if I'm using 2013 version.</p>
<p>I'm already running pre-release version of 2016, will I get updated automatically to final version on 22nd Sep, or do I need to do something to get it updated manually?</p>

Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;<span><br />
I appreciate your interest towards Office 2016.</span></div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Since you're already&nbsp;working on&nbsp;pre-release&nbsp;version of&nbsp;&nbsp;Office 2016, you&nbsp;can install the final version through the&nbsp;update.</p>
<p>You will&nbsp;be notified through the banner in Office applications stating <strong>
Updates for Office is ready to be installed</strong>. Then you can click on the <span>
<strong>Update now </strong>button to upgrade to Office 2016 final version.<br />
<br />
</span><span>If you have any other questions related to Office products, you can always reply and I‚Äôll be happy to assist you.</span></p>

<p>So, it means that the update would be manual... and when would I get this notification, on 22nd or as the roll-out happens.</p>

<h2>            Disable Design Mode Controls</h2>
                    
<p>OK, in Excel 2003 I use this code to disable design mode in the Workbook_Open event:</p>
<p>For Each Ctrl In Application.CommandBars.FindControls(ID:=1605)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl.Enabled = False<br />
Next Ctrl</p>
<p>This does not work in 2007 and 2010 versions. How do I disable the design mode control in 2007 &amp; 2010?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Customisation of the ribbon cannot be done purely by VBA.</p>
<p>You need to write Ribbon XML to do it.<br />
<br />
One good source of information about ribbon customisation is Ron de Bruin's website<br />

<p>HP Photosmart C310c</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following installation of my printer I can select Printing shortcuts under Printing Preferences using Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything works fine outside the IE10 environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However printing from IE10 command bar the same printer preferences window has garbled text and tabs and the&nbsp;specific option drop down selectors are totally blank! Tabs in the Printer Preferences form/map contain what I thing is Chinese text! (This is only
 place where no English text appears)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same situation also occurs when printing emails from Outlook.com - which is accessed through IE10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried many re installs of HP Software including uninstall using some specific batch file in the HP download without success.</p>
<p>I even installed the software on a new Windows 8 build on my laptop. Same problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone help&nbsp;me please to solve this problem.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>I never&nbsp;said I could not print!</u></p>
<p>I can print .&nbsp;That is not my problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have already stated in my initial request for help the error is that the&nbsp;printer preferences window has garbled text and tabs and the&nbsp;specific option drop down selectors are totally blank! Tabs in the Printer Preferences form/map contain what I thing
 is Chinese text! (This is only place where no English text appears). Selection of options is therefore impossible as printer preferences window shows as blank or in what looks to be Chinese text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that I have already given you the details:</p>
<p>- of the Printer I am using</p>
<p>- the IE version I am using please read title of my question?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I am not using IE <u>and</u> Outlook. I assumed you would&nbsp;understand Outlook.com is the Web base version of what was originally Windows Live Hotmail accessed through IE?</p>
<p>I quote from my original question "...Same situation also occurs when printing emails from Outlook.com - which is accessed through IE10."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Question: Is your reply a generic default first response?</u></p>
<p>Would appreciate it if you could actually read my question again to understand exactly what support/help I may need.</p>

<p>Printing preference options are all blank when selected in Internet Explorer 10 but are all visible when selected in any other application.</p>

<p>I can print from IE but only default settings as I cannot make any changes to the printing preferences</p>

<p>I have a similar problem. My printer is an HP Photosmart Premium C309g-m. I had it running without any problems on my old computer with Windows XP. I recently bought a brand new computer with Windows 8. After installing the printer, I get exactly the same
 problem with printing preferences. The text in the preferences dialogue looks garbled, and I am unable to choose my settings. Below, I have attached a screenshot of the dialogue I get:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fh30434.www3.hp.com%2ft5%2fimage%2fserverpage%2fimage-id%2f45993i198AFC19765F50D5%2fimage-size%2flarge%3fv%3dmpbl-1%26amp%3bpx%3d-1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem only appears for certain software. I get the problem for Internet Explorer, Notepad, Paint, WordPad, and the entire Microsoft Office package.&nbsp; For the following software the problem does not appear, and the Printing Preferences dialogue works
 fine: Acrobat Reader XI, Mozilla Firefox, and GSview. In general, the problem seems to appear only for Microsoft software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can circumvent the problem by going to Control Panel -&gt; Hardware and Sound -&gt; Devices and Printers, right clicking on the printer icon and selecting Printing Preferences. When I do this, the Preferences dialogue works normally, and I can set the default
 preferences I want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried uninstalling my printer, then downloaded and installed the latest version of Adobe flash player, and reinstalled the printer. This didn't help, however.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a link to an HP community forum, where a couple of people seem to have the same problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10-windows_8/ie10-hp-photosmart-printer-preferences-failure/aec12033-bd91-48b0-b244-b422af71575d">http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printer-All-in-One-Software-Drivers-e-g-Windows-8/cannot-use-print-preferences-in-notepad-or-internet-explorer/m-p/2467143#M44539<br />
</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could somebody please help resolving this annoying issue? <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

    <title>Recording tab in Mac version of PP 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew burgess &#40;ab17abv&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recording tab in Mac version of PP 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have been enjoying the new recording features of Powerpoint 2016 on a PC, being able to record a webcam into a presentation (via recording tab) and upload a recording directly to stream is very useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mac version doesn't seem to offer this functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I correct in concluding that the recording tab and the features it contains e.g screen capture, webcam recording, uploading to stream are not available in Mac versions?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so are there any plan to incorporate at some point?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for letting me know, I work in a University where lots of people are needing support in doing this kind of thing, so need to make sure I am offering correct information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

                    <p><span>I've been trying to get a hold of someone who actually works at Skype to help me with a connection problem I'm having. &nbsp;I ended up posting the question
 to the community, but I'd still like to know how to get a hold of these people. &nbsp;No matter where I go, everything always takes me back to this page:&nbsp;https://support.skype.com/en/skype/windows-desktop/</span></p>
<p><span>Even "contact us", ultimately leads me to the "ask the community" page. &nbsp;I tried e-mailing a return address from a back-and-forth I had 7 years ago, but all
 I got was an auto response telling me to ask the community. &nbsp; Does anyone work there? &nbsp;How do I get direct help?</span></p>
<p><span>Also, does anyone know where I can get a new Skype phone?</span></p>

            Ha ha. Welcome to "Customer Service" Skype/Microsoft style. As in, go to the community and see if someone out there is kind enough to help you because we sure as heck wont do anything. I am having a similar issue where I need to get into a Skype account
 which has been inactive for a very long time. After sending me on a wild goose chase and wasting half an hour of my time with various Microsoft related email addresses that &nbsp;no one ever uses, I got to the same point you are at now which is to throwing a Hail
 Mary on the Community boards. The irony here being that my problem is one in which it would be impossible for the community to offer any assistance.&nbsp;

<h2>            how to send a email to a gal</h2>
                    How do you send an email to the gal? I'm familiar with this process on a windows version of outlook 2010 by clicking on To:, selecting the gal, and click first name then scroll down to bottom of list, hold down the Shift key and selected last user, then
 selecting bcc.<br />

            Not that I'd recommend sending to the entire GAL but see if this works:
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click the Contacts Search button to open the Contacts Search window.</li><li>Change the All Folders drop down menu to any Exchange account listed as Directory, LDAP or Global Address List.</li><li>Typically, searching the GAL requires typing at least three characters. You may be able to simply type an asterisk ( * ) and get the entire listing.</li></ol>
<div>If this doesn't work then contact your Exchange administrator for a distribution list name than you can use instead.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Outlook 2019 W10 - Inbox Refresh Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quiktek-dan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2019 W10 - Inbox Refresh Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that the account's inbox does not properly refresh. When hitting the send/receive button, it appears to do all of the expected connecting and what not, but no mail comes in. The only way to get the mail to "receive," is to switch to another
 folder, then switch back to the inbox, then new mail flows in. I have done my due diligence and know that this is an ongoing issue and has been known to happen since at least outlook 2013. I tried many of the suggested solutions, to no avail. Format resetting,
 send/receive group setup, subscribing to different/more/less folders, clean starting....and others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm working with a standard IMAP based account (non-exchange account, charter is the mail provider) in outlook 2019. It is the only account that exists on the profile. The server settings are all correct. It
<em>does</em> send and receive, just improperly. I know there must be a way to correct this that I am missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated and thanked in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dan.</p>

            HI Dan,
<br />Did you make any changes to the send and receive settings? 
<br />
<br />Try this: type or paste the following into File Explorer's address bar then press Enter  to open File explorer to the folder where the SRS file is stored and delete it. 
<br />%appdata%\Microsoft\Outlook
<br />
<br />This will reset all of your send/receive settings back to the default. 
<br />
<br />Then go to Send/Receive settings (Ctrl+Alt+S)  and change the check every 30 min to 5 min. Do not go lower than 5 min, but higher is ok.  Do not make any other changes.
        </p>

<p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. </p>
<p>First, this account is newly set up. The issue existed on a clean install, with the account newly added, everything default. Also, after having made changes, I removed the account and added it again, thereby bringing things back to default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you still think that deleting this SRS file might help?</p>

            If its new and you did not edit the send and receive settings, no, i don't think you need to delete it. If you changed any send and receive settings, then delete it so outlook reverts to the default settings. 
<br />
<br />Definitely check the timing - default is every 30 min. Most people want it between 5 and 8 min, but it's not recommended to set it less than 5 min.  Let it sync every 5 min instead of doing a send and receive. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Then go to Send/Receive settings (Ctrl+Alt+S) and change the check every 30 min to 5 min. Do not go lower than 5 min, but higher is ok. Do not make any other changes.

<p>Ok, I'll do that. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but it kind of seems like there isn't really a solution. That, the send/receive button cannot be pushed on command to get the emails and that the best I can hope for is to set a low refresh time and allow it to
 refresh on it's own terms. Am I correct in that assumption?</p>

            At this point in time, without fully understanding the cause, its hard to find a solution. It may be related to something with the imap server your account uses - it could be your firewall or antivirus (if you use a 3rd party application). It's not a common problem. 
<br />
<br />The send/receive button *should* work (or Send / Receive groups &gt; imap account), but for the most part, it's also not really necessary. IMAP will sync when you switch to a folder if you are between the autosync times.

<p>I did this on 4 laptops by using the Media Creation Tool and burning a DVD (Not just copy to the DVD but using the burning program as it adds the boot information so you can boot from the DVD and do a custom build and format the System partition.&nbsp; This gives
 you 14393.xxx.&nbsp; Then you can Get Insider builds and be in the Fast ring.&nbsp; I did mine in the afternoon and 14915 was available the next morning.</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, there's your problem. You must have done a Clean Install of 14905. Not matter, If you have access to another PC (with the same architecture), then consider doing what I did. Turn it's download into an ISO (on disk) and install from&nbsp;that. If you haven't,
 or it's been 'Disk Cleaned' then still no problem, but it will mean doing a Clean Install of 14393.</p>
<p>

<p>Well, a thought it might be, but it's certainly not accurate. Why are you saying that by using the MCRT (which, I presume, you mean), he will get kicked back to Home version. Any evidence of that happening? Do share, I don't claim to know everything...</p>

No, sorry, Colin that won't do a thing. There's nothing wrong, Robert is just stuck in the Slow ring, a known bug of build 14905 (and fixed in 14915, which he can't get to |--). Being stuck in a 'wrong' Ring, that is.&nbsp;Just his luck (and mine, but that's not
 important), he might as well have been stuck in the Fast Ring and complaining he isn't getting any 'Slow Ring' builds, same issue, different timelines...

<h2>            web pages are not opening in proper format</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently restarted my computer in safe mode to fix a problem in my spread sheets where charts would not stay anchored in one place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then when i open some webpages they do not open in the proper format.&nbsp;The formating makes it very difficult to work with the pages because images do not display, lines are too spaced out and links to sub pages do not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is this?&nbsp; Has the restart in safe mode changed settings somewhere?&nbsp; has some software used in web page formatting been switched off?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Memory issues&#63;</h2>
                    I use an LG Optimus 7 for over a year now. Few weeks ago, the phone started acting weird: the marketplace app wouldn't open, as well as Games hub, etc... Worst thing is, the camera button stopped responding too - there was no way to take a photo.
<div>When I restart the phone, all things go back to normal... for a day. After a day or so, the symptoms are back - nonresponsive camera button, apps wouldn't open, ...</div>
<div>So now, for a couple of weeks, I have to restart my phone on a daily basis.</div>
<div>I'm suspecting a memory issue, but how to be sure / confirm that?</div>
<div><br />

            <p>My initial thought is that the issue might be caused from an app that is installed.</p>
<p>I think if it was my device and it was a reoccuring event, I might consider performing a hard reset and set the device back up but NOT reinstall any apps until I was sure that it was working properly for a couple of days.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If it appeared to be working then I would slowly add back apps to determine if it was an app that was causing the issue.</p>

    <title>How can I remove software installed by scammers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ptmguelph  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I remove software installed by scammers&#63;</h2>
                    I spent a few hours today helping a neighbor who was taken in by the Microsoft Support telephone scam.&nbsp; She let them onto her computer and ended up paying them over $200 via credit card.&nbsp; I got her to cancel her credit card and change her email password.&nbsp;
 Fortunately, she does not keep any financial info on her PC, nor does she bank via internet, so there was nothing to be concerned about there.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I went to her house and ran the Microsoft Safety Scanner, which did not turn up anything.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I also wanted to remove any newly installed programs.&nbsp; One of these was called PC Performance Booster, which was from Tech2TechSupport and which my neighbor told me she saw them install when they had control of her system.&nbsp; I started to use the Control Panel
 Uninstall Programs tool, but when I told it to uninstall this program, it appeared to be using Tech2TechSupport's own uninstall program - I knew this because User Account Control (she has Win7) asked if I wanted to let this program modify her system.&nbsp; When
 I saw this, I said no, so the program is still on her system.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest some other means of removing the program?

            <p>The uninstaller won't be any worse than the installer was and if you've got security software running on the system it should either indicate if malware is detected during the uninstall or at the very worst become disabled, letting you know that there actually
 is an issue.</p>
<p>The best method to uninstall software is always the uininstaller run from Control Panel, since what this actually does is execute all of the commands originally used to install the program in reverse, effecitvely reversing everything that was originally
 performed during installation.&nbsp; The warning that the uninstaller will modify the system is generic and is always invoked by the Windows Installer before it allows the installation process (really a reverse install) to execute.</p>
<p>I'd be far more worried if these normal warnings weren't being displayed.</p>

            The Format property or function returns a value which is the representation of a number as a percentage, so for this to be a percentage between 1 percent and 99 percent the number must be a fractional value of 0.01 to 0.99.&nbsp; It appears that the value of
 Test%Comp is, in your example, already a fractional value of 0.2, so you do not need to divide it by 100.&nbsp; You can see how in works in the debug window with:<br />
<br />
? Format(0.2,"Percent")<br />
20.00%<br />
? Format(0.2/100,"Percent")<br />
0.20%<br />
<br />
A number as a percentage is merely the number multiplied by 100.&nbsp; Again in the debug window:
<br />
<br />
? 0.2*100 &amp; "%"<br />
20%<br />
<br />
To return a number as a percentage of another number the first number is divided by the second number and multiplied by 100, e.g.<br />
<br />
? 22.5/90*100 &amp; "%"<br />
25%<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The Format function or property removes the need to divide by 100:<br />
<br />
? Format(22.5/90,"Percent")<br />
25.00%<br />
<br />
But there is an important difference here in that the arithmetical expression 22.5/90*100 returns a
<em>value </em>of 25, whereas formatting the value with Format(22.5/90,"Percent") merely
<em>presents </em>the result of the expression 22.5/90, i.e. 0.25 as a percentage; the underlying value is still 0.25.<br />

<p>Then see what Ken said. A percent is a decimal value. 20% is .2. So when you format a value as a percent it formats .2 as 20%. If you divide .2/100 you will get .2%</p>

            The issue is. I don't know what the actual number is going to. If I divide by 22.5 I will get 25% in each box. I need to change any number to a percent no matter what the value may be. How is this done?

            <p>You don't need to <em>change </em>the number at all, you need to <em>format </em>
it, which is simply a matter of setting the Format property of a control bound to the original number column in a report or form to Percent. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Do not format a number in an expression in the query by calling the Format function; that does change the value by returning a string expression.&nbsp; You should only format a numeric value as the very last stage of presentation, whether that is in a report or
 form.&nbsp; The underlying value should be left as the original number which in this case is a value between 0 and 1.&nbsp; You can then do any necessary arithmetic on the values.<br />
<br />
A simple example of this would be the net price of a product to which a tax, e.g. VAT, rated at 20% needs to be added to return the gross price.&nbsp; The tax rate should be stored as 0.2.&nbsp; If you need to display it as a percentage you'd simply set the Format property
 of the bound control in a form or report as Percent.&nbsp; While it would show as 20.00%, the value of the control would be 0.2.&nbsp; The gross price is then easily computed with the expression [Price]*(1+[TaxRate]).<br />

<p>Here is my issue. I use the hotmail.com for my emails, now outlook.com</p>
<p>I have been back and forth with emails to a friend. When he now replies to the email, all the previous history of responses in that email trail are condensed to two lines for each reply. &nbsp;I can get it expanded by clicking to the left of each reply. But how
 do I make it show the expanded view for all replies I send or receive please?</p>

<h2>            Duplicates in Shared Calendars...</h2>
                    <p>Working on my Boss's Apple MacBook Pro and he is using Outlook for Mac with our Company's Office365 account.
</p>
<p>Our Manager's Shared their calendars with the each other and the boss. The issues is on the boss's Mac, one of our manager's "private event" entry on his calendar is duplicated multiple times on the boss's Mac. Yet when we look at that same manager's calendar
 from a different manager on a PC its fine and not duplicated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Ideas? </p>

            <p>Events marked ‚Äúprivate‚Äù should never appear on anyone‚Äôs calendar other than the owner‚Äôs calendar. Are you saying a manager marked an event as private and it‚Äôs appearing on your boss‚Äôs calendar? If so, that‚Äôs a huge bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest your boss remove the calendar from his Outlook, restart the application and then add the calendar again. This should force it to refresh events.</p>
