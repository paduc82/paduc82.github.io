<h2>            N95 &#47; Bluetooth keyboard &#40;Logitech dinovo Edge&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I just bought a bluetooth keyboard but cannot get my N95 to connect to it. I have (after considerable trouble) managed to pair all other devices I needed and wondered if anyone had tried this before. The N95 lists the device as visible, but refuses to connect.
 I have connected the keyboard to my PC.<br />
<br />
The N95 claims to provide HID support for wireless keyboards. The message I get each time I attempt to pair is "Unable to connect to device". I even switched the PC off and attempted to pair without any joy either.<br />
<br />
The Logitech keyboard is a fairly recent product and I was wondering if anyone else had any luck connecting to the N95.<br />
<br />
Many thanks!

            Hi there,<br />
<br />
I've got an N95 and a diNovo Edge and they are working fine.<br />
Have you got the keyboard working with the N95 without the PC?<br />
The diNovo Edge cannot connect to multiple devices - i.e. can't be connected to the PC AND the N95 at the same time. (Otherwise the keyboard would type the same text on both phone and PC).<br />
I hope this helps but if not then this is how you connect the two devices:<br />
<br />
1) Turn on you diNovo Edge and hit the 'connect' button on the back<br />
2) On your N95 go into main menu --&gt; Connectivity --&gt; Wireless keybd<br />
3) Go to Options --&gt; Find keyboard<br />
4)If it prompts you for a passcode, type in 1 and press OK. Then type the letter 1 on your keyboard and hit return. (You should get confirmation that they are paired)<br />
4) Follow the rest of the instructions.<br />
5) Voila!<br />
<br />
----&gt; If you aren't prompted to pair the device - go into menu &gt; tools &gt; Bluetooth, Then hit right to go onto paired devices then &gt; options &gt; new paired device (and chose the Dinovo from the list...)<br />
<br />
(Note - the Windows key brings up the txt menu from homescreen, the homescreen can be controlled with the arrows, and when in an application (such as txt or email) to get into the 'options' menu - use the windows key again and use windows key or return to navigate.
 Also The Fn key works from keyboard to N95 - i.e. if u press the Fn key and the multimedia buttons - they are fully functional, and even open the app if u press Fn + Play/Pause (the homepage button on Fn and the email/txt ones work too)<br />
<br />
If theres any more probs, gimme a shout

<h2>            IE-11 Lettering and text jumbled, out of place, etc. - Picture included</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>Prefacing this question with the fact that I am not a techie. That said, for some reason IE as well as Google Chrome both show text all jumbled as in the picture attached. If I use Firefox, the problem does not appear, nor does it Print e.g. - if I print
 a screen shot, the text prints normal. I would prefer to use IE as my browser, and would like to correct this. I first noticed after the computer "updated". What I have tried to do thus far:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) Checked for updates for my graphics card, drivers, etc.</div>
<div>2) Played with page "font sizes", but it made no difference</div>
<div>3) Toggled between having compatibility view turned on and off, had no effect or change to how the pages looked</div>
<div>4) I tried going back to a previous version of IE, but it did not help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone provide a fix to this?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Thanks, W</div>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Which version of Internet Explorer is installed on the computer?<br />
2. Does the issue occur with any particular website or all the websites?<br />
<br />
As the issue started after the computer got updated, I would suggest you to see which updates got installed recently and provide us the KB numbers.<br />
<br />
a. Open Windows Update by swiping in from the right edge of the screen (or, if you're using a mouse, pointing to the lower-right corner of the screen and moving the mouse pointer up), tapping or clicking Settings, tapping or clicking Change PC settings, and
 then tapping or clicking Update and recovery.</span></p>
<span>b. Tap or click View your update history.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to check if the issue persists in no add-ons mode, Also try all the steps from the following link:<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t see files on lumia 920 in windows explorer</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
I've had this problem for a day or so now. I connect my lumia 920 to my PC (Windows 7 ultimate x64) the phone makes a connection sound and it shows up under My Computer. However when I go to browse the files on the 920 it is just empty. Also when I try and
 use the WindowsPhone app it boots up on the welcome screen as if it's the first time I'm connecting it and does nothing when I press the continue button...<br />
<br />
This hasn't always been the case as I was able to browse the files and use the WindowsPhone app for over a week without trouble previously.<br />
<br />
<b>What I have tried so far:</b><br />
<br />
&gt;Restarting my phone.<br />
&gt;Reinstalling the WindowsPhone app.<br />
&gt;Repairing and reinstalling .NET 4.5 and updating it.<br />
&gt;Tried having a password and not having one on the lock screen<br />
<div>&gt;Turning my firewall off.<br />
&gt;Connecting it to another USB port.</div>
<div>&gt;Uninstalling the Phone drivers under devices and re-installing them.</div>
<div>&gt;Connecting it to my other computer.<br />
&gt;Hard resting my phone. (This left me stuck on the cog wheels for hours and I had to flash my phone to fix this)<br />
&gt;And maybe more things that I can't remember at the moment.<br />
<br />
<b>Interestingly</b>&nbsp;when I had to hard reset it and wipe everything off the phone it worked fine, the app let the phone sync my music etc, I thought it had been fixed. BUT the second time I went to sync my phone the same problem happened! WindowsPhone app
 thinks its the first time and wont let me press continue and the device is just empty under My Computer.<br />
<br />
The phone works fine otherwise, all my music and stuff is on it from the first sync and I have 0 problems besides this! Any help would be appreciated and sorry for the huge post</div>
                </div>

Hey, this was a long time ago but I did manage to fix my problem. I found out that if I hard reset my phone it was fine right up until&nbsp;I synced it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It turned out that one of the albums I was syncing was causing it. After tediously going through syncing different albums&nbsp;I got to&nbsp;an album I had imported into iTunes from CD and my phone started having the problem again. Not sure if this is a common problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any music on ur phone that was on a CD and you imorted to iTunes? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It probably wont help but the album that was causing the problem for me was a Calvin Harris album, keeping it out of my library and stopping it from syncing stopped the problem from happening again after resetting the phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

                    <p><strong>Original Title: </strong>Silverlight?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I screwed up and installed Win 10 over my 8.1Pro. Didn't seem like it hurt anything... Until I tried to run a training program that requires Silverlight. Bummer. The start frame just sat there telling me I had screwed-up, big time. Maybe I was in over
 my depth but, I couldn't recover my 8.1. The files were there and I had the recovery files on a flash drive but, bottom line, I've got a nice new 8.1 install and when I go to install 10 again, I'm gonna unplug the 8.1 SSD and connect my spare, just in case...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if MS is going to address the Silverlight issue? It's kinda a show stopper as long as I've got these videos I've got to deal with.</p>

<p>I reloaded Win_10 and updated it again and this time when it asked to install Silverlight, it seemed to work. I'm using "TestOut.com" software and the videos played after the second load. The first load was on a second SSD, the second time I put it on the
 primary SSD. Computer is ASUS Z-87-PRO using the chipset DVI video @ 2560x1440.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at this point, I'd have to say, "case closed".</p>

<h2>            lumia 930 wireless charging problems with build 10149</h2>
                    <p>Since updating to build 10149 the battery life has substantially reduced which i can live with and has already been fed back. However, to recharge my phone i now have to connect a physical cable due to the phone over heating and the battery draining faster
 than it charges using the wireless charger. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only is this an inconvenience, it is also a safety issue due to the amount of heat given off. It is almost too hot to touch. I do not get the same problem charging with a usb cable as I'm typing this on the phone while the usb is plugged in.

            A soft reset does not have any impact whatsoever on the phone's OS or on any of the apps that are installed on the phone. It's possible that to lose any unsaved data that you were working on or inputting into the phone when you performed the soft reset.

 last three characters are, all my A1Bs will be classified as "GroupA". Let me know what's possible, thanks!</p>

            You're probably going to have to be more specific than that. Canada used an A9A 9A9 format and GBR uses&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;of the following &nbsp;AA9A 9AA,&nbsp;A9A 9AA,&nbsp;A9 9AA,&nbsp;A99 9AA,&nbsp;AA9 9AA&nbsp;or&nbsp;AA99 9AA formats. Depending upon the international area of concern, this
 can get pretty detailed.

<p>
</p><p>I am used to Hyper-V and it uses it's own display driver, which can extend up to the full-screen resolution of my desktop monitor (2560x1600). Also there is a way to use my graphics adapter more specifically in the Hyper-V Virtual Machine (shown below) although
 I have never tried it.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft scam &#33;&#33;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been getting invoices charged to my card for $12 per month.When I rang Microsoft, they EVENTUALLY told me it was a subscription</p>
<p>charge.They told me i had a one month trial that then converted to a monthly charge.</p>
<p>I asked for proof of an authorisation for a subscription and i was told to come to this location !!! Great service NOT.</p>
<p>The operator could not tell me what the charge was for from THEIR tax invoice number or even the ID # on the receipt.Which I find astounding.</p>
<p>I had to give him my credit card details, again. I still have not been told how they got my card details.!!</p>
<p>They agreed to cancel the subscription, a months worth of charge (WOW)&nbsp;</p>
<p>So whomever from Microsoft is reading this I want proof of subscription authorisation.</p>
<p>I also wonder how many others are being snipped $12 a month- not a lot, but surely a nice little un-authorised earner !!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately you would not like my reply either.</p>
<p>Problem here, is that members of the community have no link what so ever with MS, especially related to issues with MS Billing.</p>
<p>MS representatives hardly if ever post on look into these forums.</p>
<p>The only option is to cancel the subscription and or speak to a supervisor at Microsoft over phone.</p>

<p>Sorry I missed your earlier replies, but you seem to have gotten there in the end. To answer your question about the formatting of the TOC, the formatting of a TOC entry is based on the relevant style (TOC 1, TOC 2, etc.), but the entry also picks up direct
 formatting from the referenced heading. Direct formatting is any formatting not prescribed by the heading style. This behavior is by design, so that, for example, italics in a bold roman heading (for emphasis or for a title) are retained in the TOC entry.
 See <a href="http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/TOCTips.htm#DirectFormatting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/TOCTips.htm#DirectFormatting</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>A common problem, however, is with capitalized headings. The correct way to have a heading in all caps is to include the All Caps property in the heading style. When you do that, no matter how you type the heading, it will be in all caps. The downside to
 that is that, if you type it all lowercase, that's how it will appear in the TOC. Or if you turn on Caps Lock and type the heading, it will be in all caps (rather than caps and lowercase) in the TOC. Any other random capitalization will also be reflected.
 I have an All Caps toggle button on my toolbar so that I can toggle the property off and back on in capitalized headings to make sure that they have been capitalized properly, so that they will appear properly in the TOC.</p>

<p>By default, a table of contents in Word only includes heading levels 1, 2, and 3. Which heading styles have been applied to text paragraphs on page 71 onwards?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, note that the scope of a TOC may be limited by a bookmark, which may or may not be relevant here.</p>

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using&nbsp;browser to create group in outlook.com and I find that I cannot create any. It seems that the search function during the group-list creation does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example my address book has many people called Vincent as shown:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fc944b1-1695-40ce-ae11-2ae0fa0bcd38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fc944b1-1695-40ce-ae11-2ae0fa0bcd38" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But I cannot find any during the group-list creation!</p>

<h2>            Working on different sheets or workbooks in separate monitors</h2>
                    <p>I would like to know whether it is possible for one to work on (i) different sheets in one workbook, or (ii) different workbooks/files, with for example sheet or workbook appearing and edited in/through one monitor
 and another sheet or workbook in/through another monitor etc etc.</p>
<p>I have tried to drag individual sheets or workbooks from one monitor to another but all the sheets/workbooks move rather than the ones that I would want to move. This
 evidently undermines the efficiency that one can attain with the use of multiple monitors.</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards</p>

            1: kinda, <br />
2: yes, but it's not easy<br />
<br />
There have nearly been "religious wars" about whether "MDI" (multiple docs, 1 app window) or "SDI" (single doc per app window) is better.&nbsp; Too bad Office is schizophrenic, both types of design on different apps in the same office bundle.<br />
<br />
Word is SDI, Excel is MDI, as you've found, except there are techniques to beat it into submission.<br />
<br />
In Excel in a single spreadsheet you can use View tab &gt; Window group &gt; New Window button to "split" the current worksheet into 2 "windows" (sorta). You can then use View tab &gt; Window group &gt; Arrange All &gt; tiled option to display the now 2 views on the same
 spreadsheet in the application window. You can now look independently at different worksheets or different parts of the same worksheet. You can stretch the application window across the 2 monitors. It just gets a little tricky lining things up if they are
 using different screen resolutions or orientation (I like one landscape and one portrait).<br />
<br />
Here are some tips that have worked for me to allow me to open spreadsheets in separate "SDI" windows. These are tips that have been submitted by a few different people:<br />
<br />
<div>
<b><span>Change MDI to SDI</span></b>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-excel/i-want-to-open-2-excel-files-in-separate-windows/f7588d9a-3c41-466f-8f01-3b6ab9661ae3?page=21&amp;tm=1345702575157#footer">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-excel/i-want-to-open-2-excel-files-in-separate-windows/f7588d9a-3c41-466f-8f01-3b6ab9661ae3?page=21&amp;tm=1345702575157#footer</a>
</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<span>This is a partial fix. It will start separate Windows from the Start menu, but not if you use “File &gt; New” or “File &gt; Open”.</span></p>
<p><span>the solution involves making little changes in the registry so i recommend making
<b>back up</b> for just in case:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>start &gt; run &gt; regedit, navigate to:</span></p>
<div>
<p>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/Excel.Sheet.8/shell/Open/commend:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double Click on the “Default” key and add to end of the string so it looks like:</span></p>
<div>
<p>
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\EXCEL.EXE" /e "%1"</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right Click on “Command” key</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>choose "rename" and add something to the name&nbsp; - for example 2 (command2).
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Navigate to
</span></p>
<div>
<p>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/Excel.Sheet.8/shell/Open/ddeexec:</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right Click on the folder ddeexec and choose "rename" and add something to the name&nbsp; - for example 2 (ddeexec2)</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Navigate to
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/Excel.Sheet.12/shell/Open/commend:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double Click on the “Default” key and add to end of the string so it looks like:</span></p>
<div>
<p>
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\EXCEL.EXE" /e "%1"</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right Click on “Command” key</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>choose "rename" and add something to the name&nbsp; - for example 2 (commend2).</span></p>
<p><span>no restart needed</span></p>
<p><span>Have Fun</span></p>
<p>It works with Office 2010 also. Just change ref from "Office 12" to "Office 14"</p>
<b><span>Alternate Solution MDI to SDI</span></b>
<p>Create a shortcut in the “SendTo” for Excel.EXE, ie</p>
<div>
<p>
C:\Users\ &nbsp; [your user name] &nbsp;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo</p>
<p>Now you can open the Excel-files in SDI by right click &gt; send to &gt; MS Excel (it appears to be a functional equivalent to opening the second Excel session using the Start menu</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: I tried this tip AFTER making the registry change above, so I don’t know if the 2 tips have to both be applied together.</p>
<p>****************************</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>I have tried this<span>&nbsp; </span>too -- I run multiple monitors, and I want to be able to have ONE sheet of a workbook open on one monitor, and another open on the other. Tired old eyes work better this way sometimes!<br />
<br />
BUT... I could not get this to work, and even when I'd tell Windows to set the displays to extended desktop, and manually stretch the EXCEL main window to cover both, I get toolbars and tabs on one monitor, and none on the other.<br />
<br />
I tried doing a double-open -- open the file once, then open a second time -- but it opens it in the same main Windows window, does not let me drag it aside as some of these posts suggest.<br />
<br />
So I went in to GODMODE, and found the ASSOCIATE FILETYPE WITH PROTOCOL OR PROGRAM menu, and noticed that filetype XLSX was associated with Microsoft Open XML Converter, and NOT with EXCEL itself (like the .xls files are).&nbsp; I changed this back to EXCEL, and
 now each double-click on an XLSX file causes a separate instance of EXCEL to start in a separate window.<br />
<br />
So my question: why was that default file type set to the XML converter? And... how can I get ONE copy of EXCEL to let me take a SHEET in a workbook and open it in a separate window that I can place OUTSIDE of the Excel window itself (in a second copy of the
 excel main window)? <span>&nbsp;</span>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>

</p><p>A hotel Wi-Fi Internet connection is considered a public Internet connection.&nbsp; It is possible that it is not secure enough which is why you are getting the aforementioned error message on your Windows Phone. However, this statement may not apply to you since
 your initial post implied that you are able to retrieve your emails on your other devices using the said Internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to soft reset your phone while you are connected to the hotel's Wi-Fi Internet connection? If you have not, please press and hold the
<strong>Volume down</strong> + <strong>Power </strong>buttons on your phone for ten to fifteen seconds or until it vibrates and it should automatically restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, you may take a screenshot on your Microsoft Lumia Phone by pressing the
<strong>Volume up</strong> + <strong>Power</strong> buttons simultaneously. If you see the error on your phone again, please take a screenshot of it.</p>

<h2>            Calendar not syncing - Fine between 2 x PC&#39;s but not syncing on my MS Mobile - All using W10</h2>
                    <p>I am using the same MS Outlook account on all of my devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP PC using W10 (upgraded from W8.1) and a HP Laptop using W10.&nbsp; The calendar syncs with no issues between these devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a MS phone using W10 (upgraded from W8.1).&nbsp; Until a few months ago there were no issues with syncing the calendar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is causing some issues as, obviously, I do not have all my devices with me continuously and not having the calendar on my phone is not helpful. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all of the settings and they have not changed since I set them up almost 2 years ago on all of my devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            contacts in people pane are not in alphabetical order</h2>
                    i upgraded from office 2010 x64 to office 2013 x64 but my contacts in the people pane are not in alphabetical order. if i click the 'cd' on the side it skips the first contact that starts with a C and jumps another couple of spots down to the 2nd contact
 that starts with a C. i cant see any option to sort the people list by alphabetical order. if i click on 'By Catagiory' or 'Card' the contacts are sorted correctly. i searched google and couldnt find anything about sorting the people list. im hoping i dont
 have to delete every contact and start again. that would be very annoying. i took a screen shot of what im talking about. thanks<br />

            now that im looking at it again it appears its trying to sort by the last name. i didnt realize this before because some of the last names are not in alphabetical order. so its still not right. if its going to sort by last name it should be LAST, FIRST
 not FIRST LAST. pretty bad design. anyway to change the sort from first to last name?<br />

<p>Great dataset!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like a dataset such as this one to help my students learn Excel pivot tables and such. How did you manage to make such a beautiful dataset?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all your work! If you have any datasets such as this one that are suitable for working with basic statistical options in Excel could you please let me know?</p>

<p>Hi FySoX,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are welcome to use my database.&nbsp; I prefer that you have students upload it so I can keep track of how much it is downloaded, to determine if it is worth my time to maintain.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I collected data from many sources, some online, some from books.&nbsp; I also spend many hours each Olympics getting the latest results from the official Olympic websites.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the info required extensive research - for example, athletes born before 1900
 have no ages at the offical Olympic website, they are all listed as born on 1/1/1900.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a little creativity one can think up statistical questions for the Olympic database, maybe not for all 149 statistical functions, but for many.&nbsp; There are lots of small dataset on the internet, but intermediate size ones like mine or really big ones
 are more challenging to find.&nbsp; For example, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know that NASA provides datasets from some of its missions.&nbsp; You can Google "nasa datasets" and then go exploring.&nbsp; The WHO has a number of datasets
 as do most states and countries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shane Devenshire</p>
