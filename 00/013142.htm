<h2>            Distortion of text size upon printing when grouped with an image</h2>
                    <p>Hi technical support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since the most recent Microsoft word update (16.16), I have been experiencing font distortion of textboxes upon printing. It only occurs when I use the "group" function to connect 2 text boxes or a text box to an image. On my computer screen, the font
 looks normal, but when I print it, the text is hugely enlarged and mostly cut off the page. The font also looks distorted in print preview mode. Switching font types from Arial to Calibri or Times New Roman did not fix the issue. I use Word 2016 for Mac.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help with this issue. Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jackie</p>
<p />

    <title>Unreliable OneDrive for business&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> labsyboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unreliable OneDrive for business&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>our small company recently switched from Google Drive shared documents to MS OneDrive for Business. I've configured each user's OneDrive with his/her Offcie365 account on 2 computers: desktop PC in office and a LAPTOP.</p>
<p>OneDrive sucessfully created the folder under <strong>C:\Users\%username%\OneDrive-CompanyName Ltd</strong> with shared content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All seems fine, until some users started using the same Excel file on both computers. Users know, they need to CLOSE file on one computer to be fully accessible on another, so they are doing this...</p>
<p><strong>...BUT sync is totally unreliable.</strong></p>
<p>Even after 1 day the changed file on one computer is not reflected to OneDrive on another computer??!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed under OneDrive cloud icon in taskbar there's exclamation mark, which if you open it says: "A file is in use by another application" and if you click on this, it is about THE PROBLEMATIC file.</p>
<p>But the simultaneous file open on both computers happened 2 days ago! Now this file is now closed on both computers for more than 1 day, and 1 computer also was rebooted since at least once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does this mean? Paused sync conflict does not retry or cure itself?</p>
<p><strong>Does it mean, that once simultaneous open/conflict occurs, file sync for this particular file is PAUSED until you do...something?</strong></p>
<p>What you need to do?</p>
<p>There's no "Resolve conflict" action to intervene.</p>
<p>Whatever I tried, this file is not out of sync and I cannot resync them, unless I break whole OneDrive setup, and resync whole 200GB back again.</p>
<p>I've never had such problems with Google Drive in past 5 years, and I was syncing 100GB of documents between 3 computers.</p>
<p>Is OneDrive really so unrealiable, not being able to resolve sync problems by itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW...I have 100/100 Mbps fibre Optic link on both sides, with 2-5ms ping latency from home to office. So it's definitelly NOT poor link guilty.</p>

<p>Hi Labsyboy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused by OneDrive for Business on your end. We would gladly assist you in resolving the issue you are experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, due to the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-autosave-6d6bd723-ebfd-4e40-b5f6-ae6e8088f7a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AutoSave feature</a>, the workbook should be allowed to be edited by multiple users and synced in the real time regardless closing the file or not . It's called
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/collaborate-on-excel-workbooks-at-the-same-time-with-co-authoring-7152aa8b-b791-414c-a3bb-3024e46fb104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
co-authoring</a>. However, seems your users have to close the workbook when they want to edit it in another computer.
<strong>Have they enabled AutoSave when they edit the files?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the situation, I would like to confirm if you are following the scenarios below:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario One:</strong></p>
<p>1.You share a folder with your users via OneDrive sharing.</p>
<p>2.You users like User A, User B and User C ,etc synced this shared folder from OneDrive web client to OneDrive sync client as shown in the figure:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/741a3d9d-8bae-4c46-bea7-27a9422bdd3d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/741a3d9d-8bae-4c46-bea7-27a9422bdd3d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>3.After that your users A, B and C can work in the same workbook (like Book222.xlsx) on their end. But they cannot edit this workbook in the real time with the different computers, which causes the issue that this workbook has been syncing all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Scenario Two:</strong></p>
<p>1.You configure OneDrive sync client both on users' computers as below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad42192a-f725-4c5a-862f-640d69e1450e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad42192a-f725-4c5a-862f-640d69e1450e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>2. When the user starts to open a workbook on his computer. it works fine. But if the user starts using the same workbook on his laptop, even if this workbook was closed on the computer, the content of the workbook cannot be synced with that on his laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer think that you are mentioning <strong>the Scenario Two</strong>. For any misunderstanding, feel free to point it out. While co-authoring should take effect both in scenario one and two. So&nbsp;<span><strong>simultaneous open won't cause the conflict&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>theorigically.
</strong><span>As <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/collaborate-on-excel-workbooks-at-the-same-time-with-co-authoring-7152aa8b-b791-414c-a3bb-3024e46fb104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
co-authoring </a>mentioned, please check if you are using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/update-history-office365-proplus-by-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the latest version of Office </a>. (Open Excel &gt;File &gt;Account to check the version.)&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>The synchronization is automatic unless there is something wrong with the process.
</span>If the issue only affects the certain workbook, we would suggest you re-upload it via OneDrive web clent in any browser to check if it can be synced correctly. If the issue persists, could you share the screenshot of error message with us to better understand
 this situation? <span>Please also share your current OneDrive version with us. (Click OneDrive icon &gt;Settings &gt;About)</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>For any concerns, feel free to let us know.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            Below are general troubleshooting steps to solve various problems in Excel. Try them one by one and check the result after each step -<br />
<br />
1. Update your office as well as Windows 10 to latest patches from Microsoft site. Microsoft keeping releasing Office and Windows 10 patches to correct known errors. If Feb 10, 2016 update (KB3114717) is installed, this should be uninstalled.<br />
<br />
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-Office-and-your-computer-with-Microsoft-Update-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5<br />
<br />
2. Perform Quick Repair of the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
3. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
4. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
6. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
7. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
8. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
9. Issues in Protected View<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
(For reference, You may review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54)<br />
<br />
10. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
11. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
12. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
13. If above don't solve your problem, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license
 keys ready before you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

    <title>What steps should I follow to delete and then redo headers, section - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pccostello  say:</h3>
<h2>            What steps should I follow to delete and then redo headers, section breaks, and page numbering in a very long document  &#40;400 pages&#41; without disturbing paragraph formatting and styles&#63;</h2>
                    What steps should I follow to delete and then redo headers, section breaks, and page numbering in a very long document&nbsp; (400 pages) without disturbing paragraph formatting, headings, styles, font, etc?<br />
<br />
I have finished writing a very long document that I would like to submit online today. However, the headers and section&nbsp; breaks are chaotic, as is the page numbering, with some adjacent chapters being numbered together and other chapters numbered independently.
<br />
<br />
I would like the page numbering to be continuous for the overall document and the headers to change with the beginning of each new chapter. There are 11 chapters.<br />
<br />
What I think I need help with isa set of steps to strip out and then re-establish section breaks and to re-do the headers that would go with each chapter.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for you help.<br />
<br />
Peter. <br />

            <p>Nothing you do with headers, page numbering, or section breaks will affect paragraph formatting. You can easily delete all section breaks at one go by searching for ^b and replacing with nothing. This will automatically get rid of all your headers except
 those in the last section, along with any page number field that is there, and page numbering will be continuous throughout the document. If you restarted it at any point, you may need to go to the Page Number Format dialog and change it to "Continue from
 previous section" (which is the default for a single-section document).</p>
<p>If what you want to change in the header at the beginning of each chapter is just the chapter number or title, you can accomplish this with a StyleRef field (see
<span><a href="http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/StyleRef.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://WordFAQs.mvps.org/StyleRef.htm</a>), but if you're submitting the document for publication and it's going to be printed just the way you submit it, then you need to do more because
 you won't want a header on the first page of the chapter.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>You can still use the StyleRef field (this will save you from having to unlink headers and run into possible page numbering issues), but you will need some section breaks.</span>
</li><li><span>Start by enabling Different First Page in your one remaining section. This will become the default setting for any new sections you create.</span>
</li><li><span>Then, at the beginning of each chapter, insert a Next Page (or Odd Page) break, so that the chapter will begin on a new page.</span>
</li><li><span>Leave the First Page Header empty.</span> </li><li><span>If the remaining Header is what you want, then you're done, but if you want different running heads on recto and verso (odd and even) pages, or if you want the page number on the outside of the page, then you'll need to also enable Different Odd and
 Even Pages and create content for the Even Page Header (the primary Header will become the Odd Page Header). Unlike Different First Page, which can be turned on or off for a given section, Different Odd and Even affects the entire document.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>When I'm formatting books, I generally find it easier to put the page&nbsp;number in the footer (centered on every page), leave the First Page Header empty, and have different content (author and book title, author and chapter title, book title and chapter
 title) in the odd and even headers, but you can also place the page number at the outside of the odd and even headers along with whatever other content you include.</span></p>
<p><span>If this is a book, you might also want to look at <span>

            So did you backup the drive before formatting?&nbsp; If so go into that backup and restore the certificate.&nbsp; If the machine was formatted without backup - hence the drive contents are lost - then you aren't going to get access to encrypted files, that's the
 whole intention of encryption.

    <title>Excel 2007&#58; Print Jobs Truncated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atd_2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2007&#58; Print Jobs Truncated</h2>
                    
<p>Print jobs from Excel will truncate at random points in the document when printing to a printer or Adobe pdf.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, half of a page will print, then the remainder of the document will be blank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the&nbsp;document is setup correctly, because it has printed correctly in the past.&nbsp; It also&nbsp;displays&nbsp;correctly&nbsp;in the print preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a print range problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error occurs sporadically, and is&nbsp;usually fixed by closing down Excel and reopening.&nbsp; I am now experiencing the error with more&nbsp;frequency, and the restart&nbsp;does not fix the&nbsp;problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard issues you mentioned are well known bugs and Microsoft has stated they will be fixed in a future build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer issue is likely a driver issue. Most hardware manufacturers will not update their drivers until a stable version of the preview is available.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Add A Generic Folder</h2>
                    <p>I monitor dive email addresses in my Outlook 2013. I have created a folder that I want to use as a holding folder for mail from any of the five addresses but I can only add mail from the address that I created the folder under. The folder permissions icon
 is greyed out and I don''t know how to activate it so that I can share this folder with the other email addresses. I don't want to create 5 holding folders. Rules are supposed to move specific emails to the holding folder. How can I have just one holding folder
 to accommodate all the email addresses? I also have Office 365.</p>

            <p>The main email account is on Office 365 home premium and belongs to only me. I am not on any other network. I have added four more accounts on Outlook 2013. All I want to do is create one folder that I can move emails from all these email accounts and save
 them for future use. All the added accounts are IMAPS and GMAILS and located from within Outlook. I had a similar folder in Outlook 2010 that worked perfectly but I can't reproduce in 2013.</p>

            <p>You have seperate data folders apparently configured as IMAP for each of your mail accounts, you can perhaps create a folder in the Outlook Personal Folder data file (the pst file) then use rules to move/copy whatever to this folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had added the mail accounts as pop you could have had a single data file for all the accounts, rather than seperate data files. Of course this may not be ideal if you wish to view the accounts on other devices</p>

<p>When I created O2013 Outlook personal was there but I deleted it from O2013 as I didn't think that I would need it. I did, however, keep the outlook.pst file. I put it back into the Outlook folder along with the other *.ost files for the newly created IMAP
 email addresses. Is there a way to access the Outlook.pst file once again into O2013?</p>

            <p>Well, it turns out that it is not necessarily IMAP but maybe GMAIL that is the culprit. I have one IMAP email account that is a Compuserve (yes Compuserve) account and I was able to create a folder under that account that works fine. Moving on now to the
 next challenge.</p>

            <p>There are two issues here.&nbsp; First, I don't believe a delete query in Access can delete from more than one query at a time, so you would have to run two separate queries:&nbsp; one to delete from GuardiansAndContacts, and one to delete from Students_GuardiansAndContacts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, when you use CurrentDb.Execute to run a query, you're using pure DAO, rather than Access, to do it, and DAO doesn't know about forms and controls on forms.&nbsp; So, since you are building the SQL for the delete query in code anyway, what you can do is
 build the literal value of the StudentID directly into the SQL, in place of the reference to the control on the form.&nbsp; Your code might look like this (assuming that StudentID is a numeric field:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'------ start of code ------</p>
<p>Dim varStudentID As Variant<br />
<br />
' Capture Student ID from the form<br />
varStudentID = Forms!frmStudentInformation!StudentID<br />
<br />
With CurrentDb<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Delete from GuardiansAndContacts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Execute _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "DELETE GuardiansAndContacts.* FROM GuardiansAndContacts INNER JOIN Students_GuardiansAndContacts " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "ON GuardiansAndContacts.ID = Students_GuardiansAndContacts.GuardianID " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "WHERE Students_GuardiansAndContacts.StudentID = " &amp; varStudentID, _<br />

            It's not a bug it is because you needed to upgrade to the newest build as this issue has been posted on here for the last two weeks, as an Insider we are to keep up with the program by reading feedback and forums for any changes as the insiders version
 is not meant for everyday computing it is a testing program for beta software.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Ria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>One of the possible reasons could be that the people who send you email might receive an error message that your inbox is full.
</span><span><span>For us to fully identify the root cause, we need to get additional information. Please answer these questions:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span>What's the domain of your account?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Are you using an Exchange, IMAP or POP account?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Did you check your Junk emails or spam folders?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Have you tried other browsers and see if the same issue persists?</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile, you may follow the troubleshooting steps provided on this link:

            It was possible that my Inbox was full, so I deleted many, many email messages, but I am still not receiving some. I don't know the domain, and I don't think I have a domain account. &nbsp; Looks like IMAP is used. &nbsp;All of the messages i'm not getting go straight
 into the deleted emails. &nbsp;

<h2>            Macros for Email templates in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have no experience with writing macros. I'd like to create a series of buttons within an Outlook ribbon for email templates that are part of regular workflow process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These will be a series of "Thank you" emails, invitations,&nbsp;etc that will be used very regularly and would be great to have them pre-populate an email at the click of a button.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already found the how-to's on adding the macro, the buttons, and customizing the ribbons in &nbsp;Outlook. Now I just need the code! :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion would be very much appreciated. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

    <title>excel 2013 will not print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valmoody  say:</h3>
<h2>            excel 2013 will not print</h2>
                    I have not been able to print from Excel on any printer, I used to but it has stopped working.&nbsp; I can print with all other programs i.e word, power point etc.&nbsp; I can see the print preview, but when I ask it to print I get the sign/notification 'now printing'
 to the printer, but it just disappears and does not print.<br />
<br />
I am running  on Microsoft Windows 7 home premium<br />
At the moment I have to copy and paste to word to print.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help using plain language as not very computer literate. Thanks <br />

After a google search , see this one <br />
http://help.wugnet.com/office/Excel-print-ftopict1110872.html<br />

Changing/Lower the print setting quality (draft or every day printing and not Hight qualit) seems to help.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I know from other post that printing was causing an issue with Window 7.<br />
See if you could get an updated printer driver. Check on the website of your printer manufacture for Window 7 printer driver.<br />

            Hi JY<br />
<br />
I have done that with no avail, Excel will not print on any computer, but other programs such as word, Powerpoint etc do. I feel it is something to do with excel and not the printer, but don't know what.<br />
<br />
Thanks Val<br />

            Hi<br />
<br />
Two options : either the printer or the XL Application<br />
From XL, you could try to get a free Print to PDF program and see if its works ( if yes, its the printer driver)<br />
<br />
For XL, try repair office, or even un install all office and install again.<br />
For the printer, re- install the printer driver<br />
<br />
No more ideas <br />
<br />

            <p>After days of searching for the reason behind this error on my computer, I was able to find a solution that was a little different, but I'm sure it had to do with Excel 2013 printer settings, where I had this file with an older Excel version macro that reduces
 a certain row's height to zero if it's empty,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Rows("20").RowHeight = 0</strong><br />
<br />
which was creating the error, so I changed it to the following and that fixed the problem;<br />
<br />
<strong>Rows("20").EntireRow.Hidden = True</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works for someone. Thanks.</p>

<p>After getting frustrated, I solved the issue on my end by deleting the Printer associated with my computer.&nbsp; I then searched and installed the printer again.&nbsp; I can now print from Excel 2013 with no problem.&nbsp; Hope that helps, Microsoft is a little slow in
 helping from the corporate side of house.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Number lines in text field of a form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrissy2391  say:</h3>
<h2>            Number lines in text field of a form</h2>
                    <p>In Word 2010, I have a form that users are supposed to type in and number their various observations in a text form field. The problem I am having is that when they type 1. in the text field, the automatic numbering takes over which is fine but when you
 press enter and type a 2. it isn't automatically numbered so the indentation is off (see below).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c100af8e-997f-46cf-83e9-b34856c87f09" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this form will be filled out on hundreds of different machines, turning off automatic numbering in the autocorrect options will not work. I created a custom style so I could apply it when in the Content Control Properties box but it isn't listed when
 I check the box to "Use a style to format contents".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, how do I allow users to number their observations in the text form fields without automatic numbering kicking in or apply my number style to the field?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

                    When typing a message in Microsoft Outlook 2016 there is a bug that shows a ghosting of a letter to the right of the cursor as you type quickly. It does not happen in Word or Excel and only Outlook. It is hard to explain, other than that as I type, it
 seems the speed of input is too fast in that it is showing a letter just past the cursor (to the right of the cursor) as I type, instead of the cursor always leading in front to the right of any letters. It is making things very confusing for me as I type.
 I tried 'repairing' Outlook, and also did a clean uninstall and reinstall. I rebooted my Dell Latitude Laptop running Windows 10 several times as well. It appears to be isolated to Outlook only. Please advise.

            Yes, and always have. No prior issues, and this bug began after a recent MS Office update about a week ago.

            Microsoft knows of this problem and an update fixing it should be out this month. For now, you can remove the image or roll back the update.

            Great, what about an update to make the ridiculously oversized email headers smaller/less tall when reading pane is at the bottom?

<h2>            Corruption in styles gallery MS Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a number of new templates, all using fresh styles, and not amending MS words set ones.&nbsp; Every time I open the template, or a new document based on one of the templates - the top line of the styles bar, which should be the "clear all" gets
 corrupted with one of the styles in my document, and looks like the below with loads of weird characters (although it does still work!).&nbsp; I am just introducing new styled templates to my colleagues and so want to present the best possible impression. I have
 also created a 3 level bullets list, and again although the icon for my bullets is there when I apply the style, you cannot see it in the styles gallery - it used to be there, but has disappeared at some point and now never appears.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only recently working with templates again - and am new to Microsoft 10 pro and Word 2016 - but have worked with templates for a number of years previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>look forward to any reply - thank you</p>

<h2>            Bing Tranlslation API with SharePoint Online</h2>
                    I have seen articles saying that we can use Bing Translation APIs for English to French translation on SharePoint Online sites. I want to know how to set this up so we can see how it works. Is there anyone currently using this? If so, how do you set it
 up?

                    I cannot locate the icon/ icons that allow me to make a skype to skype free call. I have not used skype in 2-3 years and have just reinstalled it with new code numbers for my microsoft account and for my skype account with new passwords. &nbsp;Can you check
 my account and see if anything is wrong or tell me where to go to get the call icon which use to be so very easy to use? &nbsp;GE
