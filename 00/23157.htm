<h2>            Not Receiving Emails</h2>
                    The last email I received was from Friday 1/12. I know I have been sent emails today and over the weekend but nothing seems to be working? I have the latest update for Outlook 365 on my computer.&nbsp;

<h2>            E52 Firmware &#38;quot&#59;no update available&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>I have an E52 with last years firmware...everytime I try to update it with PC suite it checks and says "no updates available" which is nonsense as there have been a few since then. I am in the US using a simple plan card so cannot afford to try OTA updating
 but that never worked for me before either. Does anyone know how to get PC suite to do it's job? OVI was worse, wouldn't even connect to the server to check, and I deleted it and went back to PC suite for the rest of my needs. Cannot get map updates either
 because of the screwed up non connecting anything.&nbsp; I love the E52 but all the support software and services suck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone is unlocked and I have updated it in the past with PC suite. It just hasn't worked since then for updating.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pay attention to what DonAndress said.</p>
<p>Nokia firmware versions are market-specific.</p>
<p>This specificity is implied by the device's Product Code (printed on the label beneath the battery).</p>
<p>Nokia Software Updater reads your Product Code and may decide that, as yet, no new firmware suits your device.</p>
<p>That is the way it works.</p>

My E51 is at firmware version 300.34.56, has Product Code 0556431, and NSU will select none of the two newer versions that have been released since December 2008.</p>

 to you going to Nokia service. Got ony problem with what we do here - get the heck out and don't ever bother us again!</p>

<p>and see exactly what firmware version is available for your model...then click on the "can I update" which will direct you to a new page and will prompt you for the "product code" of your E52. After you enter the product code and hit "GO" you will know which
 firmware version is available for your product code.</p>

<p>Dude, read your posts. It is you who sounds like a little kid, who did not get a lolipop and now is widely offended and stamps his feet to get what he wants. It's not me who needs to grow up.</p>
<br />
<p>Nokia has a certain policy with a Product Code. Oh and look, it wasn't only me who told you about it. Pity you have a **bleep** service in your city. In mine it's quite ok and I can't complain. And for that - yes, I think it was a good advice.</p>
<br />
<p>Next time maybe use your head, read before you buy and eventually buy something else then Nokia if you don't like it. Noone forces you.</p>

            If Word had crashed, and then you reopen it then it <em>might</em> prompt you to recover the document. If this isn't the case and you didn't save, then unfortunately the work you did is gone.

<h3> toopersistent  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 - Quickstep is able to send items to a folder I can&#39;t see in my folder list</h2>
                    <p>I have several pst files open in outlook and a pst file seems to have disappeared. &nbsp;I can't find it on any of my drives and I don't see it on my folder list, but I have evidence it still has contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick steps is undoubtedly sending files to the hidden pst file. &nbsp;I just sent an email to a folder in the hidden pst file using quick steps. &nbsp;When I search for the email using the search box and selecting "All Mailboxes", it can't find emails that are in
 that pst file/folder. &nbsp;HOWEVER when I right-click on the quickstep and choose "Go to", the folder and it's contents are all there including the email I just placed there using quicksteps. &nbsp;I added "IN FOLDER" to the visible fields and it is blank (but that's
 always the case for the current folder, so that was no help). &nbsp;When I search for items in that folder while I'm in the folder, and I can see all of the emails in the folder before the search, but the search results are always "We couldn't find what you are
 looking for" even when the search window has the obvious (I tried various words and even the letter "a"). &nbsp;I use file view and expanded every pst file and every folder in the pst file and searched the deleted items of each pst file and cannot find the folder
 or pst file. &nbsp;I rebooted my machine and repeated the expansion of the pst files and folders, but the pst file is still not visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To save what I could see, I created a new pst and folder of similar names and though I can't see the folder in my pst/folder list, and though I can't find the items with a search, and though the only way to see the folder's contents was to use the "go to"
 option in quicksteps, I was able to move all of the emails to the new folder in the new pst. &nbsp;My problem is that I had other folders in that pst that I need to capture. &nbsp;How do I unhide the hidden pst file, and what did I do to cause this and what do I do
 to fix and prevent this? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There could either some settings that need to be configured or changed. We'd like to know more information so we could provide an accurate resolution. Kindly answer the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue? </li><li>How's your account configured, are you using POP3, IMAP, or Exchange? </li></ul>
<p>

<p><span>In response to your clarifying question:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>There were two changes to my computer prior to this issue:</span></p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span>My workplace installed the latest Windows patch last week</span></li><li>
<span>I created several new .pst files and moved emails into&nbsp;them from&nbsp;a very large .pst file.&nbsp; The Quick Step should not have been impacted by this change (at least intentionally).</span></li></ul>
<li>
<span>My account is Exchange.&nbsp; The .pst files are local, not on the main server.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>I'm curious, is there a way to see specifically where one of the "Quick Steps" is pointing?</span></p>
<p><span>In the event you need to know, I'm using Windows 7 Professional, Mircorsoft Windows Version 6.1 (Build 7601: Service Pack 1).&nbsp; Thank you.</span></p>

            Yes, the options are there to edit, and they show the name of the pst file and subfolder that the Quick Step is pointing to. &nbsp;However, I cannot find the folder that my Quick Step is pointing to in my Outlook folder list when I am in folder view. &nbsp;There
 are other folders that are in the .pst file that Quick Step targets, but since I don't have Quick Steps pointing to the other folders in that .pst file, I cannot get to emails in them.

            Yes, I downloaded and installed Outlook for Android from playstore and set up my corporate 0365 account on it. I want to Sync all local phone contacts also google contacts if possible? I am not sure how to tell if my account is Outlook.com or Exchange.

            Try connecting without installing Outlook for Android. Open Settings&gt;Accounts&gt;Add Account&gt;Corporate and supply the information requested. This works for me. I use the built-in Mail, Contacts, and Calendar apps and all my data syncs perfectly in both directions.

<p>Hi Erl Lazaro,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using outlook for Android, actually it’s not feasible to sync your phone contacts to your outlook contacts.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, you can vote your thought <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293346-outlook-for-android/suggestions/20035903-sync-contacts-in-phone-with-outlook-contacts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>Not able to&nbsp;synch with my bellsouth.net (a att&nbsp; yahoo mail account) It will&nbsp;download the messages but you&nbsp;it will continue to attempt to synch. If you try to download even a small download (30kb) part of the e-mail, it may take forever or not at all, and
 you get some type of error code such as above. Have deleted and put back in. Did a factory reset and still have the problem. Have the correct inbound and outbound addresses and am at a loss. Have called the internet provider and they say they have no problems.
 Verizon tried for 3 hours and could not figure it out. What is baffling is I am able send e-mails and messages do come to my phone but it is as if the phone has a mind of its own and will download messages. I deleted the Skype App as this has been a recommedation

            <p>From what I understand bellsouth.net uses the yahoo mail service and behaves exactly like a yahoo account, except for the actual email address which has bellsouth on it. There could be a problem in using a yahoo via bellsouth account on windows phone. I
 am guessing but there are quirky problems that exist on windows phone OS that almost nobody has a solution to. This could be one of those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have a solution for this but I do have a workaround.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we know that standard yahoo, outlook.com and Gmail accounts work just fine on windows phone, you could create an account in any one of these. Personally, I would recommend you try outlook.com. Then simply arrange for your emails to be forwarded to
 your new account. </p>

<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

    <title>Unable to change primary email address after implementing Azure AD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craigburke- &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to change primary email address after implementing Azure AD Sync</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We use Office 365 to host our email, previously we used AD Sync to sync users between our local AD environment and Office 365. This was effective for us, and like most customers, we noticed that if we didn't have any value in the proxyAddress attribute in
 our local AD that the user's default email account would be an ourorg.onmicrosoft.com address. However after entering the user's email within the proxyAddress attribute and re-syncing ourorg email address would show up as the default email in Office 365.</p>
<p>About 4 weeks ago we updated AD Sync to Azure AD Sync. Since then all new users created have a default email address of ourorg.onmicrosoft.com and many don't even hour our org's email as an alias, even though the AD attribute proxyAddress&nbsp;on our local AD
 has SMTP:user@ourorg entered.</p>
<p>I've had an open ticket for 3 weeks and Microsoft's Office 365 support has failed to make any change. Now I get a daily call that they are running procedures on the back end but any new users are unable to receive email at our org's email suffix.</p>
<p>Has anyone run into a similar issue or have suggestions to troubleshoot?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Craig</p>

<p>Hard to tell without being able to look at your setup. But there's an easy workaround for this - even though you are using dirsync, you can update the Primary SMTP address via EO remote PowerShell. The cmdlet you need is:</p>
<p>Set-Mailbox *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -WindowsEmailAddress *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>This will add *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as the Primary SMTP for the user, while preserving his old address as secondary alias. If you need to add multiple aliases just repeat the process. Again, this will work regardless of whether you are syncing with the local AD,
 but it's a good idea to have the issue with sync sorted as well.</p>

<p>Hi Craig,</p>
<p>Like what Vasil mentioned above, no matter whether you deployed AD sync in your AD, you can use Exchange remote PowerShell to set the Primary SMTP address. Meanwhile, I notice you opened a ticket with Microsoft support. Can you share the service request
 number via PM so that we can trace the status and process of it?&nbsp; Please click on the link below to access to your Private Message.<br />

            <p>Try the Network Reset in Settings and then Restart. Sometimes disabling and re-enabling the adapter will help. I have an old laptop that sometimes requires this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also use Device manager to remove and reinstall the Wi-Fi adapter, to try to set it to it's default settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are having the issue due to a weak signal, there may be something physically blocking the Wi-Fi, such as a large appliance or other electrical device. If possible, relocate the Wi-Fi router to a location that covers more of the area intended for use.
 There may also be a setting to increase the power output of the Wi-Fi signal from the router, although if it is physically very close, sometimes reducing that signal is better, to avoid interference with other Wi-Fi signals.</p>

<h2>            IE11 CSS animation please fix your shorthand</h2>
                    <p>I'm posting this since IE11 just wasted 4 hours of my time on CSS animation shorthand for paused and running:</p>
<p>
</p><p>re: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34809544/css3-animation-is-not-working-in-ie11-but-works-in-other-browsers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34809544/css3-animation-is-not-working-in-ie11-but-works-in-other-browsers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>IE11 always has a problem when setting <code>animation-play-state</code> as <code>
running</code> in the shorthand. There is no justification for this and it should probably be considered as a bug. Fix for this issue should be to just remove the
<code>running</code> from the shorthand.</p>

<h2>            Security Essentials stopped and Quarantined Exploit&#58;JS&#47;Blacole.GB</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 Home Premium and Security Essentials stopped and Quarantined Exploit:JS/Blacole.GB last night, so i ran a full scan to make sure all was well and nothing else came up, then i started system restore and looked at the last few restore points
 to see if there were any changes and i saw that Microsoft Antimalware Checkpoint was uninstalled at the exact same time that Security Essentials Quarantined Exploit:JS/Blacole.GB.&nbsp; So i selected a restore point from 2 days before that and restored to that
 point successfully.&nbsp; After that i opened Security Essentials and saw that the virus was still in quarantine.&nbsp; My question is will my laptop be ok or is there something else i should do?</p>
<p><br />
Thanks and have a great day.</p>

<p>System Restore does not revert the PC to an exact state in the past. It rolls back system changes to drivers and programs.</p>

            Thanks for this. However, if only it were that easy. That was the first thing I did but Picture Manger is not listed in the programmes when you do this. However, Picture Manager IS there in my pc as when I open Office 2010 it can be opened quite easily.
 I just can't find it anywhere on the list of programmes

                    <p>I am a teacher trying to create a lesson plan template in Word 2013 and am experiencing tremendous difficulties.&nbsp; I have created a 5-page document with a typed title at the top of each page (for each day of the school week) and a customized table following
 each table to type that day's lesson plans.&nbsp; Any suggestions for solving the following problems?&nbsp; I have tweaked with different settings, so it's difficult to say what all I've tried and haven't tried, as well as what settings are applied to which table currently.</p>
<ul>
<li>When I type in Monday's lesson plan table and it expands, the table breaks and rolls over onto page 2 of the document.&nbsp; (This is great).&nbsp; Tuesday's title and table roll&nbsp;over onto page 3 and everything else moves down.&nbsp; Once again, this is great.&nbsp; First
 picture is of normal plans.&nbsp; The second picture is of what happens when Monday's table must expand.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c63dceb-1f16-431c-999b-3e4831e90199" /></li></ul>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c04b383f-4556-4287-a361-63da1063f8a7" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The problem:&nbsp; when I type in Tuesday's lesson plan table to the point where it must expand, the "Tuesday" title is stranded at the top of the page, and the table is&nbsp;moved onto the following page.&nbsp; Furthermore, the "Wednesday" title&nbsp;is not&nbsp;sticking with
 the Wednesday table, but is now following the now-broken Tuesday table, with Wednesday's table stranded on the next page.&nbsp; Thursday and Friday's titles are also out of place at the bottom of inappropriate pages.&nbsp; This pictures&nbsp;are of what happens when Tuesday's
 table expands.</li></ul>

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/278644fd-5144-4394-952c-0d9e9172f68e" /></p>
<ul>
<li>I would&nbsp;love for my template to simply follow Monday's&nbsp;pattern --&nbsp;when a day's lesson plans grow too large&nbsp;to fit on one page, that that day's table simply expands and breaks into the next page, and all the other tables and titles neatly move down to the
 beginning of a new page.&nbsp; </li><li>Another option I would be fine with is to have EVERYTHING in the document -- titles, tables, and all&nbsp; -- simply move down as tables expand.&nbsp; Not having each day acting as an island, but the entire week's tables breaking and moving along down the&nbsp;pages as
 necessary.&nbsp; This effect actually happens when I type in Thursday's table (although Th.'s title still gets stranded)... possibly because Friday is the last page and doesn't have room to do anything inappropriate?&nbsp; This picture is of what happens when I type
 in Thursday's table.</li></ul>
<p>Thanks for any assistance!</p>

            <p>Doug-- Thanks so much... this helped a LOT!&nbsp; The tables are now breaking and flowing onto additional pages when they expand.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have one problem.&nbsp; When I type in Wed. and Thurs.' tables to the point that they must expand, both pages with the tables move down, leaving the title stranded on the original page.&nbsp; Monday, Tuesday, and Friday are working perfectly.&nbsp; Any additional
 suggestions?</p>

<h3> jaco171  say:</h3>
<h2>            2010 Outlook cannot connect to Incoming &#40;POP3&#41; E-Mail Server, Error Code 0x80042108</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem regarding my 2010 Outlook&nbsp; that cannot connect to Incoming (POP3) E-Mail Server since I have installed&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">a NETGEAR AC750 Wifi DSL Modem Router
 (D6000) to connect to my existing ISP. I have had some community discussions on the NETGEAR Website but that's going a bit in circles. I also contacted my ISP but the support from them is less than desired. I've Googled this topic just about to death and tried
 many suggestions but with not clear direction or answers as yet. I have even tried to repair my e-mail account, deleted and recreated it, uninstalled and reinstalled 2010 Outlook but with no joy.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">Apologies for the long discussion details but here's some history on how I ended up with zero e-mail connectivity which was also posted on the&nbsp;<span>NETGEAR
 Community Website.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">I have recently purchased and installed an AC750 Wifi DSL Modem Router (D6000), Firmware ver.V1.0.0.76_1.0.1.
 I cannot get 2010 Outlook to connect to the E-Mail Server of my ISP.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">I used to be able to connect with 2010 Outlook to my current ISP via a NETGEAR N300 Range Extender which
 was setup as a WAN Access Point. My current setup now is that I am using the D6000 as the WAN Router and the N300 as an extender to boost the WiFi signal to my lounge. This all works OK from an Internet Connection point of view. I can connect from any Device
 via WiFi to the Internet OK.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">2010 Outlook is installed on a Win7 Pro 64 bit Desktop PC which is connected via WiFi to the D6000. I
 did contact my ISP and they assured me that no settings on their side is preventing me from connecting to their E-Mail Server. I've made a 100% sure with the ISP that my 2010 Outlook settings, Mail Server Name and Password is correct. Internet E-Mail Settings
 for Port Numbers are; Incoming Server (POP3) : 110 and Outgoing Server (SMTP): 25. The xDSL Setting on the D6000 is setup for Ethernet WAN and my Internet connection is working just fine as mentioned before. I can see my ISP IP Address and can ping my ISP
 without any problems. Firewall Settings my Win7 Pro 64 bit Desktop PC did not change either. I am running Kaspersky Internet Security App on the Win7 PC but cannot see that any of the settings are affecting the connection to my ISP E-mail Server. In fact,
 for testing purposes, I have temporarily disabled both my Win7 Desktop PC Firewall and Kaspersky Firewall but still could not connect to my ISP E-mail Server.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">For testing purposes, I've setup my e-mail acount on my Microsoft LUMIA 950 (WINDOWS 10) phone and cannot
 connect via WiFi to my ISP E-Mail Server either, but if I disable WiFi on my phone and make use of my cell phone provider's data then I can connect to my ISP's Mail Server and receive and send e-mail without a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">With the above said, I have a suspicion that the problem could lie with the D6000 as it is the only common
 denominator that changed. Not sure if the problem could lie with the D6000's Port Forwarding/Triggering setup of which I have no idea on how to setup properly. Please can anybody shed some light on this topic in getting 2010 Outlook connected to my ISP again.
 The situation looks pretty much grim for me as the ISP and other company that sold me the D6000 kind of washed their hands with the whole issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">Much Appreciated;</span></p>

<h2>            Emails stuck in outbox &#38; calendar not saving appointments</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, when opening outlook in browser, I cannot receive emails or send them. They send, but then sit in my outbox with no notification to tell me they're there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still getting and able to send emails fine on my phone. Also, once I open the email on my phone it suddenly becomes visible on my desktop inbox as open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I am unable to save appointments in my calendar. I'm able to accept them fine and they show up. But if I am to make them myself, they save, then I navigate away from the appointment and then it disappears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>There is few factor why you cannot send an email and unable to save an appointment. There might be caused by a network connection, the browser that you are trying to use or the status of your email account. Before we proceed, we need to know the following

<h2>            MS Word - Built in Headings not working</h2>
                    <p>Good Day, I am hoping someone can help me</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem with my MS word, I am currently trying to format one of my reports for varsity so that I can use the automatic table of contents feature, and when I try select one of the preset/built-in heading styles (i.e. Heading 1) to format my
 headings and sub-headings then my text still remains as normal text and this is the same for all headings, Heading 1, 2 or 3 do not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite versed with MS word yet this is frustrating me, when manipulating the headings on my work laptop this works yet when trying to address this on my home pc it is not working, my MS is licensed so I do not see this as any issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was once an issue on this computer but I upgraded windows and reinstalled MS office and the issue seemed to go away, but it has now yet again arisen and I can not find any discussions or related posts on the net that is of any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue also still arises when creating a new word document, so this isnt just restricted to my one report on my home PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone perhaps can relate to this issue or can help me resolving this it would be much appreciated</p>

<p>At first I thought it might be a problem with the View option you selected. But when I tried to recreate it using all of the view options (in 2016) I could not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you create a small example file. Use the =rand() function to generate some filler text then apply the heading styles.&nbsp; Upload it so we can play with it.</p>

<p>Trouble shooting problems in files can be like a visit to the dentist, a long, slow painful process of us trying to “extract” the clues needed to recognize the problem in a back and forth flow of questions and answers so that we can come up with a / “the”
 solution.</p>

<p>Often it is faster and easier for everyone if we have a “sample file” get "hands on", to look at, and to “play with”.</p>

            Outline view with "Show Text Formatting" disabled shows all text in the Normal style, but the Home tab would still indicate the style chosen and the font formatting.

<p>If it not the outline view settings, my guess is that the headings are formatted to have the same font settings as normal text. This is done in some reports and could have been set into your normal template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you post a link to a sample document with all nine heading levels displayed it would be easy to check.</p>

            Hi Paul, how are you. Thanks for posting in our Microsoft Community. I suggest that you repair  office to resolve the issue. To do this follow these steps:
<br />-First open Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features 
<br />-Now click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications 
<br />-Then click Change &gt; And click Repair (choose the Online Repair)
<br />
<br />Hope above suggestion help you and good luck!       
        </p>

<p>Right click on the relevant Heading # style in the Styles Gallery and then on Modify and check the formatting of the Style in the Modify Style dialog.&nbsp; Make changes as necessary and then click on OK.&nbsp; Before doing that, you may want to select the radio button
 for "New documents based on this template"</p>

<p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your advise,</p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What I have noticed is that somehow, the font of the custom styles has changed as well as the formatting, i have not modified the built in styles so I am unsure as to why it would of done this to my normal word template, i have tried deleting the old
 template called "normal" and yet when i open word again the styles are all still normal text but still have the built in headings as "heading 1" etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Usually the heading 1 style is blue in colour and converts the selected text to a heading which then reflects in the table of contents but somehow overnight all the custom styles are spoilt. What is strange is that I used the built in formating which
 worked perfectly fine up until a week ago and now to recreate custom styles up until heading 4 will be somewhat teadous, is there perhaps a way around by replacing the template with working template where all the custom styles return to 'normal'?</span></p>

<p>I watched your video, then tried to recreate the problem. It did not happen to me. The TOC did generate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the problem is your heading styles do not have the appropriate "outline level" defined on them.</p>
<p>

<p>Look in your Modify dialog for the highlighted "level" entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the outline levels are not set the style won't appear in the TOC.&nbsp; </p>

Table of Contents</a>.&nbsp; Many questions come down to a core misunderstanding about Word – what Word calls ‘Headings’ aren’t really headings at all – they are outline levels.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, the simplest way to fix all of your heading styles is recreate your NORMAL.DOTM, then modify the styles to your desired standards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These tips tell how to find NORMAL.DOTM.&nbsp; Rather than deleting it, rename the current one so you can copy styles and macros from it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: you have to close all Word sessions to release NORMAL.DOTM before you can rename it.</p>

It's hard to understand how this could happen. The outline level is hard-coded in the built-in heading styles and can't be changed.
