    <title>Birthdays added to contacts are not showing up on my calendar. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicole00  say:</h3>
<h2>            Birthdays added to contacts are not showing up on my calendar.</h2>
                    <p>Let me start by clarifying that this issue is NOT mobile related. This is an issue viewing my calendar on a COMPUTER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been adding birthdates to my contacts for months, and while I assumed that they were automatically adding to my birthday calendar (some are) many are not showing up! The Microsoft website states that any time I update a contact's information with
 their birthday, it will automatically update the birthday calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some have been updated, and many have not. I cannot figure out the logic behind which ones it chooses to display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this is on my laptop, not my phone. I have tried to add their birthdays manually by adding to the birthday calendar, but then it creates duplicate contacts and the birthday still doesn't show up on the calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p />

</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand, the birthday calendar&nbsp;does not add up to the calendar and it adds only few birthdays not all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be due to sync or browser issue.</p>

    <title>Word 2016 defaults to Asian typography for envelopes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bytecrawler54  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 defaults to Asian typography for envelopes</h2>
                    <p>I have a US Windows 10 system with the default font set to English. I have also loaded the Japanese language pack which my wife needs to correspond with her family. Everything on the system works appropriately except the Mailings ribbon in MS Word 2016.
 On that ribbon, greetings and postcards are set to Japanese, fonts in envelopes and labels only offer Asian type sets, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw that someone did have this problem with Office 2010 and the only advice anyone gave was to uninstall the Japanese language. That is not an option for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real question is why is this only a problem for Mailings? There is either a setting I'm missing somewhere or there is a bug in Office 2016. By the way, I didn't see this in earlier versions of Office including 2010, so I suspect there is a bad default
 setting somewhere. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

                    <p>We are using MS Project with Server (2010) -&nbsp; however, I believe the question is about MS Project (valid question with or without the Server piece).&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>We are having cases where <strong>actual hours </strong>are appearing <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
in the future </span>for tasks when no actuals were entered.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past - this occurred when someone changed % Complete (i.e. changed it to 100 so it spread remaining work out ove rthe life of the task).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is NOT the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; What scenario or task set up would cause actual hours to appear in the future for resources who did not enter them?&nbsp;

            <p>Randy,</p>
<p>First make sure your installation of Project 2010 is updated with the May 2016 Cumulative Update. Running Windows Update is a good way to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides setting a future task to 100% entering a non-zero percent complete into a future task will also show future actuals. For example, let's say a task is scheduled to start May 30 (i.e. next week) with a duration of 2 days with one resource assigned.
 Now someone enters a 25% into the % Complete field. Project will automatically put May 30 into the Actual Start field and 2 hours will appear in the Actual Work field with that work starting on May 30 (i.e. future).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be other instances where actual work appears in the future. Careful examination of the task should give some clues and if you could post a screen shot of a typical example, we may be able to help you figure out why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Ash,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your pictures which give me a better understanding about the question. According to the pictures, the view type of your Trash folder and your Inbox are different. To archive your goal, first choose the Inbox, and then change the view type of your<strong>
 Inbox</strong> by clicking <strong>View</strong>&gt; <strong>Reading Pane</strong> and then in the drop-down list choose the option
<strong>Below</strong> or <strong>Hidden</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following picture will do you a favor. Please give it a shot to see how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

            Windows Defender has come a long way from the days of Microsoft Security Essentials. 
<br />
<br />It includes a decent Antivirus scanner thats more robust and uses heuristics and the cloud to detect and remove malicious code. 
<br />
<br />There is also a built in offline scanner you can use to scan Windows outside of the installation.
<br />
<br />Windows Defender also includes a Firewall, Network Security and protections again newer types of attacks such as Ransomware. 
<br />
<br />So, its pretty robust, especially when combined with other security features such as Windows Smart Screen Filter. I think when used with a Standard User Account, some common sense - don't just download software from suspicious websites or open strange emails with attachments. 
<br />
<br />Also, keep a regular backup of your computer, system restore points; you really can't go wrong. 
<br />
<br />You can also supplement it with third party solutions such as the ESET Sysrescue offline scanner and Malwarebytes.

            Hi Marek.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />To answer your question:
<br />
<br />No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we do solve problems by having them uninstalled.  Of these McAfee is by far the worst.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners. 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>How to Access Skype from Two Countries - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evadee1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Access Skype from Two Countries</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to use my Two Skype accounts from locations in two different countries. Can anyone explain to me, why the second account I opened for personal messages-Windows 10, overrides the country where my Primary Skype account Windows 7 is located.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had hoped that the second Skype account used on a different PC would permit me to use the local currency and the local mobile number to operate more effectively.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; The problem I have now is accessing the Primary account, as the Second personal account default's the Primary and defaults back to the Skype personal account.</p>
<p>When I try to log into the Primary account, the password is not accepted. </p>
<p>This just may be a problem with trying to operate in two different countries.. different phone systems etc.
</p>
<p>Most appreciated if anyone can offer a link, or comments, suggestions. One thought I had was to learn if Merging the two Contacts together is the best option, and then the problem should be solved.</p>
<p>Is the Merging of the two account contacts an option? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance to anyone who has some ideas,... Cheers Dave </p>

    <title>BSOD While Upgrading to Build 14959 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> recepbaltaåÿ  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD While Upgrading to Build 14959</h2>
                    <p>I really **** hate Microsoft. Microsoft is always upgrading a part of Windows but not to improve People's lives, but to **** ruin it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you lately update BSOD pages. Back then, there was information about the driver and we had an idea about the problematic driver. But just because you were flamed by everyone else over those BSODs, you decided to make it look like more modern and added
 a QR Code to the BSOD screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it first came, I thought wow! With QR code, I will be able to quickly learn the driver causing the BSOD. But I was wrong! Because Microsoft do not want you to know the reason behind the problem. Turns out to be the intention was to "look like modern".
 So, when you check the QR code, you just land on a **** page which says you are getting a BSOD due to a hardware change bla bla bla... Old Microsoft ****...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I had a BSOD back then when upgrading to a Preview Build. It was casued by Netstat. A network monitoring software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time, I had another BSOD while upgrading to Build 14959. The system gave no information about the driver. Just the usual error, DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE... Since it was collecting the minidump, I thought I might check it later from the Minidump folder.
 But I was wrong. I was unable to locate the DMP in the Minidump folder. And there is no information about where the Minidump files are stored which are generated during a failed upgrade...</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK. No minidump. No info. Just a QR code. But what about the error log ? When the old build booted, it told me that the system could not be upgraded. I cliked the notification thinking it would give some infor about the error. But no! Microsoft has to keep
 it to himself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I want to try to upgrade again. YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE UPDATE AGAIN! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Wow. This is exactly the MS way!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ? Where do you store Minidump files of failed upgrades or where is the log file ?</p>

            Suggest that you drop out of the PREVIEW/INSIDERS program as we were all advised before downloading and installing BETA software that it may have problems. issues, glitches, deleted files, and if you don't want these issues don't install and seeing that
 you have been with the program for awhile I'm surprised by your posting, and suggest mod to look at this posting.&nbsp;

 that didn't already receive this email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I have so far been able to get it to work is make one forward rule&nbsp;for each person individually then add the rule &nbsp;"except if sent to" and add them there</p>

    <title>Incorrect Skype credit billing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mauricio harley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incorrect Skype credit billing</h2>
                    <p>Dear support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been realizing that the billing is not happening correctly. Every time before calling a landline number, Skype shows me I'll be charged R$ 0,068 (Brazilian currency) per minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, many of my calls last less than one minute, and Skype charges me more than R$ 0,068. For example, there was a call on March 31st that lasted 17 seconds. I was charged R$ 0,18. So, what happened???<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f836990-c94b-478e-9127-103acdd997e0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f836990-c94b-478e-9127-103acdd997e0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly take a look into the attached image. It confirms that the charge should be R$ 0,068 /
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>minute</strong></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please check and fix that for me?</p>

<p>Just as an addendum, I realized the same is happening with mobile numbers. R$ 0,34 / minute is supposedly charged, but the real charge is a way higher than this.</p>

<p>Dear support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been realizing that the billing is not happening correctly. Every time before calling a landline number, Skype shows me I'll be charged R$ 0,068 (Brazilian currency) per minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, many of my calls last less than one minute, and Skype charges me more than R$ 0,068. For example, there was a call on March 31st that lasted 17 seconds. I was charged R$ 0,18. So, what happened???<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f836990-c94b-478e-9127-103acdd997e0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f836990-c94b-478e-9127-103acdd997e0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly take a look into the attached image. It confirms that the charge should be R$ 0,068 /
<p>
</p><p>Could you please check and fix that for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards.</p>

<p>Hi, Veejay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are two of the cases:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Duration 1 (landline): 17 seconds. Charge: R$ 0,18;</p>
<p>2. Duration 2 (mobile): 24 seconds. Charge: R$ 0,55.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus, I have a Skype number. It says I can use 75 minutes to mobiles and landlines, but they are not being deduced from there. I mean, I remain being charged even having a Skype number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Let's do one thing, as this will require account access, you should chat with a live agent from Skype Support on this issue. (This is not a bot support but staffed by human agents)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Not all options will allow you to chat with a live agent. Select following one from the categories dropdown to get the option for chat.
<br />
<br />Payments &amp; purchases
<br />Account, profile &amp; sign-in
<br />Privacy &amp; security
<br />
<br />On the next screen, you get the Chat link which you can click.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

so i'm having quite a little challenge at my job. I'm working for an industry and they took me to create a simulator with Powepoint for one job in a departement. I did good so far and manage to do over 60slides that were screenshot from the screen we use for
 the job. They are all connected with Hyperlinks and some actions button but in one of those Screenshots there's one page where we have to change Parameters. I want this page when in slideshow, to be able to write in numbers, and when its entered to show the
 same filling on a second box right next to it in the same screen. Is this possible? &nbsp;

<h2>            Nokia E90&#58; URGENT&#33;&#33; Bluetooth Modem</h2>
                    I have recently bought a Nokia E90 model. I have installed the PC Suite (latest version) also. I can browse the internet when I connect my phone to my PC via the USB cable. I can also connect my PC to the phone through bluetooth. But I CANNOT BROWSE the
 internet through bluetooth.<br />

            If you are able to browse the Internet using the E90 modem through the USB cable, you have to create the same Dial-up connection, but using a bluetooth modem instead. You can install a "generic bluetoth modem" (standard in windows, no special drivers)
 and use the same settings as on the wired connection. This is if I have understood the problem correctly. If not, please give more details. Good luck.

            I assume you are using some version of Windows:<br />
<br />
1. Pair your Phone with the computer. This is done from the computer, with its specific Bluetooth software. Generally, you have to double-click the Bluetooth icon on the bottom right of your screen and than hit Add.<br />
<br />
2. In the same menu, search for the services available for you phone, and one of them will be dial-up networking. You should follow the instructions for establishing the Dial-up connection, using the parameters given by your network opperator (phone number
 - usually *99#, access point, etc)<br />
<br />
Good luck !

            Thanks once again. My laptop is paired with the phone. When I go to "Explore My Bluetooth Places" and double-click on "Dial up" it pops up a message "Out of memory".<br />
<br />
BTW, I have Windows XP on my laptop

            It seems that you are doing the right things, but your Laptop has a problem. Maybe the Bluetooth drivers and software should be re-installed.

            I had already done that. Well based on your valuable feedback, I am able to at least connect to the phone now. I use the dial in number "*99#" and tried to logon. It now gives the following error: Error 734-The PPP link control protocol was terminated."

<br />
+cgdcont=1,"IP","xxx.xxxxxxx.xx"<br />
<br />
This xxx.xxxxxxx.xx should be provided by your network opperator and will be something like "internet.vodafone.com"<br />

            Apologies for the late repsonse.<br />
<br />
Basic problem that I have seen is as follows:<br />
1. I go to Nokia PC Suite -&gt; Connect to Internet.<br />
2. It initially tries connecting via the default USB modem (note phone is connected to laptop via bluetooth)<br />
3. I go Settings to select a modem. I cannot see any modem in the drop down list.<br />
<br />
So I check up under Phone/Modem in Control Panel and under Modem tab, I see the following list for bluetooth modems:<br />
1. Nokia E90 Communication Bluetooth Modem Com 5<br />
2. Bluetooth modem Com 4<br />
<br />
Pls advise.

            Now that you have a Bluetooth modem installed (maybe both of them will work), you have to:<br />
<br />
1. Set the advanced properties for both Bluetooth modems according to my message above.<br />
2. Set-up a Dial-up connection for the Bluetooth modem (try both of them)<br />
<br />
You do not need PC Suite for this, just Windows functions.<br />
<br />
Good luck.

<h2>            I need to unlink one Skype account from Microsoft account to link another</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got my new phone I stupidly created a new skype account which has made everything a disaster for me! My Microsoft account is now linked with this new skype account I don't even use, and the one I use day in day out doesn't function properly. I don't
 get notifications when people message me, it doesn't open automatically on start up, it shows I'm away all the time so my work colleagues don't think I'm online when I am.... I about to just give up on using Skype all together if I can't get this changed because
 it is driving me insane now, I've been trying for 2 hours today to sort this problem out. If anyone can offer some advice it would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to somehow unlink this unused Skype account from my Microsoft account (no unlink option available!!) so that I can link it to the one I do use. I have even tried deleting the Skype account I don't use, but can't do that either it seems. Microsoft
 you are making things impossible!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Navigation apps use a lot of juice &#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've noticed that both Google Maps &amp; Ovi Maps draw a LOT of battery power (on my 5800XM).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week in London I had Google Maps on for about 40 mins &amp; dropped 2 bars of charge !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing this is mostly related to the phone's GPS&nbsp; ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were travelling by car from London to Wales with Ovi Maps active the whole time, and despite the fact that I had the phone charging the whole time, the phone suddenly shut itself off due to depleted battery after about 7 hours.</p>
<p>Best practice: Turn off Maps while travelling on the same road for long distances (or in a similar situation where you don't need directions for an extended period). If you're using assisted-GPS, it shouldn't take long for the Maps to re-orient itself upon
 restarting; if not using A-GPS, allow a little extra time for orientation.</p>

<p>As we were visitors to the UK, our car was a rental, a small BMW, I think.&nbsp; Actually, we travelled first to Bath, and then took some small scenic roads, stopped off along the way, etc. But it was ill-advised of me to keep the Maps running once we returned
 to the motorway.&nbsp; Once we arrived in Wales (near Bangor), it was nearly dark, and navigation became difficult (and not just due to the L O N G words on the boards!).&nbsp; Of course, that was the precise point where the phone ran out of juice, and we had to resort
 to inaccurate maps in the dim light. Unfortunately, by then it might have taken a couple of hours of trickle-charging to build up a sufficient charge to run the Maps program.</p>
<p>Wales was beautiful, though; no regrets!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, is the picture you uploaded a Yugo, or perhaps a Fiat?&nbsp; I don't recall any British cars with that appearance!</p>

<p>It's a FIAT 126 which shared most of the underpinnings of it's FIAT 500 predecessor with a 2 cylinder engine so for the time in early 1970's was very economical.</p>

            This phenomenon (phone using lots of juice for GPS navigation) is normal for all phones of whatever make. GPS navigation really makes use of a lot of battery because not only does it power up the GPS receiver, it also is connected to the internet (in case
 of google maps or A-GPS in Ovi Maps).

<p>As experienced by me, it also depends on the Navigation software. I have OVI Maps and Sygic Maps running on my Nokia 5800xm. Sygic is more power hungry as compared to OVI...but what is more surprising is it consumes more battery in the Route Demo mode (that
 may run just for about 4-5 minutes) than actual use (..of about 2 hrs.)... &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I agree with that. Some time ago, I installed a trial version of NDrive on my phone and it also uses a lot of battery. Also, when compared with Ovi Maps, my phone became a lot hotter during NDrive navigation. Definitely, Ovi Maps uses much less energy than
 any of the current navigation systems.</p>

<p>Is continuous use of GPS/Navigation likely to do lasting damage to the battery? After all, it is a phone at the end of the day!</p>

<h2>            Cannot send emails. When I click the Inbox, nothing happens.</h2>
                    <p>Not sure where else to go so I'm asking here in the hope somebody can help me. Basically none of the&nbsp;options along the top of my inbox work,&nbsp;which means I can't send any e-mails from my account.&nbsp;When I'm in my inbox and click them nothing happens, and if
 I'm on any other page I just get returned to my inbox. I need to send a couple of potentially important e-mails so it's really annoying me that I can't get into compose a new message. I really don't know how to fix it&nbsp;so if anybody&nbsp;knows why this is&nbsp;happening
 and can offer me a solution I would be most grateful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            Hi Abigail,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I began running through your suggestions, and I am happy to&nbsp;report that the very first one I tried appears to have been successful. I&nbsp;deleted my browsing history and&nbsp;it&nbsp;has let me write this&nbsp;e-mail which it wasn't doing before so it must have been that.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I was also going to try Firefox if I had to but it was&nbsp;ridiculously slow so I'm glad I found a solution before it came to that. Thank you for your&nbsp;prompt response as well, and also&nbsp;for being helpful and polite. Working in a similar technical support role at
 the bank I appreciate the importance of excellent customer service so I would like to commend the&nbsp;courteous reply I received.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you very much,<br />
Mark

<p>I'm having trouble with outlook 365 forwarding my emails to an email address I previously used to forward emails to. In my settings, under accounts the forwarding is turned off and there are no connected accounts. If anyone knows how to resolve this, it

<p>Hi Andrey,</p>
<p>Since this issue happened only to you, please try disabling the forwarding feature by using PowerShell. Below are the detailed steps:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect to Exchange online using PowerShell</a>.</p>
<p>2. Run the command:</p>
<p><em><strong>Set-Mailbox -Identity &lt;UserMailboxEmailAddress&gt; -DeliverToMailboxAndForward $false -ForwardingSMTPAddress $null</strong></em></p>
<p>If you are not an admin of your organization, please contact the admin of your organization to run the PowerShell command for you.</p>
<p>Please feel free to post any updates after running the PowerShell.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mouran</p>
