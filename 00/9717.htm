    <title>My poor windows mobile experience - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xmethodx  say:</h3>
<h2>            My poor windows mobile experience</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, <br />
<br />
Just thought I would share my experience in using W10 Mobile on my Lumia 950. There were several reasons why I decided to pre-order this phone prior to release. Spec wise at the time, it appeared to be on par or slightly better than the rest of the phones on
 the market. The camera looked fantastic, as did the display and promising removable battery and OS.
<br />
<br />
With well over one year of ownership, I have decided to give MS the flick for good. I have used iPhones, Samsungs, Sony (Z1 which was my fav - best batt life, best camera app, quickest to use) and HTC prior to owning the Lumia. I chose the 950 as the size of
 it worked better for me than the size of the XL.<br />
<br />
I really liked the idea of having good integration between the Lumia and my Surface Pro 3 (which I absolutely love) but I am sure I will have missed many more reasons for the change which I will list below.<br />
<br />
(I have been on the Insider fast ring since Jan 2016 from memory)<br />
<br />
- Adding words to the dictionary doesn't seem to be possible anymore. This is really annoying when you want to add a word and the option to add it doesn't exist, yet type a word that you don't want to add, that doesn't exist and it lets you add it.<br />
<br />
- There has never been an option to restart the phone, you have to power off, wait, then power back on or use a hard reset which is really annoying when you just want to restart the phone and be done with it.<br />
<br />
- The phone can never be charged without it turning on<br />
<br />
- Looking for a phone number that isn't recently dialed requires so many screen touches making it frustrating to search for a name/number and on top of that, you have to click the people icon, then tap again on the alphabet to scroll to a position in the list
 and then tap and tap again to dial. Why not make it the same as Apple and Android have? It works and it works well, be different if you wish but don't be annoying and ugly!<br />
<br />
- There is still no way to close all apps at once<br />
<br />
- The most frustrating issue is that you can't adjust the alarm volume, if your alarm goes off, it wakes everyone in the house if you aren't there to shut it off. This has been brought up on the feedback hub since the phone was released, yet stupid bugs and
 fixes that no one gives a crap about are always added/closed and the important issues with the most upvotes get ignored.<br />
<br />
- Navigation disappears if you switch to another app or back to the home screen. You're lucky if you get the message "tap to resume navigation". It should display in the notification list to resume but it does not. You have to go back to the home screen and
 click on Maps again to resume.<br />
<br />
- Bluetooth volume is intermittent, sometimes it's there to adjust, other times it isn't (issue was there with my Bose and now Jabra headset)<br />
<br />
- Photos take FOREVER to process. When you want to take a photo and send it, you have to wait before it can be sent. If you take 4 or 5 photos at once, it takes even longer and you are given a screen that says "loading...." for a long time.<br />
<br />
- Live tiles don't refresh, you still have to re-size the news tile for it to start updating. This has been an issue since day one and upvoted many times yet it is ignored.<br />
<br />
- Searching the settings list doesn't actually search all of the settings, for example if you search for "volume" you get no results which is ridiculous<br />
<br />
- Windows mail is a very poor app, it is slow and it never downloads the full message regardless of your settings. You have to click "download message and pictures" multiple times before it actually works.<br />
<br />
- Using google mail through edge is about 10 times quicker than using the mail app regardless of your type of connection<br />
<br />
- Resizing attachments is not an option. This is another issue that MS ignores all of the time. Even iphones can resize and also send videos &gt; 8 seconds regardless of the resolution.<br />
<br />
- MASSIVE MASSIVE lack of app support. Banking apps here in .au hardly support the OS. They are outdated, don't have support for NFC, are never ever updated etc<br />
<br />
- There is no way to quickly scroll through pages, you can't grab the scroll bar and move it quickly you have to swipe 50 times to navigate through a large document etc<br />
<br />
- Cortana is hopeless at the best of times, even with full reception on 4G, a simple command like "call dad" gives the result "Try again in a few" or "I had a hiccup, try again in a little bit"
<br />
<br />
- Using Cortana again, if you give the command "call dad" and it works, it displays "call dad" in the text box correctly and then says "Sorry I didn't get that"<br />
<br />
- When you have many apps open or have been using the camera, the camera app then gives you the "resuming.... loading....." and the camera app is useless, or anything you wanted to take a photo of is a miss</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Recently, the maps app tells me to turn onto a street that I am already driving on. Insider or not, bugs like this should be fixed immediately!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on the latest update and all of the above issues have always been there and are still issues, feel free to flame but I did give MS a good go with the phone and I don't think I will ever return to using W10 Mobile after the lack of apps, support and
 development.<br />
<br />
So much potential yet so little effort on listening to real life user experiences.</p>

            And one thing I don't like about them is that new improvements get to the latest version of their OS, while older&nbsp;versions may just rest or get&nbsp;something, lets say childish, even outdated. I'm sorry, please don't be offended, but I feel, every version
 should have something almost similar, and different for rare few, more so, please, but not everyone may have the resources to afford an update.&nbsp; My apologies,&nbsp;if I may be harsh.

            Well, it's either that or just another example of a popular misconception that Windows 10 Mobile is no longer free to obtain similar to Windows 10 for PC. I just wanted to clarify whether it is the latter.<br />

</p><p>It would need large amount of data, and one would have to buy that much, and in Nigeria, its not cheap, also depends on the standard of living. Second, not everyone wouLd be able to update it and so would need to find one who could do it, and&nbsp; since it&nbsp;is
 complicated&nbsp;(to them, based on difference from other devices), the charges would be high.</p>

<h2>            HELP&#33;  Cannot connect Android LG Stylus phone to Live Email anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried searching for this problem and contacting support with NO HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an <strong>LG STYLUS android-based phone</strong>. &nbsp;Was able to read my Microsoft Live emails up until now with no problems for years!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One day I changed my password and it would not let me &nbsp;read my emails after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the email account from my phone and reconnected it using <strong>Microsoft Exchange
</strong>under the settings in my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I keep getting an error: &nbsp;<em><strong>Cannot connect to server.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Imap and am getting the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, I cannot connect my Microsoft live email account to my LG phone...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help WOULD REALLY appreciate. Please send detail information...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again,</p>

    <title>Touchpad scroll not working with Excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emile willday  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touchpad scroll not working with Excel 2010</h2>
                    <p>Good day all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Acer Aspire ES 15 running 64bit Windows 10 and Office 2010 Professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just built this machine from new and the only application or situation where 2 fingered scrolling on the touchpad doesn't work is Excel 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following some online advice I ran a fix which didn't fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also uninstalled Office 2010. That's when I found out Office 365 was pre-installed. I uninstalled that as well. I have now performed a fresh install of Office 2010 and still have the same problem with Excel 2010 only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw, this is happening for all excel files whether they have freeze panes or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts or help would be much appreciated.</p>
                </div>

<p>Hi Emile,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I</span>ncompatibility, <span>Outdated driver</span>, and application error are a few of the possible reasons why you are experiencing challenges with using a Touchpad to scroll in Excel. We would like to know if the issue happens even when Excel is
 in safe mode. Check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for the instructions on how to open Excel in safe mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, it is possible that one of the add-ins installed in Excel is causing the issue. If yes, try checking if Office is up-to-date by following the instructions on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might also want to check if your Touchpad driver is updated by following the steps in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you Kristine for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I'm aware, I followed all the links correctly but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Opened up Excel in Safe Mode (new one on me :) ) No joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The link for the office update took me to the "<span>Windows 10 Fall Creators Update"&nbsp;</span>with
 no other options. I ran it and it said that I was up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Went to Acer's website then downloaded and installed the latest Touchpad driver. Also to no avail. Are there any other drivers I should have tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>After seeing Michel's issue, it got me thinking and I checked my 'old' laptop. It's running the same OS and version of office as this one and I've found it now has the same scrolling issue. It always used to work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is starting to look like an update may have caused this issue and unfortunately it happened to coincide with me moving from my old machine to this new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the case, I can at least look at any updates that have been installed recently and start uninstalling them one at a time.</p>

<p>Michel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just found that issue exists on my old system that had the same OS and Office 2010. It never used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting to think that a windows update has been pushed to them and that's what's caused this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to start uninstalling any 'new' updates off my old machine.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue was we didn't want to have to share the contents of the primary "parent' folder as in this case was the inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We managed to slove the problem by giving the primary folder the following permissions&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>This way the folder is 'visible' but no contents can be seen or edited</p>

<br />
Are you referring to the Microsoft account that you logged in to the computer?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to log-in to Bing.com using different web browser and check if the issue persists. If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to add the picture to outlook.com email account, then sign-in to Bing using outlook.com email account
 and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Let us know the update after you try the above steps. </span></span>

 and welcome to the Skype Community!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before you can actually delete a Skype account, you first need to have access to it. We do not have an option to delete multiple accounts at once, you have to manually delete each and every account.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Once you confirmed that you have access to these accounts, you have to go through the list of things you need to consider before you close them. Remember, deleting a Skype account will also delete the Microsoft account
 associated with it so play very close attention with reminder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once your account has been marked for closure, it will take<strong> 60 days </strong>
before it is completely removed from Skype's database. During these time, you can still cancel the closure by logging in to the account. You may find the detailed step-by-step guide for closing an account

I have tried running Word in safe mode. No help.<br />
<br />
I have done a complete repair using control panel/programs...no help. It seemed to have uninstalled MS Office 2013 completely and reinstalled it completely, and nothing improved. One minor problem I have with this is that I've lost my product key from the original
 version, and I can't retrieve it from Dell, where I bought the machine, so I can't activate the reinstalled MS Office 2013! It'll run till next Tuesday, then it'll be dead. My bad, but that's not what's causing me this grief.<br />
<br />
I have checked the hard drive with AVG PCTuneup disk doctor and found no errors. I've defragged with that routine also; no help.<br />
<br />
I've tried running Word with and without first launching any browser. The problem occurs whether or not I've launched a browser.<br />
<br />
To my untrained eye, it seems as if whenever I try to point Word to my normal ...documents folder, to retrieve a doc stored there so I can work on it, or save a new doc there that I've just created, or "save as" a doc I've retrieved from a different folder,
 Word can't find that spot on my hard drive. But it does seem to have no problems finding and using any other paths I select.<br />
<br />
Also, when I first open Word, it displays a list of recent files and their paths. As I said, Word has no trouble using any of the paths it displays other than ....documents. When I click on that, it tries to display the usual list of documents stored there,
 for me to choose and use, and it freezes completely.<br />
<br />
By "freeze completely", I mean that nothing will close Word correctly. Nothing. No X in the corner of the screen; no file/close; nothing. All I get is the error screen from Word saying it is having trouble and I have to wait for it to try to close before it
 finally shuts itself down, or I have to use Ctrl-Alt-Del and start the whole machine all over again.<br />
<br />
I updated Windows a few weeks ago to the April 2017 Creator version, and I created a system restore point just before I did that. I have not tried restoring to that point yet. I'd like advice, please, on whether I should try that.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of that has changed since I did that that might be causing problems is whatever routine Windows updates that have been installed in the past two or three weeks. I have not tried uninstalling any of them.<br />
<br />
I have not had any virus problems with Windows defender or Malwarebytes. The problems with Word all have occurred since I've done anything with either of those programs and neither of them has been an issue for me.<br />
<br />
I did pay for and download MS Office 2016, but I haven't installed it yet, because I'm not certain Word is the problem. I still don't know for sure if the problem is Word or Windows.<br />
<br />
I would like advice please on what to try next.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better know your concern, we'd like to ask some information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Is it only happening in Word 2013?</p>
<p>- Have you tried saving your files to a flash drive and opening it to a different computer and having the same issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Hi.&nbsp; Thx for helping.&nbsp; Sorry I was out of town and didn't reply till now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I can add as of Monday eve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded and installed Office 2016.&nbsp; I gave up on 2013.&nbsp; I have the same problem in Word 2016 that I had in Word 2013.&nbsp; If I point Word 2016 to C:\Users\Tom\Documents, it freezes.&nbsp; Nothing but Ctrl-Alt-Del will shut down and restart.&nbsp; If I point Word
 2016 to C:\Users\Tom\Documents\Word, it works fine.&nbsp; I can open existing docs, work on them, save them back to where they came from, "save as" somewhere else on my hard drive
<em><strong>other than</strong></em> C:\Users\Tom\Documents, etc., and it works like it's supposed to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife also uses Word and I need to watch her later tonight to see if she has the same problem.&nbsp; She has always had Word docs in a subfolder called Word (duh!) under C:\Users\Judy\Documents, so she has not had the problem since she never points Word just
 to C:\Users\Judy\Documents.&nbsp; But to "do good science" by collecting good data, I do intend to ask her to try doing that, to see if she has the same trouble I have when she points Word 2016 to C:\Users\Judy\Documents but not to her ...Word subfolder.&nbsp; I suspect
 she does.&nbsp; I'll report back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I just found out this evening that in fact, when I point Excel 2016 to C:\Users\Tom\Documents, it fails the same way it fails in Word 2016, and when I point Excel 2016 to C:\Users\Tom\Documents\Excel (which is a subfolder I've long used, contrary
 to my experience with Word), it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your last question, it's NA for us.&nbsp; Our Dell Desktop is our one and only computer.</p>

<h2>            Data Validation - Create a Drop-down list within a drop-down list</h2>
                    
<div>I would like to be able to have only one column labeled "Consult Reason", with two options--Symptoms and Goals of Care".&nbsp;&nbsp;In that column I would like to able to, when I select "symptoms", have a second drop down list which lists specific&nbsp;symptoms from
 which I can choose from.&nbsp; So, I guess it would be a considered a drop-down list in a drop-down list.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Is there any way to accomplish this, or do I need to use two columns for this?&nbsp;</div>
<div>As always, I appreciate the expertise found on this forum!!!&nbsp;</div>

            I don't think it's possible to have two dropdown lists in one cell. You could have them in two cells below each other instead of next to each other, of course.
