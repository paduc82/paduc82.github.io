<h2>            I need to get rid of this message when closing Outlook &#34;do you want to permanently delete all the items and subfolders in the &#34;Deleted Items&#34; folder for all accounts&#63;&#34;</h2>
                    When I close Outlook it gives me this message "do you want to permanently delete all the items and subfolders in the "Deleted Items" folder for all accounts?" I don't want it to so I click "No" but I'd like to turn off the option that makes that pop up
 everytime I close out look, How do I turn it off?

<p>I set Campaign location target to China, Ad group language to TraditionalChinese without space. And give campaign name with traditional chinese symbols and this does not have any positive results.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Locked Out of Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked Out of Word</h2>
                    <p>My daughter is locked out of her Word, even though program was purchased with her laptop. I am locked out of Word on my PC even though the program was purchased for my PC. Two separate purchases, and it seems that, because we both allowed auto-updates, we
 are both locked out of using our documents. Online fixes do not work as we can not access "Options" in the "File" menu as it is not made available. We can not access our own documents. This is a similar recurring post on this forum by other users. Where is
 MICROSOFT? Who at Microsoft came up with the idea of forcing customers into re-purchasing software?</p>

            It blocks me from accessing my own documents by telling me that I have to buy a new subscription. The fixes online tell one to change the file blocking settings by accessing "Options" from the "File" menu. But when I do that, "Options" is not available
 to be clicked upon, not highlighted. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/922849/opening-a-file-is-blocked-by-your-registry-policy-setting-or-file-bloc. It's a subscription issue and I see where the many posts about it are being hidden from the feed. Microsoft
 wants older Word software to be updated and is blocking usage of software we own and are using. &nbsp;It is very sneaky.

            We own the software, purchased the software with the laptop and alongside the purchase of the PC, but right now we can not even open a document or edit an existing one. It says that our "subscriptions expired" but we don't have subscriptions. We did both
 opt for auto-updates, but we never paid for subscriptions nor were free subscriptions utilied if they were offered because we owned the software. It is very sneaky. Most people don't know what they have so they'll just click on "Reactivate" in a panic and
 under duress. &nbsp;The online fix says&nbsp;
Opening a file is blocked by your registry policy setting</p>
but then you can't fix it with the fix they offer.

            First, you don't "own" the software.&nbsp; You have a license to use in according with the licensing terms you agreed to when installing or using the software for the first time.&nbsp; It makes no sense that you would be asked to renew a subscription for software
 that wasn't offered on a subscription basis.&nbsp; I don't know what you're referring to as "very sneaky."&nbsp; I assume that you have product keys for both installations.&nbsp; If so, you should uninstall the software and reinstall it using the original product keys.&nbsp;
 Unless, that is, that the "very sneaky" thing you refer to resulted in your agreeing to something that you didn't understand.<br />

            Yes, I OWN a licensing agreement. I stand corrected. I paid for it. I am a paying customer as are the apparent multitude of individuals who have been complaining of the same issue only to have their posts removed from the feed without resolution. Since
 your last reply, I have clicked through the "Reactivate Subscription" prompts to find that there is eventually an option to re-enter my product key, which I have done because I PURCHASED the USE of the software and still have my product PURCHASE paperwork.
 It is very sneaky to lock licensed users of a product out of their personal documents while prompting them to RE-purchase something that they don't have to re-purchase, and also very sneaky to ask PURCHASERS software licenses of over seven years to RE-ENTER
 their product keys when most people don't maintain organized papers that long (just ask an IRS auditor. Many laws use 7 years as the outside limit for having to produce records, such as paid-off mortgages), all the while, prompting them to t

            Oh no, my "lack of understanding" just gets better with "Activation Key not found." So I tried the one I had for the Office product that I PURCHASED before the last one, and am told that the products don't match, which they don't, but I PURCHASED both
 and could still conceivably be using both. Very, VERY sneaky. I will be looking for this Question and unhelpful responses on the feed to alert other customers...lol

<p>1. I purchased two versions of Office for which I still have Activation Keys.</p>
<p>2. I still own both computers on which those versions were respectively installed.</p>
<p>3. I could still be using both versions of Office on those computers.</p>
<p>Rather than suggesting that the other person doesn't understand or that something doesn't make any sense, when it is YOU who is not able to follow "I purchased both [products] and could still conceivably be using both," you should use less pompous statements,
 such as "I'm confused" or "I don't understand" or "could you explain that differently" or "am I to understand correctly...?"</p>

<p>

<h2>            Laptop won&#39;t boot&#40;at Windows 10 Technical Preview&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is DELL XPS 13 9333(late 2013), and I installed Windows 10 Techincal Preview(build 9926)&nbsp;at last night.</p>
<p>Right after&nbsp;I installed, Windows worked well, and also I could see the Uninstall option on boot(Windows Rollback).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But today,&nbsp; Windows 10 Technical Preview has updated(automatically). After that, I turned off my laptop.</p>
<p>Few minutes ago(maybe 30 minutes), I tried to boot my laptop, but It won't boot.</p>
<p>I can access F2 setup and F12 boot option,&nbsp;But I can see just cursor and black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before install Windows 10 Technical Preview, I used Windows 8.1 K.(both languages are&nbsp;Korean)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the problem? Is it usual like this situation on Technical Preview?</p>

            <p>Hi Song,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that your laptop won‚Äôt boot up after installing updates and you are getting a black screen with a cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem might be caused due to following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphics drivers outdated.</li><li>Third party application conflict.</li></ul>
<p>In this scenario we can try to do two things:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Recovery mode</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to force shutdown the computer multiple times it should take you to the recovery mode. From the recovery mode try to initiate system restore to an earlier date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to refresh the computer if you are able to accesses the Recovery Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Boot from the Windows 8.1 disc and initiate system restore</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Boot the computer using the Windows 8/8.1 installation disc.</li><li>Repair your computer.</li><li>This will give you an option to initiate system restore.</li></ul>
<p><strong>System Restore disclaimer: </strong>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>
<p>

    <title>OneNote Online Excel blank image &#40;picture&#41; problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> speedyway  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Online Excel blank image &#40;picture&#41; problem</h2>
                    <p>We have a group using OneNote 2013 desktop application.<span>&nbsp; </span>They copy Excel spreadsheet sections and paste them as picture to OneNote.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The reason they do this is so the Excel table looks correct.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Copy/paste the actual table into OneNote messes up the formatting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They share their notebook.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some people only need to view the content occasionally.&nbsp; They don‚Äôt want to install the desktop application so they just use the shared link and go online to view content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Excel picture is large, they show up on OneNote online as blank image.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The whole picture is blank with the tag ‚Äúimage‚Äù inserted on the top left corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can test this by copying an Excel table of 30R*30C size and paste into your OneNote.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then view the notebook on your OneDrive online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can play with the image size online by right clicking the image and click shrink or grow.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When you shrink the image small enough, the actual Excel picture will show.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I‚Äôve tested this problem with other type of pictures such as PDF or the Microsoft simple OneNote demo pictures.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I made those&nbsp;as large as possible and have no problem online viewing them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't seem to have this problem with Word or PowerPoint either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Excel is the one causing the problem and Excel tables can get quite large.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So this is common problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

    <title>Restarting numbered lists in each Heading section with VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cn13579  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restarting numbered lists in each Heading section with VBA</h2>
                    <div>I have some Word 2010 documents that are automatically generated from Robohelp. The documents have different subsections at different Heading levels, and most sections include numbered lists using the same style: List Number.
 The numbering is continued from the previous section in each subsequent section instead of restarting at 1. As there are many sections that would need to be manually reset each time the documents are generated, it would be incredibly helpful to have this automated.
 Is there a way to do this with VBA?<br />
<br />

            <p>You can add a body text style such as List Number in the same multilevel list as your headings, so you may not need a VBA solution. The assumption here is that you don't actually make use of all nine heading styles.</p>

            Hello Mammaslots,
<br />
<br />I understand that you are having an issue with Outlook.com as you are unable to attach files to your e-mails that you want to send. I know how annoying this can be and I will try my best to help you to resolve this issue.
<br />
<br />Could you please provide us additional information about the issue? 
<br />
<br />1. What kind of file do you have problem attaching? 
<br />2. Does it work if you refresh the webpage or attach another file instead? 
<br />3. What are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far? 
<br />
<br />Generally, since you have just transitioned to the new Outlook.com experience, it may be a good idea to refresh your Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies and your browser caches: 
<br />
<br />- selectively deleting browser cookies

<br />- clearing browser caches 
<br /><a href="https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/</a>

    <title>Problem with Office Templates for Android Tablets and Smartphones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidwhatley-holmes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Office Templates for Android Tablets and Smartphones</h2>
                    <p>Hi fellow participants,</p>
<p>I have created a couple of Excel templates for the haulage company I work for. &nbsp;They are not tech savvy people, very good at running a trucking company, but not good at computer stuff. &nbsp;So I want to be able to provide them with a simple way of recording
 the hours the drivers work (to protect against stringent government legislation on drivers hours that can often see both drivers and hauliers prosecuted over unwitting time-keeping errors); and to record mileages, fuel usage, and maintenance records. My templates
 do all this. Each driver will complete a daily record, and this can then be uploaded at the end of the week, and the relevant data copied to a central sheet keeping a clear record for the authorities to inspect.</p>
<p>There is a lot of automation built in to prevent mistakes, and explanations here and there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the drivers have smart phones and/or tablets and are more than capable of using an Excel worksheet as a form. However, they should be able to start a new document on a Monday morning by File&gt;New and entering their own vehicle's details on a new document
 created from a standard template held in a central cloud repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole point of this post/Rant is that there is no facility built into Office 365 for tablet or smart phone running Android to use what Microsoft call Personal Templates. The only templates available are those that MS has put on line, very generic and
 somewhat simple too. Certainly not capable of the task I have set. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have discovered through chatting to tech support that it cannot currently be done - as MS have not built it in to Office 365 for Android. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I'm behind the times / fashion, but I don't think using a company template is all that unusual. How do the big boys manage? Is there a version of Office 365 that works in a multi-platform Intranet? If there is why doesn't MS include the technology
 into 365 for Android? If there isn't, Well why not!?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe this can be put out as an update pretty soon. &nbsp;MS must be aware that more purchasing transactions now take place over smart phones and tablets than from PCs, and that the trend will only rise, so to me it follows that more people will be working through
 the same technology they use to do everything else in their lives, and will require the facilities they are used to on a desk-top.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wouldn't have thought it too hard to implement a File&gt;New&gt;From Personal Template option, or a File&gt;Save As&gt;Personal Template option either! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts world?</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I'd like to explain that it's not feasible to insert a custom template into Office 365 apps for Android tablets and smart phones. I understand it will be much more convenient and
 efficient if we could insert custom template into Excel for Android. Therefore, I would suggest you vote this post in our Excel for Android forum:
</span><a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304939-excel-for-android/suggestions/10138488-add-support-for-custom-templates-in-office-mobile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Add support for custom templates in Office Mobile apps, specifically Excel and Word</span></a><span>.</span><span>
 Many new features came directly from customer's suggestions. We appreciate your constructive insights.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can first save the template file into one of your organization SharePoint library (or a central cloud place) and give it a special name. When they want to record
 file in the library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jared</p>

    <title>Blackjack II&#58; all-day events not visible on phone&#39;s month - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zplunk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blackjack II&#58; all-day events not visible on phone&#39;s month view.</h2>
                    I just got a new Win7 machine (32bit) and use Outlook 07.&nbsp; Downloaded WMDC and couldn't get the calendar to sync.&nbsp; Finally changed the Sync Settings to PC 2 from Windows PC and got it to work BUT all day events or multiple day events don't show up on the
 phone.&nbsp; They're viewable only on the Day view, but not the Month view where I prefer to see if days are blocked out.&nbsp; My current workaround is to manually schedule all day events directly on the phone and they'll be visible.&nbsp; Any other ideas?&nbsp; Thanks.

<p>Hi ZPlunk - I used to run a BlackJack II with Windows Mobile 6.1 and am now running a newer Windows Phone&nbsp;device and am not able to replicate your scenario. We have historically seen a number of calendar sync postings including all day event and multi-day
 event references.&nbsp; You might want to see if some of the tips on this older, long thread are of assistance:&nbsp;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/windowsmobileactivesync/thread/799657AB-D954-4CF7-B8C2-7773F61CD18F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/windowsmobileactivesync/thread/799657AB-D954-4CF7-B8C2-7773F61CD18F</a></p>

            <p>Hi Ahmad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to use the below Windows phone recovery tool and go back to the previous version of Windows. Software Recovery Tool can help you to reset and recover your phone software at home, if your phone is experiencing software related or software
 update problems.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong><span>&nbsp;Using the Software Recovery Tool will erase all content stored on your phone, including apps and games (along with app data and game progress), text messages, call history, music, photos and more. If possible, you should
 back up your phone first (Settings &gt; backup). You will be able to restore a backup once the recovery is complete.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After performing Software recovery tool, I suggest you to update to Windows 10 and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.

<p>Hi T.Kaye,</p>
<p>If you purchased your Office 365 plan from GoDaddy, I suggest you turn to GoDaddy for expert help since the Office 365 purchased from GoDaddy has GoDaddy customized UI\features.</p>
<p>If you purchased your Office 365 plan from Microsoft directly, there are two scenarios with different solutions.<br />
1.&nbsp;If you want to cancel your plan, you can follow the steps in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Cancel-Office-365-for-business-b1bc0bef-4608-4601-813a-cdd9f746709a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the kb</a>.<br />
2.&nbsp;If you only want to delete your account from the tenant, you can‚Äôt delete your account by yourself and you need ask other global admins in your tenant to help you remove your user account. You can refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Delete-or-restore-users-d5155593-3bac-4d8d-9d8b-f4513a81479e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>After upgrading from W7 x86 to W10 x86 my USB Keyboard is not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephentassell  say:</h3>
<h2>            After upgrading from W7 x86 to W10 x86 my USB Keyboard is not recognised</h2>
                    <p>I have tried two wired USB keyboards and a wireless keyboard with a USB Receiver.<br />
<br />
In Device Manager it reports that the Encassa CoDefender USB Keyboard Driver Device Status (for all keyboards tried) as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This device cannot start (Code 10)<br />
Insufficient system resources exist to complete the API<br />
<br />
I would really welcome an urgent reply this this request as it is extremely difficult to review what appears to be the best ever release of Windows, without a working keyboard!</p>
<p><br />
Many thanks.</p>

</p><p><span><span>Hi Stephen, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in updating to Windows 10 Technical Preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur due to incompatible or outdated drivers and missing updates. I can understand that it must be difficult for you when things are not working as it should. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may update the Audio or sound driver from Device Manager manually and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press (Windows key + X) and click on ‚ÄúDevice Manager‚Äù.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Expand ‚ÄúUniversal Serial Bus‚Äù.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3. Right click on the video driver and select ‚ÄúUpdate Driver Software‚Äù. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Further, you may also look for optional updates in Windows Updates to see if there are any additional updates related to this device and install them as required.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the driver update does not help then I would suggest you to completely uninstall the USB driver and reinstall it to check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press ‚ÄúWindows key + X‚Äù and click on ‚ÄúDevice Manager‚Äù.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the list of devices, you should see the USB device.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the USB device and then select "Uninstall".</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the uninstall dialog, make sure you select the option to delete the driver package from the system. This causes the driver package installed earlier to be deleted.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the Action menu of Device manager, select ‚Äú<strong>Scan for Hardware changes‚Äù
</strong>option. This will force the computer to recognize any hardware changes. Once the driver is installed, close all windows and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reply with the status of the issue and we will be glad to offer our assistance.</span></p>

I have followed your steps, but unfortunately I do not see the Video Driver or Webcam in the expanded tree of Universal Serial Bus tree.

            Would really appreciate some more help on this as a week after installing Windows 10 I am still having to use a Netbook and TeamViewer to provide a keyboard service!<br />
<br />
Surely, Windows 10 not recognising a USB keyboard should be taken rather seriously!<br />
<br />
I would gratefully appreciate some help in getting my keyboard to work with Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Thank you.

<h2>            Default Attachment Download Location for Microsoft Outlook Android App</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would some kind soul please tell me the exact location of where&nbsp;<span>Microsoft Outlook
<strong>Android App</strong>&nbsp;<strong>version 1.2.23 (58) mainline</strong> saves&nbsp;</span><span>attachments to, by default. The following is the scenario I'm having: -</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If I receive an email with a picture as an attachment, I understand that if I click the Menu and then Files, I'm shown the attachments list, However, when I click on the picture I just received, it says "Downloading file" and shows me the
 picture, but it doesn't indicate where it downloads/saves it to. it will also open the picture, but gives me no way of downloading/saving it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>* Microsoft Outlook&nbsp;Android App&nbsp;version 1.2.23 (58) mainline</span>* HTC One M9 Android version: 5.0.2</strong></p>
<p><strong>* HTC Sense 7</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>* Software # 1.32.61.15</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I have made myself clear.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Once it is installed, it will show as an app. Usually before&nbsp;downloading to your phone&nbsp;it may ask you to select the path.

<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also have a problem with microsoft techies answering questions who fail to understand the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook downloads the file to a location that the user has no control or input, it does not download the files to the Android download file, or to gallery. So where does it store these files? It is NOT device specified as quoted, I can't find then on two
 Android devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Simple question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, please research and give users the simple answer - better still, give a 'save as' option so we can choose where to save the attachment.</p>

            I looked at info button while viewing pic after "downloading". &nbsp;It showed path /all_downloads. &nbsp;However, i do not have such a path visible in File Manager. &nbsp;Neither /sd_card/all_downloads (which is what I'd expect) nor /all_downloads. &nbsp;So, really, when
 will this bug in Outlook get fixed? Can you provide any information that would help me understand whether i should wait for a fix or simply move onto another email client app?

            <p>Dear Microsoft: please either answer the question asked - i.e. where can we find pics and attachments downloaded from our phone by your Outlook app on our android phones. What you're doing now is NOT answering the question and abandoning the topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason we can't find the pics is that apparently your app temporarily downloads the file for viewing and once viewed it appears to delete it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix your app so that SAVED pics and files STAY SAVED. And please learn to reply to people's questions - dropping a topic without a fix is unprofessional and rude. This is NOT the new Microsoft your CEO is portraying; it is the old.</p>

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />This feature is only for Cells not for comments / text boxes. This is a limitation currently.
<br />
<br />A work around could be to copy those contents in cells (if feasible)
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Insider program is similar to the old Beta programs. It is for PC Experts only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing is that you should never, ever, install a Preview version on your main, production computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this information is included in the description about the Insiders Program 5that you were supposed to read before joining.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you install Windows Insider Preview:</p>

<p>So what was happening from July 4 2015 to to-day as July was your last posting to the insider until today was every thing work okay with this BETA software? it seems that you should not be involved with any type of testing programs as you become easily annoyed.

            Hi BitsBits,
<br />
<br />Sorry to read that you are having issues finding the product key, It would be best to contact Microsoft directly over the phone to see if this is possible. From My experience it would be no. 
<br />
<br />There are programs that can search Product keys from the registry, but in my experience they haven't worked for Microsoft office since 2010.
<br />
<br />I hope that the Microsoft call center can be of more help.

<p>hi bernhard,</p>
<p>to dial this number from skype for business, you need to purchase pstn conferencing license as an add-on and assign it to the user. also, you need to be in one of these countries where this feature is available.

<h2>            Share Outlook 2010 pst file</h2>
                    <p>One laptop has Outlook 2010 and the other has Outlook 2003. Would like to move the pst file back and forth between the two via phyically using external drive, thumb drive or Skydrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the 2003 pst will open OK in 2010, however, not sure about 2010 back to 2003 version. This back and forth will occur at least weekly and will be overwriting the pst's with a copy command each time. Is this reliably possible?</p>
