<h2>            Emails sent via Send Later are revealing the original time when replied to&#47;forwarded on</h2>
                    <p>Following the recent update to 15.36 (170620), the Send Later functionality looks to be working great for the initial send but I'm finding when users either reply or forward the original timestamp is then shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I scheduled an email at 11:40 to arrive at 12:00. It arrived on time in the destination mailbox but when the user replies or forwards, the original time/date (in this case 11:40) is shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the Boomerang add-on to provide similar functionality which doesn't have this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this isn't ideal especially if you're emailing late at night or scheduling a follow up email a week in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has this already been raised as a bug? I couldn't find anything in the forums but I am new here so may be looking in the wrong place!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

            I don't think this is a bug, just poor design. The Windows client does the same thing and the recipient sees the sent time as the creation time, which is a problem because it can show up in their in box much earlier in their thread listing and even be
 off screen.

<h2>            Cannot create or view chart on all office products</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have been trying to create charts in excel, but it shows "To create a chart, select the cells that contain the data you'd like to use ..." which I have already select cells. I even try to transpose the data and then try to create the chart, but still
 no luck.</p>
<p>So I try to create chart in Excel Online and download it to format in Excel, the excel shows that the file is broken open the file with no chart that I have created through Excel Online. Back to square one.</p>
<p>This problem seems to exist on my powerpoint as well as I try to open powerpoint file with chart. Powerpoint shows that the file is broken and remove the chart.</p>

<h2>            Word documents changing to .odt and becoming disabled</h2>
                    Help.&nbsp; My word documents were saving as .odt documents, suddenly, by default.&nbsp; I changed the default back to word (file, options, save), but the document remains disabled, having, for example, only "files," "tools," and "views" in the upper left and remaining
 disabled - I can't type in it or move anything - nothing: no access.&nbsp; I can only copy it (control A and control N for new document and control V to paste) into a new document.&nbsp; I can then rename it, save it, and edit it.&nbsp; But if I close it and reopen it, I
 get the same problem, only now it has the docx, but it remains disabled. &nbsp;

<p>Hi Jackrin,</p>
<p>Anonymous guest links on folders in OneDrive for Business as well as SharePoint Online are not supported now, as users need permission on the folders first then they can access the folder via the link. It means they need at least a Microsoft
 account.</p>
<p>I understand it would be convenient that we can share a folder with guest link. Given this situation, you can join into this topic
<a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273492-sites-and-collaboration/suggestions/7781637-allow-sharing-of-folders-via-guestlink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
allow sharing of folders via guest link</a>&nbsp;to share your ideas with our related team. Many features will be updated based on customers' constructive comments.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Activation Hell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnqpublique  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Activation Hell</h2>
                    <p>Used my Sony Vaio Flip Laptop to try out Windows 10 Insider. Loved it and was on the fast ring for two plus months. I didn't think it a big issue when I went Insider 10 and it upgraded from 8.1 Pro to 10 Home. I figured when the RTM came to market
 I would be able to enter my 8.1 Pro license activation code and all would be honkey dorey. That didn't happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make matters worse, two days ago I wanted to follow a tree of choices in the recently issued RTM Windows 10 on the Vaio and view the restore points. I clicked one to many times and now have reverted back to the Preview/Insider edition 10166.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further the mess I have downloaded the 8.1 onto a thumb drive, obtained the OEM 8.1 activation key from BIOS and tried to reinstall 8.1 with the intent of then upgrading to 8.1 Pro with my key and then leapfrog into Windows 10 Pro. Guess what?
 The 8.1 (not the Pro upgrade, just basic 8.1) install stops on either route (keep files/programs or overwrite everything) because it says the drive is bitlocker encrypted!! I cannot decrypt/suspend bitlocker because I only have Windows 10 Home! It is not letting
 me overwrite the main partition because it states the partition is encrypted. &nbsp;So I can't downgrade and can't upgrade. I am stuck in limbo.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now I have two issues:</p>
<p>How do I get back to the RTM Windows 10 not a preview (Build 10166)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get back my Windows Pro version status? I still have the activation code (and Micorsoft Store receipt) for 8.1 Pro Upgrade that I paid $99 for 15 or so months ago? &nbsp;I use bitlocker and Hyper-V a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Tech people hung up without answering after waiting on hold for 58 minutes when I called 866-425-8809. That is the third telephone number I have been given by various MS technical support help. My laptop is NOT activated---MS deactivated
 the codes for preview builds. So now I have a functioning OS that is not activated. Please help. Anybody. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This scenario is not getting better. I absolutely refuse to BUY something I already have and paid for. This has turned into a complete sh**show and to date I now have spent over 5 hours trying to resolve this issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Fat Fingers</p>

<p>That is very sad, why it is then not marked somewhere on the box or clearly stated in user manual.&nbsp;</p>

            Anyways, how did you try to pair it?<br />
For a bluetooth handsfree for instance for a bh105 model, you need to press and hold the power key while it is turned off so that it shows blinking light.<br />
Blinking light indicates that the bluetooth device is now discoverable. At this time, you need to search foe the device using your phone. In the search results select, bh105.<br />
<br />
It should automatically pair. If asked for password, enter 0000 to pair.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried it with several types of NOKIA BT headset - all of them are working with other phones.</p>
<p>As I understood it will never work because the BT chip dont support audio profile for headset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks anyway</p>

<p>Hi, I've bought a Nokia 108 recently and it won't connect to any vehicle bluetooth systems. In one vehicle they can't find each other and in another vehicle they find each other but are unable to connect. How do I get it to connect? Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm afraid there's nothing you can do, as the 108 only supports the OPP bluetooth profile, which is for sending of files. It does not support any handsfree or other type of audio connection over bluetooth.</p>

<p>Hi all, I have just encountered the same problem with the new phone I have just purchased for my wife. Her phone died so we just wanted a basic phone with Bluetooth for hands free communications. The cover of the box indicated Bluetooth.The salesman said
 it was bluetooth compatable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reading all the problems encountered here, i have just realsied it is not. Well not for hands free communications.</p>
<p>After checking the packaging, I found that the right hand side wrap around on the box indicates the detail of file sharing with Bluetooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Loyal Nokia user for 20+ years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now feel completely deceived. I believe this to be misleading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder how others feel about this. I am thinking of taking this to consumer affairs to discuss the implications around misleading advertising and packaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry NOKIA but you have just lost a once loyal customer.</p>

Nokia » Press » Media Bank » Data Sheets</a>: ‘Bluetooth audio not supported’.&nbsp;Very confusing in my little world: In my&nbsp;11 years with&nbsp;Bluetooth mobile phones, this was my first encounter with a software-platform which is offering just Bluetooth data and not
 Bluetooth audio.&nbsp;The Nokia 108 was the&nbsp;first Series-30-Plus model.&nbsp;Despite that, this ‘feature’&nbsp;<a href="http://nokia-press.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/05/Tm9raWEtMTA4LUR1YWwtU0lNLURh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">was not mentioned</a>&nbsp;when the Nokia 108 was released.</p>

<p>That is a "new" system (what was the original operating system on the PC?) and you will need to install Win10 to an active version of Win7 or 8 to get the "free" upgrade you also can do an install and using the key from a Win7 or 8, this was changed back
 in July 2015. also suggest that you read the info that MS posted about the insiders Program as I see you have been in the program for awhile but not active.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t activate Office Professional 2016 after clean install of Windows on same PC</h2>
                    <p>Last year I've bought from an online retailer the key for Office Professional 2016.</p>
<p>I've installed and activated it with out ANY problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately today I was forced by hardware issues to FORMAT my PC and do a clean install of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Afterwards I logged onto my account and on the basis of my&nbsp;Office Professional 2016 KEY I was able to download Office from: https://setup.office.com/home/getoffice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All good and fine until Activation when it says I can't activate Office - "Product key is not valid". Also my Microsoft Account recognizes the Office KEY - with out it, it didn't let me even download the software - but I can't seem to find any trace of it
 in it. HOW CAN THAT EVEN BE POSSIBLE!??!?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give me solutions.</p>

<h2>            xltx file opening itself not a new workbook</h2>
                    I have a template called Figleaf.xltx which I use a lot from two different pc's both of which are running Office 2010 on Win 7
<div>I have recently had to install Office 2000 on one of the pc's (PC1) so that I can use Access</div>
<div>Having done so when I double click on Fifleaf.xltx from PC1 the template itself opens.&nbsp;</div>
<div>When I double click on the template from PC2 a new workbook called Figleaf1.xlsx opens</div>
<div>I am sure that there is a simple resolve but I cannot find it.</div>

<p>Have you tried running those Office apps in Safe Mode?<br />
Open Run (<strong>Windows </strong>key + <strong>R</strong>)<br />
<strong>winword /safe</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -this will open Word in Safe Mode<br />
<strong>excel /safe<br />
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -this will open Excel in Safe Mode<strong>outlook /safe<br />
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-this will open Outlook in Safe Mode<br />
If any or all of the Office apps can run in Safe Mode, it may be an add-in issue. Can you check if you have "ABBYY FineReader" installed?</p>
<p>Run &gt;appwiz.cpl <br />
<br />
If yes, uninstall it then try to reopen Office apps normally.</p>

            I suspect part of your problem is that there are 2 types of table "line". One is "grid" lines, that optionally display on screen only, they do not print. The other is table borders that always display and always print.<br />
<br />
Sometimes grid lines are not drawn onscreen even thought they are turned on. A quick &lt;page up&gt;&lt;page down&gt; will often get them drawn properly.
<br />
<br />
I just make sure to turn on the grid lines.<br />

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem: files move to the root folder after a few minutes of being correctly synched. It doesn't appear to be any sync issue, it's just that whenever I save a new file ina sub-folder, it moves to the root folder after a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p>If you are installing the x64 version and get this message, try the 32 bit x86 version instead. I've seen multiple folks, myself included, getting the missing driver message with the x64 version.</p>
<p>Note that I was NOT installing to a VM. I did a clean install on a Core 2 Duo system, Gigabyte GA-P35-DS4 system board.</p>
<p>x86 version installed with no fuss at all. I'm running it now and don't hate it.
</p>
<p>I tried Win 8 for a week when it came out and found it useless without a touch screen</p>
<p>But so far this version looks good to me.</p>
<p>Good luck &amp; have fun!</p>

    <title>remove skype from outlook account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miki1  say:</h3>
<h2>            remove skype from outlook account</h2>
                    <p>I would like to know how to remove skype from my outlook completely. I do not want a workaround, when I do use the ‘workaround’ and make myself invisible, the next time I log on to outlook I am available!! Hate it! I have been keeping myself invisible for
 years, and since messenger and now skype, it has played up and a bug changes my invisible to available. I was with a Microsoft tech guy on the phone 2 months go for around 3 hours, he had remote access to my desktop and did lots of things to get outlook to
 stay invisible, and the next day it changed again. So so so sick of it all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to choose when I can get calls or messages, I want to control my outlook and skype accounts, and I want them separate from each other 100%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have noticed that these same sentiments have been talked about, relayed, forwarded, communicated by the majority of outlook users since 2013 (and maybe earlier), what has been done about it? Nothing! It is looking very very likely that I must move on and
 away from Microsoft and start to use Apple products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not want skype and outlook to be connected at all whatsoever! Emails can be read and sent in my own time at my own pace, with skype my contacts can see when I am on line and at times my time is hijacked by friends, and when I ignore, because I must,
 due to time limit schedules, Microsoft now forces me to be rude to my friends, and make me have to explain myself when I really do not have to. I speak to them on the phone anyway or on facebook or other message apps. But at least it is when I am able to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, but I am upset and frustrated, I am sure you can work that out, so please give me the information as to how to unlink completely my outlook from skype. Please don’t give me a workaround, they don’t work permanently. Do not want it at all. Please,
 please, please, please, I am in begging mode…how do I remove skype from outlook?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. </p>

    <title>Viewing spreadsheet rows on individual pages, like flipping through - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lazzmatazz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Viewing spreadsheet rows on individual pages, like flipping through index cards</h2>
                    
<p>My question is: How can&nbsp;individual rows (records)&nbsp;of a spreadsheet be displayed&nbsp;on editable&nbsp;individual&nbsp;pages, containing all the data of each record, including&nbsp;column headings?</p>
<p>I have worked in Alpha 4 software for some 15 years. Alpha 4 has a very simple solution: press "B"&nbsp;to "browse"&nbsp;the data&nbsp;as a spreadsheet, or press "V"&nbsp;to "view"&nbsp;one individual row (record) at a time on&nbsp;a single&nbsp;page. You can view all records&nbsp;in the "View"
 mode by pressing the arrow-down (up) key, and&nbsp;you can enter additional records. It is the simplest thing&nbsp;to create and edit the "view" page to show whatever you like: include all column headings or exclude some that are unimportant&nbsp;in the view mode, position
 and reposition cells, make them different shapes, sizes&nbsp;or colors, etc. etc.</p>
<p>After&nbsp;a hugely time-consuming research I found that in Excel,&nbsp;one has to either: 1 - create a Macro; or 2 -&nbsp;Mail-merge&nbsp;into Word; or 3 -&nbsp;Download a template; or 4 - Learn Visual Basic.</p>
<p>After spending many hours experimenting with all of these options with unsatisfactory results, I had to give up. All&nbsp;of them&nbsp;are extremely time-consuming, and to me seem unnecessarily complex for a simple display function that should have a one-key solution.</p>
<p>Am I missing something? Is Excel the wrong software to use for such a simple database operation? Any recommendations, anyone?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Excel has a feature called the Form - it's well hidden in Excel 2007, you have to customize the Quick Access Toolbar to use it, and it's rather clunky.

    <title>Onedrive and file explorer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Onedrive and file explorer</h2>
                    <p>I have for several weeks been frustrated with the thumbnails not displaying for any images in pictures folders and other folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was messing about the other day and inadvertently moved a folder to the desktop.&nbsp; To my suprise all of the thumbnails were displaying correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On investigation i realised that the desktop is outside of the onedrive folder.&nbsp; This suggested that folders with images which are located within the onedrive folder were not displaying thumbnails correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested my theory with a couple of other folders and they did do the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what is wrong with the onedrive folder, and why isnt it displaying the thumbnails, and more importantly how do I solve the problem.&nbsp; Tried using support agents but there is never anyone available when i try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for looking</p>

            Are you encrypting your OneDrive files?&nbsp; It is harder for Windows to generate thumbnails on encrypted files.&nbsp; But once you have generated thumbnails there are ways to prevent thumbnails from getting deleted from the thumbnail cache.<br />
