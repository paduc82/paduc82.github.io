            Dear Nigel,<br /><br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products. Please note that I am a user like you.<br /><br />If you have not accessed your Microsoft account for more than 5 years it was deleted due to inactivity <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/13811/microsoft-account-doesnt-exist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/13811/...</a>. After it was deleted the "name" for that account was free so anyone could have registered that account in the meantime. <br /><br />Additionally all information is deleted from the account after a year of inactivity, so even if you would recover or recreate account it would be empty. Probably that is why support suggested creating new account

<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing <em>whatsoever</em> to do with "inactivity" - I 'lost' this much-used account only about a week ago when clearly I wrongly remembered a password during an attempt at updating info. - after repeated pestering from Microsoft to "update your security"
 which I had chosen to ignore.</p>
<p>Tried several passwords - none have worked.</p>
<p>Now they ask me to enter a password "associated with the account" !</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Microsoft have told me the account/name is still allocated.]</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Tried</em> recovery .... Microsoft said they'd phone me a code. They did [strangely on my newer phone number, which is 'witheld',&nbsp; yet they had asked me to 'update' my older number ... so they had it all the time!] - but when the code was entered it
 was <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> accepted !!!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>[I wrote it down <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">during</span> the call and entered it carefully and correctly]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried phoning the UK 'help' number - got a very lengthy telephone tree then put on hold [because not enough staff to answer phones] and had to listen to jangly music alternating with an American voice trying to sell me Microsoft products ! ]&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;I rang
 off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really fed-up now with Microsoft&nbsp; 'support'.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is a sick joke. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestion that I 'open another account' is plain daft.</p>
<p>It means I lose <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all </span>my old email history and
<p>
</p><p>They <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">keep</span> using 'No Reply' emails that
<p>Now I get a reply from MarkExpert592 suggesting I phone America !! Probably to get yet another telephone tree (I'm in the
<span>UK</span> as they know ... )</p>

            Dear Nigel,
<br />
<br />Mark Expert, as other similar bot experts are spamming the whole forum and they try to scam users. Please be careful. 
<br />
<br />As for your question, and if you are trying to recover your account, try to recover it again, using tips in this article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17875/microsoft-account-recover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17875/...</a> . Try to recollect what information you were providing while creating the account <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/...</a>
<br />
<br />If you will still be unable to recover the account, then it is better to contact Microsoft Account Support for alternative recovery options <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12401/microsoft-account-get-help-by-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12401/...</a> They have the necessary tool to verify you as the owner of the account, and they are replying usually within 24H.

<p>
</p><p>BUT ... been there, done that - and rejected by MICROSOFT&nbsp; with <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
no</span> explanation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was left wondering, for example,&nbsp; <em>if</em> Microsoft had put me in Wales [I'm in England]
<em>because</em> Royal Mail chooses to put our postcode in Wales. It causes mega-problems but Royal Mail could not care less.</p>

no</span> opportunity to speak to a human being].&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Automated checking systems and 'Unmonitored emails' are proving no good to man nor beast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spent <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">hours </span>on this now - perhaps I should just give up on Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>ETA&nbsp; &nbsp;Latest response from Microsoft says 'Too many attempts - open a new account ' ...</p>

            Dear Nigel, 
<br />
<br />I do understand that you are frustrated and that you want to recover your account, however you can do that only with the help of Microsoft Account support. They are dealing with such problems and they should provide you at least with the information if you have passed validation or not. If you have access to strong proofs, use them in order to prove that this is your account.
<br />
<br />I wish I could do more, however I am a user like you. I do no have any access to Microsoft internal tools. I am just helping out with my experience.

<p>This originally was orange, and said it was suspended until 10/13/2015 (I don't recall the time)</p>

</p><p>(in fact I just went back into chat and it now doesn't show a date but still says suspended.</p>

</p><p>I cannot file a case review, because none of the suspensions (this is his second) are currently showing as active on the Enforcements page.</p>

    <title>Weird 0x files in the folder &#34;InstallShield Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathan alan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird 0x files in the folder &#34;InstallShield Installation Information&#34; and crash dumps</h2>
                    My computer keeps doing these crash dumps about 2 or 3 times in a year and my "InstallShield Installation Information" folder's modified date keeps changing. I think I have a virus because the crash dump is locating these installed files on my computer
 that start with 0x. I'm not to sure what's going on but when my PC crashes my antivirus softwares don't work and my firewall gets turned off and the "Turn On Firewall" button doesn't do a thing. This has been happening to me since around 2011 or 2012 and I
 don't know which files could be doing this. Please help me... :/

            You'll have to wait until Microsoft migrates this data over to your SkyDrive account (as they proceed through the termination of the My Phone services).&nbsp; Your contacts will be migrated to SkyDrive in a CSV file, which you can download to your computer.&nbsp;
 The migration is taking place right now and will be completed by October 6th.&nbsp; There is no way to know where your data stands in regards to the migration or when your data will be migrated to your SkyDrive account.
<br />
<br />
After your contacts are migrated to SkyDrive, you can import the csv file into Outlook, Windows Live, Google Contacts or any other application or service that can import csv files that you plan to use with your phone.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I've posted numerous replies in the numerous My Phone threads this week that lay out what your syncing options are.&nbsp; Go search through the My Phone forum to find them.

<h3> kentfield_341  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to stop the option &#34;Mark item as read when selection changes&#34; being reset after each Office update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Office 2016 on Windows 10. Every time the office update runs, it resets the Outlook settings "Mark items as read when selection changes" to ticked. Is it possible to stop this resetting? I like to leave emails flagged as unread, until I have finished
 processing the actions related to that email. Then, I manually mark the record as 'read' so I know it is complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to get to the setting:</p>
<p>File</p>
<p>Options</p>
<p>Mail</p>
<p>Under the section "Outlook panes", click the button Reading Pane...</p>
<p>The second option is "Mark item as read when selection changes".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I keep this set to un-ticked?</p>

</p><p>Hi Prashant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We recommend that you reset your phone to fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try starting with a soft reset, press and hold the Power and Volume down button for about 15 seconds. Once the phone vibrates, release your hold and wait for the phone to finish restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the issue continues after doing a soft reset.</p>

    <title>Sharepoint 365 Running Workflow Management - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharepoint 365 Running Workflow Management</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been working with Sharepoint Workflows for several months now. I have created a few workflows associated with a particular list. Lately, workflows have started to self-suspend with the following error message:</p>
<p>"The workflow instance exceeded the CPU usage limit of throttle of 00:00:01.2000000 and could not be unloaded because it was not persistable."</p>
<p>Some cursory research indicates that this is a resource issue. This makes some sense, since as of late my workflows have been incredibly sluggish.</p>
<p>I then discovered that I have somewhere around 80 workflow instances "running" on items in the list in question. This should be impossible as my list has only 4 items and any given item can only have upwards of 4 concurrent workflows running on it. I suspect
 that there are some orphaned workflows attached to test items that have been deleted from the list.</p>
<p>My specific questions are as follows:</p>
<p>1) When deleting an item from a Sharepoint list, do all associated running workflows automatically terminate?<br />
2) How can I find/manage all running workflow instances for a given list? In particular, workflows that may be attached to a list item that no longer exists...</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Evan</p>

<p>hi evan,</p>
<p>for your two questions, here are the answers.<br />
1. yes. if you delete an item from a sharepoint site, the &nbsp;associated running workflow will automatically terminate.<br />
2. you can find all running workflows via list-&gt;list settings-&gt;workflow settings. please see the screenshot below.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=56beb5d6-10b8-4124-a04b-4c9b8ae19a5c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d56beb5d6-10b8-4124-a04b-4c9b8ae19a5c" /></a></p>
<p>to clarify the issue, could you confirm the information below.<br />
1. how do you find that the number of the running workflows is 80? could you provide us with the steps of your checking and some screenshots?<br />
to upload a screenshot, click <b>use rich formatting</b> and then click <b>edit/insert media</b>.<br />
2. the screenshot of some pages showing the items and the running workflows of the list.<br />
3. a screenshot of the page like i provided above.<br />
4. if you design some custom workflow which aren’t created by the basic workflow templates in sharepoint online by sharepoint designer, the issue may be caused by the some settings of the custom workflows, i suggest you post a new thread on our

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today I received a call from one of Microsoft support branches and they informed me that I had a virus and my license had been charged, however in order to correct this I had to pay a fee. I currently am unable to pay that high of a fee and so they told
 me that my computer is illegal and they "blocked" it and when ever I start it up it has a pop up asking for a startup password and it won't allow me to do anything else. I really need this computer for school it would be wonderful if you can help. Thank You&nbsp;</p>

<p>the and condition is used to state that all the assumptions will be true for example</p>
<p>=if(and(A1=2, A2=5, A3="A"),1,0)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the above it will return 1 if A1=2, A2=5 and A3= letter A</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=if(or(A1=2,A2,5),1,0)</p>
<p>it will return 1 if A1=2 or A2=5</p>

            <p>In the Excel Help files it states the following...</p>
<p>Up to 64 <b>IF</b> functions can be nested as <b><i>value_if_true</i></b> and <b>
<i>value_if_false</i></b> arguments to construct more elaborate tests. </p>
<p>For example the formula below works just fine in 2007...</p>
<p>=IF(B1=1,1,IF(B1=2,2,IF(B1=3,3,IF(B1=4,4,IF(B1=5,5,IF(B1=6,6,IF(B1=7,7,IF(B1=8,8,IF(B1=9,9,IF(B1=10,10,0))))))))))</p>
<p>This sure breaks the 7 levels of If statements rule in Office 2003! Of course this will cause backward compatibility issues&nbsp;for anyone viewing your files in earlier versions, or saving in a 2003 (or earlier) format...</p>
<p>OK -&nbsp;so for the OR/AND part - consider that maybe some of the true parts in the formula above were actually common results. This means instead of testing for each case individually we can create a logical test for each common result once.eg</p>
<p>=IF(B1=1,"LO",IF(B1=2,"LO",IF(B1=3,"LO",IF(B1=4,"LO",IF(B1=5,"LO",IF(B1=6,"HI",IF(B1=7,"HI",IF(B1=8,"HI",IF(B1=9,"HI",IF(B1=10,"HI",0))))))))))</p>
<p>then this could be simplified by</p>
<p>=IF(OR(B1=1,B1=2,B1=3,B1=4,B1=5),"LO",IF(OR(B1=6,B1=7,B1=8,B1=9,B1=10),"HI",0))</p>
<p>or as the cell reference is the same in each logical test it can be further condensed to</p>
<p>=IF(OR(B1={1,2,3,4,5}),"LO",IF(OR(B1={6,7,8,9,10}),"HI",0))</p>
<p>As the equation above is refering to one cell, the AND function can't be used as it is mutually exclusive (B1 can only be one value at once, not many).</p>
<p>So if we add a reference to cell C1 into the logical test we could have</p>
<p>=IF(AND(OR(B1={1,2,3,4,5}),C1="A"),"LO",IF(AND(OR(B1={6,7,8,9,10}),C1="B"),"HI",0))</p>
<p>This means that both the conditions for cell B 'and' cell C have to match the logical test for the true result to be shown, otherwise the result will be 0.</p>
<p>if you were to write this in its long form it might look like:</p>
<p>=IF(B1=1,IF(C1="A","LO",0),IF(B1=2,IF(C1="A","LO",0),IF(B1=3,IF(C1="A","LO",0),IF(B1=4,IF(C1="A","LO",0),IF(B1=5,IF(C1="A","LO",0),IF(B1=6,IF(C1="B","HI",0),IF(B1=7,IF(C1="B","HI",0),IF(B1=8,IF(C1="B","HI",0),IF(B1=9,IF(C1="B","HI",0),IF(B1=10,IF(C1="B","HI",0),0))))))))))</p>
<p>This is for illistration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this is of help...</p>

            <p>Hi - I understand your frustrations, I do, but perserverance is definitely key...</p>
<p>I have found an online resource for the sample file and also have read the text from the book. I am not sure that the sample file will make it any easier for you though...</p>
<p>The link can be found by typing "And Or Not.xlsx" (with the quotation marks) into the google search engine, it was the last link displayed for me.</p>
<p>The table in the sample file looks at the average exam mark and the attendance record. The formula to detirmine a pass or fail is presented by two different equations:</p>
<p>=IF(<strong>OR</strong>(G5&lt;5,F5&gt;75),"Pass","Fail")</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>=IF(<strong>AND</strong>(G5&lt;5,F5&gt;75),"Pass","Fail")</p>
<p>In each formula the <strong>OR</strong> and the <strong>AND</strong> functions have been used within the IF function. This is what nesting is, using one function within another function.</p>
<p>What the sample shows is that the two IF statements used will produce different out comes based on the 'nested' function.</p>
<p>Firstly the <strong>OR</strong> function will look at G5 to see&nbsp;whether&nbsp;the attendance mark is less than&nbsp;5 OR the average pass mark is more than 75. If
<strong>either one</strong>&nbsp;of these conditions is true then it passes the TRUE result to the IF function, which will then result in "Pass" being returned. Should
<strong>both</strong> of the conditions be false (attendance was 5 or greater, average pass was 75 or less) then the OR function would pass a FALSE result to the IF function, which returns a "Fail".</p>
<p>Secondly the <strong>AND</strong> function will look at G5 to see&nbsp;whether&nbsp;the attendance mark is less than&nbsp;5 AND the average pass mark is more than 75. If
<strong>both </strong>of these conditions is true then it passes the TRUE result to the IF function, which will then result in "Pass" being returned. Should&nbsp;<strong>either one</strong>&nbsp;of the conditions be false (attendance was 5 or greater, average pass was
 75 or less) then the AND function would pass a FALSE result to the IF function, which returns a "Fail".</p>
<p>This is the bases of nesting functions, one function passes its result to the next.</p>

            <p>Hi Rblack40,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND and OR are boolean operators. Their thruth tabel is as:</p>
<p>AND:</p>
<p>Value-1 Value-2 Result</p>
<p>True&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True</p>
<p>True&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; False&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; False</p>
<p>False&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; False</p>
<p>False&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; False&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; False</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OR:</p>
<p>Value-1 Value-2 Result</p>
<p>True&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True</p>
<p>True&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; False&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True</p>
<p>False&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True</p>
<p>False&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; False&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; False</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, for AND, both equations have to return TRUE to make the validation true.</p>
<p>For OR, TRUE if one of the conditions are TRUE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=if(condition,TRUE_PART, FALSE_PART)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=IF(OR(TRUE,FALSE) ... takes the TRUE part</p>
<p>=IF(AND(TRUE,FALSE)... takes the FALSE part</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hth,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WKr,</p>
<p>JP Ronse</p>

    <title>After 10 Months Using Office 2013 On Windows 7 It&#39;s Asking For - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gloryww  say:</h3>
<h2>            After 10 Months Using Office 2013 On Windows 7 It&#39;s Asking For Activation Again</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard"><strong>Now resolved: the short version of the solution - did an online Office 2013 repair and re-activated Office&nbsp;using the product key.</strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Office 2013 supplied (and activated) with a new Dell PC about ten months ago. We've been using it with no problems for about ten months.<br />
<br />
This morning one of the staff tried to open Outlook 2013 and got a message saying "Something went wrong". I don't believe that there was any error number/message, just a suggestion to try restarting the program. So we shut down and restarted the computer (when
 something strange happens I always prefer a reboot) and then ran Outlook 2013 again. This time we got a "Please Wait While We Load Sign-In" pop-up with a progress bar. The pop-up was quickly replaced with another saying "Activate Office" in blue with the following
 text:<br />
<br />
To activate office enter the email address that's associated with your office subscription.<br />
Enter email address<br />
[Next]<br />
Enter a product key instead<br />
When you sign in your documents and settings are online<br />
Learn more | Privacy statement<br />
<br />
Since I know we activated this ten months ago I simply closed the "Activate" with the little X button top right. A small "Getting Your New Office Ready For You" pop-up saying "Hold on, this should only take a few moments..." with a back-and-forth progress bar
 appeared. After about 15 minutes I decided it was more than 'a few moments', and shut down the computer (I had to force shutdown of Outlook).<br />
<br />
(Note: another pop-up appeared while I was noting down the text above - "You're up to date!" in orange with the following text "The latest version of office is installed on your computer". I simply clicked 'Close' on this one. Just including that information
 for the sake of completeness)<br />
<br />
Tried again. Restarted the PC. Opened a different Office 2013 application, Word 2013 from the start menu. Exactly the same - "Activate Office" message, "You're Up To Date" message, "Getting your new Office ready for you" - still going 20 minutes later. Closed
 it with task manager, reboot.<br />
<br />
Tried with Excel - same thing.<br />
<br />
Tried again with Word, but this time I clicked the "Enter a product key instead" option from the "Activate" pop-up - but I get the same "Getting Your New Office Ready For You" pop-up. Repeated this a few times just to be certain. It won't let me enter a product
 key.<br />
<br />
Tried again with Word, but this time entered our email address and hit 'Next'. It said it was searching for the account, obviously found it, and asked for the password. I paused here, and reread the wording of the "Activate" message a few times. It seems rather
 strange - we bought a copy of MS Office ten months ago, and we don't have any 'subscription' (the term implies a recurring payment). And the statement that 'When you sign in your documents and settings are online' is puzzling - we specifically chose NOT to
 use online documents. So I checked the 'Learn More' link, which talks about the online document storage, which we specifically do NOT want.)<br />
I decided not to enter the password, as doing so will apparently put all my documents and settings online, which I do NOT want to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is infuriating! MS Office is now totally unuseable on this system! (our other systems seem fine so far, fingers crossed).<br />
Please advise how I can get it working again, without these unnecessary online documents.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've already checked the similar "Microsoft office 2013 keeps asking for activation code even though I " thread here:<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-office_install/microsoft-office-2013-keeps-asking-for-activation/9e19f686-4056-4315-8bd8-bc64e6e74c04<br />
and to pre-empt the obvious questions:<br />
- The complete messages we get are noted above<br />
- We get the same problem for Outlook, Word, Excel (I haven't tried the others)<br />
- I cannot check 'File &gt; Accounts' from the application as the application is blocked by the aforementioned dialogs.<br />
- We have a single version of "Microsoft Office 2013 Home And Business" installed (supplied with the new Dell PC, although it still required online installation when we got it 10 months age)</p>

            <p>Just repeated the tests from the first post, and something's changed - the "Enter a product key" option from the Activate Office pop-up now does something.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I entered the product key (on my first attempt I was told it was not a valid Office 2013 key. That was because I also typed the dashes between the 5 groups of 5 digits. Simply typing the 25 digits was accepted - the dashes were automatically added).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried Word, Excel, and Outlook and they seem to work fine now. But I just need to go away and try rebooting...</p>
<p>
</p><p>...and I'm pleased to say that everything appears to working after a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And&nbsp;Microsoft OneDrive is a separate program under Control Panel &gt; Programs And Features so I&nbsp;should be able to&nbsp;delete that. So all our documents will remain on our local hard drives.</p>

<p>What type of controls did you use on the form.&nbsp; If you used Content Controls, rather than using the Restrict Editing for Filling in Forms (which is only meant for use with Legacy FormFields), you should use the Grouping facility in the Controls section of
 the Developer tab of the ribbon to prevent the text in the document from being edited.</p>

    <title>Detection of MBR rootkit Sinowal.M&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elsa.kurien85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Detection of MBR rootkit Sinowal.M&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to know if MSE is capable of preventing and detecting MBR rootkits such as Sinowal? Most of anti-virus programs including MSE&nbsp; (version 1.79.2033.0) failed to detect it.</p>
<p>Eventually I managed to detect this infection using gmer which reported "rootkit-like behavior" in multiple sectors. eg<br />
<br />
Disk \Device\Harddisk0\DR0 sector 00: rootkit-like behavior</p>
<p>The intriguing aspect was that when I used the "copy" context menu of gmer on the reported item and saved it to a file on the hard disk Microsoft Security Essentials indentified the file as Trojan:DOS/Sinowal.M. Why is it that MSE does not detect the underlying
 infection?<br />
<br />
Finally I used mbr.exe and Windows XP Recovery Console + fixmbr.exe to remove the infection.</p>
