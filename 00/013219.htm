<h2>            Food &#38; Drink App - No Side Scrollbar when app launches</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a new Insider and just installed 9926 on my Dell E6420.&nbsp; After getting the video drivers installed the OS isn't all that bad.&nbsp; There are a few quirks, but I'm trying to figure out if it is actually a quirk or just because I'm too familiar with Windows
 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In testing various apps out I noticed that upon initial launching of the Food &amp; Drink app once the main app appears there is no way to move within the app with either mouse or keyboard.&nbsp; Only after resizing the window (Maximize, or drag window borders) does
 the side scrollbar at the bottom appear.&nbsp; Is this intended behavior or an issue because the Interface is more Tablet oriented than Desktop/Laptop computer oriented?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will</p>

<h2>            Deleted Items verses Bin folders</h2>
                    <p>I am using a GMail account with MS Outlook in MS Office 365</p>

<h2>            My Taskbar doesn&#39;t work after I reinstall the graphic driver</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Windows 10 Technical Review and it says that my graphic driver is not working. It appears so because I cannot adjust the brightness of my monitor.</p>
<p>So I uninstall the AMD driver what is doing fine under windows 8.1 and reinstall the newest one.<br />
I also do the same to my intel graphic card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I restart my computer, I can adjust the brightness but the taskbar doesn't appear as it should be, It looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a01d837-a3bf-433a-a001-8f95f03aa1d1" /><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>It fails to show the icons which I previously locked on the taskbar.</li><li>It fails to show the time&amp;date to the right of &nbsp;the taskbar.</li></ul>
<p>Moreover, the taskbar doesn't work at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>The start button doesn't respond to my clicks (no matter right or left)</li><li>Cortana doesn't respond to me when I click or when I type something.</li><li>The time&amp;date window will show when I click to the right of the taskbar(where It should be).</li></ul>
<p>When I check my taskmanager, it shows that Windows Explorer constantly takes about 30% of CPU usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to fix it? Does my graphic driver has anything to do with it?</p>
<p>Since I cannot use start button, I cannot launch any applications except for typing the app name in the Taskmanager, I hope someone can help me out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            How to disable auto rotation for Lumia 620</h2>
                    Hello world, can I know how to disable auto rotation for Lumia 620? And also, how to disable keypad vibration to stop the phone vibrate when touch on any buttons? Besides that, how can we check on the memory that an app utilized, instead a summary in setting?

            <p>Hello JQ Goh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Forum.</p>
<p>Unfortuately this is not possible to turn off the auto Rotation with the Windows Phone.
</p>
<p>To disable the keypad Vibration you'll need to go to the Settings on the Phone, then Ringtones and Sounds and there you can turn off the Vibration. (If you click on this, it turns off the Vibration for the Phone&nbsp;completely.
</p>
<p>There is no other way to turn off the Keypad Vibration.</p>
<p>If you go to the Phone Storage, there you can see how much Space is used, but there is no way to see how much Space a single App is using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. I haven't talked about FM recording</p>
<p>2. if you read my answer properly, you'll understand why your phones can't record calls.</p>

    <title>How to calculate salary based on several factors&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to calculate salary based on several factors&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hoping someone can talk me through this. I have a salary database built but came to a stumbling block.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several employee types whose salary change depending on their type, grade, and location. What I was hoping to do was to create a "lookup" field that would look at the three fields and correlate with the appropriate table and salary.</p>
<p>1. Currently I have separate pay tables for each occupation, should I make just one table though some information may be repetitive?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. How do I make the field consider the three variables and lookup the correct salary?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

            Yes, you should have a single table.&nbsp; In database terms the table would model a ternary many-to-many relationship type between employee types, grades, and locations, so would have a column for each, which would in each case be a foreign key referencing
 the primary key of the employee types, grades or locations table as appropriate.&nbsp; The primary key of the table would be a composite of these three columns.&nbsp; Additionally the table would have a column for the current salary, which is a non-key attribute of
 the relationship type.<br />
<br />
For data entry of an employee's salary you'd thus need three unbound combo boxes in which employee types, grade, and location is selected.&nbsp; Code in the AfterUpdate event procedure of each would assign a value to a salary text box, if the active control is not
 Null, by calling the DLookup function with an appropriate criteria expression to return the salary for the three selected values in the combo boxes.<br />
<br />
You should be able to populate the single salaries table from your existing tables with a few simple 'append' queries.

<h2>            Three HTC 8x have died &#40;unable to charge or turn on&#41;...help&#63;</h2>
                    <div>So first I realize this isn't a WinPhone OS issue (or at least I really really hope it isn't), but I'm not getting any input from my carrier (tmobile) so I thought I would see if anyone has some ideas.</div>
<div>I have had three windows phone 8 HTC 8x phones die on me in a week... Each time I call tmobile and they ask me questions (did you drop it, did you put it in the toilet, etc) and I answer no and they send me out another phone (one appeared to be a refurb
 phone and the last time it was a brand new phone).</div>
<div>Each time the phone appears to die or be out of battery. I then attempt to plug it in to the charger that came with the phone and the phone does not indicate it is taking a charge (no light) and does not turn on no matter how long I leave it plugged in
 (1 hour, 2 hours, 8 hours, etc).</div>
<div>I have tested the wall outlets and they are working (correct voltage), I have plugged the USB cable directly into my PC (front USB and rear USB)... still no charge.</div>
<div>I have tried to charge it at work with the correct charger using the wall outlet and the USB... still no charge.</div>
<div>I have tried swapping cables and even using another charger (of course rated at the same 5v and 1amp).</div>
<div>I can't imagine there is that big of a defect issue w/ the HTC 8x (haven't seen anything like this on the msg boards), so I have to assume it has something to do w/ my environment but so far I haven't found the answer.... The only potential thing I can
 think of is I have recently upgraded my router to a dual band (2.5GHz and 5GHz)... I have been connecting my phone to just the 5GHz signal since our baby monitor interfers with the 2.5GHz signal... But again no other device in the house using the 5GHz single
 is having an issue.</div>
<div>Thanks in advance,</div>

<h2>            Outlines in Word</h2>
                    This is probably easier than I've made it but I simply need to know how I can create an outline in Word, in which each time I enter it takes me to the next line in the outline without me having to manually click on the next letter or number.&nbsp; I need it
 to be set permanently.&nbsp; Is there a way to do that? For instance, when it goes from Roman numeral I to A to 1, etc. that I am not having to keep doing the manual selection.

            Nope, I was wondering if one could still run the "old way". The advertising promotes the "new way", which I can see&nbsp;no use for at all. Apparantely you can still use the tried and true method. That's good&nbsp;news.&nbsp;Thanks for the info.

<div>Thnks for response my question</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was read that answer. It's look like my problem. But, I still get error message on my script when I try to run my application.&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is part of my VBA script:</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>intLogonAttempts</b> = intLogonAttempts + 1</div>
<div><br />
<div>and other script:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Format(<b>date</b>,"dd mm yy")</div>
<div><br />
<div>A2013 send error message " Can't find project or library"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Am I should change that script for all of my form and report?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Because it's a lot of scripts that must be change.</div>
<div>Is there other, more simpler way to do&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<p>It's 2018 now and Microsoft still has not addressed this deficiency. Windows 10 and Office 2016 still have problem. In fact, problem is worse now with new Apple-like color schemes and "tablet friendly" sized controls mean that you cannot see edges of windows,
 task bars or easily see which is window is highlighted or active and even the simplest form or dialog takes up half the screen now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office is probably worst offender. If I go into Personalize and change Active and Inactive Window title bars in the display theme, all the office applications IGNORE those settings and override with their faux chic white-on-white or grey-on-grey themes instead.
 Very poor programming practice and very frustrating for users when it's difficult to tell the windows apart or see where text boxes are or their cursor is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the "tablet friendly" controls, many formerly compact displays and dialogs are now supersized and overlap each other if you open more than one. No need for all this if you are on a conventional full-HD or higher resolution screen using a mouse - totally
 unnecessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question - When will Microsoft modify Office 2013 and 2016 (and future versions) to stop overriding display settings and color themes?
<strong>There is NO need for an Office Theme at all, let settings picked for desktop theme carry through.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Question - How is Office considered Section 508 accessibility compliant when they do stuff like this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question - How inconsiderate and oblivious can a company possibly be to their customers for the sake of vanity?</p>

<h3> seltsameliebe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel cell format for HTML</h2>
                    <p>I have a spreadsheet that contains one column with cells that contain HTML text like this:</p>
<p><strong>&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to format that column to display the text like this:</p>
<p><strong>Hello, world</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, none of the format options provide for converting the cell to display the HTML as readable text.</p>
<p>Is it possible to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can take the HTML cell, put it in a .TXT file, rename the file to .html, and open it with IE, but that is a lot of work.</p>

            <p>No, I do not want to write any code or macros,&nbsp; Each cell contains varying html code, which displays properly if I extract it to a text file and use IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point is that with all of the html built in IE, and all of the capability of Excel to generate HTML and save as HTML, there should be a format (general, numeric, currency, text, CUSTOM, etc) to display a cell containing HTML in HUMAN READABLE FORM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that such&nbsp;a feature has be severely overlooked.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, how do I set the format for a cell containing HTML code to be <strong>displayed/rendered
</strong>the way I want?</p>

<h2>            Unable to uninstall IE-11 after several attempts</h2>
                    <p><span>Unable to uninstall IE-11 - several different attempts</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After&nbsp;reading another similar post...someone recommended that I try several options...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Recommended steps (from MS) were as listed via link…</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/install-ie#ie=ie-11-win-7</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To uninstall Internet Explorer</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp; </span>Click the Start button, and enter Programs and features in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp; </span>Click Programs and Features in the list of results, and then click View installed updates.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp; </span>Under Microsoft Windows, right-click Internet Explorer, and then click Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the Uninstall an update dialog box, click Yes to uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp; </span>Click Restart now to finish uninstalling and restore previous versions of the browser, or click Restart later.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have followed those steps…all three attempts result in the same error message pop-up:<span>&nbsp;
</span>"<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Uninstall of one or more Windows features was not successful"</span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I go back to PROGRAMS &amp; FEATURES / VIEW INSTALLED UPDATES … IE-11 shows that it is still listed, and it works as a browser.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My concern is that the three uninstall attempts (may have/probably have) corrupted some portions of the IE-11 program.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>You can import the regedit file created prior to that step or use the restore point(system restore).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, may I know the reason you want to downgrade from Internet Explorer 11? Are you facing any issues with Internet Explorer 11?</p>

Can I sync contacts and calendar from my Windows Live Mail to my Motorola Atrix 4g WITHOUT going through google mail or Hotmail?&nbsp;
<br />
I just found a 3-yr old reply from you which helped me restore lost contacts in WLM, after researching for 2 weeks, and you had the answer!&nbsp; So, apparently since I'm signed out of WLM, my contacts will no longer sync thru Hotmail, right?&nbsp; This worked and synced
 fine for 2 months or so, through Hotmail, now I'm hesitant to use it.<br />

</p><p><strong>I want my pivot table to end up looking similar, with the quantity being the sum of the sales of that item each month, and the same with the rest of the columns to the right&nbsp; being sum or avg. calculations.&nbsp; I have no trouble with that part of it.&nbsp;
 My problem is how to get the pivot table to display the first 6 columns that way.&nbsp; If i add them as rows, I get this mess......</strong></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t receive security code. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andy.b.24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t receive security code.</h2>
                    Recently, a hacker started the process to change all the security info on my account and now the account has been put on a 30 day waiting period. When prompted with the message if it was me who started the process, I click No and it takes me to the "how
 would you like to receive your code" page. Problem is, when I select "call number" (it's a home phone, no texting) &nbsp;I always get a message saying " There is a temporary problem with the service. Please Try again." My alternate email address is not showing
 up as a different verification method either. I'm seriously worried now that after the 30 day waiting period the hacker will have access to my account because I can't receive my security code to stop the process. All I get for help is links to pages that tell
 me what I already know or the info doesn't answer my question. I've tried sending a request for help from a Microsoft support representative but all I got told was reset your browser which didn't do anything. Please help, this

    <title>time travel scheduling based on time zone segmentation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            time travel scheduling based on time zone segmentation</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a corporate user of MS Office Professional Plus 2010.&nbsp; As a such, I need to send emails (reports, instructions, meeting minutes, etc.) to different people in different time zones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I colleague of mine forwarded to me an Infographic for email marketing.&nbsp; It's mentioned emails reach their best results in the first hour, after delivery.&nbsp;&nbsp; With&nbsp;a&nbsp;23.63% reading rate&nbsp;in the first hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's also mentioned, it must be send in the morning, or early in the afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp; But what about messaging on different time zones?&nbsp;&nbsp; The infographic suggest to get a "time travel" feature for Outlook.&nbsp; Where a single message with multiple recipients can
 be delivered&nbsp;at different times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my question is: does Outlook has such a feature?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your reply and consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victor</p>
