<h2>            Build 16278 Disables Touchpad after sleep</h2>
                    Every time that I put my laptop to sleep on this build, my touchpad does not work upon awakening. I can navigate to Device Manager and toggle disabling and re-enabling the driver, and this fixes the touchpad, for about ten seconds. Then it stops working
 again. Any help?

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
Corrupted touchpad driver is one of the possible reasons why it does not work after sleep. For us to assist you better, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the Make and Model of the computer?</li><li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Have you tried updating the touchpad driver to its latest update?</li><li>Have you tried updating your Windows Insider to its latest build?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I had several issues on builds prior to 16281.&nbsp; Coming from Hibernate/Sleep I would often lose the on board mouse pad.&nbsp; I then lost the key board on the HP.&nbsp; I had to buy a wireless mouse to use this notebook.&nbsp; With the periodic loss of the key board, this
 notebook was next to useless.&nbsp; I thought of running it back to public build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key to keeping it running was generally a re-start.&nbsp; I did play with the power button settings so that closing the lid was set to "never do anything".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what was the final fix but after I installed 16281, my HP notebook is back to normal.&nbsp; Not sure whether it was 16281 or my Power button settings.&nbsp; Both happened at about the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the issue is with Insiders or perhaps the Power button settings.</p>

<h2>            Does anyone know if I can downgrade Windows 10 Upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know if I can downgrade Windows 10 Upgrade? What I mean by downgrade, is I have a desktop that originally ran Windows XP. Last year I was having problems with my computer and had to do a clean install. But couldn't get it to run since I didn't
 have any of the required updates needed to get online. Anyway so I did an online search and the only Windows I could find listed as new was a Windows 7 Pro. So even though I really wanted Windows 7 Home, to get the computer running again I had to get the Window
 7 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I tried to install the Windows 10 Insider Preview a week ago, but it wouldn't install. It would start the install, get to the point that says, CHECKING YOUR PC, and then come back and say can't upgrade Window 10 because my processor does not support
 NX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, today I just read a story that talked about Windows 10, and how there are some XP Machines now running Windows 10. The only thing I can think of is maybe they are running Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there a way to get and install Windows 10 Home on my desktop instead of the Windows 10 Pro it keeps trying to install. I even tried to do the ISO install. But it still tried to install Windows 10 Pro</p>

            <p>It shouldn't matter whether it's home or pro, the processor requirements should be the same for both. &nbsp;Perhaps, the former XP systems may have had a newer processor that supported NX. &nbsp;Or, you could try googling a way to bypass the NX requirement during
 installation. &nbsp;There should be a few links available, and some of the workarounds for Win8.x should work with Win10 as well. &nbsp;Good luck!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not familiar with your machine, but you might do a little research for your computers motherboard and BIOS settings... and take a look at this link... There are different names for NX depending on who wrote the BIOS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Mentioned in the article, it is possible your machine has it, but it's not Enabled...</p>
<p>That has been happening a lot even on some of the newer machines...</p>

            <p>Yea, I seen that already, the only thing I saw in my Desktop's BIOS is something called PXE And I didn't see that in the list of things that could be the same as NX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Computer I have is a Dell Dimension 8250 with a 3.06 GHz Processor (Intel Northwood Processor). I even tried going to Dell to see if there is a new BIOS that might have this setting as my current BIOS is A04. Looking on line and running a BIOS search
 program, it says there is a new BIOS for my computer. But Dell says there isn't any new BIOS for my computer.</p>

            <p>The big thing is Non-Execute Memory Protection and as you see below it comes in different flavors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Reboot your PC and press the key to get to your BIOS.<br />
<br />
Check the BIOS for a setting called any of these and set it to ENABLED<br />
<br />
"Non-Execute Memory Protection"<br />
"Data Execution Prevention"<br />
"No Execute Memory Protection"<br />
"Execute Disable Function" with a sub-menu of&nbsp; 'No-Execute Page Protection Technology."<br />
or similar wording<br />
<br />
It might be call CPU protection - Set it to enabled.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Some really sharp guy on the Tech Net forum provided a link to this YouTube tutorial on how to bypass the NX requirement...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know little about the process, but it looked interesting..</p>
<p>If you get Win 10 to run, it is hard to say how well it will run...</p>
<p>Those requirements are there for a reason...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you feel like experimenting, try at your own risk !!!</p>

<h3> stephenrgilman  say:</h3>
<h2>            A couple of questions about CMYK in Microsoft Publisher</h2>
                    <p>1) What color profile does Publisher use for CMYK? Does it have its own CMYK profile built in, or does it use the default profile that is set using Windows' Color Management Control Panel? (i.e. If I change the default color profile in Windows, does that
 change how Publisher handles CMYK?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Is there a way to use an ICC color profile other than the Windows default?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Is there a way to embed an ICC color profile in a Publisher file?</p>

            <p>Publisher, unlike InDesign, is not a color-managed application. Publisher uses whatever profiles are installed in Windows, so changing the Windows profiles will change Publisher's rendering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read about, but haven't tested, a kludge for embedding a profile whereby you create a customer printer that prints to a PostScript file. Then you attach a profile to the printer, print your Publisher file to and get a PostScript file that your print
 shop should be able to read and print. This is only worthwhile if your print shop has a set of Windows color profiles that they are willing to share with you and if they are willing to spend some time experimenting to get the print results you're after. Otherwise,
 just print a PDF and let them worry about the color balance.</p>

<p>oooh i just found "concatenate"...</p>
<p>so if i wanted have the range as a result in a single formula...</p>
<p>=if(counta(c2)=1,CONCATENATE((c2-weekday(c2,2)+1)," - ",(c2-weekday(c2,2)+7)),"")</p>
<p>except that it results in the excel date-time code... is there a formula to convert that back to text?</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

Try it like this...</p>
<p>=IF(COUNT(C2),TEXT(C2-WEEKDAY(C2,2)+1,"m/d/yyyy")&amp;" - "&amp;TEXT(C2-WEEKDAY(C2,2)+7,"m/d/yyyy"),"")</p>
<p>It'll return the result like this:</p>

    <title>What makes Design Ideas not give design ideas and how to fix it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> catbill  say:</h3>
<h2>            What makes Design Ideas not give design ideas and how to fix it</h2>
                    <p>The Design Ideas feature provided a nice design for a slide (Slide A) that contains a table. However, when I tried to get the Design Ideas feature to work for another slide with a table (Slide B), it says "Shapes aren't supported right now."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before being designed, the Selection Pane of Slide A showed Table, Subtitle, and Title.</p>
<p>The Selection Pane of Slide B shows Table, Subtitle, and Title. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, both slides appear to contain exactly the same elements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remove the table in Slide B, Design Ideas says it does not have any suggestions and no longer says anything about shapes.&nbsp; Thus, it sounds like the table is considered a shape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why was Design Ideas able to work with the first table but not the second table?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does Design Ideas consider a shape? What is the relationship between tables and shapes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do to get Design Ideas to work for the second slide?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<div>Hi Ma. Lau,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Someone else created the presentation and I don't know how they created the 2 tables.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Not sure what to say about replicating. My basic question is about the criteria that PP uses to determine that something is a shape. It does not seem to be consistent so I must be missing something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After testing some more, I found that when I copied text from a design element, I assumed I was copying a text box. I now see that it is considered a rectangle, and thus a shape.&nbsp; Should I assume that the best way to transfer text from a design element is
 to create a text box and then paste just the text?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have an example of a slide that contains a picture and one textbox. Design Ideas works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I add another textbox and input some text, Design Ideas says that it cannot work because there is a shape. Why? What should be done to get it this work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to share the link to the file with the example. However, the directions for doing so no longer work. When I click Share &gt; Share, there is no longer an option to share a link. I did this just a few days ago and know that it should be easy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can find an online version of the file that ends with&nbsp;app=PowerPoint&amp;wacqt=sharedby&nbsp; &nbsp;Is this the correct link for sharing?&nbsp; Do you happen to know the current way to share a link?&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is what appears when I click Share-Share. There is nothing about sharing a link.&nbsp; I asked if the online version of the file that I found (not sure if I could find that again) has the correct address for sharing.&nbsp; Could you or someone please answer that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am giving a presentation and really need help. It is incredibly frustrating that I can't share the file. I am concerned that this back and forth can go on for days without any clear answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in the meantime, can you or someone please answer the basic question: what causes PP to decide that a slide contains a shape? I especially want to know why it says there is a shape after I add a textbox with text.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>With further research, I have found that Microsoft says that Design Ideas only work with pictures and placeholders and does not work with textboxes. However, that is clearly not the full story, since it can work for a slide with just a picture and a textbox,
 as my example file shows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, once again, I am asking for a clear definition of when Design Ideas works and when it does not work.</p>

            Cool, other than the keyboard issue,&nbsp;build 9879&nbsp;works really well. Excellent multitasking. I'm using 64bit version on an HP computer with an I5 processor, 4 gig, DDR3 ram.&nbsp; Editing audio files with Audacity. Looking forward to the final version.

    <title>Word shows boxes for most characters for Uzbek Cyrillic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tcjohn78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word shows boxes for most characters for Uzbek Cyrillic</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am learning Uzbek and my teacher gave me a document with Uzbek Cyrillic on it. It display fine on my windows version of Word, but will not display on the mac Word 2011. Most (not all) of the characters show up as boxes/squares (there doesn't seem to be
 much rhyme or reason to which characters show up as it isn't consistent between files and even in the same file).&nbsp;The name of the font (on both the Mac and Windows) is Tahoma...which seems pretty basic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works just fine in the preview window you get in finder by pushing the space bar. So it seems that somewhere on the Mac it works fine. I do have both Russian and UzbekCyr installed as input sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend suggested I select the box on the "Edit" settings to "Match font with Keyboard", but that didn't seem to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2671048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this post</a>, which seems basically like what I am having trouble with, but it is for the Korean language specifically and, when I duplicated the file just to try it, Step #5 tells me that
 all fonts are displaying wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done some searching and several places mentioned how MS Word has a different font folder than system and user fonts (I think there is even one more spot on the Mac). Some suggested deleting that folder and things should work. But that seemed pretty
 drastic and like it might cause other problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any special font managers running (that I know of). Pretty new on the Mac though, so I might not be aware of stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any advice.</p>

            <p>Ok, found the solution (of course just after I posted). For some reason it appears Microsoft wants to fix some font conflicts with Mac, but not all....it leaves 9 problems including Tahoma.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.jklstudios.com/misc/osxfonts.html#officefonts has a great description of Mac fonts. Specifically, that link has a list of fonts at the end of the MS section which cause problems and need to be manually removed. I tried using "Font Book" to find
 these duplicates earlier, but they didn't show up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I closed office, removed the fonts (copied to desktop folder just in case) and the font cache&nbsp;http://www.jklstudios.com/misc/osxfonts.html#howtohandlefontcaches which nicely was easy for 2011 (at the end of the section again, also moved to desktop), and
 restarted Word and it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows why these 9 fonts weren't removed. I'd love to know.</p>

            There are a couple of licenses, specifically "OEM", that are tied to the hardware. But other licenses, "FPP" (Retail), can be transferred to new computers, provided you have the installation file and the Product Key.<br />
<br />
So, assuming the license on the old machine is 'FPP", if you can find the right installation file you can use a freeware tool extract the product key from the old HD to use to install on the new machine.<br />
<br />
Go into "Help about" to find out the exact name of the office bundle you have to find the installation file for.<br />

<div>
<b>I Need Installation files/CD for pre 2007 version of Office, What Can I Do</b>
<p>Once you get the installation file, make sure you burn a copy for yourself before returning the disk if it is borrowed.</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Find a friend (new or old) who has the right CD and is willing to lend you the CD. Unlike the very "old" DOS days when there was a signature file on the floppy, there is nothing unique on the CD to identify it. The uniqueness is provided
 via the Product key you use to activate it. So, you can borrow a CD without threatening their installation/activation.</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Ask at work if they have an installation CD you can borrow. There are often old disks "hiding" in dark corners of storage rooms</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you or a friend has a HUP installation, give it a try: http://office-watch.com/t/n.aspx?a=1453&amp;z=12 : (PS Let me know what happens if you do)</p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Try to find a local "PC Computer Club". There is almost certainly a geek or three with disks you could borrow.</p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Find a small local computer store or repair business. They often have old versions of software because they are still supporting customers using them.</p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>At the small repair business they may have old computers that customers had upgraded from that include OEM Office that you could now use</p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You could buy it online. Be very careful who you give your money to</p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Try websites like Kijiji or Craig’s List to see if you can borrow or buy it</p>
<p><span><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Try getting one from MS (if it works, please post back here, there are many interested people who would like to know that MS is still providing that kind of support) Replace MS Hardware and Software

<b>Extract Product Key from backup</b>
<p>For other computer mortals, this was my scenario:</p>
<p>1) old computer motherboard died and decided not to fix 3-yr old computer, purchased new</p>
<p>2) never stored Office Product key (no print out or email)</p>
<p>3) didn't want to pay for another</p>
<p>4) took hard drive out of HP Pavillion and put it in external HD reader enclosure so i could see old hard drive</p>
<p><span>5) downloaded&nbsp;Product Key extractorr tools:</span></p>
<p>5-A.&nbsp; Belarc gave nice summary, but only for booted computer</p>
<p>5-B.&nbsp; NS Auditor found it, but would have been $29.95 to unlock the grail of my product key</p>
<p>5-C.&nbsp; Magic Jelly Bean found it for free:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.magicjellybean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.magicjellybean.com</span></a> They key as Herb noted was that you must run as administrator.</p>
<p>6)&nbsp; Plugged in the product key to my new Windows 7 operating system and office is on line and running
<span>you have to "Load a Hive" which is the external drive and go to /windows/ file then it will give all same info.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Good News/Bad News:
<div><br />
<div>Bad News is that MS says they will not send out the replacement CD because they no longer support that version of the software. Pretty lame if you ask me. How much would it take to make the replacement CD? Too focused on profit and not enough attention
 to customer satisfaction. BTW generally I am a big fan of MS, just don't like their support attitude trying to make me buy the new stuff when the old stuff meets my needs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good News is that I found the freaking CD and the key so my problem is solved.</div>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>So, I purchased Microsoft Office Home and Business 2019 through Microsoft HUP on one of my accounts.&nbsp; I went to install it on a new laptop, and the install appeared to work.&nbsp; However, when I try to use word, excel, etc. it seems as if only the trail version
 is on the laptop.&nbsp; One thing I noticed is that my laptop administrator account is under another one of my microsoft accounts.&nbsp; Does this matter?&nbsp; What do I need to do to install it correctly?&nbsp; I went to try to reinstall, but I keep running into a message stating
 the product key was already used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please!</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;chad breaux,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to have a better understanding of your concern, we’d like to know more details about your issue. Kindly provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is there any Office program installed on your device aside from the Office Home and Business 2019 that you newly purchased through HUP?</li><li>How did you install the newly purchased Office program? Did you use a product key and associate it using a personal Microsoft account?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, make sure that you don't have any version of Office installed on your device. To check, just go to your
<strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; click <strong>Programs</strong> &gt; select <strong>
Programs and Features</strong> &gt; and see if there are different version of Office on your device. Note that if you have installed a 2013/2016 version of Office you need to uninstall it first. This is for you to avoid any error or issue while/after installing
 the 2019 version of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may check the following articles for the steps on how you can uninstall and reinstall your Office product:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall Office from a PC</a></li><li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/download-and-install-or-reinstall-office-365-or-office-2019-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download and install or reinstall Office 365 or Office 2019

<p>
</p><p>You get a prompt message of "<span>product key was already used" because you already redeemed it. You just need to use the Microsoft account that you have associated with that product key. you may refer to the steps on the
 link that I have provided.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>

</p><p>1. there are no other versions of microsoft office installed on the pc</p>
<p>2. I installed it following the "install" link when I purchased.&nbsp; I did log in using the account through which I purchased it.&nbsp; To be honest, I'm not exactly sure what it means when you ask if I associated it with a personal account.&nbsp; I have a few microsoft
 accounts.&nbsp; One using my work email, but I believe it is listed as a personal account.&nbsp; This is the account I used to purchase the software.&nbsp; I have another account, which is what is used on the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the home and office 2019 on my pc and went to re-install it and received the same message "This product key has already been used. Install from your Microsoft account".&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't know what this means because to get to this screen I had to log
 in to my microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty frustrated because I'm not completely sure I understood what I did incorrectly, but I've made a purchase and what I thought to be a straight forward install.&nbsp; Now, I can't seem to even attempt it a second time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do now?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have read the references that you’ve provided and followed the steps. &nbsp;I am attempting to install using the same account that i purchased the software with. &nbsp;However i keep getting the same error message. &nbsp;I understand what the error message means and
 your explanation of it. &nbsp;The problem here is that the install did not work. &nbsp;I’ve ubinstalled all morosoft office versions from my pc as the instructions state and am now trying to reinstall, but i am not able because the key has already been redeemed. &nbsp;I
 am not finding anything in the references you provide that explain how to achieve a reinstall when it is not working. &nbsp;Im getting the feeling that if the install does not work the fistt time then I’m out of luck. &nbsp;Certainly that is not the experience microsoft
 wants its customers to have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to use chad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the installation did not work successfully, but at what the error tells us the product key has been redeemed and you must need to remember the email address that you have used before. Take note that Office&nbsp; Home and Business 2019 can only
 be used to only one device.<br />

 need to uninstall anything!

<h2>            How to change from 3 to 12 month Skype Number subscription</h2>
                    I'm currently on a rolling 3 month subscription for my SkypeIn number. It's great but I'd like to get a 12 month subscription since it works out a lot cheaper. How can I make this change without losing my number?

<p>
</p><p><span><span>You can cancel the Skype Number 3 months Subscription on your account or wait until it expires.
</span><span>After it expires, Skype will reserve your Skype Number for you on your account for 90 days. This means no one else but you can purchase this particular number during this period. Then purchase the Skype Number again with a 12 months option.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Note: When you cancel your Skype Number, your subscription will remain active until its expiry date.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Cannot edit embedded Excel objects</h2>
                    <p>Version: Microsoft Mac for Word 15.28</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: macOS Sierra 10.12.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error message:&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>The program used to create this object is Excel.&nbsp; That program is either not installed on your computer or it is not responding.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To edit this object, install Excel or ensure that any dialog boxes in Excel are closed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>When trying to edit an embedded Excel object in my Word document, it reports the above error. However, if Excel wasn't already loaded, it does launch Excel before giving the above error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The document was created on this machine and has only ever been modified on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't previously tried editing embedded Excel documents on this version of Word on this machine before so I don't know if it was caused by any updates or settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            try to fix it by disabling all COM Add-ins in Excel 2010. I only had the one add-in, another system on our network had multiple add-ins.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Close word, and open a blank Excel worksheet. In Excel go to file&gt;options&gt;add-ins. Then down the bottom select COM Add-ins from the drop down menu and hit go. Uncheck everything hit ok. Close the options menu close Excel. Now open your word document and try
 to edit your embedded files. They should now work without a problem.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Jaqui,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't have "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">file&gt;options&gt;add-ins</span>" because this is Excel 2016 on Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a key problem I've found - the menu system on Mac Excel bears no resemblance whatsoever to the one in Windows Excel so I've found plenty of fixes for this problem in Windows but no idea how (if possible) to carry them out on Mac.</p>
<p>

            Can you fill us in on the details of how the embedded workbook was created? Were you using Word 15.28 when you inserted the Workbook? Which options did you choose in the Insert Object dialog? What file format is the Word document (.doc .docx .docm ,etc)?

<h2>            Office 365 Service Health Dashboard Reverted to v1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week, the Service Health widget in the Admin Center disappeared from my dashboard. I added it back via the "+ Add" tile, but it came in as the old version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/775fc1a5-a851-4573-9fde-cc86b2bcf20e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/775fc1a5-a851-4573-9fde-cc86b2bcf20e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, even when I click Health &gt; Service health, the old version of the page comes up (with an option to go to v2 at the top).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79012148-d1c1-4fd3-971d-f649b35bdc90" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79012148-d1c1-4fd3-971d-f649b35bdc90" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I return to the v2 service health widget and dashboard permanently? I don't want to have to click "Go to the v2 Service Health page" every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a first release customer using the E3 license across all users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Thanks for responding Suvarna.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email account on the PC is IMAP/SMTP with Outlook 2010 as the host. (The PC is Windows10, 64x)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app on the Android phone is an outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems possible to sync everything, but I'd rather it was kept to calendar or calendar plus contacts only.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that clarifies what I'm looking to reolve</p>
