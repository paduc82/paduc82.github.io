<h2>            OSK does not come up automatically</h2>
                    I got my SP4 yesterday and I love it, but there is 1 issue and it's pretty big and it needs to be fixed ASAP: when the keyboard is not attached - like when you are using it as a tablet - and you touch a text entry box, the on-screen keyboard doesn't pop
 up... you have to tap the little keyboard icon to bring up the on-screen keyboard... This is crazy! I'm sorry but this is unacceptable. The on-screen keyboard needs to automatically pop-up when you touch a text entry box, this is just basic, common sense stuff.
 The iPad Pro is coming out very soon and I'm certain it will not require users to touch a little keyboard icon to bring up the on-screen keyboard. Please, PLEASE fix this ASAP! Constantly having to touch the little keyboard icon to bring up the on-screen keyboard
 completely ruins the tablet experience. And it's not just me that noticed this. After using my SP4 for 10 minutes, the first thing my brother said about it was "the virtual keyboard doesn't come up when you tap on text boxes". (FYI he was just sitting on the
 couch holding it as a tablet, the keyboard wasn't attached)<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the SP4 is fantastic and I've had no problems at all. Please just fix this issue and it will be perfect!<br />

<h2>            Logitech Mouse left click requires multiple attempts to highlight click boxes in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro. After the update I had an issue with my Scroll wheel on my mouse skipping 87 lines at a time. I kept changing the settings back but it would not keep my 3 line scroll setting. So I uninstalled and reinstalled
 Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>Now I have another Mouse issue.</p>
<p>When selecting a checkbox anywhere for example in GMAIL to move or delete emails, I will have to click over and over before the box actually gets selected.</p>
<p>So I removed all mouse drivers and config files and started over from scratch with the latest and greatest drivers and same issue is still present.</p>
<p>I tried my Microsoft mouse...same issue.</p>
<p>Tried a usb corded mouse same issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I emailed the logitech and they are looking into it but I stumped those guys.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To better assist you about your mouse, we suggest for you to perform a clean boot to your computer. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This will help to eliminate software conflicts that occur
 when you install a program.</p>
<p>Please see this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for the steps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Steps mentioned for Windows 8/8.1, will work fine with Windows 10.<br />
<br />
<strong>Disclaimer: </strong>Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the KB article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Not enough storage space - 28 GB SSD</h2>
                    <p>Somehow I'm having a major storage catastrophe!</p>
<p>As a result I wished to start fresh by resetting my pc.</p>
<p>Yet somehow I have <strong>less than 1 GB remaining on my main drive</strong>.</p>
<p>Reset this PC tells me I <strong>need an additional 4.95 GB.</strong></p>
<p>I am using the <strong>Dell Inspiron 11-3162 </strong>laptop, preinstalled with&nbsp;Windows 10, running version 10.0. 14393 Build 14393</p>
<p>My laptop has a <strong>29 GB SSD</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I went to storage usage ( <strong>Start&gt;Settings&gt;System&gt;Storage</strong>&gt;This PC)</p>
<p>and found that:</p>
<p><strong>27.6 used out of 29.1 GB</strong></p>
<p>System and Reserved <strong>21.5 GB</strong></p>
<p>Temporary Files <strong>4.71 GB</strong></p>
<p>Apps and Games <strong>2.26 GB</strong></p>
<p>Documents 152 KB</p>
<p>Pictures 6.36 MB</p>
<p>Videos 0 Bytes</p>
<p>Other Files 33.5 MB</p>
<p>I looked for any large apps or games but found that they're only in the 71 MB - 129 MB range. Only one program is 129 MB</p>
<p>So 129 MB</p>
<p>108 MB</p>
<p>72 MB</p>
<p>52 MB</p>
<p>51 MB</p>
<p>47 MB</p>
<p>40 MB</p>
<p>28 MB</p>
<p>with a few lower values just doesn't add up. </p>
<p>I'm so confused. This doesn't make any sense. <strong>I've deleted all previous versions of Windows as well...</strong></p>
<p>I've backed-up my files on another device and deleted them off my hard&nbsp;drive. I wish to reset this pc yet I don't even have enough space to do that. I've looked all over the forums trying all sorts of things; free up space, storage manager, uninstalling
 programs, getting rid of everything, making windows 10 installation media and putting it on a USB&nbsp;flash drive to reinstall windows through pressing F12 or F2 at boot up, all efforts have
<em>failed</em>.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>

            Hi Jager.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are some good guides for managing smaller drives: 
<br /> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br />You should be able to get rid of all those temp files.
<br />
<br />You can also move your files into the cloud with OneDrive and get them on-demand: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then I'd do a Clean install which will reclaim all but 15gb of your drive and let you start fresh with a bare bones but optimal Windows 10 install that works far better than a factory install:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Yes, do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.

<h3> genieklug  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I use third-party applications to open certain files on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    Why does Microsoft no longer allow users to use third-party applications on Windows 10? Recent Windows updates have trashed some of my file associations. When I restore them, they just get reset, and I receive a notification: "An App Default Was Reset"
 - "An app caused a problem with the default app setting for .xxx files so it was rest to [MS App]." I prefer to use some third party apps, rather than the defaults that Microsoft insists on. Why can't I keep using my apps in Windows 10?

            <p>Hi William, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description, it appears that you are having issues with connecting to HomeGroup after installing the security updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>-<span> </span></span></span><span>Have you installed any third party Firewall or Security Software on your desktop computer?</span></p>
<p><span>-&nbsp;Which are the security updates installed recently?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong><span>Temporarily <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>disable the antivirus software</span></a> and disable firewall also if installed any and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is fixed, you may have to contact the program manufacturer to know about the settings that can be changed or if there are any other updates for this program.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. Running a computer without any security software can cause a potential threat to your computer. Hence, make sure
 to enable the Security Software and Firewall once you are done with the test.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is not fixed, try the following step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This issue could also occur if one or more required services are not running.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>The <span>Peer Networking Grouping</span> and<span>HomeGroup Provider</span></span><span><span>‌</span></span><span> services must both be running. Here's how to check this:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span><span>Open Administrative Tools by clicking the
</span></span><span><span>Start</span></span><span><span> button, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span>Control Panel</span></span><span><span>. In the search box, type
</span></span><span><span>administrative tools</span></span><span><span>, and then click
</span></span><span><span>Administrative Tools</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span>Double-click <span>Services</span>.<span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.<span> </span></span></span></span><span>In the <span>Status</span> column, next to the
<span>Peer Networking Grouping</span> and <span>HomeGroup Provider</span> services, you should see the word<span>Started</span>. If you don't see this, double-click the name of the service, and then click<span>Start and set the startup type of the service as
 “Automatic”.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Additional information on:</span></span></p>

<h2>            In Windows Fax and Scan, I cannot get the Fax Status Monitor to open</h2>
                    When sending a fax the status monitor does not open. I have turned Windows Fax and Scan feature off and back on. I have also deleted all the registry keys. I have reinstalled the modem (all's good). I have tested the phone line (all's good). How do I repair
 Windows Fax and Scan? It has worked in the past. Do&nbsp;I need to reinstall Windows 7?

<h2>            Graphics Tablets stopped working in Windows 8</h2>
                    Hey folks,
<div><br />
So, I've been using Windows 8 without a hitch now since it was released. I have two graphics tablets, an Intuos 3 and a CyberTablet 12000. Both of them were working fine, but this week I've plugged them in and neither are working.</div>
<div><br />
I've uninstalled the drivers, cleared preferences, reinstalled drivers, removed windows pen and ink settings, double checked the Tablet PC stuff to see if was interfering and etc, all to no avail. I thought perhaps at first it was a short in the cable, but
 after trying the same procedures with both it's not working with either tablet still.</div>
<div><br />
I can't figure out what's going on, and it's quite frustrating.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
                </div>

    <title>Can you share texture packs on Minecraft with people on same Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daddy schule  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can you share texture packs on Minecraft with people on same Xbox</h2>
                    <p>Hi. We have an Xbox One and play Minecraft. My son wanted a texture pack. I bought the Minecraft Coins under my account and then used them to get the texture pack under my account. We went to his account and the texture pack isn't available. Does he have to buy it too? Seems ridiculous. On Minecraft the Xbox One edition if you buy DLC it is shared across all accounts on the same system.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Transfer Windows OEM license to another user profile</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop, which came with a Windows 10 OEM license. It is now activated in my windows live account or something like that. If I reinstall the OS completely and log in on this laptop, no new activation is needed. This is fine. But soon I will buy a
 new laptop, and when it happens, someone else would like to use this laptop in my family. This would mean that I would reinstall windows, and the new owner would like to login with his/her user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is: what will happen? I would hope and expect that windows would activate with the new account on the very same machine without any serious problems. Is my assumption right? Is there anything extra I have to do in case of this kind of user
 change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>//Gergely</p>

            Hi GergelyLékó-Rózsa
<br />yes, you are correct it will activate without issue.
<br />the only other thing to do is to remove the device from you microsoft account 
<br />log into <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/</a>
<br />click on devices then on the device
<br />then in the blue bar at the top click more actions and remove PC
<br />it will automatically be added to the new owners account when they logon with their microsoft account.

<h2>            Unable to change shortcut icon on desktop </h2>
                    Unable to change shortcut icon on desktop after taking the appropriate steps ie. right click on icon, "change icon" under Properties, select new icon, apply and ok. But the icon remain unchanged. Many encountered the same problem. Am using XP Prof SP2.
 Repair action such as delete iconcache.db and run Tweakll to rebuild icon; changed colour quality setting etc, but no help at all. Please advise how to solve this

            Are you clicking on true short-cut icons or Program icons?&nbsp; I don't think you can change a Program icon but this is how you can change a Short-cut icon:<br />
<br />
After doing the <strong>Right-click \ Properties \ Change Icon</strong> do you do the next step of&nbsp;<strong>Browse</strong> to a new icon,
<strong>select it</strong>&nbsp;,&nbsp; then click on <strong>OK \ Apply \ OK</strong> ?<br />
<br />
This method worked for me in Win95, WinME and with current WinXP Pro (sp3)<br />

            I have tried the methods described here and am still unable to change desktop shortcut icons.&nbsp; The desktop icon flashes as if its trying to change, and the icon shows up on the properties window at first, but then changes back to the original icon.&nbsp; I
 have been able to change icons in the past...I don't have a clue what is different.&nbsp; No settings have been changed;&nbsp; no programs added or deleted.

            I'm having this problem on multiple machines at work.&nbsp; It started after we patched for the URL/Shortcut vulnerability in August. &nbsp; I've tried every "fix" I can find and nothing it helping.&nbsp; It only affects shortcuts, not user profile specific.&nbsp; Rebuilding
 the icon cache doesn't help.&nbsp; Systems have been scanned with multiple AV and malware scanners with no errors.&nbsp; I'm finding lots of topics through these forums and across the web of people reporting the same problem, but no resolution yet.

            <p>I have the same problem. I can create a folder on the desktop (Windows 10) and change the icon without a problem. When I create a shortcut to a folder tho, I cannot change the icon although nothing is greyed out and the Apply and OK buttons seem to work.</p>
<p>Wait... It worked. Only it doesn't show up until I did a refresh (F5) after clicking on the desktop. Why this doesn't happen automatically in Windows 10 is something they could easily correct in the next update, I hope.</p>

<p>Hi Viree,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've successfully downloaded the Pure Flix app on your PC, you should be able to find in Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features. However, if you were unable to download it because it's not available in the Apple Store, then we suggest that you get in
 touch with Apple support or the app developer for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have other Windows concerns you need assistance with, feel free to post it here in the community.</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes.&nbsp; Those are likely your choices for the five to six year old (since initial release) device.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If installing their previous device drivers in compatibility mode, using generic device drivers or getting one made for the operating system you are choosing to utilize (and using a different operating system is not an option for you, or at least not *because
 of* just a printer) - then you usually have to replace the device as it is no longer supported by its manufacturer for (usually) current operating systems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a new phenomenon nor will it likely cease.&nbsp; If you purchase technology today that interfaces with the current operating system(s) for you to utilize it fully - it is likely in 5-10 years, it may not work with the new operating system(s) and the
 manufacturer will have likely stopped supporting it.&nbsp; Printers/scanners have been known for this for years.&nbsp; Other peripherals are similar.&nbsp; Internal components as well, but at a lesser level in many ways.</p>

<p>i just got a new pc with windows 7 home premium and have just about finished migrating all my files and applications over to it...what a p.i.t.a. pc migration is!!</p>
<p>anyway, i was playing around in my computer starting to look at some of my pictures and none of the raw images (nikon nef from d3 body) will preview. the jpegs are fine. is there a raw viewer for windows 7 yet, i didn't see it on the ms website. any other
 ideas on why i can't see the previews would be appreciated. one of the last glitches to be fixed before finishing up the migration..but it's a biggie if i can't see previews of any of my pix! i can preview using my old vista pc, must have downloaded a specific
 application or codec to do so. wondering if there is a way in win 7 or i've got a bit of a problem.</p>

            Hi RalphManotti 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps, Connect your Printer to the computer and Switch it ON. In case of Wireless printer, Switch it ON and connect it to the Wifi network.
<br />
<br />1. Run printer troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; On the right side, Click Printer &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />If you have HP Printer - HP provides a tool for HP printers to troubleshoot - HP Print and Scan Doctor. Download it, launch it and follow the onscreen directions to locate problems and fix them
<br />
<br />Download Link - <a href="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/printers/hppsdr/HPPSdr.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ftp.hp.com/pub/printers/hppsdr/HPPSdr.exe</a>
<br />
<br />2. Update Printer Driver
<br />Download printer driver from printer manufacturer's website and reinstall.
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall and reinstall the Printer (Credit to Andre Da Costa, MVP for providing steps)
<br />A. Uninstall Printer
<br />Click on Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Scroll down and click Programs and Features &gt; Select your printer &gt; Select Uninstall
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Select your printer &gt; Remove device
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Scroll down and click Print server properties under Related settings &gt; Under Driver tab, look for your printer &gt; Select it and click Remove button at the bottom
<br />
<br />B. Install Printer 
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers &gt; Reinstall the Printer driver &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; On Right side, Click Add a printer or scanner &gt; If Windows detects your printer, it will be listed &gt; Select the printer and follow on screen directions to set it up (In case of Wifi printer, your computer should also be logged into Wifi network)
<br />If Windows doesn't detect your printer, then you will get a blue message - Click The printer that I want isn't listed
<br />If you are using Bluetooth / Wirelss printer &gt; Select Add a Bluetooth, wireless or network discoverable printer &gt; Choose the printer &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />If you are using wired printer &gt; Select Add a local printer or network printer  with manual settings &gt; Select Use an existing port &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />
<br />4. Clear Spooler
<br />Type Services in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to Print Spooler &gt; Right-click and choose Stop for the Print Spooler service &gt; Go to C:\WINDOWS\System32\spool\PRINTERS. You can also type %windir%\System32\spool\PRINTERS into the address bar in Explorer if the C drive is not the default Windows partition &gt; Delete all the files in this folder &gt; Services console and right-click and choose Start for the Print Spooler service
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>
</p><p>A situation wherein two accounts show under the same email address happens when a legacy Skype user
<em>(account was created using a Skype Name)</em> signed in to Skype using the associated email address
<strong>instead </strong>of his <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10858/what-s-my-skype-name?q=skype+name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype Name</a></strong>
<strong>without fully updating the accounts into one</strong>, which then resulted to a newly-created account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account creation process allows a user to only have <strong>one account under one email address.
</strong>It is not possible to create two or more account under one email address.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your question. Let us know if you need further assistance or additional information.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Skype is not able to make outgoing calls (while it works with the incoming calls).&nbsp;<br />
I uninstalled it, deleted the relevant folder on&nbsp;<em>\AppData\Roaming</em> (following the instructions of the Community), then installed again the latest classic version but nothing changed.</p>
<p>Then I tried with the last 8.10.0.9 Desktop version but not even this one works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OS is an updated 64-bit Windows 7; I also tried disabling the firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

    <title>Unable to connect Win 7 Pro PC to Win XP WOrkgroup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobvitter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to connect Win 7 Pro PC to Win XP WOrkgroup</h2>
                    From a Win 7 Pro 64 Bit PC I can see the Win XP PCs if I type \\name in the search box or URL line but the connection disappears as soon as I close Explorer. They do not show up under Network.<br />
I cannot see the Win 7 PCs from any Win XP PC and I can't ping them<br />
I tried turning off the Win 7 Firewall but that did not help.<br />
I tried changing the network ID on 2 different XP PCs but that does not work:<br />
&nbsp; right click on My Computer, select Properties<br />
&nbsp; click Network ID - shows computer is part of a domain which it is not, there is no server<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changed to not part of domain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changed Workgroup name to be same as Workgroup name in main screen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; save changes and reboot<br />
&nbsp; When I go back to look the changes are not made, reverted back to domain and wrong Workgroup name ("Workgroup")<br />
What could be blocking me from making changes to the XP settings? I am logged in as the Administrator (the only User on all the XP PCs).<br />

            <blockquote>Thanks for the links. I tried all the suggested settings and many more from other articles but I still cannot get the Win 7 Pro SP1 PCs to see the Win XP Pro SP 3 PCs.<br />
Even tried shutting down IPv6 and changed sharing encryption to 40 or 56 Bit<br />
All the Win 7 PCs can see the other Win 7 PCs and all XP PCs can see all other XP PCs.<br />
I can Ping the XP PCs from a Win 7 PC but I cannot Ping a Win 7 PC from any XP PC.<br />
The Win 7 PC IP addr are 192.168.2.xxx, the XP IP addr are 192.168.1.xxx.<br />
Could this be a router issue?<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>XP cannot recognise Win7 Homegroups so the Win7 machines need to be networked using user accounts and passwords.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All of the computers should be in the same workgroup and&nbsp;same subnet (ie. 192.168.1.x OR 192.168.2.x)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You didn't as much say but it seems as if you might be using 2 routers, or a router and some other device that is also using DHCP to&nbsp;assign a different range of&nbsp;IP numbers on your LAN. There should only be one DHCP server on the network. If you are using
 2 routers, rewire the connections between them such that one router is the sole DHCP server and providing all of the&nbsp;routing services while the second router is&nbsp;acting&nbsp;simply as a switch with no routing services.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The network type for the Win7 computers should be set to Home or Work. Choosing Work avoids having to deal with getting rid of the Homegroup defaults.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Make sure network discovery and file &amp; printer sharing are enabled for Home&nbsp;or Work Networks on the Win7 computers</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As for accessing shared files etc. , the XP computers will need to log on to any of the Win7 computers with the username and password of a user on&nbsp;that Win7 computer.&nbsp;The commonly recommended workaround is to create a single common username&nbsp;with the same
 password on every computer in the network. (If you find a better way I'd love to know what it is myself)&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Encryption level shouldn't&nbsp;affect connectivity&nbsp;(highest is best)&nbsp;as long as it is the same for all machines.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Win7 firewalls might be defaulted to block incoming Pings, or it could be your router configuration. Anything coming from&nbsp;a 192.168.1.x IP could be regarded as an external network connection&nbsp;by the 192.168.2.x router and incoming Pings&nbsp;might be&nbsp;blocked
 because of that.</p>

            Hey CM.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Loss of thumbnails recently is largely caused by the Pictures folder being merged with OneDrive picture folder which is not creating thumbnails for some reason we're waiting to be fixed.  
<br />
<br />To check this right click OneDrive cloud icon in System Tray, open Settings, then AutoSave tab, change Pictures folder to be Saved only on the PC.  it will not be sync'd to OneDrive any longer although the pictures in the Onedrive folder will remain while new ones will be added on PC to the User's Pictures folder only.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC was running poorly and I decided to do a recovery reset. Right after, it ran through some complications. I've been getting an error message:</p>

</p><p>Prompting to use a few options F8, ESC or Enter, however, when I choose either options "it goes back to the blue option screen" stock on that screen. Now, I've tried searching options and followed some, creating a USB windows tools for Windows 10, but I
 have not been successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? I've been trying for hours with no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight, instructions to correct issue will be greatly appreciated.</p>
