<h2>            Blue screen of death. windows xp home on dell e520</h2>
                    &nbsp;i have had the blue screen of death since 10/17 and have found no solutions.<br />
I cant access safe mode (with networking, command prompt, etc.), nor any other <br />
option from the f8 options menu. I cant change the memory cache or shadowing in which the blue screen recommends either.
<br />
Can anyone help<br />
<br />
it seems this happened over night with automatic updates. my brother got up and the screen was stuck on windows is shutting down. he restarted it by pressing the button and this screen comes up with codes like 0x00000050 or 0x0000007e and some other codes.
 nothing i tried works. i cant get any internet access when i connect that computer. what are my other options. also my mom lost the discs when she moved that came with the computer.<br />
<br />
any help will be great..

<h2>            texting</h2>
                    I just got a forced Skype update on my old and new--seemingly combined&nbsp; Skype programs.&nbsp; My texts come across as gibberish after a few words to the receiver on both programs.&nbsp; I can't remove the new program from the start menu, and my old program seems
 contaminated by the forced update.&nbsp; Any help?

<p>Tried it again after installing the latest Skype from Skype (2nd time...first didn't do well).&nbsp; I have NO messaging at all now.&nbsp; I had lost all messaging before I tried your instructions this 2nd time.&nbsp; Looking at SETTINGS for SMS, I get the following:</p>
<p><span>SMS sync in enabled. (no phone connected)</span></p>
<p><span>We were unable to find an SMS relay enabled phone.</span></p>
<p><span>Check that SMS relay has been enabled on your phone by
</span></p>
<p><span>Going to SKYPE &gt; Settings &gt; SMS &gt; SMS backup and Sync...This last part doesn't seem available as a path.</span></p>

<p>Please clarify what exactly are you trying to do. Are you sending an SMS using Skype? or you're trying to use SMS relay? Kindly provide a screenshot so I can have a better view of the issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Screen shot not available...not sure how to do that easily.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let me give you an example.&nbsp; I have a phone I use every once and awhile.&nbsp; I have sent it text messages in the past.&nbsp; So, I will use that as an example.&nbsp; I pull my phone up in Skype.&nbsp; It comes up on the right in Skype; at the bottom of the pull up is a place
 for SMS messages that I can send to that phone.&nbsp; I print a message, and hit an arrow (for send).&nbsp; In the past a green check mark would come up when the message was picked up by the recipient (above the message writing spot).&nbsp; This newest Skype just says
<em><strong>sent</strong></em>...no green check mark.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, the message does not make it to that phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; IF, I want to text another person, I pull up their phone, it comes up on the right half of Skype, with a place for a message at the VERY bottom.&nbsp; In the past, I would put a message in that spot, hit enter, and the message would come up above the area
 for placing a message, with a green check when the message was sent.&nbsp; Nobody gets a message anymore.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The relay information is all I could find in Skype about SMS messages.&nbsp; I have no idea of its significance.&nbsp; I have no idea why I cant text anymore.&nbsp; I had just downloaded and installed the newest Skype (for the 2nd time) when I was able to fix most
 of the problems I had encountered with the 'new' Skypes; unfortunately, this new one popped up.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, SMS messaging is&nbsp;currently not available&nbsp;in the newest version of Skype. For the meantime, we strongly recommend you utilize the Skype for Windows 10 (UWP). You can send us your feedback to help us improve Skype experience.

<p>Actually, this program says it is Skype for Windows 10.&nbsp; Skype 12.7.597.0.&nbsp; But, if you say it has no texting, that, at least, explains why I can't text.&nbsp; Rather lame of the writers to have a place for sending texts, but removing the ability to text.&nbsp; Oh,
 how I wish we could get back to the version that worked perfectly.&nbsp; I can't even find a program to attach to this one that automatically records calls, like<em> i free Skype Recorder</em> did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for all your help.</p>

            <p>I am running windows 10 on a stock ASUS G60JX laptop with Kaspersky Internet Security.&nbsp; On March 1 at 11pm I was shutting down my machine when it not I had updates for windows it would do before shutting down.&nbsp; I accepted it and watched it do the updates
 and the shutdown.&nbsp; The next morning I booted the laptop and got the blue screen saying it could not boot because "system thread exception not handled". Windows then went into auto repair mode, failed, rebooted into the blue screen and kept looping this way.&nbsp;
 it was suggested by the Microsoft Community member ZigZag3143 that I upload dump files.&nbsp; Used the Win10 disk to access command prompt and searched for files.&nbsp; They do not exist.&nbsp; I then used the bcdedit command to restore the legacy safe mode boot menu that
 is accesses via the F8 key.&nbsp; Rebooted and successfully accessed the safe boot menu.&nbsp; Tried every item on the menu and I ended up with the same blue screen.&nbsp; checked for restore points but there were none.&nbsp; I had set this up before but remembered Microsoft
 updates have a thing for turning this off and trying to revert to Windows defender at the same time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior notes I have indicate my machine has done this before when Microsoft updates load generic video and audio drivers on my machine.&nbsp; The wwy I had to solve that was to go back to a previous restore point and then lock out automatic updates so I could
 pick and choose what to load.&nbsp; No more blue screens until I updated to Windows 10 and had auto updates.&nbsp; Have restored the kaptop twice because of Microsoft updates which wipes out all my apps, including Microsoft ones.&nbsp; Takes a month to restore all apps and
 the way they are configured.&nbsp; Right now it appears I may have to reset again and I dont want to.&nbsp; Thats thousands in business losses.&nbsp; I am hooing someone on here has some insights&nbsp; that can help me get around this.&nbsp; I did a 100% data backup before I let the
 update happen but now I wish I did a full image and checked to make sure a restore point was set.&nbsp; my bad and my lesson learned.</p>
<p>
Any and all help would be appreciated.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
Windows had a real nice feature in version 8 that would reverse an installation if it ran into issues.&nbsp; Win10 does not.&nbsp; in fact, they even disabled safe mode and the auto restore points that were in 8.&nbsp; Now your advice is good but how to I get past the BSOD.&nbsp;
 Hard to make changes when all the suggestions require me to actually require me to have windows up and running :-)&nbsp; I suspect the video driver because windows always updates it wrong.&nbsp; Has for as long as I know them and worked with them.&nbsp; Any way to get around
 that screen through the command prompt.&nbsp; That is all I have access to.<br /></p>

            <p>I have the same issue.</p>
<p>My computer was fine until Microsoft pushed there flaw update on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSI ghost laptop.</p>
<p>2 SSD with RAID 0.</p>
<p>intel / nvidia graphic card.</p>
<p>i7 processor</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kaspersky</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having the infinite loop.</p>
<p>f8 with safe mode doesn't work.</p>
<p>bcdedit command with rescue usb doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>totally stuck on here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thw only way to access on my computer is through command line with rescue usb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You guys really need to focus on your code. What have your QA team done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>via cell phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>solved.</p>
<p>I reverted update via recue usb. It didn't work.</p>
<p>After that, I typed "sfc /scannow" on the root of c drive.</p>
<p>And the rebooting has done his job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the conclusion is that why your restoring system update image doesn't work is due to broken file system.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is really frustrating, as I've tried every possible solution from installing new drivers for Wacom, to updated Photoshop. Please help!</p>

            Hey Rohan,<br /><br />No driver trickery required here. Microsoft has acknowledged this issue with one of the newer KB hotfixes and provided a workaround:<br /><br />You can resolve this issue using the following steps:<br /><br />From Start, search for cmd<br />Right-click Command Prompt in the search results, and choose Run as administrator<br />At the command prompt, type or copy/paste:<br />reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Pen /v LegacyPenInteractionModel /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f<br />Press Enter<br />After the command executes, the issue with panning and scrolling should be resolved.<br /><br />Microsoft is working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release.<br /><br />Hope that helps.

<p>Hi!I haven't found answer to my question.Perhaps you didn't understand me.Sorry for my bad English.</p>
<p>I want to set up my system as I want, not as Microsoft&nbsp; want or someone else.I paid for it, it is my basic right.</p>
<p>You see,I have an allergy to viruses and ads.My trick is helping me stay away from ads and viruses.I want to set a global blocking rule&nbsp; of my system proxy&nbsp; ( also&nbsp; my default browser is&nbsp; IE) and have the ability to allow some sites according to my decision
 only. Or (if we are talking&nbsp; about some application )in&nbsp; the settings of&nbsp; particular program to&nbsp; make it possible&nbsp; a direct&nbsp; internet connection (for ex. in google crome you must set in shortcut after .exe&nbsp; "--proxy-server=" without quotes of cause)&nbsp; .In win7
 I have this&nbsp; trick&nbsp;&nbsp; working, so I am trying to figure it out before starting the update process. For ex. skype: I don't see&nbsp; any proposal and banners, but still can make any conversations.And any program that&nbsp; have using IE settings will be blocked.Because
 of my default browser&nbsp; is unable to get to internet, almost all backdoors unable to working properly too :)So, please check it out, if my trick is working on win10 too. And&nbsp;&nbsp; what system programs&nbsp; are not working if my trick is enabled on win10? I don't want
 to lose a lot of time on upgrading and downgrading because of this.Very many thanks.</p>
<p>P.s. As far I understand,&nbsp; win10 is using Edge as a&nbsp; default browser.Fine, as along it is unable &nbsp; to connect to&nbsp; internet, it&nbsp; is perfect&nbsp; for me and will be my default browser.</p>

                    <p>I'm trying to use my ICOM PCR1000 shortwave radio receiver using Windows 10. &nbsp;I am unable to get my laptop to recognize the radio. &nbsp;I keep getting error messages indicating that I have a Comm Port error. &nbsp;I have tried all Comm Ports (1 thru 10) without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to fix the compatibility error by setting up the ICOM PCR1000 program to run in Windows 95. &nbsp;No joy. &nbsp;Tried to run it in Windows XP, still no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that this is a rather esoteric problem. &nbsp;ICOM hasn't been much help..all they say to do is run the compatibility troubleshooter, which I have done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Dell Inspiron E1505 Wireless Connectivity fn&#43;f2 buttons not working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron E1505 laptop that originally had Windows XP, but I upgraded it to Vista, then to Windows 7, then eventually to Windows 10. The only issue that I have ever had with this "old" machine is that my speakers burst for some time now and
 so I have to use earphones all the time. My upgrades have never had issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I upgraded to Windows 10 when it came out last year, everything was great, not an issue. This week however, my wifi options stopped showing, and only airplane mode was there. My wifi light was off, so I suspected I accidentally turned it off, which
 I did once and learnt that I could use the Fn+F2 keys to turn it back on, and fix everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fn+F2 combination did not work this time around. Fn works with other Function keys and F2 still works as it should...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to settings&gt; Network &amp; Internet, to turn wifi on and airplane mode off, there are no wireless setting options, Not even a Tab that says Wireless/Wifi. In the airplane mode setting options, I see the switch to switch on/off Airplane mode. Then below
 that it says</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We couldn't find wireless devices on this PC"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check Device Manager, it says the Network Adapter installed is a Broadcom 440x 10/100 Integrated Controller. I have a 2GB RAM, Genuine Intel Processor with T2300 @ 1.66GHz 1.67GHz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<h2>            A few questions</h2>
                    
<p>Just started Mass Effect 2 the other day (It had been sitting unplayed until I finished the first game) and I see the game has changed in several ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I want to ask about the ammo abilities. Now they are no longer attachments to weapons, and are selected from the power wheel instead. If you select an ammo ability from a party member, will it only apply to them or can Shepard benefit from it too?
 Do the ammo abilities run out after a while or do they stay in place until you switch weapon?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was also wondering about the Cerberus network. I remember it saying something about having an EA account, but it went ahead without mentioning setting one up. It is possible the same email I use for my Xbox Live account was the same one I used to set up
 an EA account. If you used the same email does it automatically link, or did I somehow bypass the need for an EA account? I possibly made one a while ago, I cannot remember.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you still use medi-gel to heal teammates mid-battle? So far I've only seen it being used for reviving them when they are down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally I wanted to know whether anyone had tips on controlling by squad during battle. A couple of times I've seen them standing in the open and they are soon killed. In ME1, I just let them do whatever they wanted but it would be nice to be more tactical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

 to level 4, you get the optioj to pick a more powerful version, or a version which can be shared to all squadmates. Ammo types stay active for the remainder of the mission, unless your squadmate dies.</span></p>

 buy/find upgrades which will evolve medi-gel so that you can replenish both health and shields, but you need to have recruited the professor so that you can research upgrades on the Normandy.<br />

            At the sign-in screen select the Power icon in at the bottom right hand corner and then select Restart. Do this 4 times without actually signing in and see if after the 4th restart you can sign-in as normal.

            If anyone else has this problem, hit ctrl alt delete, go to the power option, hold down shift while clicking restart. Go to advanced&gt;troubleshoot&gt;system restore. Only way to deal with this fkn headache

<p>Okay I assume you have restored now. I was going to suggest trying out Safe Mode to see if the desktop was found.</p>
<p>Do you know which update is was it sounds like it was Feature update 1903. If it was you rolled back to your previous version, is that correct.?</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine, Lenovo W541 windows 8.1, suddenly stopped sending signals to my&nbsp;Iiyama Gmaster GB2788HS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was working with this setup yesterday and everything seemed fine. I've checked all of the cables but still the mini DP is not sending any signal. The device manager is showing no problems and there are no windows updates left on this machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me out?</p>

<h2>            How to Fix 2203 error failues during boot-up, HP S&#47;W installation and JAVA S&#47;W upgrades.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Lately I'm experiencing 3 installation failures each based on the 2203 code.&nbsp;The first&nbsp;is a "tray app" trying to&nbsp;load at bootup, another occurs during a full S/W&nbsp;installation of an HP all-in-one printer and the last involves simply trying to install
 a later revision of JAVA S/W. I'm also prevented from uninstalling both the HP and JAVA original installs. I can't determine what the trayapp boot up nuisance error is trying to install and it finally stops the attemps after 6 to 12 cancel commands. I've not
 had any success getting around the&nbsp;second two problem areas. I have tried out two different types of registry scan/repair tools also with no success</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have seen several stories on this forum with similar problems but most all seem to be focused on trying to install various Microsoft Office packages. I also see guidance to overcome their problems.&nbsp; Thus I'm wondering if I were to follow those
 same steps with my problems could I possibly expect similar success?&nbsp; And further, would I have to repeat those steps for each problem separately or would a single "repair" suffice for all?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks for any suggestions.</strong></p>

<p>Your problems may be as a result of your HP printer software, what is your HP printer? did it ever function or is this a new printer?</p>
<p>HP has a utility on their site to completely remove their software, even if Add/Remove dialoge appears to have removed it. You might be advised to disconnect the HP device, uninstall their software then reboot., befor trying anything else.</p>
<p>Where are you seeking to update Java from?</p>
<p>Registry scanning tools / utilities are for the most part snake oil, and can render your system completely unuseable.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Driver Power State Failure When Using Photoshop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Driver Power State Failure When Using Photoshop</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is very recent (I bought it in November 2018). It's a HP Spectre x360 and it has been working great since the beginning. I use it with many apps all at once and it has always run smoothly... But about a week ago, it started crashing whenever
 I use Adobe Photoshop CC. I'm not sure if there was any major update prior to the crashing as I don't use Photoshop every day, but ever since last Wednesay, whenever I open Photoshop it crashes a few minutes after while I'm using the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is the BSOD with the error "Driver Power State Failure". After some research online, I figured it must have something to do with a graphics driver, but I'm not really good with this so I don't know... Since then I've tried updating the graphics
 drivers, a new version of Photoshop became available so I updated it, and then I even "forced" a Windows 10 Update to version 1809... but the same thing keeps happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problem using Adobe Lightroom, but every time I use Photoshop it crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea what's happening and/or what I should do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mélissa</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I found a solution that worked for me. Go to your power settings within the control panel - change all of those settings to Maximum performance (there are guides on how to do this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER - one additional thing I tried, and it has stopped all BSOD from occurring for me is to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- open up your Nvidia control panel (open control panel and use the search bar to find the Nvidia Control Panel if necessary).</p>
<p>&nbsp;- On the left hand side of the Nvidia Control Panel click on "Manage 3D settings"</p>
<p>&nbsp;- on the right hand side, click on the tab "Global Settings"</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Scroll down on that list until you see an option that says "Power management mode" and change this to "Perfer Maximum Performance"</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Click on apply, then reopen photoshop and you should now expereince no BSODs that refer to driver state power failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works for you all and for anyone else searching for a solution to this!!</p>

    <title>Right Click Problem. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> koark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Right Click Problem.</h2>
                    <p>I have been having this problem with right clicking, where it will reload desktop when used. In File Explorer, the same thing happens, but for file explorer instead of my desktop. The computer freezes, then removes everything from the taskbar and the desktop
 for a second, then they all show up again.<br />
Found a fix online where I needed to run "regsvr32 /i shell32.dll" in the run file, but it did not work, with the error "0x8002801c", and the fixes on an article for this error on this website did not work for this.<br />
I am running Windows 10, with an OS version of 1709, build of 16299.125. More information might be necessary, if so, tell me and I will post it here.</p>

            Modifying the registry did not work when I did it, I still have the problem.

Sorry for the late response.<br />

EDIT: After doing the things on the reply to the post on this website: https://www.windows10forums.com/threads/cannot-right-click-on-file-since-windows-10-update.7983/ , everything seems to be working just fine. This time, unlike the last time, I tested out
 things. This, even fixed a problem that had nothing to do with this, which was This PC crashing File Explorer.<br />

<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What happens when you start the laptop, do you receive any error message?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to remove the battery and connect the laptop to the AC power and then try to start the computer to check if the issue is with the battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to contact Dell support regarding the issue as this could be an hardware issue.</p>

            Hi George, I'm Bill. <br />
<br />
These errors are usually caused by a conflict in your PC's C++ runtime libraries, so I'd recommend downloading and installing the latest version. Here's a download link:

<br />
Once you've installed the latest version, reboot the PC and see if the game works. Let me know how you go! Thanks!

                    <p>After my Windows 10 ran the upgrade last week, my USB port F and G became ports G and H.&nbsp; Also my computer stopped recognizing the USB where my printer was connected and I had to move it to another port to get the printer to work.&nbsp; Now it occasionally won't
 open files from the new G USB port and won't open an application I have on that drive, although it does not give me any error messages when I try to open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas/help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            <p>Tried decreasing your overclock, by overclocking you are stressing the system, its not uncommon to have problems if you overclock</p>
<p>Have you run the bootable memtest.org?</p>

            <p>Lookup custom control template for button style. Basically you create a custom control template and use a textblock and bind content to text. You can then use control triggers to change the look for for rollover, rollout, etc.</p>
