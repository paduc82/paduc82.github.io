<p>Hello Talia,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>One of the possible reasons why you are getting that error message is that the driver you're trying to install is not compatible with the version of Windows you're currently running. To help you with your concern, we recommend that you install
 the drivers through Windows update. Check the steps below:</span></span><span> <br />

    <title>How to sort pictures by date in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to sort pictures by date in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have recently replaced a desktop which was running Windows 7 with a new desktop which is running Windows 10.</p>
<p>On the old machine I was able to save pictures by date. In the folder&nbsp;a date bar would appear and under it thumbnails of all the pictures taken on that date could be viewed.</p>
<p>However, on the new machine when I save the pictures by date thumbnails appear with the pictures in date order but no date bar is present.</p>
<p>Has this&nbsp;feature been removed in Windows 10 or is there something that I can do to&nbsp;regain this feature?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<h3> alecs75  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where are you Microsoft&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I joined this forum right after I started to have issues with my Surface Book (i7/256/gPU) and since then I come to this forum every single day at least 5 or 7 times per day to see what other people are doing to fix all the reported issues. What I am starting
 to notice is the change in tone from all users, from a peer-to-peer support and collaboration space to a place where we are all expressing our frustrations and disappointment while we count our days to make a decision if we return or not the Surface Book.
 But I think that the WORST part of all, (at least for me) is that <strong>Microsoft is not stepping up to address any of these issues</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We know you (Microsoft) read these comments and follow some of these threads closely. The only thing we ask you to do is to acknowledge us, jump in and speak up. Tell us that you are working on it, share ETAs... something. Most of us believed in the product
 and pre-ordered it the same day it was launched. The least thing you can do is to work with us so we can help you to fix the problems. What is the point of having a forum if you are not going to lead the conversation?</p>

            I consider you all lucky since you have at least received your surface books and had chances to return them. I keep getting informed that my order is pushed back. It's happened three times so far. With all of the issues being posted and the lack of response
 from Microsoft, I am really considering just cancelling the order. The MacBook pro may not double as a tablet but for the 2600 dollars I paid for nothing more than a promise that I some point in my life &nbsp;I would get a surface book, I could have gotten a MacBook
 and an ipad. It really is no surprise that the surface book has as many issues as it does. That is all thanks to Microsoft's deployment tactics. They were extremely secretive with the product up until its release. Any decent developer or manufacturer&nbsp;knows
 that products need to be thoroughly tested before&nbsp;they are released, and it is a shame that a so-called tech-giant like Microsoft would get it so wrong. There was no real-world testing of functionality. Sure, they tes

            I agree with you completely. I'm on my replacement Surface Book. Luckily I haven't encountered the freezing issue again, but I'm getting horrid battery life - no where near to what was proclaimed and I consider just surfing the web light use. I really
 wish that Microsoft would just address these issues....<br />

</p><p>There's just no possible way the QA Team didn't catch all these obvious bugs. Don't blame them. I'll bet they were begging not to ship yet, but some manager thought patching after shipping would be better than delaying. Fire that guy. Not the poor engineers
 who must be completely embarrassed by this disaster of a premature launch.</p>

            <p>I'm on my first replacement, batch 1541, and it froze today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to keep using it to figure out if it was a one time thing or otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last surface started out well, then during two weeks started freezing up up to 3-4 times a day while I used it. (batch 1542) Basically making it impossible to take notes in class as I had to keep resetting the device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Crossing my fingers but somehow I think there are some 1541, more 1542s, and some 1543s with this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably production issues or bad i7 processors according to rumors circulating.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks, I had seen that but it doesn't list specifics I was looking for and mentioned in the OP. I want to make sure to try and conserve the best resolutions, frame rates and sounds specs I can so am trying to find out if, ie all .wav is supported, or
 all .mov. I can convert raw files to whatever needed yes, but still want to keep quality and not have frame rates dropped to 30fps or sound dropped down, or resolution dropped by whatever video editor I use.

    <title>Windows 10 Creators Update &#40;Explorer.exe crashes&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ken_ccnp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creators Update &#40;Explorer.exe crashes&#41;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Issue: Explorer.exe crashes when clicking on the background wallpaper, utilizing the start menu, hitting the taskbar (no response), or when typing in the search bar. After any two or three letter combinations, it freezes. Task manager also freezes. "New
 Task" from Task Manager also freezes and stops responding. This happens after playing a game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to reproduce:<br />
<br />
Install Win 10, update to Creators Update and install all drivers relative to the hardware from the manufacturers website (in this case MSi). Per winver.exe, I am on Version 1703 (OS Build 15063.138). Once this is done, turn OFF all features of the "Game Bar"
 (no DVR, no Game Mode). Install up to date NVIDIA drivers. Now, install League of Legends. Play one game, after the game finishes, close the client (or leave it open). Now attempt to use the search feature or navigate explorer.exe. It should be entirely locked
 up. This is 100% reproducible. It also occurrs when alt+tabbing in the middle of a game and attempting to use anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fun fact: Opera crashed 100% of the time I tried using it during this scenario as well, my assumption is because it relies on something in Windows which is also failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: "Rolling back" isn't an option. Windows.old folder was deleted, I do not hold options to roll-back as it eats up my NVMe drive and can cause excessive writes. My only other option is to reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide any LOGS or TRACE files to review, and I'll gladly provide them. Blind requests to roll back, or re-install Windows are not welcome, as I'm well aware that my most likely option is going to be: "Install W10 again and don't upgrade to the Creators
 Update, because it breaks things." <br />
<br />
Also note, this issue was NOT present prior to the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used "ccleaner" after this issue started to delete menu cache et cetera, no change.</p>
<p>I used checkdisk on C:/ and found no issues.</p>
<p>I used sfc /scannow, found corruptions and fixed (mostly duplicate ownerships on folders). No change.</p>
<p>Symptoms go away with a reboot, until I play another game of League of Legends.

            <p>All, I'm going to mark my own post as solved and by myself as this is what I did to fix the issue, although this does NOT provide root cause, I did not have days/weeks to sit around and wait for a response, so I took matters into my own hands. This issue
 DOES NOT happen anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Visit https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>2) Click "Download Tool Now"</p>
<p>3) Use Media Creation Tool to prep an 8gb/16gb USB stick to install Windows 10 Build&nbsp; 1703 (Creators Update).</p>
<p>4) Reinstall Windows wiping the hard drive clean (deleting all partitions, click unallocated space --&gt; continue)</p>
<p>5) Reinstall all relevant drivers and windows updates</p>
<p>6) Reinstall all games, tools programs, benchmark software, et cetera</p>
<p>7) Go into Game Features in Settings (new settings menu since win10 is garbage, let us JUST use Control Panel please).</p>
<p>8) Turn off all Game Feature/DVR/Game Mode settings.</p>
<p>9) Download AMD Ryzen Power Plan, install and use.</p>
<p>10) Download and install Samsung NVMe driver for the hard drive, as it will try to use Microsoft's version which has ****-poor performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No longer have search/cortana issues, no longer locks up after games, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT I THINK is that there were issues with "step upgrades"&nbsp; where we go from build to build to build, and not everything gets cleaned up and gets proper permissions, as multiple folders on a clean install --&gt; anniv update --&gt; creators update ended up being
 corrupted and with duplicate permissions per sfc /scannow.</p>
<p>Doing a clean install of Win 10 Build 1703 has, so far, fixed my problems, however it points to bigger issues in Windows upgrade process.</p>

<h2>            Please fix Cut and Paste for Google Docs</h2>
                    Hi. I often have to use Google Docs, but would be happy to use Microsoft Edge. Unfortunately, when I use cut and paste within google docs, the formatting gets messed up (e.g., italics are lost, and then its pasted into some weird format in the target Google
 docs. Google's response is to "contact the browser's developers" if you can believe this!

            Google Docs is a word processing app. Microsoft Edge is a web browsing app. These are two different things. If you have a question about Google Docs, here is the

<p>Thanks for your comments! I did document it there and they said it was a browser issue, and that they would not do anything about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Docs is a word processing application, but one that only works within a web-browser. It's a web app, just like the web version of One Note.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, you'd think that Google would fix this problem, since they created Google Docs, and they'd want people to be able to use it from whatever browser they have. For whatever reason, that's not their attitude (Weird?)</p>

            Looking at the <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2375082?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
system requirements of Google Drive</a>, Microsoft Edge is a supported browser. Have you tried using another browser?

            Yes, it works fine in Chrome. It's only edge that has the weird cut and paste problem. Normally, this would be Google's issue, but they don't care.

<p>Well, it might be with the script that runs in Google Docs' capabilities that handles pasting data when using Microsoft Edge. If you have another device, or might know someone that can reproduce this, we can see if it is an issue with Edge or Google Docs
 or with your device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally, it wont be a problem to others. Since some people prefer to use other web browsers aside from &nbsp;Edge. I, for one, use both Google Chrome and Edge. Edge has this special "edge" when you use it. Pun intended. But that's my preference. It might be
 different with others.</p>

<p>I was able to replicate it</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Create a document with some formatting (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MhthEWyxOSRvoBiGnN4nBc6bWGI4dk6W-jCbXh83n8I/edit?usp=sharing)</p>
<p>2. Use normal cut and paste to put it into a second document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/10l10HRNLOJgb3kwBtqOCeZV98XY_uza9K5bZdf4zYok/edit?usp=sharing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll see that the formatting is off in the 2nd document - example the line spacing is 1.38 when pasted (weird).</p>

            Indeed. It is different when using different browsers. Better yet send a report to both Google and Microsoft. I don't know about sending a report or complain here since members of this forum are volunteers and not entirely associated with Microsoft.

                    <p>I want to eliminate the need to log into my computer each time it starts up. &nbsp;I would like it to boot up to the desktop. &nbsp;I have tried the command line "control userspasswords2" and unchecked the box "users must enter password". &nbsp;I restarted my PC and now

<h2>            360 S blinking green light, crashing, and now avatar problems</h2>
                    
<p>ok, so my sister just gave me an Xbox 360 Slim (matte finnish). worked fine for a few days, then the disc tray started having problems. i could press the eject button and it would open and start up, but once it booted up the tray became unresponsive to anything
 and the green power button flashes, meaning i can press the eject button to start it up, put a game in and close it fast, but once it boots up the tray is stuck in whatever position its in (open, closed, and anywhere inbetween). in the off chance that it DOES
 work (though i have no idea what makes it work) i can play a game for about 5 minutes before it crashes to the profile select screen and the blinking green light returns. everything else worked fine untill tonight, i tried to sign onto my profile and it took
 me the create an avatar again. im very fond of my avatar, and my gamerscore may not be very high but i dont really want to lose it, or any of my saves as i have been using this hard drive for a while (from my old xbox that got the red ring). i tried to look
 up the warenty info to see if i could send it in and it said it had an "open repair order"(?), so i assumed sending it to be repaired wasnt an easy option, and i would sooner bash it to pieces than send it in for repair for a "small" fee of $150, might as
 well buy a new one. so anyway, what the duce is going on? and why cant i have a working xbox? someone please just help me own a WORKING and HEALTHY Xbox 360!!!</p>

<p>I may know a way to sort your freezing problem out the new xbox gets over heated easy maybe open a window near to your xbox or place a fan near to it.</p>
<p>Your Disc tray may have been knocked &nbsp;</p>
<p>games not being read your consoles Laser that reads disc may be faulty </p>
<p>If i haven't help maybe get in touch with xbox on the phone or talk to a Microsoft support staff through there chat system</p>

            Not sure what your are asking for. You can open it by pressing on language icon near time in right bottom corner. If you ment how did UK layout appeared there. There is no UK layout when I boot PC It appears after I try to type / login somewhere, but it
 does not appear when I press ALT+Shift on its own.

<p>Thanks for your reply. Kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Reset PC. Reset your PC and keep your files so we can totally eradicate the UK language.
<span>Resetting lets you choose whether to keep your files or remove them, and then reinstalls Windows. To get started, go to<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><strong>Update &amp; security</strong><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><strong>Reset this PC</strong><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><strong>Get
 started</strong><span>&nbsp;and choose an option.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 2:&nbsp; Modify the registry. You may refer to the answer of Wizmagister on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-start/french-keyboard-layout-randomly-added/5567b03f-2bc6-4670-b6d0-00a067defc78">
link</a>.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>Important: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify
 the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a
 problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get oblivion to work on Xbox one</h2>
                    <p>I bought an oblivion disc for the 360. I tried putting it in my Xbox one but it won't play. It says that it is not one of the backward compatible games but I know that it is. Any idea why it won't work?</p>

Is this a GOTY edition of Oblivion or just the standard version?

            <p>I do not think you are going to be able to get any DMP files following a stop 7b during installation of XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop 7b is normally associated with the disk access mode being incorrect. XP has no native support for AHCI operation. If you want to run your disk in AHCI mode&nbsp;you need to supply the drivers via floppy disk at install time, look for the F6 message as you
 boot from the installation CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the Toshiba website does not appear to provide the means to create such a floppy (though it does have some XP drivers), so unless you already have one, your alternatives are as follows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go into BIOS setup and switch the disk access mode to IDE/ATA instead of AHCI. Again, the Tosh website does not appear to give any details to assist with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Slipstream the AHCI drivers from here</p>
<p><a href="http://support.toshiba.com/support/modelHome?freeText=3335974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.toshiba.com/support/modelHome?freeText=3335974</a></p>
<p>into a new installation CD (unfortunately I cannot give a direct link to the page so you need to find the AMD AHCI driver by clicking&nbsp;the Drivers tab then filtering by HDD). You can use&nbsp;nLite to create the new installation CD and you can get it here</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nliteos.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nliteos.com/download.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you are wanting to create a multi-boot environment for some reason, IMO you should question your motives for wanting XP over the Windows 7 that, according to Tosh's support pages,&nbsp;the laptop came with.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>If your system will not boot, you will not get past:</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><em>Please follow our instructions for finding and uploading the files we need</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em>Did your new system not come with any operating system?</p>
<p>Are you certain that your new system supports/has drivers for XP?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For that error message the problem is more likely that since that computer has SATA drives and since there are no SATA drives included with on a genuine bootable XP installation CD the installation is having trouble communicating with the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are using a genuine bootable XP installation CD, right?</p>
<p><em><br />
</em>You could use a process called slipstreaming and your existing genuine bootable XP installation CD to create a new bootable XP installation CD that includes the SATA drivers if you can find them and that is alot of work.</p>
<p><em><br />
</em>It would be easier to see if you can get into the CMOS configuration and temporarily change the HDD interface to something the XP installation can understand (something other than SATA),&nbsp; perform the installation (they you are going to have to update drivers
 anyway) then change the setting back to SATA when you have the proper drivers installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you have some homework to do.</p>
<p><em><br />
</em>I performed a Google search on:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Toshiba Satellite BIOS</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>and there are lots of results that tell you how to get into the BIOS so unless you already know how to do that, you may have to read through some of those results and find out what works.&nbsp; Since I don't have your system I can't see what works so that will
 be up to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also Google something like:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Toshiba&nbsp; Satellite&nbsp; 0x0000007B</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>And read through some of those results where the discussions are mostly about SATA configurations and also lots of silly and useless advice for things to try that are not going to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do get into the BIOS you will have to find the HDD configuration/interface section and may have to do some trial and error to get it to work.&nbsp; Make a note of any settings you change so if things get worse, you can put the original settings back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on what you find in the BIOS here are some notes that I have accumulated and if you find the "secret" to yours, let us know what you did to get it to work and that will help other folks in the future:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It sounds like you need to enter the BIOS on your system by pressing the "Del", F2, F10 or F12 key (whatever key is right for your system), locate the section where the hard disks types and hard disk interfaces are configured and temporarily change the setting
 so the XP Setup is able to find the hard disk.<br />
<br />
Where to find the adjustment and how to change it depends on your system manufacturer and BIOS version so you may end up having to just look around for it and do a little experimenting.&nbsp; If you know your system make and model, we can probably help you find
 a manual.<br />
<br />
You need to locate and change the interface mode for your primary hard disk in the BIOS so that when the XP Setup loads, it will be able to locate the hard disk.
<br />
<br />
Before making any adjustments, you should make a note of what the current BIOS settings are so you can change them back when you are finished.<br />
<br />
The adjustment varies so here are some examples I have accumulated:<br />
<br />
The adjustment is made in the BIOS and could be under Integrated Peripherals, SATA Device Configuration, SATA Mode or something similar.<br />
<br />
Make a note of what the current settings are before making any changes so you can change them back when you get done or if things get worse.<br />
<br />
After you make the changes, save them and see how things look.&nbsp; You may have to try a few things to get it to behave.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to RAID/SATA mode, change the mode to IDE.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to SATA, change the mode to IDE.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to SATA, disable SATA mode.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to AHCI, change the mode to ATA.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to AHCI Emulation Mode, change the mode to IDE Emulation.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to SATA, disable SATA mode and/or change the mode to ATA.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to SATA Native Mode, disable SATA Native Mode.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to RAID/Autodetect AHCI, change the mode to Combination.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to RAID Auto/AHCI, change it to RAID Auto/ATA (this was a Dell XPS 420)<br />
<br />
On some system of unknown make and model, In the Integrated Peripherals menu, disable" On Chip IDE Channel 0
<br />
<br />
On an Acer Aspire 4720Z the mode needed to be changed from "AHCI Mode" to "IDE Mode"<br />
<br />
The WWW says this works on some Dells:&nbsp; "I had to set my SATA Operation to ATA instead of AHCI"<br />
<br />
After making the adjustments, ACCEPT and SAVE the changes, and restart the system and see if it will now boot on the installation or Recovery Console CD.<br />
<br />
Here are some additional ideas about changing the BIOS to recognize the SATA drive to boot from CD:<br />

            Thanks Tomas...I opted for the zero-day option and did a complete factory restore on my Dell to when I first bought it. Then spent the next few days applying all the updates to Win7 and re-installing my apps! Now waiting for the RTM release of Win10 to
 download. It's unfortunate as I was having great success with Win10 preview builds right up to the last one..10240. C'est la vie!

            I've been dealing with this for 3 days, too. I was going to purchase a new copy of Windows 7 and try to install it, but apparently you've tried that and it failed, too. I can't believe no one has an answer. The problem is the same all over and all the
 advice they give is to go to the start menu or log in under a different user - neither of which is possible.

            Perhaps un- and re-installing of the mouse driver in device manager does the trick? Or updating that driver?<br />
Did you try with another mouse?<br />

<p>
</p><p>Your adapter will probably not work because it requires a driver that is installed on the desktop side.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Surface RT does not allow one to install desktop programs, so this is what is causing your issue. (It mainly runs apps from the&nbsp;Windows store on&nbsp;the
 "modern" start screen side of Windows RT.) You will need to upgrade to a Surface Pro tablet--it has a fully functional desktop like Windows laptops and desktop PC's.</p>

</p><p>Is this the wireless adapter that's built into the Surface RT? If so, my reply to grammaloma is obviously wrong. I somehow assumed she was trying to install the drivers for a new piece of hardware. Apologies to both of you!</p>

<p>Since it worked yesterday you should restart your router and xbox one by unplugging first before trying this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is usually a NAT problem. See here for tips: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how I'd do it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Access your router's admin/config settings and set your router's MTU size to manual and 1492.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Set your xbox's IP to static and to a higher number on your dhcp table (192,161,1,149). Keep subnet mask, DNS server and gateway the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Set the DMZ IP to that IP you have set on your xbox and reboot your router and xbox one and you'll have open NAT and no more issue.</p>

    <title>Issue where monitors drop in and out of detection, messing up multimon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doctord0s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue where monitors drop in and out of detection, messing up multimon configuration.  One of the monitors is a LCD HDTV.</h2>
                    Multiple Monitor Issue.&nbsp; Have 4 monitors, one of which is a 46 inch LCD HDTV.&nbsp; Have it cloned with a 24" Dell LCD (same video card, have same image displayed on both).&nbsp; For some reason the computer randomly stops detecting one is attached, which naturally
 causes the Windows 7 version of TMM (Transient Multimon Manager) to freak out and readjust the displays.&nbsp; This happens inexplicably, sometimes the 24" will drop off, sometimes the 46".&nbsp; It happens often.<br />
<br />
What I am looking for is a way to disable whatever the Windows 7 version of TMM is, and let me hard specify what each monitor output should be.&nbsp; I will not be changing this configuration, so I would just prefer to lock in the settings.&nbsp; This is something many
 HTPC users I think would agree with, as we are not often adjusting resolutions, etc.<br />
<br />
This was never an issue with Windows XP, but with both the Beta, RC, and now RTM of Windows 7 it is a problem.&nbsp; What is the new version of TMM, and is there a way to turn it off?

            This doesn't fix it for me.&nbsp; If I turn off or switch inputs to my extended monitor and then turn it back on or switch it back the the computer input everything that was on it gets "rearranged" back onto my primary monitor.&nbsp; Changing that registry entry
 changes nothing.<br />
<br />
What makes the way it works more useless than ____ on a boar is that things don't rearrange when the monitor is switched off but when it is switched back on!<br />
<br />
The RC version before the release didn't rearrange to single monitor mode unless you told it to.&nbsp; I can't imagine why that behavior was "fixed" and sure want to find a way to unfix it.

            Sadly, this fix does not work for me either. <br />
<br />
I upgraded to Windows 7 on my HTPC, and this most annoying behavior started. Whenever I change the input on my HDTV
<em>or</em> AVR, and then go back to the Windows 7 HTPC, all the windows are scrunched up in the upper left corner. There was no such problem in Vista.<br />
<br />
I really hope someone discovers a way to get Windows 7 to behave like Vista in this regard!<br />

            same here - suggestion does NOT work.<br />
<br />
I have Win7, 64-bit. 2 video cards: both ATI Radeon HD (one is 4670, other is 2400 XT).&nbsp; I have 4 monitors: 2 identical 23" widescreens and 2 identical 19" normal aspect.&nbsp; The 2 widescreens are on the 4670 card and the 2 19" are on the 2400 card (with a splitter).&nbsp;
 I have Win7 configured that the 2 widescreens are monitors 1 and 2 (and both set for their max resolution), and the 2 19" show the same desktop (3|4) (and set for 1024x768).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This works perfectly for me - until I reboot (or logoff/logon).&nbsp; Windows rearranges my monitors, and it even changes the resolution of my 2nd widescreen down to the lowest resolution.&nbsp; Each reboot, I have to manually adjust the Screen Resolution page - very
 annoying.<br />

<p>I see that some time has passed since the last entry here. I am having a similar problem&nbsp;as DoctorDOS&nbsp;with my DisplayPort connection using Windows 7 Professional.</p>
<p>Now here's my problem. I just got a new monitor that I use for my main monitor in&nbsp;my setup. It has a DisplayPort connection that I use with a DisplayPort cable from my DisplayPort video card(no adapters). Similar to DoctorDOS's problem, the monitor intermittently
 disconnects itself. When this happens, I hear the "device disconnected" sound and the desktop rearranges itself onto the other monitor, which&nbsp;has a DVI input. After a few seconds, the DisplayPort reconnects itself and I have to rearrange the desktop. Sometimes,
 I go for days without a problem but some days it disconnects and reconnects itself pretty often.</p>
<p>I tried the solution suggested above but my Registry has no such TMM location as shown above.</p>
<p>Are there any new solutions that have come out?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            Having the same issue as DoctorD0S: one 32" Sony LCD TV connected via DVI/HDMI, and one Samsung 19" LCD monitor connected via DVI to an nVidia GTX260. When Windows 7 boots up, it always starts to re-detect the displays.
<div>Sometimes it succeeds, sometimes it detects only one of the displays, sometimes it takes half a minute of crazy blinking and rearranging (and the dun-dun sounds of losing devices), and sometimes it just gives up and turns off both displays, at which point
 my only option is to turn off my PC and start again.</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>It's really random, and really annoying. Every day I have to spend 5-10 minutes until it finally finds the right display setup.
<div><br />
<div>So yeah, I definitely would love to see an option to turn auto detection off.</div>

            Experiencing a similar problem with an external monitor connected to a laptop.<br />
<br />
OS: Win7 pro<br />
External monitor (DVI port): lenovo 2440p<br />
Machine: Malibal Lotus P150HM<br />
Vid Card: ATI 6970M<br />
<br />
The external monitor is recognized on startup, but is dropped about 1 min later. Attempts to detect the monitor (using the screen resolution utility) cause the monitor to wakeup from sleep mode but it remains blank ... then goes back to sleep.<br />

            <p>The idiotic "answers" by MS Support:</p>
<p>You were told repeatedly to stop advising people to update Drivers or whatever.&nbsp; The problem is a documented moronic feature of Windows7, having zilch todo with drivers !!!&nbsp; hOW MANY TIMES DO YOU NEED TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE DEAF &amp; BLIND, MS SUPPORT GUY?</p>
<p>There's a "feature" or should we say problem, whereby Windows7 detects any monitor connected via modern digital ports (DP, HDMI, TB) beign turned off, and forces moving entire desktop to monitor still being on, in multimonitor environment - which happens
 to be prevalent in our industry (Engineering e.g. CAD/Design), Graphics design, Medical, and MANY home users also, these days.</p>
<p>Use brains when reading bug reports, dear MS idiot.</p>
<p>Fix the bug and quit blaming nVidia, AMD (ATI), Intel HD, or "drivers".&nbsp; I hold MSEE degree, near-complete PhD and you tell me I forgot to update da** drivers?</p>
<p>Read this line again, Microsoft idiot:</p>
<p>This is a feature (by design) whereby PnP monitor connected via DP/HDMI/TB to Windows7 is being polled for powerOn/Off state, it may or may not use DDC signal by the way, we can't tell.&nbsp; YOU should know better than us, customers !!</p>
<p>I tried to disable DDC in my high-end IPS $1000+ monitor, but no effect.&nbsp; I seroed Registry Keys used in nVidia or ATI monitor status polling - no effect.
</p>
<p>Disgusting feature of Windows7 which moves desktop to another display, when one is turned off in multimonitor setup - is Disgusting simply b/c user is deprived of ability to disable such behavior specifically for DP/HDMI-attached Monitor. Hot PnP is a necessity
 usually, but NOT always - in the case of monitors, anyone with braisn wants to turn them OFF for the night or leaving room for longer than e,.g. an hour.<br />
SLEEP/STANDBY is NOT equivalent to what we're asking to fix, we are asking (get a magnifying glass you Microsoft guy, if you can't read properly):<br />
To restore ability to TURN OFF [arbitrary] MONITORS, with a physical/hardware button in a multimonitor setup which is becoming prevalent - w/o fear of Windows7 autoswitchign desktop to a monitor reamining ON thereby WREACKING HAVOC w/windows sizes, locations,
 icons, you name it.<br />
Behavio ris due to a simple fact that movign desktop to different resolution ersizes windows previously drawn on that monitor, you just turned off !<br />
Do you understand it is a terrible Productivity killer?<br />
Want a simple example where you always use multimonitor setup?&nbsp; Here:<br />
Suppose you're doing serious, professional grafix work on your laptop, which thankfully is adequate in both Processor &amp; Video specs, e.g. my HP EliteBook8540w &amp; Elitebook8740w, all you want is to attach an EXTERNAL professional (IPS) display, mostly for size
 reason (HP ELitebooks include internal LCD which is also pro IPS/"Dreamcolor" type but too small for full-scale work).<br />
What do you think you just got yourself??&nbsp; Windows7 treats it as a MULTIMONITOR SETUP!&nbsp; So you canNOT turn off g0* da** external monitor w/o Windows7 autoswitching internal LCD ON.&nbsp; Next thing you know your desktop is messed up b/c internal LCD is obviously
 lower resolution!<br />
And finally, what adds to the pain, is my professional Videocard in this laptop, which alone costs many hundreds$$$, is configured to drive EXTERNAL display &amp; via DPport, when Windows7 stubbornly invokes internal LCD after I turn off external Monitor, this
 same settings is almost damaging my internal LCD - too bright.&nbsp; B/c external IPS monitor is a professional, medical grade type that is much less bright than cheapo TN monitors.&nbsp; I rush to turn external back ON and leave it On wondering how long will this problem
 will remain unfixed ??</p>
<p>Even WindowsVista blamed for many issues comparing to WinXp, even Vista - convenient target of jokes, did not exhibit this stupid behavior.<br />
No tto mention WIndowsXpo which doesn't wreack your desktop when one display out fo multiple is turned OFF.
<br />
More than retarded, it is actaully a showstopper for professional folks.</p>
<p>Tired of rearranging desktop everytime one of the monitors is turned off, so tired I don't care to run spell check in this post.<br />
I am angry.&nbsp; WindowsXP developed by Microsoft in Israel, was the best OS in history, now that it aged &amp; faded into history, there's no equally well designed equivalent.<br />

            <p>Apparently this is still an issue ?</p>
<p>Every time I boot my win7 32bit pc with a two monitor setup I have to go to the resolution and click on DETECT to put the monitors back to the correct settings.</p>
<p>( rightmouse click on open desktop area, screen resolution, detect )</p>
<p>Of course all the desktop Icons are auto arranged from I wanted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to turn this behavior off ?</p>

<h2>            Why are there no Windows 7 drivers for the RT9450 keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I still get a tremendous amount of database work done using my RT9450 Keyboards (Microsoft Office Keyboard).&nbsp; The board was definately&nbsp;created by someone with a lot of data clensing experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, that great productivity stopped with Vista
 and WIndows 7.&nbsp; MS no longer manufactures the board so I guess they think no one uses it anymore.&nbsp; Big mistake!</p>
<p>I would like to get a driver for Windows 7.&nbsp; Does anyone know if a third party driver is available?&nbsp;&nbsp; Could someone tell me how to get in touch with the appropriate people at MS about reintroducing the RT9450 keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
