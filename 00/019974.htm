<h2>            Create pivot table with same datafield in rows and columns</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>i want to count how many times same person traveled with another person based on route id. Example of data:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>PERSON</td>
<td>ROUTE ID</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>And i expect output like this, where column and rows are persons and data are counts traveled with other person:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>PERSON</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I thought with simple pivot table i could achieve this by adding same field in row label and column label and count of ROUTE ID to values but excel wont let me do that. Is there some workaround?</p>

            <p>You could use a custom VBA function for this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Function CountEm(data As Range, p1, p2) As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim c1 As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim c2 As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim v As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each c1 In data.Columns(1).Cells<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If c1.Value = p1 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v = c1.Offset(, 1).Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each c2 In data.Columns(1).Cells<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If c2.Value = p2 And c2.Offset(, 1).Value = v Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CountEm = CountEm + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next c2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next c1<br />
End Function</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say your data table is A1:B13, and the second table is D1:J7.</p>
<p>In E2 (the first cell in the "interior" of the second table), enter the formula</p>
<p>
</p><p>=CountEm($A$2:$B$13,$D2,E$1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fill down to row 7, then fill right to column J (or vice versa).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get slightly different results than your sample "pivot table", by the way.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One can solve this with the PowerPivot.&nbsp; Here&nbsp;are the PowerPivot formulas</p>
<p>
</p><p>Distinct Routes=</p>

<p>DISTINCTCOUNT(travel_data[Route ID])</p>

    <title>Have You Received Phone Call Saying Your Computer Has A Problem&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dimples2015  say:</h3>
<h2>            Have You Received Phone Call Saying Your Computer Has A Problem&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is a common dilema. &nbsp;The Technical Support Company employees from India and up to this last year were located there. When you made a transaction with company you were charged for International Service Charges from your bank. &nbsp;Just had another encounter
 this week, which is one of many in the last year. &nbsp;<br />
The representative says the program I have downloaded called "Microsoft Security Essentials" is showing there is a problem with my computers operation. &nbsp;They speak in their language and most of the time they are going on so you can't get a word in to ask very
 important questions. &nbsp;What problems are you seeing? &nbsp;Why should I allow you access into my computer? I know that even though they are talking as though this is part of the over $200.00 I have paid, I insist on seeing what it is they are getting their information
 from. &nbsp;They have me enter the connection to Teamviewer where they take over and are in control of what they want to go into and correct. &nbsp;Since I insist on documentation of what they are doing, we communicate with Notepad and each call is basically has the
 same purpose. &nbsp;Purchase more that is necessary to repair the problems and this time I was told that the previous purchases did not cover what was needed to clean up many errors in red in the Event Viewer in my Microsoft Windows program. &nbsp;They proceed to show
 me four hundred or more errors and ask me if I can see them? &nbsp;We will clean these up for you and get everything working again. &nbsp;Was my computer not working before? This particular call progressed into a lot of garble that you can hardly understand and with
 each question specifically stating what was promised and what that action would cover. &nbsp;The same response, "Miss .....no need to worry, this will be all taken care of, never answering my question but continue to probe into the reason for his call. &nbsp;Then, it
 gets better. &nbsp;I finally got very upset with what they were telling me that I had purchased previously; documented what it would cover and monitor, opposite from what the rep was stating. How many times are you going to call me and try to get more money for
 nothing? Oh, Mame, no need to worry, we will get this all taken care of? &nbsp;Because I have the docs to backup what was promised in writing, I again ask what it is this $149.99 is necessary. &nbsp;That was for your computer, this is needed for your network. &nbsp;Just
 how dumb do they think we are? This session is going on 2 hours now even though I told them I did not have the time to watch what they were doing at this time, that meant nothing, he just kept going on and on. &nbsp;Let me talk to my billing department and will
 be right back. &nbsp;After another 45 minutes back and forth, he said that they would refund the $200.00 + purchases and the check would arrive by UPS in 4-5 days. &nbsp;I thought it was going to be ok, then he asked if I had heard of the new law that any phone line
 that is recorded cannot take credit card information? &nbsp;I had not heard of this and he said I would need to go to a location and get a Green Dot Money Voucher and once they got the validated number from the back of the card they could proceed with the Network
 Download? &nbsp;I got mad and they told me that the Microsoft does not cover your network; then it got even better. &nbsp;I left the line for a few minutes because it was going on three hours at this point and when I got back he started in again and said I would need
 to put $149.99 on the Green Dot card and after I get the Registration Number on the back of the card, they can put the money back on the card or mail it to me. &nbsp;Why? With that response I advised that I was getting all my paperwork and reviewing it and could
 not talk to you anymore. &nbsp;I foolishly left my computer open with their connection still active hoping they would go in and correct any issues that needed to be addressed. &nbsp;I was away for approx. one hour and when I got back there was a box on the screen saying
 having problems starting up your computer. &nbsp;Please take this article as advice and use it as you may need. &nbsp;Ask a lot of questions; I had used their service for 12 years and it was over this last year that all the problems have occurred. &nbsp;Oh, one more thing.
 &nbsp;The rep also told me just before we hung up that the Microsoft Security Essentials was not used with their company that they used the program they had previously eraced. &nbsp;That was it! &nbsp;Refund? Probably not! &nbsp;Problem corrected? &nbsp;Probably not! So why did they
 call me? &nbsp;Money!</p>
<p>The only final response I have is, "Just How Dumb Do They Think We Are?" &nbsp;We do need a reputable support company we can trust and count on that what they say they will do is done, without additional expense. If you have one, please let me know.</p>

<p>
</p><p>it's only a dilemma if you allow it to become/be one. Anyone receiving an "out of the blue" phone call from &lt;anyone&gt; about your PC should do one thing and one thing only HANG UP (unless you want to get creative and record things for comic relief). No reputable
 company will ever phone advising that they have noticed issues with your computer PERIOD. No different then someone knocking on your door telling you that your car has sent diagnostics "home" and they are there to "fix the problem" so "please&nbsp;hand over&nbsp;the
 keys to your car so it can be checked/fixed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for reputable support company - good place to start if you can't get answers to a problem in one of the answers forums related to the issue would be</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Support<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/ContactUs/TechnicalSupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/ContactUs/TechnicalSupport</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond that - find someone who knows what they're doing as it relates to the problem you're encountering and also happens to be someone you can trust - not much different then finding a good car mechanic.</p>

            <p>Thank you Karl for your reply. &nbsp;You are correct about what you wrote and I do know that but this is a company I have been working with for over 12 years. &nbsp;Just recently having problems.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft has already taken action and filing a lawsuit because they are misrepresenting their position selling the software. &nbsp;They told me only a technician can have access to download.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t connect PC Suite to my phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tlhobbes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect PC Suite to my phone</h2>
                    I'm using the latest version of PC Suite (6.82.22.0) on Win XP (SP2) and I can't connect to my Phone, which is a Nokia 6234.<br />
It once worked with an old version of PC Suite (4.88), also it worked for some days after I had upgraded to the latest version of PC Suite. For no obvious reason this is now different and I can't get a connection to the phone any more, neither with USB nor
 with Infrared (these are the possibilities that my PC offers).<br />
The "raw" USB Connection works, which is obvious since both my phone and the PC show the connection on the phone display or in the task bar, respectively. The same goes for the Infrared Connection that you can see being present in the Windows task bar and on
 the phone.<br />
When I now press "Get Connected" in PC Suite, press "Next &gt;" on the Connection Wizard, select the appropriate connection type and press "Next &gt;" again, then it starts searching but nothing happens any more. There is this animation of the plug being plugged
 in the phone or the infrared animation, but nothing happens from there. The "Next &gt;" button is grey so it's obviously instructing me to wait. I waited as much as an hour and nothing happened.<br />
I also tried uninstalling PC Suite and the Connectivity Drivers through Control Panel -&gt; Software and reinstalling them from a fresh Internet Download. This didn't solve the problem.<br />
It's urgent since I want to transmit my backed up phonebook. Due to the warranty replacement of a broken phone I currently have my 200-entry phonebook only on my PC. And I can't even read it from there since PC Suite doesn't allow to browse backups at the PC.
 My phone is quite useless without my phonebook.<br />
So PLEASE help soon! PLEASE!

            I now uninstalled PC Suite 6 and installed the old version (4.88) again. The connection manager in this program finds the Nokia 6234, I can select it, but when I want to use it PC Suite says: "Interface not supported". It doesn't say this in English but
 in German.<br />
The Caption of the Error Message is "Nokia PC Suite". My PC Suite is in English though, while my Windows installation is a German version. Thus the error message seems to be thrown by Windows.<br />
What should I do?

            I am having the same trouble. I have a 6280 and am trying to get it to talk to PC Suite. It is OK on the previous version which came with the phone, but it keeps prompting me to upgrade to 6.82.22. When I do this, it does not think there is a phone connected.
 I am connecting by USB cable. I have deleted and reloaded 3 times, no difference.<br />
<br />
The reason for wanting to upgrade is that I am not able to access the phone's contact list via PC Suite despite successful (I think) synchronisation. I get a message asking if I want to update my phone list, I say yes, and it says 'Operation Failed' or something
 similar.<br />
<br />
Any help would be great!

            As for the connection problem I have found a solution, it seems.<br />
I used the Nokia PC Suite Cleaner tool, which can be downloaded from the support section of their homepage. I uninstalled PC Suite and then tried all the different options the cleaner tool offers. I always restartet Windows inbetween.<br />
After a re-installation of PC Suite the connection problem is suddenly solved, but only the IrDA connection works. The USB connection is still not working.<br />
The problem now is that the phonebook, when restored, is incomplete. Many entries are distorted or missing. As for the mail address fields - they are never restored.<br />
So it's still not good.<br />
But you might want to try the cleaner tool, too. Maybe it also solves your connection problem.

then when i tried to manage the connection via the 'manage connection' icon, i get the following error message 'Connection to Nokia PC Suite failed. Please reinstall Nokia PC Suite. (Code: Init IMediaControl2)'.<br />
<br />
with the previous version, my phone cannot be detected by the pc suite although my laptop managed to detect the infra red signal immediately and i could send files to and from my phone (not using the pc suite).<br />
<br />
i suspect something is missing from the updated version of the pc suite...<br />
<br />
help help! i can't sync nor do anything with the phone/pc !

            I suspect the problem is with the PC Connectivity Solution. You have to uninstall it through the control panel together with Nokia PC Suite and Nokia Cable Connectivity Drivers before installing PC Suite 6.82. However, while my N70 worked fine with 6.82,
 I can't erase text messages from the sent folder of my 6230i. Has anybody experienced this problem too?

and re-intall. I have used DKU-2 cable.Can work with bluetooth.<br />
Infrared is inreliable.

<h2>            Atheros wireless network adapter not working in Windows 10 Technical Preview</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tested Windows 8.1 Preview I had this same issue with the Atheros wireless connection. The same thing is happening with Windows 10 Technical Preview. So I am pasting the solution in case it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/hardware/no-wireless-networks-after-upgrade-to-windows-81/c9223bef-cd2e-4098-bdd2-34f8f8f70ac2?auth=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/hardware/no-wireless-networks-after-upgrade-to-windows-81/c9223bef-cd2e-4098-bdd2-34f8f8f70ac2?auth=1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I own a Lenovo G470 and my problem is solved.</p>
<p>Device manager was showing I had a Realtek wireless lan driver facing a startup error. I tried updating the driver even with a LAN connection working but had no luck.</p>
<p>Then I downloaded the latest Realtek/Atheros bundle drivers from the Lenovo support site, installed them and still no luck. The driver shown in Device Manager seemed to be the same that was installed before and still not working.</p>
<p>So I tried to update the driver choosing the Browse My Computer for Driver Software / Let me pick a list of device drivers. It showed three options: Realtek driver, Microsoft driver and Atheros driver. Tried each one, as soon as I chose the ATHEROS driver
 the wireless lan icon appeared and everything started working!</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone.</p>
<p>Now my Windows 8.1 notebook rocks.</p>
<p>Best regards and thanks for the help!</p>
<p>Cesar</p>

            <p>My card is an AR5006XS and I have followed this instructions with no result. I've installed the Windows 8.1 drivers to see if I could be able to select them manually as indicated without result because I didn't get the Atheros entry, while it was already
 correctly detected on Windows 7. What can I be doing wrong? What could I do?</p>

            <p>Hi Tripp. I have tried it but didn't get that option, only available verdors are "Intel", "Intel corporation" (yes, twice) and "Microsoft".</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the card is identified as HP probably because my machine is one of them, but the card is a PCI generic one I added later. I've installed Windows 10 from the Insiders preview ISO by doing a clean install (removing the partitions and re-formating,
 too).</p>

            <p>Hi Jim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, as I said in my previous post, the wireless card is identified as a HP one, but in fact is a generic one. There's a device listed on the "Other devices" section, but it's an old Logitec webcam that only had drivers for Windows XP (I have it attached
 because it's a really good can and works under Ubuntu).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is the "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Show Compatible Hardware</span>" option, on the menues? I don't remember to see it in the assistant... :-/</p>

            <p>I've follow your screenshoot and the checkbox was unmarked when it showed only the Intel and Microsoft entries. Now it showed a lot more companies including Atheros and Qualcomm, but probably this is related to the fact I tried to install the drivers for
 Windows 8.1. Anyway, the Atheros drivers were only for ethernet cards, and the Qualcomm ones always returned an error 10 "unable to initialize device", also the one for my exact chipset (AR5004G).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I get the hardware id? I'll open later the computer case to look directly to the card to see if I can get more info.</p>

 that it found a&nbsp;Realtek&nbsp;wifi - not the Atheros&nbsp;..&nbsp; Using your suggestion, Cesar, I 'browsed' - selected "Let me pick..." - opted for the Atheros and my useless "Realtek" wifi card became functional with the Atheros driver.&nbsp; Nice catch...&nbsp; and I'll make a note
 of this for my clients who will (no doubt) have similar 'mis-read' wifi and&nbsp;other hardware.

            <p>I've reinstalled Windows 7 OEM from the recovery partition and the Atheros card was correctly detected at the install process itself. I hope that installing Windows 10 via Windows Update will preserve the Atheros driver and also the one for my Intel graphic
 card (when I did previously a clean install it was not recognized too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, this problem still needs to be fixed, so let's continue trying it :-) The driver is identified on Windows 7 as HP 802.11b/g Wireless Network Adapter, that's the same&nbsp;value&nbsp;that's identified on Windows 10, so seems that's not the problem. The&nbsp;hardware
 IDs are:</p>

            Hi Rhys,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your clarification.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since you are using Office 365 (online, no Exchange on-premises), may I know the detailed symptom about the issue (the error you got)? I mean, you have mentioned Office 365 smtp relay (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-to-set-up-a-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-Office-365-69f58e99-c550-4274-ad18-c805d654b4c4?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-AU&amp;ad=AU#option3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-to-set-up-a-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-Office-365-69f58e99-c550-4274-ad18-c805d654b4c4?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-AU&amp;ad=AU#option3</a>).
 And, according to the error message “There is a partner connector configured that matched the message's recipient domain”, my understanding is that you were using the third method “Configure a connector to send mail using Office 365 SMTP relay” described in
 that article.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If so, please be noted that this method is to authenticate your device to relay the email to Office 365 and then relay to the recipient. That is to say, it used Office 365 (online) smtp server “smtp.office365.com”. Besides, it needs a static IP address or IP
 range as well as 25 port. The detailed requirement of this method can be found “Requirement for Office 365 SMTP relay” or that article.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If all the requirements have been met but the issue persists, I’d like to collect the complete NDR (Non-Delivery Report) in the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list/">
private message</a> for analysis and a screenshot of the device settings (Configure a connector to send mail using Office 365 SMTP relay). By the way, why you don’t send from your Office 365 mailbox to the recipient directly?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>Incorrect. The scripts above refer to Office 365 SMTP servers. Please ignore hte fact that these ever worked or that we migrated. I want these scripts to send email via Office 365 SMTP servers.</p>

            Hi Rhys,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your clarification.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now, I know the issue (the error “5.7.51”) you are encountering is that you can’t send via the script via referring to that article. Firstly, I should admit that your understanding is right. Sending from Office 365 via “Direct Send” really doesn’t need an Office
 365 mailbox but only an address containing the domain of your Office 365 organization. Secondly, I’d like to say this method is used for the multi-function device but not any script. As a result, it won’t be successful if you send via the script via referring
 to “Direct Send”.<br />
<br />
In addition, Office 365 has little information regarding sending from Office 365 via script (Office 365 users always send from the real mailboxes). I know there might be some third-party article/link about it. Here, I am afraid we can provide limited assistance
 in helping resolving sending via the script. Your understanding is much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

<p>While you have all approached with a helpful demeanour, I find no evidence that you follow that up with actual intention to help - &nbsp;I have found no help in any of what has been said. It has in fact been a waste of time, and includes misinformation. A little
 effort in reading the post by someone with a little more exchange knowledge than me was all that was required. I got there by searching and learning myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Alan that is plainly wrong. read the article's first sentence and tell me this is only for multifunctions. A cursory thought about what is going on would reveal that this is just as relevant to scripts as it is for MFDs, and you seem to have looked past
 my requirements and the reality of how IT operations run. There is a reason that the ability to send emails is built into the scripting languages Microsoft have developed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess you are under pressure to post but please s<span>ave the next post creator some frustration and read their request.</span></p>
<p><span>The answer was there in the error message I posted originally (which was then removed) for my privacy although I replaced identifiable info with XXX.</span></p>

<div>Hi Rhys,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, the first sentence of that article has explained it is for the multi-devices. And, can you show me any official article/link regarding sending from script for Office 365?
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>For Office 365 Direct Send, it requires 25 port on the device. But, I can’t find any information about it for your script.

 alert - 'phone memory full')&nbsp;I've checked the phone browser - cant see any files which could possibly fill up the phone memory. How to proceed. Quite desperate whitout my txts/emails inbox. Regards.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should go to messaging, options, settings, other, and change memory in use to "E: Mass memory". If the phone ask you to copy old messages to the new storage, answer yes, and if it ask to keep the old messages in the old storage you should answer no (I
 don't remember exactly the question).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Hope this solve your problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In installed applications, you should have a lot (or not, hehe) apps. If you take a look to all of them, you realize that there are some with an icon in the right. If you see that icon, this application is installed in E:, if you don't see the icon, that
 app is intalled in C:</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have manage to increase the phone-memory by deleting the internetbrowser cache. (from 186Kb to 8,2Mb free Mem)</p>
<p>But&nbsp;to delete installed applications (from phone memory - Not&nbsp;Installed in Massmemory&nbsp;) doesn't take much afford.</p>
<p>All my messages, e-mails, applications&nbsp;etc&nbsp;are stored in the Massmemory, but stil 8,2Mb (internal phonememory)&nbsp;isn't much?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please Nokia, Create&nbsp;a application/update to clean/delete your internal Memory files!</p>
<p>Or create a link in the (error)notice&nbsp;in your phone&nbsp;where to find to problem of the full memory to erase some files!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Did you setup a Microsoft account on your phone ? If you have one, just add it to Settings &gt; E-mail&amp;accounts and you should be able to download from the Marketplace. If you don't have a Microsoft account you can setup one here: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/sign-up-create-account-how<br />
After signing up, just add it to your phone and enjoy downloading apps from the Marketplace.<br />

            <p>Hello Ranjithaswin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for posting to the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you are under 18, you will need to follow the steps in the link below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/how-to/wp8/apps/set-up-my-family-for-windows-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/how-to/wp8/apps/set-up-my-family-for-windows-phone</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are&nbsp;18 or older, but still being asked to set up family, this indicates that&nbsp;the year of birth in your account is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To&nbsp;correct this, you will need to log into your account <span><a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">https://account.live.com</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;change the date of birth.<a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After you have done that, please do a soft reset of the phone (<span>Press and hold the Power and Volume down buttons<br />
for 20 seconds), correct the time and date and sync the account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are&nbsp;still asked to set up family after these steps, you will need to reset your phone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before doing that, please remember to&nbsp;do a backup.</span></p>
<p>

    <title>&#34;cannot create file&#34; when trying to load OLE objects from word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesmolyneux  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;cannot create file&#34; when trying to load OLE objects from word</h2>
                    Hello All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i have a particularly troublesome problem using OLE objects with Office 2007. my company writes software that uses OLE to store documents in a database. You can however emulate what we do by doing the following:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>save an outlook email in .msg format.</div>
<div>drag it into a word document, this will use OLE to place the msg in the document.</div>
<div>you can open that .msg by double clicking. Outlook should then be launched and should display the email.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Instead on 3 separate sites, all running Office 2007, users now get an error message , which can be seen here:</div>
<div><a href="http://imgur.com/9M4uY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/9M4uY</a></div>
<div>the blacked out path is the secure temp files location from the registry, in Documents and Settings.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've done a lot of searching around and almost every instance of this that I can find suggests emptying that folder. I have done this, and the error persists.</div>
<div>All the users involved are the owners of these directories, with full and complete access to it. All seem to have Office 2007 and XP.</div>
<div>We have multiple sites which also have this combination (2007/XP) and are working perfectly well.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>can anyone suggest what may be going on here? I'm at my wits end</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in Advance.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>James</div>

    <title>Action Center missing in Windows 10 Technical Preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ray a h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Action Center missing in Windows 10 Technical Preview</h2>
                    <p>There has always been an Action Center in earlier versions of Windows that shows in lower right task bar that sometimes gives you useful feed back with the little flag.</p>
<p>I have noticed that&nbsp;with the&nbsp;Windows 10 preview it has created a long code (look like a registry key) in the start menu instead of the lower task bar. When I opened it, it has a red x and nothing in the menu option. Finally I was able to delete it. I guess
 my question is the Action Center working in the Windows 10 preview?</p>

            Hi CDT. My impression is that the ACTION CENTER icon should be on the taskbar along with the other icons. My taskbar for WIN10TP does not include ACTION CENTER as previous posters described.

<p>Action Center is known as Security and maintenance in Windows 10 and you could access it through Control Panel.</p>
<p>You will see notification icon in Notification are of Windows and when there is any warning or issue, you will get notification and you will it there.

                    I am trying to create a list which starts at 2.1. (and not at 2.) Using the "Set Numbering Value &gt; Continue From Previous List - Skip Numbers" Option, Microsoft word still automatically inserts 1. and 2. before 2.1. The strange thing is it worked on my
 work computer but when I opened the exact same document on my home computer those numbers appeared and I can't remove them. Any ideas?&nbsp;

<div>Thank you.</div>

            The numbers preceding 2.1 that Word inserts after your commands are formatted as hidden text hidden.&nbsp; (Unfortunately, the numbering does not get the dotted underlined that denotes hidden text in W2010.&nbsp; But type something on after the number (&amp; before
 the paragraph mark) to see it.)<br />
<br />
When you open the document on your home computer, are the nonprinting formatting marks showing?&nbsp; When you click the ¶ to turn them off do the numbers before 2.1 disappear?<br />

            <p>Hi Jan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post. I would like to ask what <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
version of Outlook for Mac</a> you are using to access your emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using Outlook for Mac 2016, it is not feasible to access the Calendar in the right panel of the inbox window. As a workaround you can easily switch windows by pressing (command key + 1) to access Inbox window and (command key + 2) to access the
 Calendar window.</p>

Are the files able to be updated on an iPad? Meaning I have the same issue, and the document will update if I open it up on a Pc, but I want to know if there is a way to have it update on a mobile device instead of creating the error that "this workbook can't

<p>

<p>
</p><p>The imap-outlook.com address seems to be the right one. I can send emails on both devices but can't receive mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess the new and improved Outlook doesn't actually have a support service. Nice. I seriously doubt that there's anything wrong on this end since the exact problem started occurring on both devices.</p>

    <title>TODAY function&#58; need to stop values from being recalculated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d_m  say:</h3>
<h2>            TODAY function&#58; need to stop values from being recalculated</h2>
                    
<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I expect this has a simple answer.</p>
<p>I have a worksheet with a column labelled Observation where I enter a numerical value for an observation I make periodically (usually once a week, but sometimes more often).</p>
<p>In the adjacent column labelled Date I have the following formula: =IF(A2="","",TODAY())</p>
<p>This formula automatically fills in the serial number of the date in which I recorded the observation.</p>
<p>I would like to track the observation over time but having the date entered with the TODAY function means that each time I open the worksheet the value is recalculated and observations made 2 weeks ago which originally had values like 40422 entered in the
 Date column now have those values changed to 40437 etc.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can have my observations recorded adjacent to a serial date value that remains constant on the value the observation was entered? Of course I can manually enter a date for each observation but I am sure this can be automated somehow.</p>
<p>Thanks for help,</p>
<p>Dave M</p>

<p>@D_M,</p>
<p>If your observations are put in&nbsp;A and you wish a datestamp in B, my earlier supplied forumla&nbsp;needs only a slight&nbsp;modification (as below).</p>
<p>To implement, right click the worksheet's tab and select View Code. Paste this function code into the pane on the right side with Book1 - Sheet1 (Code) in the title bar (your own my vary).</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim Isect As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Isect = Application.Intersect(Target, [A:A])<br />

<p>In the adjacent column labelled Date I have the following formula: =IF(A2="","",TODAY())</p>
<p>This formula automatically fills in the serial number of the date in which I recorded the observation.</p>
<p>I would like to track the observation over time but having the date entered with the TODAY function means that each time I open the worksheet the value is recalculated and observations made 2 weeks ago which originally had values like 40422 entered in the
 Date column now have those values changed to 40437 etc.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can have my observations recorded adjacent to a serial date value that remains constant on the value the observation was entered? Of course I can manually enter a date for each observation but I am sure this can be automated somehow.</p>
<p>Thanks for help,</p>

<p>
</p><p>We have a PBX (Ericsson Business Phone). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>But I do not want to connect skype to the PBX.</strong></p>

<br />
In other words: I want that windows uses "dial.exe" for CALLTO. At the moment windows has registered "skype" for CALLTO. But I want to change that. So I need to change in registry.<br />
<br />
I did this for many years already for the normal Skype intallation. But now Skype is a windows app and has changed the way in which skype registers in the windows registry.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for the response and additional details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the CALLTO is not supported in the new Skype. This is only possible in the classic Skype, however, we recently removed the classic Skype from the download page due to an installer issue. But do not worry, our developers are already fixing
 this and we're expecting that in the upcoming weeks this will be available again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as the classic Skype&nbsp;is available, you can install it and try the changing the registry again.</p>

<p>Callto: is a protocol in Windows.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, the Skype consumer version does not override callto: protocol behavior, so there is nothing to disable. No special changes have to be made. Your issue is with Windows 10 rather than actually Skype.
 To resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Modify that sample code you linked to match your 3rd party dialer application.</p>
<p>2. Execute callto: from your run box, to select your 3rd party dialer app instead of Skype as displayed below:</p>

<h2>            Has anyone solved the &#34;Unable to initialize API&#34; error w&#47; Lotus Notes&#63;</h2>
                    I have an E61 that I'm trying to Sync to Lotus Notes 7 on my Windows XP sp2 Thinkpad. However, I keep getting the following error "Unable to initialize API" I can see that other people have been getting the error too. Nokia's web Site states that PC Sync
 works with Lotus Notes so I hope that there is a simple fix to this. <br />
<br />
Thank You Penn Jennings

            Hi I had this problem and sorted it by:<br />
<br />
Ensuring the location of my notes.ini was in my path<br />
<br />
I then went thought the windows registry searching for anything with :\lotus in it. This is where notes was installed on my pc - The drive letter is left off deliberately to allow it to find things which are on the incorrect drive.<br />
I then went through ensuring the drive and path was correct for all entries. (Took about 10 mins)<br />
<br />
As with all config changes back everything up first!<br />
<br />
Good luck as this bugged me for ages!!!<br />

            For information, PC Sync will attempt to determine the location of the Notes API by looking in the following registry locations:<br />
<br />
SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\App Paths\\notes.exe<br />
SOFTWARE\\Lotus\\Notes\\7.0<br />
SOFTWARE\\Lotus\\Notes\\6.0<br />
SOFTWARE\\Lotus\\Notes\\5.0<br />
SOFTWARE\\Lotus\\Notes\\4.0<br />
<br />
In these locations PC Sync will either look for a Path value or the Default value for the location of the Notes installation. In short, if there are old registry entries or inaccurate registry entries, PC Sync maybe pointed towards an invalid directory.<br />
<br />
As Douglash describes, if you remove any 'old' registry entries PC Sync should be able to correctly determine the location of the Notes API (nnotes.dll).

            Neil, the behaviour for searching the system registry for the Lotus Notes keys was changed in PC Suite 6.84. Can you report if using 6.84 has improved the situation for you?

            Ok....<br />
I had this problem (not solved) on my old Dell D600 and PCsuite together with Notes... API-problem.<br />
Now a month ago I got a new Dell (D630) with Notes 6.5.4 and PCsuite 8.62-something. I got the sync working well (it was a new install so it should work and it did). But only for a week or so. Then I got this wierd timing problem and I had to hard-quit the
 PCsuite with the task manager. THEN I got the API problem again and I can't get rid of it. (Is it a API from Notes or from the PCsuite install btw??)<br />
<br />
So, I'm thinking that it must be a corrupt ini-file or a thingie in the registry that went bad. And it's really no idea reinstalling to a newer version - the problem remains...<br />
<br />
Can someone concur with that behaviour?<br />
<br />
It's really an anoying problem!! :(<br />
<br />
I'm really this close "&gt;&lt;" asking my boss to have my phone replaced with a Sony/Ericsson :|

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I am striking the same problem here. We are using Lotus Note 7 and Nokia Suite 6.86.9.3.<br />
<br />
When trying to sync the Notes Calendar I get the erro "Unable to initialise API" I selected server as local and my userID as the file. Do I have to point sync software to the directory of my userID?<br />
<br />
I have read the above post from Douglash and have the following question. When he refers to notes.ini being in his path, what path does he mean and where can I find it?<br />
<br />
Second question, I don't really understand what he did when he searched and replaced erroneous entries in his registry. For example if I have Notes installed at C:\Program Files\lotus\notes and my data file stored at c:\ntsdata then what do I do?<br />
<br />
A question too about synch's posts. Those registry entries, where are they located? Under HKCU or HKLM? I found similar entries under the Local Machine but not under Current User.<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated.<br />
<br />

                    How do I list/sort saved documents by date created Word 2003?&nbsp; I need to save all files created after my last restore point.&nbsp; Or, I need to know how to totally get rid of a corrupted Firefox program so I can download one that will work.&nbsp; During installation
 of an upgrade, my computer hung.&nbsp; This corrupted the file and now nothing I do will give me a useable Firefox browser.&nbsp; I removed the program &amp; redownloaded, but it still just doesn't open and slows the computer to uselessness.

            Do you know all the places&nbsp; you have DOCS saved. If it is just the "DOCUMENTS / MY DOCUMENTS" folder, you can open Windows explorer and click on the column title for the date modified.<br />
<br />
Or you can go to a command window (CMD) (aka DOS) and use the "DIR" (directory) command.<br />
<br />
A little more info about what you want to do would help.<br />
