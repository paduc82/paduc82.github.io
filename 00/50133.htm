    <title>Why does Windows 10 use a Microsoft Account ID for local logon&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iambpr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows 10 use a Microsoft Account ID for local logon&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It seems like a very bad idea to remove the Local UserID Password from the logon process, but this appears to be what Microsoft has done. &nbsp;This seems to break the security of my private LAN management and expose my private data to unknown 3rd parties using
 the Microsoft Account authentication process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use multiple Windows PCs and several Linux devices with SMB to manage data within my own local equipment, and am not willing to allow this data to leave my own LAN. &nbsp;I do not want to allow any 3rd party to have access to my private data which is stored
 on multiple NAS devices on my own property.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This recent change of logon process by Microsoft appears to be an effort to prevent me from managing my own private data, and expose it to a 'cloud server'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be certain that none of my private data is stored on any device that is not on my property, nor accessible to any process that runs on any equipment that is not on my property. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way for me to be certain that none of my private data can be read by any Microsoft processes which run on devices located outside of my own property? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I monitor who / when / why Microsoft processes are being used to remotely access any of my private data? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>You don't need to have a Microsoft Account (MSA) on Windows 10. You don't need a MSA to install Windows 10 and you don't need one to use Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft would&nbsp;<em>love it</em> if you had a MSA, and they <em>really</em> want you to have one, but you don't need to have one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A MSA <em>is</em> required to use certain features of Windows 10, for example: Cortana or to save your settings to the cloud or to use the Mail/Contact/People apps. But nobody says you have to use those features. I don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need a MSA to download apps from the Windows Store. But all you really need is your MSA email address. You don't actually have to use your MSA for anything at all. I setup a MSA to get an outlook.com address so I can use the Windows Store. I don't
 do anything else with my MSA and it's not setup as a user account on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can certainly go through the Settings app and turn off every setting that shares your data - I did. Look on the web for guides to turning off settings that might not have known about.
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/221864/digging-into-and-understanding-windows-10s-privacy-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Here</a> is one example of what I found on the web. You can also go through your MSA and disable every sharing setting. Don't think Microsoft makes it easy (neither does Google or Apple) but you can do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm all in favor of sharing - but on&nbsp;<em>my</em> terms.</p>

            <p>BulldogXX, I understand and agree with what you've stated, however I also agree with IAMBPR that requiring the MSA password to be entered to log on as a user is a step backward from a security point of view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win7, these two passwords were separate and one could better protect from prying eyes the MSA password while the User login was more visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I believe that requiring people to know their MSA password for every login will encourage people to create short, simplistic passwords for ease of use.&nbsp; Not a good idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, the login screen shows the MSA account name.&nbsp; I never publicly share that MSA with anyone.&nbsp; My interactions with others is through other accounts, again to help thwart access to where the bulk of my private/work information resides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to see the user password to be separate from the MSA, without loosing functionality.</p>

            <p>I suspect that my most important objection has not been understood yet. &nbsp;Perhaps I did something wrong, but I don't know what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My major concern is the un-authorized change from my Local PC Logon to a Microsoft Account Logon to authenticate access to my Local PC resources, likely including shared folders on SMB devices on my LOCAL LAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10, and did NOT change my LOGON to a Microsoft Account ... and I was able to log on to my PC with the same UID / PW used for Windows 7 for a few days after the upgrade. &nbsp;Then less than a week later, apparently the result
 of Windows Updates, my Local LOGON was replaced by my Microsoft Account to use to log on to my LOCAL PC ... I do not recall ever consenting to this change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did report this concern in a different thread on this forum, and several people did tell me about the Windows 10 Security settings and how to revert my MSA logon to a Local UID / PW ... and I did change it back. &nbsp;I was not able to simply re-activate the
 Local PC UID / PW ... I had to re-create it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a week later, probably also after Windows updates, the Local UID / PW was again replaced by the MSA Logon for access to my local PC and LAN resident shared files (on Linux devices and other Windows PCs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to allow the use of my MSA credentials to authenticate access for any Local resources (especially on other devices connected to my LAN) . &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not consent to this change in authentication credentials ... and do not want it to happen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also do want to know how to monitor accesses to any Local resources by any process related to my MSA credentials, or any remote Microsoft process that allows access to my private data. &nbsp;I want to prevent the potential for all unauthorized remote access
 (including Microsoft systems) to my private data ... but I have no confidence that the MSA authentication process allows me to have this control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that Microsoft has implemented a Cloud server (OneDrive?) for the purpose of making my private data available on multiple devices that can all use my MSA ID for authentication ... I want to prevent all of my data from being included in this process,
 with the exception of ONLY data items that I explicitly agree to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This looks a lot like what the cell phone companies did with their 'opt out' option plans that automatically added features to cell phone plans for users, often taking over management of private data without users knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT want to allow anyone to have visibility to my private data without my express consent for each individual data file or possibly folder level control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know how to manage this data security using a Local UID / PW ... I do not believe it is possible for me to manage it with a Microsoft Account based authentication process.</p>

            <p>Nice thread, I agree totally with the original poster. MS wants to become Facebook overnight by getting the entire world to log in to one of their domain names every day. Just not with my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it really true they deleted my old login? An upgrade that deletes user data that Microsoft doesn't like? That crosses a line.</p>

            <p>I too have had my computer hijacked by Microsoft. My personal laptop has had its security bypassed and replaced by MSA login information required -- and it seems to have wiped out my fingerprint reader info as this no longer works to log into
<p>
</p><p>I am EXTREMELY unhappy ... to the point of leaving Microsoft 10 and abandoning this laptop for a Google Chromebook -- at least they haven't decided to take over my phone's security system ---- yet. I hope they don't get this idea. I might just have to go
 off the grid. AND I'M NOT KIDDING!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think anyone from Microsoft reads this and cares?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do -- please reply to my gmail account -- ltfd1101 -- you can figure out the email from that info.</p>

            <p>Your suggestions don't &nbsp;help. I agree that some file (s) is corrupted - what I need is what file and how do I repair it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is up to date as I check for updates every time I use it. I don't recall when the problem occurred (2 to 3 months ago?). I have been able to work around the issue so my computer is usable; however, the operation is not right and should be fixed!
 It irritates me every time I use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The EDGE browser still works if I push where the missing button was. But I can't find the EDGE icon to restore it to the taskbar. If I right-click on the WINDOWS icon, it works (menu list appears). As i previously reported, left-clicking the icon causes
 weird behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a dual-boot setup with Win 10 and PCLinuxOS. I will proceed to use Linux for ever-day use. I will periodically boot into windows to check for updates, oor hwn I have no other choice for what I'm trying to do.</p>
<p>

    <title>What causes a Media Center scheduled TV recording to only partially - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> therealkennewickman  say:</h3>
<h2>            What causes a Media Center scheduled TV recording to only partially record&#63;</h2>
                    The following error is in the Media Center Event Log:&nbsp; "Recording of (show) began as scheduled on (date/time) and was manually stopped on (date/time) for use by another component."<br />
<br />
The only other interesting log entry is in the System Event Log, WindowsUpdateClient/Windows Update Agent always runs at the same time.&nbsp; This is always the case and seems too coincidental.<br />
<br />
I am using a Ceton 4-tuner card.&nbsp; Drivers and firmware are current.&nbsp; Ceton has reviewed the tuner logs and sees no signal interruption.&nbsp; I can confirm this as Direct TV viewing is unaffected even during the period where a scheduled recording may be ended prematurely.<br />

    <title>How to merge 2 dbx files in Outlook Express - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew148  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to merge 2 dbx files in Outlook Express</h2>
                    How can I merge 2 DBX files with the same name (Outlook Express 6 on WinXP) into one?<br />
<br />
PS Automatic compacting of my Sent Items box failed a month ago. As a result all my Sent e-mails disappeared from Outlook Express. Backup of sent messages before the failure was created and is still available. There was no immediate reaction to the situation,
 as I was out of town. In the meantime, my family sent new messages and a new Sent Items.dbx file was created. In order not to loose any of sent messages merge of Sent Items.bak (old messages) and Sent Items.dbx (recent messages) is necessary.<br />

    <title>WIndows 7 pro retail upgrade to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredericberbigier  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows 7 pro retail upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>If I understood all the related questions/answers about this matter, a Windows 7/8/8.1 retail key won't be updated to a Windows 10 retail key, while the license itself will be retail (transferable), meaning that we will never be able to use Windows 10 iso
 to perform a clean install, even if we did proceed to an update using Windows update, or update procedure from the iso itself.<br />
If I'm correct, that means the only way to then perform a clean install on a new PC (license transfer), is to have a flashdrive generated from Windows recovery tools or to restore a Windows Image Backup of the initially updated Windows 10 ? If that's the way
 to do, I understand, not convenient at all, would have been much more easy to be able to get a new Windows 10 retail key while updating from a previous Windows retail.</p>

            <p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM licenses </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>
</span></span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once you upgrade, you can create a recovery drive and perform a clean install as many times you like.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The initial upgrade experience is a chore, but once that upgrade is complete, you won't have to go through the process ever again on the same PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In previous releases, when you installed an upgrade version of Windows, if you wanted to reinstall the upgrade version, you had to first reinstall the qualifying version from which you upgraded, reactivate it, then upgrade again and reactivate again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
With Windows 10, this is no longer the case. Once you have upgraded to Windows 10 and activate, you can simply create a bootable copy on DVD or USB and reinstall just Windows 10 without the need to reinstall the qualifying version and it will reactivate automatically.</p>

            <p>Ok, so it works the same way than it did for Windows 8.1 upgrade to Windows 8, need to have the license baked in the installation medium, or I'll lose it. I actually own 2 licenses, one Windows 8.1 pro OEM that is going to be updated to Windows 10 on my
 laptop, and I've got another Windows 7 pro retail (boxed) license, I did perform an install of it to do the reservation process, it means that I'll need to keep a backup of this install once updated to 10 and/or generate a recovery drive if I want to use that
 license on another PC in the future.</p>
<p>Thanks for the answer, I'm clear with what I need to do in order to keep my license.</p>

            <p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>
</p><p>You replied to me a couple of days ago, but I'm still not much clearer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2009 I bought a new PC running Vista and was later provided with a W7 upgrade disk .&nbsp;&nbsp; I have used this disk several times this last few weeks to upgrade a couple of vista drives to W10 and also on two new ITB drives, one for this computer which is activated,
 and another for the PC in which I had to replace the mobo on Saturday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was not a frivolous decision just to upgrade my computer, the thing refused to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I can transfer an upgrade version to another computer, as you state, why has mine been deactivated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Annie</p>

            <p>It still does not explain how to transfer the license, there is no answer about that, and it's a concern for me, if I upgrade a Windows 7 retail license, I intend to be able to transfer it easily, that's the only advantage to have a retail license. OEM is
 tied to hardware, RETAIL is NOT, how do I get my Windows 10 retail key from upgrading my Windows 7 retail key, which I will need when I will transfer the license to be able to install ?
</p>
<p>What I'm asking for, is a detailed procedure on how to transfer my Windows retail license to a new PC, admitting that the other PC does not exist anymore, so far, there are no answer to that, and that's a requirement for a RETAIL license, to know how to
 install it on a new PC.</p>

            <p>I have the Windows 7 Family Pack ( 3users). It is RETAIL. In the past 4 years I have replaced several bad motherboards as well as building 15 or so " NEW' computers. My license lets me have three computers running at any time. I can change any and all parts
 to whatever I want and 3 will activate. Microsoft's computer knows that I have a license for 3 computers so my second and third build activated automatically. Since #3 was activated, I cannot activate automatically so I have to call their 800 number. You talk
 to a robot and will enter in a series of numbers. The robot will than ask me " how many computers has this software been activated on ?" The answer that it wants is "1"It doesn't ask how many are you currently using or how many are scrapped. Since I cannot
 give extra details or explanation to a robot the answer is 1. That computer will be #1 and the next two activated computers that I turn on will fill up that license. Anything else on that license is deactivated.</p>
<p>So once I pass the robots questions with flying colors the robot gives me a series of about 8 codes&nbsp; that have to be entered on the computers keyboard. The first block will be A Then B, etc. After each block it will ask you whether to proceed, repeat the
 last block, or start over. I always say "REPEAT" as it gives me a chance to double check the entry. I do this with each block until the end. At the end I tell it to " Start over". While it is doing that I click the "Activate" button just below all the numbers.
 If I have entered all the codes the display will say activated in about 5 seconds. If it says NO then I have entered a code wrong and I tell the robot to start over. Don't hang up until you see the notice that you are activated. If you have to call back you
 will have to start at square 1.</p>
<p>It takes me about 15 minutes to get through it but doing it the first time will take longer. Just be patient. Like going to the dentist, it's something you gotta endure</p>

            <p>It's very easy to get the Windows installation code from any machine. There are several software's out there that will do this. Some are free and some want money. Some are free and come with a ton of adware and viruses. The one I use is:</p>
<p>ProduKey v1.75,Copyright (c) 2005 - 2015 Nir Sofer, Web Site: http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html. NO ADDWARE, NO VIRUS and FREE</p>
<p>You just run the software and it popups a small window which gives several bits of information but the number you want is in the lower right corner. If you highlight the number and click copy it will ask which number you want copied. Chose the installation
 key. I then paste the code onto a word document and print. Then I cut the code off of the paper and tape it to the computer. The software does not actually install on your computer. It just opens, give the code and then gets closed. I've reinstalled Windows
 on numerous computers where the owner had lost the install key or never had one to start with. Many were told that they had to buy a new license which is not true as long as you can pull the license off of it before it dies.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not been involved with the Insider Program prior to July 29th, or possibly before, with the machines in question, basically what happens is that the free Win 10 upgrade uses your original Win 7\8\8.1 license...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 30 days this becomes a Win 10 license...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you do the upgrade to Win 10, and the installation is activated, you can do a clean installation of Win 10 without a problem... You MUST do a Upgrade installation first...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The licensing information and the hardware ID of your computer are stored on Microsoft's activation server... Basically you won't need the license again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you later want to do a clean install, you can either enter your license, or select "Skip This Step" or "Do This Later"... The installation will complete this way, and then activate itself after a period of time... It might take a day, depending on how
 busy the servers are...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need to create any special restore\recovery media other than what you might need for your software and a few types of drivers...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file (ISO) and the ability of the Website to create installation Media eliminates the need for anything special... More like Win 7 used to be, before things were changed for Win 8...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has ALWAYS stored your hardware ID on their activation servers... This is how they determine if you have installed your Windows on more than one machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also how they detect that there have been hardware changes to your machine that might require the purchase a new license...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading your motherboard would be a good example of this... Even adding memory may trigger their server to require reactivation...</p>

            <p>You will first need to go to the manufacturers website for your model computer and first find out if there are Windows 7 native drivers available. A lot of computers that come preloaded with Windows 10 do not have native driver support for Windows 7 by the
 manufacturer. If there are no native drivers, you will have to consider returning the machine and purchasing a machine preloaded with Windows 10 Pro with downgrade rights to Windows 7 Professional. Or look through the manufacturers catalogue for systems already
 preloaded with Windows 7, usually the business line will have these options. </p>

            Java is the original release of Minecraft. Xbox One Edition will no longer be updated seeing as they released the Bedrock version for Xbox and Windows 10 and other platforms.

<p>If you have Java Minecraft, sign in with your Mojang Account on the Minecraft Website, and you should get an offer to redeem a code for the Windows 10 Version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it was long ago since I did that, and don't know where exactly you need to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you got your code, you can go to the Windows Store App on your Windows 10 PC and redeem that code in the Store App to get Minecraft Windows 10 Edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: It seems that you need to have purchased the Java Edition before Oct. 19th 2018 to be eligible for getting Minecraft Windows 10 for free.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Steam games will not get past launch window</h2>
                    Ever since upgrading to windows 10, I cannot play games such as Left 4 Dead 2, or Path of Exile, as they will not get further than the small launch window, then cease to function. It does not show up in the task manager at all, and various reboots, updates,
 system checks, fixes, powershell commands, and cmd commands have done nothing. I can't even roll back to windows 8.1 because my taskbar and start menu are both broken too. Please help.

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and for your interest on Windows 10.<br />
&nbsp;I can understand the inconvenience that you are facing with the issue. We are here to help you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please help me with this.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>•Did you change and check the resolution in settings?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may update the Display driver from Device Manager manually and check if this helps.<br />
&nbsp;1. Press (Windows key + X) and click on “Device Manager”.<br />
2. Expand “Display Adaptor”.<br />
3. Right click on the driver and select “Update Driver Software”.<br />
Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Further, if there no updated drivers available on the computer manufacturer’s website, then trying installing it in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the
 program using settings from a previous version of Windows.<br />
&nbsp;Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.<br />
&nbsp;a. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
&nbsp;b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‘properties’.<br />
c. Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ and select Windows 10 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue
 persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>If the game doesn’t work on Windows 10, then I would suggest you to run the game in compatibility mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps in resolving your issue. Feel free to get back to us, if you have any further queries. We will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>Thank you.</span>

            Just Kidding!!!The games still don't work, although the restart to install them fixed a start menu and taskbar function. I'm running hd 4600 on toshiba P75-A7200 with an i7-4700mq. On the intel &nbsp;HD graphics control panel, it says i have Windows 10 Pro
 Insider Review with build 10.0.10240 for some reason, although i upgraded to Windows 10 Home without the insider review. The driver version for intel HD 4600 is 10.18.15.4256, if that information helps any...

            Feature Updates for Windows are normally delivered through Windows Update. Is the pop you are seeing a notification graphic with a clock in it?
<br />
<br />If it is, then its legitimate. 
<br />
<br />Make sure you backup before upgrading:

            Hello Clancolin, <br />
<br />
The Windows feature update would depend on the KB article or Windows 10 current build and version your computer is currently on.
<br />
<br />
You may check which update is shown on your Windows Update desktop app or confirm which build your system is running. To do this, simply follow this path:
<br />
<br />
<strong>Windows Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>
Windows Update</strong> &gt; <strong>Update history</strong><br />
<br />
Another way to confirm your current build is by typing <strong>winver </strong>into the Cortana search box. Then hit
<strong>Enter</strong>, a pop-up box will show details of your system.<br />
<br />
Once you're able to identify which update your system is on, you'd be able to confirm the next build update being offered, refer to this support article for more details about certain KB articles and updates:
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4043454" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 update history</a><br />
<br />
Hope this information helps.<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>Is there a way to disable this splash screen pop up?</p>
<p>We started getting this domain wide, even though we don't roll out feature updates.</p>
<p>It must be a update from december that have enabled this, we haven't seen it before, and it confuses the users :-S</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatic Updates feature is being used by Microsoft engineers to keep Windows computer up to date with the latest updates and enhancements. However, there are updates that can be defer and cannot be defer (pop-up). We suggest that you choose the Pick a
 time to set when the pop-up should show up. It's the best option to avoid the pop-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any other concerns for us to be able to assist.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I dont think it would work because i can play five or ten min with nothing but then at random point my pc completly freezing and i cant do anything.If would game crash and send me to desktrop i could think my problem based on the game i playing.But it freezing
 my whole computer and i cant even get crash file out of it.I looked my pc reliability section but it was nothing there too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit:I found one eror in my reliability files.It says Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 x64 Redistributable couldn't updated and failed to install.Maybe my problem based to this?I tried to manually install it too but it giving me error.It says:Installation failed

    <title>Cannot connect to Internet via direct Ethernet cable connection. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> homucles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot connect to Internet via direct Ethernet cable connection.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. Have had this PC for about a year now. Came as Win7, updated to Win10 shortly thereafter. It is incapable of connecting to Internet wirelessly, so I connected it to modem directly through Ethernet cable. Have never had any problems whatsoever with
 connectivity to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the sudden, as of about last week, I would start up my PC and it would be disconnected from the Internet. It cannot detect any sort of Internet connections despite being directly connected to the modem. Even wirelessly connected devices in my home
 like smartphones and tablets were unaffected by whatever ails my PC/Ethernet cable/etc.. I had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restarted PC</li><li>Unplugged and replugged in modem after 30 seconds</li><li>Uninstalled drivers</li><li>Checked for driver updates (of which there were none)</li><li>Switched Ethernet ports</li><li>Switched Ethernet cables</li><li>Turned off firewalls and other malware-detecting programs</li><li>Reset network devices</li><li>...and a host of other troubleshooting tips I have now forgotten</li></ul>
<p>None of these worked, but after 10-20 minutes, the Internet returned to normal. It has just happened again, and I did not retry any of the aforementioned actions, and, once again, it returned after 10-20 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may seem to be a very trivial problem if the Internet ultimately comes back, but this effectively means my PC's startup time is extended to about 20 minutes, and this proves to be extremely inconvenient when I need to access the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please offer any suggestions you think would solve this problem. Whatever system specifications are needed I will provide.</p>

    <title>How to use an online pass on both my consoles - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to use an online pass on both my consoles</h2>
                    
<p>hi everyone, here's my problem. I have two 360 consoles, one for me and one for my kids.I bought mass effect 3 and utilized the online pass that came with the game on my console, which can be used by anyone that uses that console as well (sorry forgot to
 mention that we have an xbox live family account, me, my wife, my son and my daughter) anyway, my son is trying to play me3 on the other console but can't gain access to the the online stuff, it only gives me the option to redeem online pass code or purchase
 online pass code. i logged on to my account, on his console, and was able to gain access to it though. Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks!</p>

<p>The online pass that you redeemed is linked to the Gamer Tag used when you entered the code. That Gamer Tag can access the Online Pass by logging into either console. If you want your Son to be able to access those features he needs to either log in under
 that Gamer Tag or purchase a new online code for his Gamer Tag. The codes are one use only and only work for one Gamer Tag. Sorry if that isn't the news you wanted but hopefully it helps you.</p>

[quote]As long as the Online Pass DLC package exists on the console, any Xbox LIVE/PSN profile that is in the same region as the game will have access to Multiplayer.[/quote]So if he wants to let his son have access on the other console a

<p>Missed the edit time.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Essentially with online passes it is a good idea to redeem the code on the 'family' console so that everyone can make use of it.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>On your console you'd need to be signed into LIVE to use it but since it is an online pass you'd need to do that anyway.</p>

<p>I have never seen a DLC license work that way. Apparently, it's not working that way, because the OP says she logged in on the other console with her profile and it still doesn't work. Perhaps she can re-download the pass onto the new console? Personally,
 I'll be shocked if it actually works since I'm looking at the card that came with my Collectors Edition and it clearly says at the bottom that it's a one time code limited to one account.<br />
<br />
Either the card is wrong, or that web site is wrong.. my guess is it's the web site. Hopefully it's the card.</p>

<p>I have never seen a DLC license work that way.[/quote]Really? Pretty much all DLC works that way. The major exception is Avatar items, as they are linked to the account only.<br />
<br />
Most DLC is licensed to two things. The account which purchased it and the console it was first downloaded to.<br />
<br />
The latter console license enables everyone on that 360 to use the DLC, online or offline.<br />
<br />
With the account license it lets you play the DLC on any 360 as long as you are connected to LIVE. Other accounts on those other 360s will also be able to use the DLC but only when the purchasing account is also signed in to LIVE.<br />
<br />
You move the console license with a license transfer.<br />

[quote user="DarthLama"]Either the card is wrong, or that web site is wrong.. my guess is it's the web site. Hopefully it's the card.[/quote]My guess would be that it is the card.<br />
<br />
This is based on that the EA Sports titles also allow other accounts on the 360 the pass was redeemed on to play online using it.<br />

<p>[quote]<strong>Do I need an unique Online Pass for every user on my console?</strong><br />
No.&nbsp; One Online Pass will give online access to multiple users logged into the console where the Online Pass was first activated (subject to the console manufacturer’s and EA online terms of service).<br />
<br />
Also, the user that activated the Online Pass will be allowed to access online features on other consoles (of the same manufacturer) by logging into the same account credentials that they used when they enabled the Online Pass.<br />
[/quote]I would think that if the pass downloads a file to your 360 then other players will be able to go online.</p>

<p>[quote user="voteDC"]Most DLC is licensed to two things. The account which purchased it and the console it was first downloaded to.[/quote]</p>
<p>Please understand, I don't want to sound like I'm being combative, but in my experience no DLC works that way. I have 2 user accounts on my console, and no DLC bought under my 'DarthLlama' account is ever accessible to my other account. Maybe we're doing
 something different, but my experience has always been the same as the OP. The only way I can use DLC content is with the account that purchased it. Even if it's on the same console.
<br />
<br />
If everyone elses experience is different then mine then it's quite possible that I am doing something wrong. Certainly wouldn't be the first time that's happened. lol<br />
<br />
If that's the case, then I apologize to the OP for giving inaccurate advice.</p>

<p>Something is wrong on your end. This is how the licensing has worked for a long long time now and is the very reason the license transfer option exists.<br />

Xbox 360 Digital Rights Management
<div>
What is DRM?
<div>
<p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology is used by content providers, such as Xbox LIVE Marketplace, to control how digital game and video files are used and distributed. Xbox LIVE Marketplace sells and rents DRM-protected videos, games and add-in content
 that are covered by media usage rights that allow specific uses of that content.<br />
<br />
When you purchase content, you receive a licence to use that content. The licence has two parts: the system licence and the local licence. The system licence applies to the gamertag that purchases the content, and the local licence applies to the console where
 you first downloaded the content.</p>
<div>
Transfer content licences
<div>
<p>You can transfer content licences from one console to another once every four months.<br />
<br />
If your console was recently repaired, or if you’ve purchased a new console, use the licence transfer option on your console to transfer content licences. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>On your console, sign in to Xbox LIVE using the gamertag that you used to purchase the content.
</li></ol>
</ol>
<br />
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Go to the&nbsp;<b>Settings</b>&nbsp;and then select&nbsp;<b>Account</b>. </li></ol>
</ol>
<br />
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<b>Your Billing Options</b>, and then select&nbsp;<b>Licence Transfer</b>. </li></ol>
</ol>
<br />
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Follow the on-screen instructions to transfer the content licences. </li></ol>
</ol>
<br />
<p><strong>After the licences have been transferred, you need to download the content again to update the local licences. This way the content can be used by other profiles on your console and when you’re not connected to Xbox LIVE.<br />
<br />
</strong>For information about how to download previously purchased content, please see&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-content-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Buy and redownload content from Xbox LIVE</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>[/quote]XBLA games, Games on Demand titles and DLC I buy on voteDC can all be used by the other accounts on my console.<br />
<br />
Edit: The page uses different terms for the licenses to me.<br />
<br />
Account License = System License.<br />
<br />
Console License = Local License.<br />
<br />
Different terms to say the same thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am having the same problem. &nbsp;I can send and receive messages on my Skype account on my Mac properly. &nbsp;On a number of various IOS devices running the new Skype I can receive messages but when I type a reply it says "sending" and the message never gets sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I send a message from you computer to a friend that message shows up immediately in the chat history on my iPhone but when I send a message from the iPhone it just sits there.</p>
<p>

<p>I had this same problem and tried some of the suggested fixes - to no avail. Then I went back and started deleting the messages that were stuck. I started from the first one that I had sent. After I deleted the third message, Skype sprang to life and sent
 all the remaining messages. I think when Skype has a problem with a message - it just hangs at that point. (Reminds me of Fortran :))</p>

    <title>Gears of War 3 Rank Reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashtonlawrence  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gears of War 3 Rank Reset</h2>
                    
<p>So as the title would suggest it appears my rank has been reset on my online account for Gears of War 3,&nbsp;<br />
My acheivments and previous high scores remain, as do weapon skins and the character I was using before the reset.</p>
<p>I've read some information around and have begun to presume there is no hope for regaining my ribbons, mutators and my horde fortification levels and things like that but I thought I'd ask anyway.</p>
<p>Is there ANYTHING that can be done to get my rank and stats back? It looks like I'm still in a system somewhere, I'm just back at level 11 instead of the mid 70's like i was previously...</p>
<p>Thanks for any and all help</p>

<p>There's a post here about rank resets, and if I recall correctly, once you connect online with a reset rank, it overwrites your backup online, so there's no way to recover unless you have a backup you made earlier.</p>

<p>It's been a month or so; I'm back at level 78, but the whole reason I wanted my stats back was mainly for my horde fortifications...so I've been grinding away.
</p>
<p>Basically unless I had made a copy before hand there was nothing I could do, I still don't have a cause for the reset and both Microsoft and epic games say they can do nothing to change your online account...
</p>
<p>So I guess we just have to roll over and take it... Which really sucks. </p>

<p>Signing in your profile at the loading screen, or playing offline. There are multiple reasons for it and all can be prevented.(usually) the only problem is you have to be aware , and most players don't know about this until they get reset.</p>

<p>Oh man, I came here to see that there's no hope to get my status back. It has been my first time with an Xbox 360, so I have been 3 months playing Gears Of War 3, getting almost all medals in Golden, and now back to level 1, only having the damn achievements.
 I have to say that me and my cousing both play GOW 3 and I did bought the Season Pass when it was at sale for 9€, then yesterday, I gave him the licenses and he used my account to download it and all the maps, so IDK why, im now at level 1, all that I did
 it's lost now, I have played again to reach only level 17, but man, starting again, I don't want to think about it. Do I have been banned or it's just that glitch?? All my Weapons, Sensivity and other configs are like always. I did remember having a copy of
 my profile in an USB so is there a chance to get back my profile?? Maybe putting it again on my Xbox and playing online?? Or what's the way to do it</p>
<p>Please answer, I'd be very very grateful</p>
<p>Greetings</p>

<p>I lost about 5 levels the other day. I'll play and get them back, but it would still be cool to see this fixed.</p>

<p>This error is normally an startup error. If you already tried an power cycle and the issue is not fixed you could try the following:</p>
<p>
<span>Reset your
 console</span>
</p><div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>
If you’re still experiencing a startup error, you should reset your console from the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter. If you need to bring up the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter again, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Power off your console, and then unplug the power cord to ensure that the console is completely powered off.</li><li>
Wait 30 seconds, then plug the power cord back in.</li><li>
Press and hold the&nbsp;<strong>BIND</strong>&nbsp;button (located on the left side of the console) and the&nbsp;<strong>EJECT</strong>button (located on the front of the console), and then press the&nbsp;<strong>Xbox</strong>&nbsp;button on the console.</li><li>
Continue holding the&nbsp;<strong>BIND</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>EJECT</strong>buttons for 10-15 seconds.</li><li>
Listen for two “power-up” tones a couple of seconds apart. You can release the&nbsp;<strong>BIND</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>EJECT</strong>&nbsp;buttons after the second power-up tone.</li><li>
The console should power up and take you directly to the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>
To reset your console from the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter, use the&nbsp;<strong>D-pad</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>&nbsp;Button&nbsp;on
 your controller to select&nbsp;<strong>Reset this Xbox</strong>. When prompted, select&nbsp;<strong>Keep games and apps.</strong>&nbsp;This option will reset the OS and delete all potentially corrupted data without deleting your games or apps.&nbsp;</p>
