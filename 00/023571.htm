<h2>            Restore Contacts to my phone or desktop Outlook.</h2>
                    I am a new user of a smart phone and windows.&nbsp; I know that I backed up to windows live and now need to restore my contacts because I accidently corrupted Outlook on my desktop and that mess synced to my phone.&nbsp; I dont remember what my sign-in is because

<p><br />
You indicated that you backed up to Windows Live, I am assuming you mean the MyPhone site&nbsp;... is that correct?</p>
<p>You need to know that to get back into the MyPhone website.&nbsp; Without it, you are out of luck jj.</p>
<p>If you had backed up&nbsp;your data on MyPhone and mistakenly lost all the data on your phone then it is an easy process to restore.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 not showing all the Conversation View Expand icons...</h2>
                    I have O2010 setup to use Conversation View.&nbsp; The problem I have is that the triangle to expand messages only show up for some messages when I have that message highlighted.&nbsp; For other messages the triangle show sup all the time.<br />
<br />
I want the triangle to always show up for all messages that have multiple messages in them since it's easier to glance through my whole list to pick out the ones with responses.<br />
<br />
Is there some way to do this without having to manually highlight every email in my inbox just to see which ones have multiple messages inside them?<br />

<h2>            I get &#35;value error from just referencing another worksheet</h2>
                    <p>I've added a tab to a workbook and started rolling up the data from multiple other pages. However, I find that this page gives a #value if I simply link a cell here to a cell on another workbook page. In both cases I have a percentage in the cell. If I do
 the same thing in the original page (ie go to the data page and in a random cell I reference the percentage I wanted) it gives the correct % value. Why is the added tab being retarded?</p>

            <p>I've&nbsp;figured it out. Its because I'm referencing a merged cell on the other tab. Instead of using the simple argument "='page'!cell:cell" I have to pretend I'm summing up the merged cells. So =sum('page'!cell:cell) does work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the efforts. The reply just above suggesting "different data types" made me think about the cell differences, so it wasn't the answer, but definitely a solid assist in getting my answer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The remaining bizzar thing is it seems like excel does accept the simple equality in some cells but not in others. Ooh well, I can complete my work without solving that mystery.

<h3> theokapi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t split screen</h2>
                    
<p>I can't split the screen in Excel, when I have 2 separate Excel documents pulled up.&nbsp; With Windows 7, I can drag any other type of document (Word, PDF, Internet Explorer, etc.) to the side of my screen, and it automatically fomats the document to take up
 1/2 of my screen (vertically).&nbsp; I can do this with Excel, but I have to minimize it first, whereas with say Word I can just grap the top of the document and drag it to the side.&nbsp; Also, if I have 2 Excel docs pulled up, it will not let me split the two, and
 drag one to the left and the other to the right.</p>
<p>What the ____??!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Lately, i have been doing an extensive cleanup in my one-drive space, and i received an email from "OneDrive" that seem to mention something about deleting a large amount of data. I cannot understand for sure what it says since it is in spanish. I cannot
 find a way to select proper language for these communication. I do have the same issue with the different microsoft services i use and pay for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has a clue?</p>

<p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before I proceed in resolving this concern, may I confirm if you're still having this issue? If so,
</span><span>I would like to know if you're </span><span>using a web browser or an e-mail client
</span><span>such as </span><span>Windows Mail or Office Outlook</span><span> to manage your emails.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you're using a web browser, it might be one the possible reasons why you're receiving e-mails in Spanish because a
</span></span><span>web browser has the capability to translate a page content to a language that it has been set to be converted to. You can change this depending on the settings option of your web browser.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I look forward to your response.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Hacked account - Help, please &#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since last Monday I've been unable to log in my hotmail.com account.</p>
<p>It says that it seems that someone else is using this account.</p>
<p>I've filled the recovery form countless time with all the good info but every time I get a response that says that the informartion provided is not good enough to prove I'm the rightful owner.</p>
<p>I can provide the last time I connected to the account, the IP address from which I did it, the subjects of the last mails I sent and received, I can tell who I write to often (and who writes me back), which newsletters I suscribed to, the names of the folders
 I created...<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> I do have information that can help prove I'm the rightful owner</span>!</p>
<p>I contacted the web support : they told me to fill in the form and if I had more questions I could come back to them. I did. Last week. I'm still waiting.</p>
<p>I tried the telephone support. I live in France, the number I found was 09.70.01.90.90. All I got was a robot telling me to go to support.microsoft.com.</p>
<p>I asked the community in French. All I had was responses from people in the same situation as me and one admin who told me to fill in the form.</p>
<p>I never responded to phishing, I never gave my access codes to anyone, I don't share my computer in a public space, I don't connect to my account via wifi.</p>
<p>All I know is that on Sunday I could log in and on Monday I couldn't. On Tuesday I received a phone call that I did not answer: 002.345.789.652. According to my research it comes from Lokoja, Nigeria (and it is associated with people pretending to be from
 Microsoft calling to help customers fighting a virus).</p>
<p>I have very personal mail on my account and I'm desperate to get it back.</p>
<p>I found on some forums that some people who were unable to recover their account through the form actually managed to reach someone to help them (though now I'm started to think it's only urban legend) and then they were able to recover their account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm asking, please, anyone help! </p>
<p>You can answer me in English or in French (although I think on this side of the community English is preferred). I live in France but the account I'm trying to recover is about 10 years old (I've been&nbsp;accessing it regularly) and is an address&nbsp;in hotmail.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone who answers me a new way to try and recover it : thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Anyone who anwers me to fill in the form on account.live.com/password/reset : like I said, I already tried that!</p>

            <p>The issue is not what email client you're using on your laptop, but what email service you're using and how you've connected to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if you're using your ISP's email and you're downloading your email via POP3, then you will NEVER get your folders on anything but Outlook 2010 because all your email is local to that device!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first step would indeed be to migrate to a service that has lots of storage on the server, and is designed to sync with multiple devices. And this being the Outlook.com forum, the answer would of course be... Outlook.com! You have a Microsoft account
 since you posted here, so you could just sign into Outlook.com with the same account you used to come to this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you do any of that though, please tell us who your current email provider is, and if you know, how you are connected to that email in Outlook 2010 and your iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last thought: You do not need Office 365 for this. 365 is a nice product, but it's only something you should subscribe to if you need or want it. Otherwise, the Office 2010 suite will suit your needs just fine for now. It's still supported and updated by

            <p>Okay, so for emailsrvr.com, you're going to want to switch Outlook 2010 to IMAP instead of POP3. That will do the syncing you want.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For lswhite.com, you need to check if your email hosting allows syncing over IMAP.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;I do have an Outlook.com address, so that is ok</p>

            I can write those steps, but before we I spend that time, can you switch to IMAP on your personal hosting? That would fix this rather quickly.<br />

<h2>            OneNote search broke</h2>
                    <p>I am using OneNote 2016 on Windows 10.&nbsp; When I search for text, I always receive the message: "No matches - all notebooks".&nbsp; Even if the text is on the current page.&nbsp; If I do a page search, it does highlight the text.&nbsp; I confirmed that Indexing is turned
 on for OneNote.&nbsp; Also - searching on the OneNote app on my Android phone works well.&nbsp; It did work on OneNote 2013 PC version as well.</p>
<p>Here is an example of when I search all notebooks for the occurrence of "the" and it found nothing.&nbsp; I must be missing something????</p>

<p>-Not sure when it started since I seldom used the search function.&nbsp; (I do need the search function now)&nbsp; May have started when I upgraded to OneNote 2016 roughly 1/2 year ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- good question on if it happens on other PC's.&nbsp; I have OneNote 2016 on a laptop with Windows 10 also, so I just tried it.&nbsp; Same exact result that seems to indicate it is a OneNote bug.&nbsp; Possible in a setting, but cannot find a setting that could be the
 culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen other posts with this issue spread over a couple years, but did not see a resolution.&nbsp; I'm stuck...</p>

<h2>            Excel on Flash Drive</h2>
                    On my old computer {Windows XL} I had a large file set up on Excel, I bought a new one with W-10 and had Staples transfer my old info. That file did not go through. I did have it backed up on a flash drive, but now when I insert the stick in W-10 it won't
 work, giving me the "You are trying to use Office but don't have Office". I just want to access the files information, how can that be done?

            <p>Bernard makes a good point about needing free space for the "temp" files Excel creates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That applies if you are talking about an XLS or XLSX file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you describe sounds like it may be part of "Office to Go".&nbsp; When Office 365 first came out it had a feature called "Office to Go" where you could create a portable copy of "Office" on a USB drive. It allowed you to run your copy of Office on computers
 that did not have Office installed.&nbsp; Is this what you are talking about?</p>

<p>I understand that you want to know how to install the Kinect sensor and know how to use the images created by the sensor.</p>

<p>You are in the&nbsp;Xbox music and video&nbsp;support at the moment. To have more information about the Kinect sensor, who might want to post your questions on this forum:

<h2>            Office Word 2011 for Mac - stuck in Notebook layout</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Mac OSX and I have Office Word 2011.</p>
<p>I normally use Print Layout (default) but today I accidentally pressed the Notebook layout and now I can't change it back. Every new document comes that way. It's annoying.</p>
<p>I tried to go to Users-Library-Application Support-Microsoft-Office-User Templates-Normal file and change it to default but didn't work.</p>
<p>Help please!</p>

            <p>When you launch Word switch to Page Layout View then close the blank document without saving it. Select New Blank Document from the File menu... you should be good to go from that point on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option is to use this method to create a New Blank Document, then Close the NBL document without saving it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Click the disclosure triangle [ ▼ ] on the right edge of the New Document button of any type of document in order to create a new document of a different type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For future reference, Word remembers the type of document that was open when you last Quit the program (IOW, the type of document it last Closed). It then continues to generate new documents of that same type until you Quit after having last used some other
 type of document.</p>

<h2>            Merge Cells in a table &#40;word for mac&#41;</h2>
                    <p>so many tiny but maddening glitches in Word for Mac...</p>
<p>
</p><p>my latest:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a table with multiple rows and columns...I want to insert a title midway down the table, by merging three cells across a row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried putting in returns both above and below the highlighted row/cells to be merged, thinking that this approach would signal that the formatting of this one row is separate from the other rows...it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I do, once I click "merge" the table formatting goes completely wonky...sometimes it enlarges the table completely off the page (so no handles to resize -- only option is to undo) or it minimizes the last two columns to the width of a return
 and I have to manually resize them, both above and below the merged cells title row I am inserting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what ever happened to a simple merge cells? Can this be done simply?</p>
<p>

<p>Each cell ends each with a formatting character that is the equivalent of a paragraph mark. These table cell characters are hidden by default, but they contain the formatting for the cell. When you merge cells, the formatting character of the rightmost merged
 cell assumes control over the cell. In this illustration, if the 3 cells of the bottom row are merged, the formatting character circled in red will assume formatting control:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06d91b40-0754-4d90-b7d4-a791f1afcf68?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06d91b40-0754-4d90-b7d4-a791f1afcf68?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Table can have styles applied to them which can be very different from your intention. Most users will handle this by locally formatting the cells to take on the preferred appearance. But when the cell contents are merged, the style can reassert itself over
 the cell formatting and the appearance can change drastically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is to select the table or at least the row you're editing and apply a style that has your preferred formatting. Then cell merging and splitting has no effect on the table appearance.</p>

                    <p>I need a simple way to pass a value from a form to a report. &nbsp;Basicly i have a database that is populated by a form, call it form1. &nbsp;When i click the save button on form1, i need it to not only save the data but open a report. &nbsp;The report, call it report1,
 needs to display the data just entered on form1. &nbsp;I can save the data and open it in a report by entering the id field in a querie, but i need it to do this dynamicly when i save the data initially.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have trined using the condition inthe command eevnt builder but it always asks me to input the field again. &nbsp;Is there anyway to popolute this with the data just saved on the form.</p>

            <blockquote>1.&nbsp; now is there a way to have this script take me back to my original navigation form.
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; And will i be able to use the same/similar code for the OnClose attribute of a couple other the forms that i need to reverts back to the main navigation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; And is there a way to do this same thing for the popups that come up when a querie is asking for criteria. &nbsp;If you hit cancel it just closes the box, then leaves you on a blank page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; You can move focus back to a form with:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forms("YourFormName").SetFocus<br />
<br />
though I'm not sure if this will work with tabbed forms, which I never use.&nbsp; If not others here may be able to advise.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; A line like the above can be entered in a form's Close event procedure.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; When including a parameter in a query this should not be a crude system generated prompt, but a reference to a control on a dialogue form.&nbsp; You can then include appropriate code to cater for no value(s) being entered in the dialogue.&nbsp; There are a number
 of ways you can approach this:<br />
<br />
3.1 The query, or better still a form or report based on the query can be opened via a button in the dialogue form.&nbsp; The dialogue form would be opened first and would need to remain open, so to close it automatically code to do this would be included in the
 bound form or report's Close event procedure.&nbsp; This can't be done if the query is opened as a datasheet of course, which is one reason why a query should not be opened in raw datasheet view.&nbsp; A bound form can be in datasheet view of course.<br />
<br />
3.2.&nbsp; Code in a report of form's Open event procedure can automatically open the dialogue form, so in this case the form or report are opened directly.&nbsp; If the form is then closed with no value(s) having been entered, the code in the form or report's Open event
 procedure detects this and sets the return value of the event procedure's Cancel argument to True.&nbsp; Note that this will cause an error if the form or report have been opened with the OpenForm or OpenReport method of the DoCmd object, so that error should be
 handled in the calling procedure.&nbsp; You'll find examples of two way to open a report in this way as ReportDialogue.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />

<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
The approaches illustrated in this little demo would equally well apply to opening a form.<br />

    <title>Assigning excel to open different file types - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theadamsonian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assigning excel to open different file types</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Excel 2010 to Excel 2013 when 2013 was released. When I want to assign a file type (i.e. .dat file), I only have the option to select the Excel 2010 program.&nbsp;I've also tried more options&gt;look for another app on this PC and navigated to where
 the Excel 2013 program is located "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15\Excel.exe". However, when I select this application, Excel 2010 is still assigned to open the program. How can I fix this? I am afraid of uninstalling Office 2010 since I
 upgraded from&nbsp;its product key and don't want to lose my Access 2010 application I purchased separately.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to hide participant&#47;attendee list on Skype for Business conference call</h2>
                    I am looking to host a conference call using Skype for business, and I want the participants to see and hear me, but I want to keep the attendee list confidential so only I can see it. I don't want them to be able to see each other. I haven't found this
 option, and I'm wondering if it exists?

<h2>            Windows Mobile Device Center Just stopped working</h2>
                    
<p>I've got a brand new Palm Treo 700 WX, Microsoft Vista on a new HP Pavilion laptop, and all was going fine untill a couple of days ago when my Windows Mobile Device Center stopped working.&nbsp; It won't even
 load, it starts to load when I click on the icon and I get a message saying that there's a problem and Windows is trying to fix it.&nbsp; Then, it stops trying to fix it, and I get the following message:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Mobile Device Center has stopped working.</p>
<p>A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.</p>
<p>Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is</p>
<p>available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's it!&nbsp; I can connect my Treo to my laptop with the USB cable, and I can access it from my laptop, I can connect to the internet using the Treo as a wireless modem, but nothing will sync.&nbsp; I've uninstalled
 and re-downloaded the latest version of WMDC, and it did not help.&nbsp; I can't even search for a specific error cause the error message doesn't really tell me anything.&nbsp; Can somebody please help me out here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            the problem seems to be with outloo. What version are you running? try a detect and repair. If that does not solve the problem, the uninstall and reinstall Outlook.

    <title>New outlook live is a mess - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimmcwells  say:</h3>
<h2>            New outlook live is a mess</h2>
                    <p>Well the millenniales have screwed things up again. &nbsp;The older hotmail, excuse me outlook.live was somewhat ok after the last upgrade but this new version was tested by idiots. &nbsp;I use this for an address for when I buy something so my regular emails are
 not full of junk ads. &nbsp;It was easy to look at the screen see the ones I did not want to read and simply check alongside the message and delete it. &nbsp;Now I have to read everyone and delete individually. &nbsp;Hotmail has become cumbersome and a time waister on my
 iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did they take the list view away?i have no choice but to now create an EarthLink email address for the future and try and get those vendors whose ads I want to see to recognize the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this type of quality control is why I will never upgrade past windows 7. &nbsp;And will consider Apple for a new PC.</p>

            <p>Hi Seenu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In&nbsp;new Outlook.com, it is easy to&nbsp;empty junk folder, just you&nbsp;need to click on the
<strong>empty folder</strong> option in Outlook mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information&nbsp;see the below screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/683651fa-95c3-4262-be63-74f36dd4983f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/683651fa-95c3-4262-be63-74f36dd4983f" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For&nbsp;moving messages, you need to select the emails &amp; click on the <strong>Move option.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>See the below screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1c45fb4-db80-4e40-be6d-001c0d0a711b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1c45fb4-db80-4e40-be6d-001c0d0a711b" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As your account is upgraded to the new version of Outlook.com, which is Outlook email &amp; there is no option to go back to&nbsp;the previous version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However you can provide us the feedback through below link, so the developers will try implement in future.</p>

            <p>It depends how you connect to your Satellite service.&nbsp; If the local connection between your computer and the modem / router is by WiFi then you can get what you want.&nbsp; If it is not connected by WiFi then I do not think you can achieve what you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;it is a WiFi link&nbsp;then you can use the solution that I have provided <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/85eb67ac-af93-4cdf-8239-4a7a406ef94e?threadId=e4384dd6-d483-4600-b0d9-4c6ff6ad0416">
instructions for</a> in another thread in the forum - for a user who was also using a satellite connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That other thread is very long so I have linked you straight to the post explaining the solution [<em>don't scroll as the page loads or you'll move away from the intended section</em>].&nbsp; In essence, you use batch files and Task scheduler to switch your local
 WiFi link to your satellite modem / router between <em>metered </em>&amp; <em>non-metered
</em>at 12 midnight and 5am EST.&nbsp; When your connection is set to <em>metered</em> [daytime], Windows does not download updates.&nbsp; When it is set to
<em>non-metered </em>[overnight, 00:00 - 05:00] , Windows downloads updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do ask any questions about it here as the other user and I had already exchanged a lot&nbsp;of information so there might be some assumptions built into that instruction post that I have not realised.</p>

<p>Looks like I'm screwed then. I connect direct to the modem. Seems like this is something MS would/could do very easily. It's not like I want to "NOT" keep up to date, just need the updates whether for builds or security to be at certain times of the day.</p>

<p>I don't mind updates even if daily. I just need them to be downloaded during certain hours so I don't blowup my data quota. How hard is it to allow setting a "Update at &nbsp;_ _ o'clock only"</p>

Thing is we shouldn't have to jump thru hoops to do something so simple and important. Win10 should provide a solution.

            <p>I have your problem too. I really don`t know what to do. I have free bandwidth &nbsp;2-8 AM but during the day I only have 40 gigabytes per month. This is a joke that we can not confirm the updates. Today my PC again downloaded updates and 4 GB of my bandwidth
 was gone again.</p>
<p>If Microsoft will cost us more after the Windows 10 price, it`s not worth to have it inside the main PC.</p>
<p>Yesterday one of my friends shouted at me that I used his WI-FI for downloading, but when we checked downloads by a network monitoring we saw that 4 GB was downloaded by windows updates.</p>
<p>Even the networking program for Windows Updates is the same with other parts(like browser and Windows Store etc) (Host progress for windows services) and when we block it with firewall all the network stops.</p>
<p>We need that option Microsoft.... Please.... You can active that only on Group Policy that we schedule our updates` download time. In some countries like ours the cost that you make for updates is more than the cost of Windows 10 activation code.</p>

<p>
</p><p>2. RentalPeriod ( a Value List that allows the user to select the length of time for the rental.&nbsp; The choices are: Days, Weeks, Months. Values are in WBSCode Table.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Cost ( Contains the Value that will auto populate when the user selects the "EquipItem" &amp; "RentalPeriod")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to add code to the After Update Event of the "Cost" Field but unable to successfully make the value match the EquipItem &amp; RentalPeriod.</p>

<p><span>That's probably not the right event, because you want the Cost field to auto-populate. So the code has to be written in the EquipItem and the RentalPeriod AfterUpdate events.</span></p>
<p><span>Maybe a one-liner will do:<br />

if IsNull(Me.EquipCode) or isnull(Me.RentalPeriod) then exit sub</span></p>

</p><p>1. Table Structure of WBSCode is the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EquipID | EquipItem | EquipDayRate | EquipWeeklyRate | EquipMonthlyRate</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. RowSource of the EquipItem combo is:</p>

<p>OK, this is how I would do this.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Bound Column: 1</span></p>
<p><span>Column count: 5</span></p>
<p><span>Column Widths: 0";1";0";0";0"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the Rental Period combo's After Update event I would use Code like:</span></p>
<p><span>Dim intPeriod as Integer</span></p>
<p><span>If IsNull(Me.cboEquipItem) Then</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; MsgBox "You need to select the equipment first!"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Me.cboEquipItem.SetFocus</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Me.Undo</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Exit Sub</span></p>
<p><span>End If</span></p>
<p>Select Case Me.cboRentalPeriod</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Case "Days"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; intPeriod =2</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Case "Weeks"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; intPeriod = 3</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Case "Months"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; intPeriod = 4</p>
<p>End Select</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me.Cost = Me.cboEquipItem.Column(intPeriod)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should populate the cost control with the proper cost amount.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, after I posted that I discovered that if the styles do not have their own tab settings, the change in the default will carry through.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, in my normal.dotm template, the default style is Body Text. I used the Tab dialog box to change the default interval from .5 inches to .3 inches. This was not a style modification but was just done in the first (empty) paragraph of the template.
 The Body Text style is <em>not </em>based on normal. The template was saved and closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an existing document, there were no changes. In a new document, the new setting was present, even in other styles which are not based on the Body Text style.</p>
