<h2>            6288 screen display has gone blank and I have no PC back up</h2>
                    Hello, its my first time here. I have registered because my 6288 display has "gone" to a mass of coloured dots for the want of a better word. It happened last night. I have never backed up my phone to my PC but when I tried to do it tonight before it goes
 in for repair tomorrow my PC won't recognise the phone via the cable/infra red or blue tooth. I cannot get any display on the screen of the phone so I can't check the phone settings. Any help to offer?

            Unless you have the Bluetooth Switched on and Paired, then you'll need to "guess" the keystrokes that you need to be able to get it to connect to the PC.<br />
<br />
You can try and ask the repair centre to back it up, if its a hardware problem there should be no need for them to erase the phone but this cannot be Guarenteed.<br />
<br />
Hope this someway helps<br />

    <title>Unable to access Mass memory in N958GB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meeezz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to access Mass memory in N958GB</h2>
                    Just upgraded my N95 to N958GB yesterday, Yesterday I manage to connect via PC suite and data transfer, after installing all my needed applications and etc.... today I can't seem to connect via data transfer, it keep saying<br />
"Unable to activate data transfer mode, Mass memory in used by another application"<br />
<br />
Anyone has this problem, please advise how to access it,<br />
<br />
Previously when I am using N95, i encounter this problem too when I want to access my private folder, all i have to do is<br />
- shutdown my mobile<br />
- remove the memory card<br />
- power up the mobile, the mobile starts<br />
- after the mobile starts put my memory card and i can access to the mass storage<br />
<br />
but now this (N958GB) is without memory card, how am i to go about it??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

            This is a though one.<br />
<br />
Something in the 8GB internal memory is blocking access.<br />
<br />
Did you set the messages to be saved in the Drive E (8GB?) if so you may need to change it back to the phone.<br />
<br />
Did you install a theme in drive E and that theme is used now?, change to one of the default themes to see if this fixes it.<br />
<br />
Have you install a program in the Drive E that may be running in the background?, check that no programs are running in the background or unistall programs from E drive and instead install them in the Phone memory.<br />
<br />
If all fails you may need to Format the 8GB memory or take it back to a service center.<br />
<br />
Basically it's the same problem you experienced before with your previous phone but now you can't take out the memory card.

            Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
My messages are stored in Phone Memory, Themes and applications are installed in Phone Memory except MSDict Concise Oxford Dictionaries installed to Memory card, but i am sure this application is not running in the background.<br />
<br />
Guess, I have to uninstall this app first before formatting the mass memory.<br />
<br />
Then simply means we can't install any applications to the memory card if we need to access the mass storage? What's the purpose of 8GB then, only for music and photos?

            And videos, Documents, etc. and also some programs do work from the mass memory without restricting access.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the only way to know if the program works is to install it, then test that it works if it doesn't uninstall and install in phone memory instead.<br />
<br />
Also the Phone memory is faster than the mass memory so programs work better when installed in Phone Memory.

            Thanks so much for all the suggestions.<br />
<br />
I found the software which I had installed on Phone Memory but give me headache when access the Mass Memory.<br />
I had it deleted and boot the phone... Now i am able to access my mass memory.<br />
<br />
The naughty software is called "Font Magnifier"<br />
So for N95 8GB users - do NOT install this app if you want to access your mass memory.<br />
<br />
All the essential softwares i installed to phone memory except dictionaries to mass memory and now accessing it without any problem :)<br />
<br />
Problem Solved

            Yeah! I am getting exactly the same problem. Cannot access to Data transfer mode. Now I got some tips and tricks from this discussion. Thanks a lot! But I really disappointment bcoz I cannot install programs in mass memory if I wanna use it as data transfer
 mode. So 8GB is for what? only for multimedia? oh! no!<br />
That shouldn't be!!!

            I install applications all the time on the 8GB secondary mass memory on my N95 8GB. No problems in doing that.<br />
<br />
You can also change the message settings to point there, if you wish. (Contacts and Calendar info can only reside in the primary phone memory.)<br />
<br />
However, some applications lock access to the 8GB memory, and prevent the data transfer (USB mass storage) mode from working. Then you can only uninstall the app, change its settings (if it has such) or use only PC Suite mode.<br />
<br />

            I have had a similar experience with my Nokia 6120 classic.<br />
I have installed about 25 files, both applications and themes.<br />
I found that the problem was not Font Magnifier nor Autolock but a "non default" theme. I think the problems was not the theme by itself but having installed it in microsd memory while default themes are all in phone memory. Perhaps installing themes only in
 phone memory may also works, so all I can tell is "pay attention to themes". I went back to Nokia Velvet and now I can use Mass Memory Mode. All the best

            This is a crazy design by Nokia. I cannot use data transfer mode just as in the earlier messages. Because they have locked the 8GB inside the phone I have no way of 'resetting' it by the simple means of taking the card out and putting it back again (works
 every time when the memory card is swappable). Surely it would not have taken a huge amount of foresight to put in a simple utility that could tell you what application is "using" the mass memory? And then be able to unlock it?<br />
<br />
Is it really the case that I have to uninstall all my applications 1-by-1 until I find the right one? Or format the memory card (and thereby lose DRM activation keys - great design again)?<br />
<br />
Come on Nokia - provide some useful help for those of us who are trying to be evangelists for your new phones!

            Okay, so I found the answer by uninstalling applications. I looked the apps I had recently installed and went in reverse. I din't have to go far - it was Vodafone's "My Communities". I have no idea why this was tying up the "mass memory" even when completely
 closed down.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows how to install "My communities" without it locking up the memory I'd apppreciate hearing how - I had just started using it to load photos to Facebook.<br />
<br />
Thx.

    <title>How to get valid&#47;new Root Certificate for Entourage 2008 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maymaymaymaymay  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get valid&#47;new Root Certificate for Entourage 2008</h2>
                    <p>Finally managed to reinstall Entourage 2008 in iMac with Yosemite 10.10.4 after 3 days of wrangling. However, still can't find the solution to my original problem of how to get a new and valid Root Certificate for sending emails in Entourage. I know the
 difficulty is because MS is no longer supporting this legacy email client, but for many reasons I need to carry on using it. The error message started after the latest upgrade to Yos 10.10.4, but that could of course be a coincidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>would really appreciate hearing if anyone has found a solution.</p>

            You know it wasn't cheap purchasing Microsoft Office and for reasons I also can't switch, I need my entourage to collect my emails.&nbsp; I have thousands saved in files and now I can't touch them.&nbsp; I am getting the same message.&nbsp; Please let me know if you

            <p>I trawled for nearly 24 hours and finally came across a geeky explanation from a link I can't remember. Basically, it implied that there is a built-in fault in Entourage that means an automated handshake process is not recognised by Entourage the first time
 you open it to send something, even though there is valid certification. Whatever the process is, when you click 'OK', you are telling it to go ahead and send the message, which Entourage does. Then for the most part whilst Entourage remains open, it remembers
 the automatic process and doesn't come up with the error message until the next time you open up Entourage.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the short and untechnical language summary of what I read. The upshot of it is that you just have to put up with the "warning message and OK-ing it" process till the day some kind and clever person might write a script for us that will do the OK
 on your behalf without showing you the warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So no cheer. Since MS has long turned its back on Entourage this is what we have to live with. Still worth it because the Outlook or Mail alternatives are just not as good in appearance, manageability and highlighting/colour labelling.</p>

            <p>Mine tries to send/receive email at timed intervals so even if I leave it open, it will still give me same message when it attempts to get email again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be too worried about just hitting ok because it leaves you vulnerable to a hacker.&nbsp; I did hit ok once but still happens every few minutes when tries to send/rec.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far my fix has been to export to Apple mail and just get over it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sad considering I've paid for my Microsoft Office and its just not current any more so they don't support it or update it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I"m not a fan of the other mail alternatives but I guess I will have to adapt.&nbsp;

            <p>Yes, I think the multi-warnings come because there are momentary blips in the internet connection not usually perceptible as it reconnects again, but as this software is faulty, it alerts you to the dropped connections by flagging up the warning message
 again as each reconnection acts like a fresh attempt to send, if you get my drift.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple's Mail is till nowhere near good enough when you dig deeper into using it. I am trying out the Preview version of Outlook 2016 right now. It is reasonable in appearance and sort of does the job, but in my opinion not as well as Entourage, for my needs.
 The current trend of washed out greys dominates both Mail and Outlook, but i think Outlook is marginally more user friendly.</p>

Entourage 2008 - Exchange root certificate
<p style="color: rgba(170, 170, 170, 1)">

<div style="color: rgba(64, 79, 86, 1)">
<p>We have had the delight in trying to solve the issue of root certificates with Entourage 2008 and Exchange 2007 (Microsoft Small Business 2008)</p>
<p>Amazingly, with lots of people on the web with the same problem, no-one has posted a solution? As a small business we at Alpine hope this saves you the time and expense that we have incurred trying to solve this
 problem!</p>
<p>Here goes with the solution for how to install a root certificate on Mac OS X, Entourage 2008 and Microsoft Exchange:</p>
<p>First we need to create a certificate:</p>
Error message: unable to establish a secure connection to XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX because a correct root certificate is not installed.
<p>Within IIS console on SBS 2008</p>
<ul>
<li>Server Certificates</li><li>Create self signed certificate i.e. mail.myserver.com or buy one!</li><li>SBS web applications</li><li>Bindings</li><li>Edit - where it says SSL certificate - ensure correct certificate is selected - or select view drop down menu.</li><li>View</li><li>Details</li><li>Copy to file</li><li>Next</li><li>Yes, export the private key</li><li>Next</li><li>Choose Personal Information Exchange</li><li>Tick boxes for;</li><li>"include all certificates in the certification path if possible"</li><li>and</li><li>"export all extended properties"</li><li>Give it a password</li><li>Save the certificate.</li><li>Go to location where you saved the file/certificate and email your users or put on an accessible network share.</li></ul>
<p><br />
Save certificate to your mac (desktop).</p>
Installing the certificate on mac OS X.
<p><br />
We need to install the certificate in two places:<br />
<br />
On mac<br />
Open hard drive<br />
Search for Microsoft cert manager (choose files to search) and open it<br />
Import<br />
Locate saved certificate - open<br />
Enter password you gave to certificate earlier.<br />
Certificate now imported.<br />
Quit cert manager</p>
<p><br />
Install certificate on Keychain login<br />
Now search for "Keychain access"<br />
Highlight login<br />
File<br />
Import<br />
Browse for certificate<br />
Make sure you are importing into login key chain<br />
Enter certificate password<br />
<br />
You should now have 2 certificates that you have imported. One is expandable.<br />
On both certificates:<br />
Double click<br />
Expand trust<br />
Under field "when using this certificate"<br />
Choose "always trust"<br />
Then enter MAC password</p>
Now go to to Entourage 2008, connect to your exchange 2007 server.
<p><br />
Open entourage and note no certificate problems!<br />

            <p>I cannot believe the answer, finally, was so simple. All this headache and heartache comes from quite simply, how you have to specify the receiving mail and the sending mail servers in your account setup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple insists that we have to enter "imap.mail.me.com" and "smtp.mail.me.com" as the Incoming and Outgoing servers details. However, because of the age of Entourage, there is no valid certification between these server details and the Entourage app, presumably
 because Entourage 2008 predates these newer server details. Hence we get the error messages about Root Certs etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I went back to my previous account setup, in which the incoming server is specified "mail.me.com" and outgoing server is "stmp.me.com". Hooray - now everything is working brilliantly. Apple would say these settings are wrong - but for the time being
 at least, until they block this route into my mac.com email servers, I don't get those Root Certificate error messages anymore!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just two little words in my account settings is all it took to relieve me of three nightmare days of researching the problem. I hardly care whether this is making my mails more vulnerable, though I hope they are at least as safe as they ever used to be before
 the problem arose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works for others in the same predicament.</p>

            <p>Is this set up still working for you? So when you reverted to the "old" server info did your account type change back to a POP and/or disable the IMAP account? Also did you need to change port and SSL settings. I have my original Mac.com account still set
 up and it won't work. I get server failures when I try to use that info. <br />
<br />
Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you. </p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>Funny thing I just went to the Apple Mail Set up page and it asked me for the address that I wanted to set up and not the eMail client that I am using. When I put in my mac.com address it returned the servers you are using, without the .mail. that you took
 out.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Incoming Mail Server </strong></p>
<ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't believe there is any issue with your phone or settings on the phone. Our best hope is to wait for the final version to be released. Till then the Skype experience on our phones will vary and frankly, continue to disappoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To MS credit, they do mention that the Skype app is a preview version, so I am cool with the issues Skype currently has.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you would like to know how to select all contacs when adding it to BCC. I can imagine how convenient this would be for you. Please be informed though that you would have to select each contact to add them to the list. I apologize but there
 is no way to select all contacts for BCC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            There is no way to select ALL contacts for ANY email through Outlook????

<div>How am I supposed to let everyone know that my hotmail has changed to Outlook other than by selecting each individually???? That is just so ridiculous! Please tell me there is a way!</div>

There is only a workaround.&nbsp; Create a new group and add all your contacts to it.&nbsp; Then type the group name into the email<br />
<br />
By the way your Hotmail email address will continue to work as will contacts, and calender so you really dont need to notify anyone.<br />

<h2>            Counts based on multiple column conditions with duplicates - formula&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with trying to produce a formula to produce some counts. I am sure there must be an easy solution but I can not see it! So help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the example values below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">One app may have multiple envs, with some of the envs being in scope and some of them not. But if at least one env is in scope, then the app is in scope. Likewise if at least one env has "Started" then the app has "Started".
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
I want to produce the following results but using formulas:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- Count of in-scope apps = 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (app1, app3, app4, app5)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- Count of started apps = 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (app1, app3, app4)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I think pivot tables can be used, but I really need a formula to properly summarise the data into a useable form.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This is just a sample of the problem to try and get a solution. There is a much bigger multi-tab spreadsheet behind this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone provide some formulas that will work for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need more info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these 2. These are both ARRAY formula, see below for how to enter them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Count if in scope (4)</p>
<p>
</p><p>=COUNT(1/FREQUENCY(IF($C$1:$C$100="Yes",IF($A$1:$A$100&lt;&gt;"",MATCH($A$1:$A$100,$A$1:$A$100,0))),ROW($A$1:$A$100)-ROW($A$1)+1))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Count of started (3)</p>
<p>
</p><p>=COUNT(1/FREQUENCY(IF($D$1:$D$100="Started",IF($A$1:$A$100&lt;&gt;"",MATCH($A$1:$A$100,$A$1:$A$100,0))),ROW($A$1:$A$100)-ROW($A$1)+1))</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter<br />
and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets<br />
around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula<br />
you must enter it again with CTRL+Shift+Enter.</p>

            <p>Two things to do here ...</p>
<ol>
<li>Compute a formula to find number of unique texts available in a column
<ul>
<li>Below formula finds number of unique Applications in your list (Assuming the data provided starts from A1)</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>=SUM(IF(FREQUENCY(MATCH(A2:A11,A2:A11,0),MATCH(A2:A11,A2:A11,0))&gt;0,1))</p>
<ul>
<li>This will give you 5 (App1, App2, App3, App4 etc.)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you're comfortable formulating this it is very simple for next step</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Create a simple IF Condition for creating App-Scope &amp; App-Status (Some screen shots attached including formulas)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sum function written in Column&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>ColA - A12- 5 - Total unique Applications</li><li>ColE - E12 - 4 - Total App's in Scope</li><li>ColF - F12 - 3 - Total Apps with started Status</li></ul>

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee044171-fa8d-4bf9-be65-a52673c15a07" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Formula in E12 is "=SUM(IF(FREQUENCY(MATCH(E2:E11,E2:E11,0),MATCH(E2:E11,E2:E11,0))&gt;0,1))-1"</p>
<p>Formula in F12 is </p>
<p>"=SUM(IF(FREQUENCY(MATCH(F2:F11,F2:F11,0),MATCH(F2:F11,F2:F11,0))&gt;0,1))-1"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not want to create additional column ... Modify E2:E11 with "=IF(C2:C12="Yes",A2:A12)" in every place &amp; make it an array formula ... This is just the redundant part&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"=SUM(IF(FREQUENCY(MATCH(IF(C2:C11="Yes",A2:A11,""),IF(C2:C11="Yes",A2:A11,""),0),MATCH(IF(C2:C11="Yes",A2:A11,""),IF(C2:C11="Yes",A2:A11,""),0))&gt;0,1))-1"
<strong>This Array formula will give you </strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Count of in-scope apps</strong></span></p>

<p>Hi Zakzak234,<br />
<br />
<del>Yes, it's available for Arabic Language. But please note that the languages that you use in a document can affect how your Office program checks and presents readability scores. Languages like Arabic or Chinese, which reference words in different ways,
 will not score accurately due to inaccurate letter counting and sentence analysis.</del></p>
<p>
</p><p>The readability algorithms in Word use syllable counting to determine their scores. The current syllable counter used here will only work with English text. --

                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've built a spreadsheet which has 3 sheets, with all content pretty much fitting on one screen (so you see, &nbsp;the spreadsheet isnt very big).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, when attempting &nbsp;to do a goal seek on the named range, the error comes up for no clear reason. &nbsp;If i get rid of the goal seek, everything works fine, its only when i try to goal seek something via VBA that i get the "unable to get the number
 format"</p>

</p><p>As far as removal of sensitive/confidential data is concerned, you have done a very right thing.</p>
<p>In fact I forgot to mention that in my earlier communication.</p>
<p>However, you have also removed some function (not sure if that function could be playing any role in the error).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give me a day or so to have a look at the file you have shared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, just give this a try - </p>
<p>
</p><p>in the screen-shot which you have shared, it can be seen that you are writing </p>
<p>sheets.range().goalseek goal:=0, ...=sheets("").range()</p>
<p>
</p><p>instead of just giving sheets dot range dot ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try to write&nbsp;it complete&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; workbook.sheets().range().....</p>

<h2>            Marco to Generate XML file from Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to read and excel file and generate a XML file based on Excel Data as Below</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel Data will look like this</p>
<p>

<h2>            Paragraph Marks</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need help on inserting paragraph marks before/after a table in MS Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the end of the table and pres enter, it just creates another cell rather than moving to a new paragraph. How can I stop that from happening?</p>

            <p>When you say "click on the end of the table", exactly where is that with respect to the table structure? Is it within the last cell, between the last cell and the final row marker, or really below the table? Each of these locations gives a different result
 when you press Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's easiest to tell what the location is if you click the ¶ button on the Home tab to display nonprinting characters, including the cell markers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you click inside the cell, you just get a new paragraph inside the cell:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9f5449c-4472-4133-aceb-35497998b9d3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0fb6d030-9bb1-4906-96a0-cda2c48a20aa" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you click outside the last cell, but somewhere in the margin to the right of that row, the cursor goes between the table and the final row marker, or it might select the row marker:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da2a7d32-a425-41ff-a3fe-6a36799a6c51" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then pressing Enter creates a new row, which is probably what's happening to you:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48a5ac3f-92eb-4d39-bf36-c2fb79f32f7e" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>What you really want is to click at the start of the next paragraph below the table:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89b6c0c7-3afe-43ae-9609-65b77b151767" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing Enter there adds a new paragraph between the table and the existing text:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/200e9116-140b-4126-9251-d155eca02392" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, if you want to add a paragraph mark before a table, click at the end of the existing paragraph before the table, and press Enter there. A special case is when the table is the first thing in the document, and there is no paragraph above it. For
 that, put the cursor at the left of the first character in the first cell, and click Table Tools &gt; Layout &gt; Split Table. That will create a new paragraph above the table.</p>

            <p>There is 'always' a paragraph mark after a table. It is not possible to have a table as the last element in any of the story ranges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, it is possible to float a table and hence have it appear below the last paragraph mark. Select your table and check the Table Properties. On the Table Tab, the text wrapping should be set to None if you want to manipulate the paragraphs above and
 below the table.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where exactly is your cursor when you say you 'click on the end of the table'? Where does this created cell appear?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not standard behaviour in Word to create a cell by pressing Enter so perhaps you have a macro or something loaded that is hijacking the standard behaviour. If your cursor is on the right side of the table row then Enter will add a complete row to the
 table.</p>

            <p>As guessed pointed out, I do NOT know of any way of creating a table without a blank paragraph mark after it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have Home tab &gt; Paragraph group &gt; "Show Hide" turned on to show para marks?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A simple, "brute force" approach is add a new blank row to the table. With the cursor in it, go to Table Tools Layout contextual tab &gt; Merge group &gt; Split table.&nbsp; This will split the bottom row off into a "new" table with a blank line between them. Then
 you can delete the new table.</p>
<p>Could you post an example file we can "play with" in skydrive. Give us an edit link to it.</p>

<h2>            HTC HD2 no longer syncs with desktop &#40;windows 7 &#43; outlook 2010&#41;</h2>
                    My HD2 has mainly synchronised with no problems. However, for the last ten days. It just gives an error message (0x85010014). I'm running windows 7 and haven't changed anything. I deleted the partnership and set it up again, no change. Have re-set phone.<br />
Have searched the forum but not found anything relevant. I think the problem is that it is trying to sync with exchange server which I don't have or need. Just want to sync with my desktop.<br />
<br />
All help very much appreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks guys

            Hi physiology1225 
<br />
<br />When a college/school provides your Office licence, that is normally switched off once you graduate, there is usually a grace period for you to collect your files, before they expire your account, that may have lapsed
<br />
<br />Try logging into OneDrive in a web browser with your personal details to see if your OneNote books are stored there
<br /><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/signin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/about/signin/</a>
<br />
<br />If you cannot gain access to your OneNote files from there, you will need to contact your college/school and have them provide access to your old account so you may make copies of your work . ..

            <p>The Puzzle cover page is in Word 2010. It is not available in Word 2013. Perhaps if you explain to your professor that you are using a different version of Word and understand the concept of inserting a cover page but don't have that specific one available,
 he will be more understanding. See <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-word/i-have-office-2013-need-themes-austin-from-office/fac6c778-1e2a-44c7-94a0-a6b8810d3c68">
<strong>this post</strong> </a>about a similar situation where a student was able to negotiate with his instructor. (You probably won't get extra points for suggesting that, since Word 2010 is no longer available for purchase, his class is now behind the times,
 and his syllabus needs to be updated!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that, with each Ribbon version, the Word design team have found it necessary to introduce new themes and Quick Parts without retaining the old ones. I'm sure they think they are giving Word a "fresh" look, but they are making a lot of trouble
 for students and teachers who have a mix of Word versions. (If you search this forum for "Office themes," you'll find many posters in the same boat.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone (I thought it was Jay Freedman) has made Office themes available for download, but this would not help you, anyway, because the themes don't include the Quick Parts that you would need.</p>

Suzanne is correct that the Office themes don't include the cover pages. However, I've created a template that contains the single cover page for Puzzle, and posted it in my SkyDrive's Public folder. You should be able to download it from<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=41770EA1A35BC44D%214772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=41770EA1A35BC44D%214772</a><br />
<br />
Clicking the link opens the template, Puzzle Building Block.dotx, in the Word Web App. Click File &gt; Save As &gt; Download and save it on your computer.<br />
<br />
Put the downloaded file into the folder on your computer that you get by pasting this line into the Windows Explorer address bar and pressing Enter:<br />
<br />
%appdata%\Microsoft\Document Building Blocks\1033\15<br />
<br />
That folder should already contain the file Built-In Building Blocks.dotx, which contains the building blocks that come with Office 2013.<br />
<br />
If Word is running, restart it. It will load the building blocks from both templates.<br />

            When you are talking to your instructor, point them to this discussion so that they can see that several MS MVPs, people who MS has publicly recognized as "Most Valuable Professionals" have said that the instructor was "mistaken" (or some other polite
 politically correct, inoffensive way of saying "wrong") to deduct marks because you could not make use of a feature that was not included in your legal copy of Office.
<br />
<br />
Of course, if they want to be difficult, they could say you should have copied the cover page template from someone who has Office 2010 ... I've had a few instructors like that, they can never be wrong, no matter how right you are ... &lt;sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
You have our support, good luck.<br />

            I found a way to cheat the system. I had office 2007 at my job, i found the coverpage i needed, copied it to my flashdrive, and saved it so i can use it on my 2013. I was shocked but it actually worked. I called my school to ask them why they sold me the
 2013 software when i asked for 2010 and they told me that it updates to the newest version when downloaded. I also asked my professor n he pretty much told me to bad.

<br />
That is not cheating. It is simply taking advantage of features in Office that allow it to be "backward compatible".<br />
<br />
If your "2010 automatically upgraded to 2013", you probably have an Office 365 subscription. There is very little we can do to control those "upgrades.<br />
<br />
That reaction from the prof is about what I expect. They have unrealistic expectations, then make it your "fault" and problem.

            Hi Paul
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Sometimes, a random application you have installed, might be executing a startup script up on signing into Windows 10.
<br />
<br />You can try performing a clean boot to see if it helps:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />For peace of mind, you can also scan the system:
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />Look through the list for any entries for suspicious software installed
<br />Select it then click uninstall
<br />
<br />Reset all your web browsers to their original factors state
<br />
<br />In Microsoft Edge - Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; Microsoft Edge
<br />Select it, click Advanced options &gt; Reset
<br />
<br />Reset Chrome settings to default - Google Chrome Help

<br />
<br />Use Malwarebytes to scan and clean the computer.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Also use ESET Sysrescue offline scanner to scan and clean the computer, see instructions in the following article:

<h2>            Folders &#34;the file so that changes to the file will be reflected in your item&#34; are being created in my ost file and even after deleting them they come back.</h2>
                    <p>Folders "the file so that changes to the file will be reflected in your item" are being created in my ost and even after deleting them they come back.&nbsp; I'm using Windows&nbsp;7 Professional with&nbsp;Outlook 2007&nbsp;and Microsoft Exchange 2003 (SBS edition) on a local
 network.&nbsp; I have a 10gb size ost file and from what I read Outlook 2007 can go all the way up to 20gb.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Recently have I seen&nbsp;an issue of what some folks are calling Ghost Folders appearing .&nbsp; Each folder is listed in sequential order underneath the Sent Items folder.&nbsp; Not a subfolder the the Sent Items folder.&nbsp; Just listed under it on the screen.&nbsp; Each titled
 with the name "the file so that changes to the file will be reflected in your item" and ending in a number starting from&nbsp;.1 going all the was to&nbsp;.9&nbsp; (the first of these folder in the list has no number after it).&nbsp; Also I have appearing under my Draft Folder,
 additional draft folders numbering 1-3, as well the same thing happening under the Junk E-Mail folder, folders appearing in sequential order 1-3. All of these Ghost Folders (as I'm referring to them in this post) have the Microsoft hand icon on them indicating
 that they are all shared folders. </p>
<p>I have tried deleting the folders but they slowly come back during normal use.&nbsp; I also seem to lose emails when I delete the folders so I know that it is some kind of place holder for data waiting to sync to the Exchange Server.&nbsp; But this pc is on a network
 that is on the same small Lan as with the server and there should be no reason for any lag issues.&nbsp; I navigate normally in Outlook with no problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sending and receive does not seem to be affected.&nbsp; Already&nbsp;sucessfully&nbsp;archived the ost and issue was not
 resolved.&nbsp; Tested the ost file for errors within the Outlook diagnostic program and found no error with the ost file.&nbsp; I'm at a loss what to do next.&nbsp; If anyone can help that would be great.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Additionally, we recently started using delegated authority for all&nbsp;incoming emails on this account and shared the personal calendar to the secretary.&nbsp; About two weeks later we started seeing this error and don't&nbsp;know if it's related.&nbsp; We need this function
 to be working in our enviorment for production purposes.&nbsp; This is an active directory network even though it's overkill for our needs.&nbsp; But no special permissions have been established that would create this error that we can tell.&nbsp;

            You can run applications designed to run on Windows Mobile 5&nbsp; on WM6. I have the same device and it is the best I've ever had. Obviously, only applications designed for Smartphone will work on your device.

            <p>Hi, LaalangJafaru.<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
To set up Cortana for the first time, you can either tap the Cortana Tile on the Start screen or press the Search Search Icon button. She'll ask if you mind answering a few questions; this will help her understand what's important to you and what information
 she should bring to your attention. You can also tell her what name you want her to call you and make sure she pronounces it correctly. Cortana sends speech data to Microsoft to improve personalized speech and speech recognition. You don't have to use a name
 for Cortana to work, but if you do, you can use any name you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also check the link below to know more about Cortana:</p>

<h2>            How do I take a screenshot in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to create either a PDF or a snapshot from a billing program to send as a statement to clients via attachment in email. &nbsp;My billing program does not create it's own PDF. &nbsp;I am using Windows 8. &nbsp;Any ideas?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open your webpage on the Desktop Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>From the top menu bar, select "File"&nbsp; (If theres no menu bar, right-click on the top blue border)</p>
<p>Select "Save As"</p>
<p>Name the file and select the .html extension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can do a scrrenshot too, but the quality is not always that good., and you have to designate a program to open&nbsp;it with.</p>
<p>Press the Windows Key and<em> </em><strong>prt sc</strong> at the same time.&nbsp; (your screen will dim momentarily)</p>
<p>The screenshot will go into your Pictures library.&nbsp;</p>
