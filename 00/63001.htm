<h2>            Diablo 3 - Bloodstained Letter&#47;Challenges Bug</h2>
                    
<p>Many, particularly on the PC version, before the game was released on the console, complained online that they couldn't get the Bloodstained Letter, one part of the People's Lore book challenge in Act III. &nbsp;It just refuses to drop.</p>
<div><span>Well, there is a very real bug related to this issue and it exists on the consoles as well. &nbsp;I also now know the parameters of this bug.&nbsp; I have run into&nbsp;it myself while playing the game on the Xbox 360.&nbsp;
 The game was originally released on the PC on 2012-MAY-15.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;it would appear that&nbsp;Blizzard could not reproduce, find or fix the bug by the time the game went gold for release on the consoles&nbsp;on 2013-SEP-03. If you want to skip the explanation and just want
 the bottom line, scroll to it near the bottom of this message. &nbsp;Otherwise, here's how it goes...</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><strong>1.&nbsp; It's not a bug directly related to the Bloodstained Letter in itself (keep reading).</strong></span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><strong>2.&nbsp; It a bug related to the tracking mechanism for the Challenges (or PC Achievements).</strong></span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>When you read a lore book or talk to someone two things happen (hopefully in quick succession)</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>a)&nbsp; The item (book or conversation) gets flagged as done.&nbsp; For example, conversations listed for a Follower or NPC will display as grayed out.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>b)&nbsp; Any associated challenge (or achievement on the PC) then gets tripped, and viola... you get a checkmark or the challenge pops up on screen.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>For some reason, a particular item can get flagged as done (a), but not trigger the associated challenge (b).&nbsp; That's the bug.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><strong>3.&nbsp; How do I know?</strong></span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>I have seen a few times where I have had a conversation with a Follower and then when I go later to check if that conversation has a checkmark beside it in the associated Challenge it does not.&nbsp; But when
 I go back to that Follower I find that that particular conversation is in fact grayed out.&nbsp; Step "a" was&nbsp;accomplished, but "b" was not.&nbsp; Fortunately I can have that same conversation with that Follower again by&nbsp;clicking on it again (even though it is grayed
 out).&nbsp; I&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the challenges&nbsp;again and&nbsp;the conversation&nbsp;is checked off now.&nbsp; I have also seen where I have completed an item (conversation or lore book) but there was a delay before it registered in the challenges.&nbsp; When I first checked the challenge it
 did not register, but I wait a bit and look again it is now has.&nbsp; My point is, there is a problem going from step "a" to step "b" and it is fundamentally a challenge tracking bug.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><strong>4.&nbsp; How this is exacerbated with the Bloodstained Letter</strong></span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>With the same character you can imitate the same conversations multiple times.&nbsp; So, if the challenge doesn't register the first time, you can have another shot at it.&nbsp; If the conversation is still listed
 for the associated character you can just play it again (though it's probably grayed out),&nbsp; If&nbsp;it isn't listed anymore, you can go back and replay&nbsp;an&nbsp;earlier&nbsp;level where it is listed (by selecting&nbsp;the level&nbsp;from the main menu).&nbsp; This is not possible with lore
 books.&nbsp; Once a lore book has been read, meaning step "a" has been completed, it does not drop anymore.&nbsp; The bonus for most lore books is that they have multiple spawn points.&nbsp; Coming back to the same level and hitting a satchel will usually drop a lore book
 in the series you haven't read yet.&nbsp; Some you have to read at certain points or levels in the stories progression (such as Leah's journals), but again, you can replay these levels.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>The problem is exacerbated with the Bloodstained Letter however.&nbsp; It will only drop on the Dead Soldier (single spawn point), wherever he is found in Bastion's Keep... assuming that step "a" is not flagged
 as&nbsp;done yet.&nbsp; Once step "a" has been done, it will never again drop with your present character on any mode (Normal, Hard, Nightmare, or Inferno).&nbsp; In other words you have ONE chance only to get this letter.&nbsp; If the challenge bug impedes registering that it
 actually happened (i.e. step "b" fails) you can't make it happen by re-playing the level.&nbsp;With "a" already flagged, the Dead Solider will simply drop gold (if anything).&nbsp;The only way to get the Bloodstained Letter to drop again, is to play the game with another
 character that hasn't completed step "a" yet.&nbsp; Play&nbsp;the new character all the way to the Act III Quest, "The Breached Keep".&nbsp;It is unlikely that the bug would kick in on this other play-through, but it could.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>Of course, if you never did find the Dead Soldier in the first place and never did get the drop, you have a chance to get it if you replay the area.&nbsp; That assumes that step "a" hasn't happened yet.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>In my case, I am pretty sure I heard the dialog for the Bloodstained Letter as it was read aloud on my first time through the area.&nbsp; I was just in the middle of battling monsters at the time and wasn't paying
 a lot of attention.&nbsp; Somewhere along the way I noticed that I didn't get the checkmark for the Bloodstained Letter in the People's Lore challenge.&nbsp; I replayed the level too many times to count, hoping I would eventually get it.&nbsp; But then, when I looked at
 what the letter contains&nbsp;I remembered hearing it.&nbsp; I considered my experiences with Follower conversations and put it all together.&nbsp; Now I too am virtually locked out and unable to complete the People's Lore challenge, both a nuisance and extremely frustrating
 - especially since I actually read the letter in-game at least once.&nbsp; The tracking system missed it (as a result of the bug).</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> It is all related to a very real bug with the challenge or achievement system that&nbsp;doesn't always register&nbsp;an item has been done.&nbsp; It is a particular problem with the Bloodstained
 Letter because you don't get a second chance at it with the same character.&nbsp; You are pretty much toast if the bugs kicks in and you miss it.&nbsp; Simply replaying the level will NOT get it for you, no matter how many times you play it (UNLESS you completely overlooked
 the Dead Soldier when you went through the level).&nbsp; The work-around that&nbsp;others have&nbsp;described&nbsp;works is to play the game again with another character and hopefully you will get it this time when you get to the Bastion's Keep.&nbsp; Other items can be affected by
 this same bug, but in most cases, farming the area or initiating the conversation again will get the desired results.&nbsp; Not so with the Bloodstained Letter.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>Hopefully with this additional data, Blizzard can reproduce, find and fix this bug and a patch will be supplied so a separate play-through with another character is not necessary if you miss it the first
 time.&nbsp; And hopefully this also provides all you users with enough explanation so you know what you can and cannot do until it is fixed.</span></div>

            <p>Hey there Stonehawk!<br /><br />Let me just say that this is an exceptionally well written forum post. I've read a lot of forum posts and this one gets your point across in such a clear way. It's awesome.<br /><br />Since you went to such great effort to detail this issue out, I'm assuming that you have already reported this bug to Blizzard? If not, I definitely suggest making a post over in the <a href="http://us.battle.net/d3/forum/5386229/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Bug Report Forums</a> so that Blizzard can take a look and hopefully get things resolved for everyone&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have to agree with Cerb...this is one of the most articulate posts NOT from an official xbox support member. Its like Data from star trek is explaining this problem to me. I have heard about this...it was my understanding its been reported and they are
 looking into patching it. I dunno if this is like a one in every so many issue...I personally have found it. I am however having trouble with the act 1 lore 'the hanging tree'. Ive done it about 30 times now and still nothing. I dont know if they might be
 connected or not...its the only one im missing. </p>

    <title>Windows 10 Start Menu and Search broken by April 2018 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gill bates esquire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu and Search broken by April 2018 Update &#40;Redstone 4&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a 6-month old machine that *was* running a clean Windows 10 Pro install on X299 architecture flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like many people have already reported, I applied the April 2018 Update (also known as Redstone 4) and the Start Menu entirely breaks.<br />
</p>
<p>Symptom 1: Clicking the Start button results in a flickering mess and nothing can be selected. Nothing.</p>
<p>Symptom 2: The task bar's Search box also cannot receive any text entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is ridiculous. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows' entire purpose is to provide a Start Menu and run Apps. That's it. Forget "Timeline", Fake Dropbox and all the other bloat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After struggling with many of the "fixes" suggested by MS and others on similarly reported Redstone issues across the interwebs, nothing works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very fortunate I took an images of my drive one month ago, so I've re-imaged back to pre-April 2018 Update and entirely disabled the Windows Update service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize this will likely get a Copy &amp; Paste "We're sorry for this problem" and the useless cavalcade of "have you tried sfc /scannow, driver upgrades, restore points, etc". Done all that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, this is not acceptable software quality from any company, let alone one of the World's largest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The April 2018 Windows 10 Update is an atrocious display of incompetence. Clearly a result of poorly designed permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft even test software anymore?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>Thanks for your input Andre, but "early adopter issue" is an inaccurate description of this RS4 bug.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Windows 10 RS4 / April 2018 /&nbsp;Spring Update was forced upon my machine and it's been coming for a long time through the insider program, originally slated for April until as per internal memo it was pushed back to May 8 for unknown reasons. It's now
 evident it was never ready for release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many others are facing this same RS4 "Start Menu Broken" bug, which is utterly ridiculous. Fortunately I know what I'm doing, but many unfortunate Windows users will get very stuck as a result of this poorly tested update and they may not be able to roll-back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft must be held to account with this gross lapse of quality control which renders paid product unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>RS4 should in reality be pulled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Unfortunately I wiped the failed update entirely when I re-imaged. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have downtime in a few weeks I may try RS4 again and post the a bug report as you suggest, but I do suspect others will beat me to it.</p>

<h2>            Games downloaded to the Xbox 360 hard drive through the game disc.</h2>
                    
<p><strong>I've downloaded games to my hard drive on the Xbox 360 through the game disc, yet&nbsp;after I play a&nbsp;match; the game will close and say disc is unreadable, also I can't see aiming down the sight with a sniper.</strong><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong><strong>Why does this only happen only after a match is over ?<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why do tiny scratches affect a game if it is already downloaded ?<br />
</strong><strong><br />
</strong><strong>What's the point of downloading the game from the disc onto the hard drive, then not allowing me to play because of the disc ?<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong><strong>?<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disc type you're having issues with: NTSC COD Black ops II.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Steps you've tried:&nbsp;Cleaning disc, clearing cache.</strong></p>

<p>Even though you install the game from the disc on your hard drive the xbox still needs to confirm that you own that game.</p>
<p>When a disc gets scratched it matters how many scratches are on the disc and how deep those scratches are. The laser still needs to read the disc and if it can't read the data through the scratches then it will cause an error.</p>
<p>The point of installing from a disc is so that the game will load a bit faster. This also prevents less wear and tear on the drive because it's not constantly spinning. The drive will read the disc when you first put the game in to make sure you own it and
 it will read all of the data so it's not constantly spinning. After it reads the disc it will stop and won't have to keep constantly reading the game.</p>
<p>If the game is not working for you try deleting it then re-installing it again. Hopefully it will work for you.</p>

    <title>Italic text in ALL text editors&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Italic text in ALL text editors&#33;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hi</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have a very weird problem: all my text editors(except MS Word) display italic text ONLY.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Having Italic text in Notepad &amp; Notepad++ it's not much of a problem. But that's not all.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All my IDEs have the same problem: DEV C++, NetBeans and VS 2008 are all displaying only italic text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The problem occurred when I tried to remove a game. While the uninstaller was running an error msg box popped out telling me it cannot remove a font file in the game directory. I clicked on skip and deleted the file after a system restart. Since
 then, every text file I view is italic and coding in Italic gives me headaches.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Besides that, some Windows fonts are weird, blurry and even some web pages like Bing and Google are having the same problem. When it comes to 3rd arty apps things are getting worse. For example, reading the instructions on an install wizard is impossible
 since the text looks something like this: &nbsp;<a href="http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/7267/prb1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/7267/prb1.png</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Even now, when I am writing this post, the HTML view displays italic text and I cannot see any italic tag.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/6248/prb2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/6248/prb2.png</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>I tried adjusting Clear Type and reseting font settings &nbsp;and even editing the registry but it didn't work out. I even tried system restore but no luck. I don't use font utilities or other customization tools. I only add fonts from time to time,
 fonts I need to use with Photoshop. Also, the only system maintenance utility I use is Tune Up Utilities 2011 and I already used the undo option but it didn't work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Something like this happened to me a few months ago, except the fact that back then all Windows was Italic &amp; Bold &amp; blurry. Same thing for apps. I tried fixing the problem and managed to get the regular font back even if in some cases windows fonts
 were still blurry and weird. I tried changing font options for every text editor or IDE installed but it still didn't work out.</strong><strong> Even if I set the text to Regular nothing changes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any solutions for this?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for your fast reply. However I managed to solve the problem without even knowing.</p>
<p>I have updated WebMatrix and I wasn't able to open any project because of some font error. And since trying to reset font settings didn't work out I copied the font folder from my laptop to my desktop and this solved my problem. It's weird that I didn't
 think of it when I saw resetting font settings didn't work out :))</p>
<p>Thanks again :)</p>

            <p>Hey there Pendragon!<br /><br />To start off, let's try simplifying your setup.<strong> I suggest connecting your Xbox One console directly to your TV via HDMI cable (not connected through a receiver). Once you've done that, let us know if the sound is still distorted.</strong><br /><br />We'll be standing by to hear back from you! ^_^</p>

<p>I'm not sure I understand what you're asking. &nbsp;As I stated in the post, my TV is connected via the HDMI cable.</p>
<p>Stereo works fine through the tv or the receiver. &nbsp;Apparently my $2500 Panasonic TV can only accommodate stereo. &nbsp;When I select DTS, or anything other than stereo, Xbox tells me that the TV can't handle it.</p>

<h2>            Cleaning&#47;tidying up Computer Problems</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 and lately have a number of little problems. Screen freezes, mouse pointer sticks, some slowness with some applications. Is there any tool or cleanup I can do to improve operation. Thanks Jeff

<h3> shady nero  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft LifeCam Studio</h2>
                    I have a Microsoft LifeCam Studio. I also use Windows 10. I am trying to use the camera to stream to twitch. It keeps freezing. it used to only freeze like after an hour or so and i would just let it sit for a few minutes and plug it in and it would be
 okay. but it gradually gets worse. now when i turn it on, it will freeze almost instantly. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the device but it does the same thing. If its a computer thing, I'd love to know what i should be looking at to verify thats the case.
 Is it just that the camera is just pretty old now, and I should upgrade?&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me know! thanks!

<h2>            Security Update for Silverlight &#40;KB4017094&#41; failing to install</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I am having a big problem trying to install the&nbsp;Silverlight (KB4017094) Security Update. Every time I reboot start my PC the security patch downloads and tries to install and this has been going on for a very long time</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34af1e56-0cd6-469c-bfac-ad51cca12845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34af1e56-0cd6-469c-bfac-ad51cca12845" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to install it manually by downloading these 4 files</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9a045b4-7e54-402a-98ac-1f7e03f52ac3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9a045b4-7e54-402a-98ac-1f7e03f52ac3" /></a></p>
<p>When trying to install the first two I get this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c52ae380-3afc-4ea5-90c1-d03cf97703da" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c52ae380-3afc-4ea5-90c1-d03cf97703da" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>...and when I try to install the other two (Silverlight_x64.exe and Silverlight_Developer.exe) I get:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73060549-1e2a-402c-922e-379a79f8d75a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73060549-1e2a-402c-922e-379a79f8d75a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I obviously do not have any "Microsoft Silverlight" CD-ROM or "Floppy disc" for that matter ha, ha.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being that is a security risk I would like to have it fixed soonest possible :-)</p>

<p>I've done this LASO twice now... the first time took 2 hours &amp; 15 minutes and I only accounted for 5 of the 82 deaths...

LASO 1</a></p>
<p>The Second run was much faster at a mere 56 minutes and 11 Deaths for the party (I was 3 of them)...

<p>I can upload the videos if anyone wants to see them...</p>
<p>They are rather pointless overall... but you may find some useful tips and hints mixed in to assist you in doing this challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest tips I can give you though... are to take your time, using cover, to snipe with the DMR (sometimes going as slow as only one shot per second)... and
<i><b>DON'T</b></i> be <i>anywhere</i> near the door to Dr. Halsey's Lab if you can help it... hijack a Banshee or a Wraith and kill from LONG range (it takes a bit of time... but well worth the time spent if you aren't restarting every couple of minutes).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else have useful tips and hints for this challenge?&nbsp; I may do it a couple more times this week to see if I can get through without dying at all.</p>

<h2>            telephone calls purportedly from Microsoft</h2>
                    I keep getting telephone calls from an international source claiming to be Microsoft, telling me that my pc is at risk from viruses even though my own security (BTnetprotectplus) assure me I am safe. The caller, usually sounding Asian wants me to press
 the windows button and R key then type in something like eventvrw but I think it is some sort of scan - can anyone advise me please?&nbsp;

<h3> fabioreismendes  say:</h3>
<h2>            banimento da conta</h2>
                    
<p>Fui surpreendido com o banimento de meu console xbox one na data de hj,sem razão alguma (0x8015dc03)Nome do login: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** do console: 006041334611. product id. 06390312003041334611.trata-se de situação propagada sem nenhuma razão , pois
 possuo mídia física e por razão de conveniência, alguns jogos mídia digital adquiridos. Não infringi nenhuma norma e possuo mais de 13 meses do xbox live pagos, estando sendo apenado sem justa razão, com prejuízo diário pelo valor pago no cartão para acesso
 ao xbox live. Inexistiu qualquer advertência , posto que no Brasil, local da fabricação do console , necessário informar ao consumidor as razões, bem como em caso de penalidade, que seja estabelecido um critério e não uma pena de extremo alcance. Totalmente
 desarrazoado.<br />
Se não estabelecer a retomada do serviço, bem como, pelo interesse das partes, a razão, não se pode aferir sua validade. Se eventualmente incorrido alguma infração, dever-se-ia encaminhar uma advertência, visando modificar o fato e não banir o console, repisa,
 com mais de 10 meses ainda na garantia.<br />
Em caso de não solução, certamente irei ingressar com ação própria , inclusive pelos danos decorrente de ato de tamanha expressão.<br />
Contudo, sei da primazia da Microsoft no interesse do cliente,razão pela qual tenho certeza da correção do ato falho</p>

<p>Boa tarde, senhor Fabio Reis Mendes. </p>
<p>Poderia informar de forma criteriosa, exatidão e detalhada a forma, método ou meio ao qual foram adquiridos seus respectivos jogos digitais?</p>
<p>De antemão lhe trago à ciência de que tais atos de banimento e suspensão de contas e consoles são extremamente analisados com cautela e de forma imparcial no que diz respeito a usuários Gold ou não, sendo assim, não é levado em conta os valores em assinaturas
 ou jogos empregados, mas sim no infringimento de políticas de uso ou comportamento dos aparelhos Microsoft e suas dependências virtuais.

<p>Boa tarde. sim, posso esclarecer. &nbsp;Possuo jogos meio físico e alguns jogos mídia digital. Em sua maioria adquiridos na própria live e outros adquiridos com a prerrogativa da conta compartilhada, o qual repasso a metade do valor comprado a um colega. Como
 colocado, nunca obtive problemas, senão nesta data informada. O que me surpreende ainda mais é a forma pela qual o console foi banido, porquanto poderia, acaso qquer problema existente, ser a conta suspensa ou outra forma. Não adquiro nada de má-fé e sempre
 pauto na compra da mídia física para eventual revenda ou, de maneira mais cautelosa e extraordinariamente, pela forma de conta (2) compartilhadas com pessoa de minha confiança.
</p>
<p>Assim é a razão da solicitação da reanálise do caso, até para obter informações, porque se eventualmente ocorreu algum problema, certamente não realizarei a compra da midia ou jogo nos lugares onde foram realziados.</p>
<p>agradeço a atenção</p>

<p>Bom dia, Senhor Fabio Reis Mendes. Recentemente a Microsoft realizou banimentos de consoles que possuíam diversas contas compartilhadas com itens e jogos comprados por meio de clonagem de cartões ou roubo dos mesmos, em sua grande maioria através do Mercado
 Livre. Vale ressaltar que o compartilhamento de contas é permitido até certo ponto, porém se algum dos usuários envolvidos nessas contas possuir jogos comprados de contas compartilhadas que estejam em verificação, todos os consoles vinculados com esses produtos
 e contas sofrerão a ação necessária para regularização e cumprimento das políticas da Microsoft e Xbox Live.
</p>
<p>Não há como eu lhe informar que o seu caso se enquadra nesta prática, porém aconselho-o a entrar em contato com uma equipe especializada em verificações de consoles e contas banidas através deste link:
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4276.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../4276.aspx</a> </p>
<p>Eles analisarão sua situação e lhe darão um parecer definitivo sobre seu caso.</p>

<p>ola, moderador. </p>
<p>obrigado pela gentileza, todavia, já encaminhei, por dois dias seguidos, a situação ocorrida neste link (mesmo sendo em inglês), sem nenhuma resposta. Realmente, não sei como lidar com a situação, trata-se de uma tremenda falta de preparo com o cliente de
 um console fabricado no Brasil. sinto-me totalmente incapacitado de saber as razões e ver meu problema resolvido, embora com relação a vc, agradeço e sei das limitações. E mesmo se a situação relatada por você eventualmente ocorresse, como observei em fóruns
 da xbox, bastava a suspensão da conta e não do console. Se puder, gostaria apenas de ser informado se tal situação é permanente. Se afirmativo, procederei com as garantias a mim conferidas. muito obrigado</p>

<p>Bom dia.</p>
<p>Historicamente, os banimentos de consoles são irreversíveis, porém não há como negar a existência de casos em que os mesmos foram analisados novamente e o processo revertido à condição anterior do mesmo. São casos raros, porém não impossíveis de se repetirem.</p>
<p>O prazo de verificação com a equipe de fiscalização realmente não possui um prazo expresso para obter retorno, haja visto a quantidade massiva de solicitações de uma segunda análise por parte dos usuários, afim de comprovar, quase sempre ineficaz, a falha
 nas ações tomadas pela equipe fiscal. Porém, é salutar dizer que o senhor possui plena liberdade de recorrer aos seus direitos através dos meios que julgar necessários e que estejam cabíveis judicialmente.</p>
<p>Espero que seu caso obtenha um retorno justo. Até breve.</p>

<p>Olá boa tarde,sou novo aqui e não sei se estou perguntando no lugar correto desde de já peço desculpas,porém tenho uma dúvida,comprei o console Xbox One de meu primo,ele comprou contas no Mercado livre,porém li que posso ser banido por contas de terceiros
 e como esses jogos ele comprou barato estou com receio de ser conta comprada com cartão clonado ou roubado,minha dúvida é:se eu excluir essas contas eu não corro mais risco de banimento?desde já obrigado!!

    <title>Windows 10&#58; HTML shortcut Details &#38; Notes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaspencer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; HTML shortcut Details &#38; Notes</h2>
                    <p>Following the update to Windows 10, I have been trying to add Details &amp; Notes to the Properties Fields of some HTML Shortcuts on the desktop. However when I try to do that, the process fails silently.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the Apply button remains greyed-out, whilst sometimes it remains apparently active, but when clicked, no action is taken. The Close button also has no effect once an attempt has been made to create text in the two offending edit boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By way of background:</p>
<p>- the shortcuts are on the desktop, but moving them elsewhere has no effect;</p>
<p>- I am the owner of the files;</p>
<p>- I have tried performing the changes to the shortcuts as Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advice will be gratefully received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kenneth Spencer</p>

            <p>Thankyou, Robert ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, they are URL files. But I have none with the Description/Notes fields filled in, and if I attempt to add details to any of the shortcuts/favourites, I am prohibited by security from completing the save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have opened the files in Notepad, but there is no indication of a "Description" nor a "Notes" field.
</p>
<p>I tried adding such details by beginning a new line with the field label+"=" and added text but any added information is not saved, although no error is issued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a security problem associated with a Windows 10 upgrade? Assistance and resolution is my hope!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks you,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Running SFC resulted in a few reported corruptions, but they were all resolved after a reboot. But the refusal to accept and save edits of a URL shortcut on the Desktop remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue still occurs with a new user, and with the Administrator user.</p>

    <title>Internal Microphone missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 2bxi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internal Microphone missing</h2>
                    <p>My mic has been missing for months. It didn't occur to me until someone asked if it was because of an update. My computer doesn't think it has a microphone anymore and doesn't detect any audio input on any app or site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 and I have looked at different and similar questions and used their methods to try to fix this but nothing has worked. Most deal with an external microphone but even the ones dealing with an internal microphone do not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran trouble shooter on Recording Audio, Hardware and devices, and Playing Audio. One of which told me to restart my computer and the others said nothing was wrong but to get rid of the sound effects I had [I had none].</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And Yes I hit right click to look at disabled and disconnected devices but none acknowledge that there is an internal microphone. It's not a disabled microphone and even when I plug in my headphones [the basic white ones used for ipods] and try to use their
 mic, it still doesn't recognize any audio input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've had this computer for over a year and for the first half of owning it, the microphone worked fine and using my headphones to talk was also fine.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Fax and Scan</h2>
                    <p>My OS is Windows 10.&nbsp; I've been using Windows Fax and Scan for some time now with no issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently when I now select NEW SCAN, I immediately get an error message displayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No scanners were detected.&nbsp; If a scanner is installed, make sure that it is powered on and connected to the computer and then try again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, nothing has changed.&nbsp; Same printer/scanner.&nbsp; No updates have been installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The printer still prints everything just fine.&nbsp; But I cannot scan anything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? &nbsp; Thank you.</p>
