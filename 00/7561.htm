            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            This is not as simple as you might think.&nbsp; Firstly you must get out of a spreadsheet mindset.&nbsp; While a relational database table's datasheet has a superficial resemblance to a spreadsheet, that's where the resemblance ends.&nbsp; In a relational database a
 table is a set, and by definition a set has no intrinsic order, so concepts like 'above' or 'below' are meaningless.&nbsp; Tables do not have cells; they have values at column positions in rows.&nbsp; Data in a table is addressed solely by value, not by position.<br />
<br />
One value in relation to another value is dependent on a sort order, e.g. in a table of distinct daily transactions a row for a transaction with today's date would sort after one with yesterday's date if the data is sorted by date, but could sort before or
 after the same row if the data is sorted by the transaction amount.&nbsp; There is no intrinsic relative position of one row vis-à-vis the other.<br />
<br />
To do the sort of thing you are attempting requires that you identify the two values on which the percentage difference is to be computed on the basis of one being the value in the row with the latest date prior to the date in the other row.&nbsp; To do this in
 a query is not trivial. Perhaps I can illustrate it using a simple table of transactions in which each transaction date is distinct, but not necessary sequential:<br />
<br />
SELECT T1.TransactionDate,T1.TransactionAmount,<br />
(T1.TransactionAmount -<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT MAX(T2.TransactionAmount)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM Transactions AS T2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE T2.TransactionDate =<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT MAX(TransactionDate)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM Transactions AS T3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE T3.TransactionDate &lt; T1.TransactionDate)))/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT MAX(T2.TransactionAmount)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM Transactions AS T2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE T2.TransactionDate =<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT MAX(TransactionDate)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM Transactions AS T3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE T3.TransactionDate &lt; T1.TransactionDate))*100<br />
AS PercentIncrease<br />
FROM Transactions AS T1<br />
ORDER BY T1.TransactionDate;<br />
<br />
In this query the outer query returns the transactions ordered by date.&nbsp; The percentage difference between the value of one transaction and the next in date order is computed by using a subquery to return the amount where the transaction date is the date returned
 by a further nested subquery which returns the latest (MAX) date prior to the outer query's current date.&nbsp; The use of the MAX operator against the TransactionAmount in the first subquery is here used not to return the highest amount, but simply to force this
 subquery to return only one value, so any aggregation operator could in fact be used in this case.<br />
<br />
The percentage difference is computed by subtracting the earlier amount returned by the subquery from the current amount, dividing the result by the earlier amount returned by the subquery (which is why he subqueries are repeated) and multiplying by 100 to
 return the value as a percentage.<br />
<br />
While this can be done in a query as above, there is a far simpler solution, which is to compute the percentage difference in a report.&nbsp; The report would be a simple one of transactions ordered by date, and in the Format event procedure of the detail section
 the percentage would be computed on the basis of the current transaction amount and the value of a module level variable which stores the previous transaction amount.&nbsp; The result of the computation would be assigned to an unbound text box control in the detailed
 section, and the value of the variable would then be set to the current transaction amount ready for it to be used in the next row of the report.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Once you've created and tested a suitable query you simply have to create a report with the query as its RecordSource property.&nbsp; The report wizard can be used to do this.<br />
<br />
If you want to do the computation in the report rather than a query then you'd firstly declare a variable in the report's module's Declarations area:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim PreviousMaxOfGrade As Currency<br />
<br />
Then in the Format event procedure of the detail section you first assign a value to an unbound text box,&nbsp; txtPercentIncrease say, with code like this, leaving the control in the report's first row as Null by examining the value of the PreviousMaxOfGrade variable
 for a non-zero value, and then assign the current value of the Max of Grade column to the variable ready for the computation in the next row:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If PreviousMaxOfGrade &lt;&gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.txtPercentIncrease = (Me.[Max of Grade] - PreviousMaxOfGrade)/PreviousMaxOfGrade<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PreviousMaxOfGrade = Me.[Max of Grade]<br />
<br />
Format the txtPercentIncrease control as Percent to show the fractional value as a percentage.<br />
<br />
Doing the computation in the report is not only simpler, but has the advantage that the dates of the rows need not be distinct.&nbsp; It's unlikely with salary increments of course that you'd have two rows with the same date, but with other types of transactions
 this might be the case.<br />
<br />
The report can then be a simple one based on a query which merely returns the rows from the table with no need for the complexities of the subqueries needed if the computation is done in the query.&nbsp; If the report is grouped by employee say, then re-initialise
 the variable to zero in the Format event procedure of the employee group header with:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PreviousMaxOfGrade = 0<br />

            <p>I have to disagree Ken.&nbsp; There is no foolproof way to use VBA code in the Format or Print events to keep track of a value in the "previous" record.&nbsp; Reports do not maintain a sequence of format events as several things (e.g. section and group KeepTogether)&nbsp;can
 cause format events to&nbsp;be processed more than once and in a semi arbitrary order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the needed calculation can not be done using text box expressions and RunningSums, then stick with doing the calculation in the record source query.</p>

            You are absolutely right of course, Marshall.&nbsp; I'd lost sight of the fact that the variable would need to be incremented only in the last incidence of the event.&nbsp; The RunningSum property doesn't help in this context, though, as this is not a case of aggregation.&nbsp;
 It's necessary to know the previous row's value as the expression to return a percentage increase is (y-x)/y*100 where y is the previous value and x the later value.<br />
<br />
The query I posted will work in the current context on the assumption that there can be no more than one transaction in one day.&nbsp; In the context of this post the subqueries would of course need to be correlated on the employee key if data for multiple employees
 is being returned.&nbsp; In cases where multiple transactions can occur in a single day, unless distinct date/time values per transaction are recorded (desirable but rarely done in my experience), a candidate key would need to be brought into play as a tie breaker.&nbsp;
 This is not difficult when computing balances by means of a join of two instances of a table, or even if calling the DSum function for an updatable query, but would make the query I posted even more complex.&nbsp; I think the simplest approach would be to firstly
 compute the row numbers per group by a join, by customer in the following example from one of my on-line demos:<br />
<br />
SELECT COUNT(*) AS RowNumber, T1.CustomerID, T1.TransactionDate, T1.TransactionAmount<br />
FROM Transactions AS T1 INNER JOIN Transactions AS T2 <br />
ON (T2.TransactionID&lt;=T1.TransactionID OR T2.TransactionDate&lt;&gt;T1.TransactionDate)
<br />
AND (T2.TransactionDate&lt;=T1.TransactionDate) AND (T2.CustomerID=T1.CustomerID)<br />
GROUP BY T1.CustomerID, T1.TransactionDate, T1.TransactionAmount, T1.TransactionID;
<br />
<br />
Save this as Q1 say, then create another query on it:<br />
<br />
SELECT Q1A.*,<br />
&nbsp;(Q1A.TransactionAmount-<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT TransactionAmount<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM Q1 AS Q1B<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE Q1B.CustomerID = Q1A.CustomerID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND Q1B.RowNumber = Q1A.RowNumber-1))/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT TransactionAmount<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM Q1 AS Q1B<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE Q1B.CustomerID = Q1A.CustomerID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND Q1B.RowNumber = Q1A.RowNumber-1)*100 As PercentIncrease<br />
FROM Q1 AS Q1A;<br />
<br />
Coming back to your original point, I see that Callahan recommends using the Print event procedure with a test for PrintCount=1 for this sort of thing.&nbsp; I know that the Format event can execute multiple times for the same incidence of a section, with a FormatCount
 property of 1 at each execution.&nbsp; Is the same true of the PrintCount property?&nbsp; Callahan's method seems to work when I try it, but maybe I've just been lucky.<br />

            James,&nbsp; hope you've noted Marshall's correction of my last reply.&nbsp; Things are rarely that simple unfortunately!<br />
<br />
See my reply to Marshal for an alternative two-query solution, which will handle a situation where there could be multiple transactions per day.&nbsp; It also groups by customer, which would be analogous to grouping by employee when dealing with salaries.<br />

If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
You can create the last two queries I posted in my file if you do download it.&nbsp; It will work fine, but as the amounts in my Transactions table are not always incrementing some of the percentages will be negative.&nbsp; The original query I posted can be created
 in the same file, but the results won't be correct as my table does include multiple transactions per day.<br />

    <title>Undoing &#34;update links on save&#34; for hyperlinks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h patel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Undoing &#34;update links on save&#34; for hyperlinks</h2>
                    <p>I have Word documents with a large number of relative hyperlinks. After installing the latest version of Office I found that the relative links had been converted to absolute links--I now know that this can be prevented by unchecking the "update links on
 save" box in "Word Options". </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know how to easily revert the updated hyperlinks back to relative hyperlinks--I know how to do this manually for each individual link but wonder if there is an option to change all the links back to relative hyperlinks?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Hitesh Patel</p>

<h2>            Surface Detach&#58; &#34;Please resolve before detaching&#34;</h2>
                    I have a Surface Book. If I click on the "Surface Detach" button in the notification area, it says that an application "may need to be closed on order to detach". Is there documentation anywhere that describes the reasons that an application may prevent
 detachment and what the desired application behavior is for a desktop application to be "detach friendly"?

            Have you checked with Surface support? as you haven't posted which build, which model of Surface you are using, as this is the forum for testing of newer builds of Windows 10 before being released to the Public, and isn't a general support site.

            Should have noted it's Insider Build 14379. As per my question, I'm not looking for support to help troubleshoot an issue - it is clearly intended behavior of the OS. I didn't notice this behavior on earlier builds so am trying to find documentation so
 that I can ensure that applications are (re)designed to behave correctly with it.

            As you are using a beta version things may change with each new build as for documentation I doubt that MS has posted any just for this version as posted by others the best place to ask this question would be on the Surface support site or in the Feedback
 Hub as I have searched for this question and found very little input by others, here is a link I did find that might help &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-surface-book-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>CLICK

<p>From your description, I suggest you try the following steps to check the outcome:</p>
<p>1)Clear your Mac defaulted web browser cache.</p>
<p>2)Quit all running desktop applications.</p>
<p>3)Restart your Mac and switch to another network and try signing in<span>&nbsp;
</span>your account to check the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Virgil,</p>
<p>no amount of tweaks was able to resolve the problem with mac version.</p>
<p>so i borrowed a PC and ran the importer app on the PC from evernote to onenote.</p>
<p>no luck. The import said it ran successfully and reported that it had both located and successfully imported all 24 notebooks and 206 notes, however...</p>
<p>when I open onenote to confirm, its only imported one notebook. The other 23 are missing.</p>
<p>i have run the process three times at this point. Each time it tells me its successfully imported all 24 notebooks and only 1 shows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what gives?</p>

<p>Hi Virgil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read the article you referenced and followed those directions. The other 23 notebooks are not available anywhere. It is only importing the very first notebook of the total 24, but not the other 23.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet, at the end of the importer process, when the importer app claims it is finished importing the 24 notebooks, I click the "View Notes in OneNOte" button, and it simply loads the first notebook.</p>
<p>I then follow the directions to browse for the other notebooks and they are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide an alternate path here. This importer is not working as expected on PC or Mac.</p>

</span><span>importing the 24 notebooks</span><span>. Given this situation, I suggest you ask

<p>Hi Virgil,</p>
<p>i checked onenote online. Same story as the client experience it only shows the one notebook that has now been imported 3 different times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would you suggest i talk to evernote support about why a microsoft product is not working as expected? They didn’t build this importer software. They didn’t tell the customer that it would import their evernote notes into onenote. Microsoft did. This
 importer product exists for the sole purpose of winning evernote customers over to onenote. Do you think I as an evernote customer am inspired to switch if this is your guidance as Onenote support?</p>
<p>As I see it, this is a microsoft bug to fix. I would suggest you file the bug with the engineering team responsible for onenote importer, and let your customers know how it is progressing. I’m almost certain they would appreciate being notified, especially
 since the onenote importer software is in preview.</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for letting you ask Evernote support for help. However, it shouldn't be a bug because I can importer notebooks from Evernote to OneNote.</p>
<p>Based on my test, I create 5 notebooks in Evernote application on Mac, then I used OneNote importer tool to import notebooks from Evernote to OneNote.</p>
<p>After the importer prompt successfully and I go to OneNote online, I can find all notebook from Evernote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Given that I installed Evernote application, so OneNote importer can
</span><span>automatically locate </span><span>my Evernote
</span><span>note</span><span>book</span><span>s</span><span> in OneNote Importer import list. Please check if you tick all notebooks under the import list.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I also suggest you try the following steps to check the outcome:</p>
<p>1)Exporting Evernote file(.enex) of your Evernote notebooks to local.</p>
<p>2)Open OneNote Importer and choose the file(.enex) to import to OneNote.</p>
<p>3)Please go to both OneNote application and OneNote online to check the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Virgil</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the record, I HAVE created a macro which I have titled "AutoExec" which I believe means that it runs when the Database opens. The problem I have is that this macro doesnt run. Is there a setting that I have missed out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I've tested for this, and I was able to load Visio 2003&nbsp;on my Windows 7 64-bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visio 2003, Version 11.8161.8172&nbsp;SP3</p>
<p>Windows 7 64-bit, Version 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you have the latest update installed.</p>
<p>And try to <strong>repair/reinstall</strong> your Visio 2003 from the installation source.</p>
<p>Before that you could also try to run Visio 2003&nbsp;in the <strong>compatibility mode</strong>. To do so, right click on the short cut for Visio 2003, choose compatibility tab, select the check box in front of
<strong>Run this program&nbsp;in compatibility mode</strong>, choose <strong>Winsows Vista(Service Pack 2)</strong></p>

<h2>            Band 2 Refunds after email regarding no app support</h2>
                    <p>I recieved the email regarding that me and my wife could no longer use the app after the end of May 2019. We have been in contact with microsoft regarding our claim for our refunds and they told us to wait 2 weeks for the email. We are now 5 weeks in and
 still have not heard anything at all from microsoft. They are quick enough to take your money but are verypoor in refunding this. All we are being told is that microsoft are still trying to work out when the refunds can be done and we need to wait for the
 email to arrive. My complaint has gone to the higher team, what ever this means as ithink i need to go to the team who is working in outer space to get some kind of responce. The service has been very poor and i am sure that if we owed microsoft money thay
 would have sent me an email by now. Sayno more would not reccomend this multimillion pound company for there customer service.</p>

            One way is to have events on the button and list box to run macro.&nbsp; Macro have conditions comparing list box content with report names to open report in Print.&nbsp; One action&nbsp;in the macro per report in the list box.

            A good way to to use a list/combo box for that is to create a table with the report name as the primary key and another column with a short description of the report.&nbsp; Then the list can display the description but have the bound column with the report
 name hidden.&nbsp; This way the list's Double click and the button's click event can just refer to the list's value in the OpenReport action/method's report name argument.&nbsp; If you prefer, as I do, to use VBA event procedures, the code would simply be like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenReport Me.thelistorcombobox, acViewPreview

<p>The following code in a form's Open event procedure will fill an unbound list box with a list of report descriptions, i.e the Description property of a report object as added via the database window.&nbsp; Reports with no description property are omitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Form_Open(Cancel As Integer)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error GoTo Err_Handler<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const NODESCRIPTION = 3270<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim dbs As DAO.Database<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctr As DAO.Container<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim doc As DAO.Document<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strReportname As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strDescription As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set dbs = CurrentDb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctr = dbs.Containers("Reports")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.lstReports<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each doc In ctr.Documents<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strReportname = doc.Name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error Resume Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strDescription = doc.Properties("Description")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Case Err.Number<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' no error<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case NODESCRIPTION<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' report has no description<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' so ignore and go to next report<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GoTo EndLoop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' unknown error<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GoTo Err_Handler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Err.Clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error GoTo Err_Handler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ctrl.AddItem strReportname &amp; ";" &amp; strDescription<br />
EndLoop:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next doc<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Exit_Here:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Err_Handler:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Err.Number, vbExclamation, "Error"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resume Exit_Here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Sub</p>
<p>As it stands the code lists all reports with descriptions, but you could, by using suitable naming conventions for reports, limit the list to particular reports, e.g. to list only reports whose names end with "_Sales":</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Right(strReportname,6) = "_Sales" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ctrl.AddItem strReportname &amp; ";" &amp; strDescription<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
The list box's RowSourceType property should be 'Value List' and its ColumnWidths 0cm;8cm or similar to hide the first column.&nbsp; This is the report name, so the selected report can be opened with a button on the form with:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(Me.lstReports) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenReport Me.lstReports, acViewPreview<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />

                    <p>I have entered into one of the Xbox One S sweepstakes on Microsoft's Rewards program. I noticed that you can also enter via mail. I would like to know more about how that works and if I can enter with both points and mail.</p>
<p>Here are the rules for the sweepstakes. https://microsoftrewards.icgrouplp.com/sweeps/2/rules</p>

                    <p>Hi this is urgent&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am recording interviews on skype to later transcribe them. After recording on skype i save the file to my desktop. It turns out that 2 of these haven't saved properly.....on my desktop the time duration for the calls reads the full time, however when you
 play them it freezes at around 1 minute. The dial at bottom reads as still playing but the image and audio is frozen. Unfortunately a month has passed and i cannot go back to the chat...please help me</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like there has been some error saving the file or something and that it is corrupt. Does anyone know how to get through to the team at skype? There must be a copy somewhere, everything is reversible!!! I would pay money. Please help me&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If you have access to a desktop computer (Mac or Windows) running Skype, try signing into your account there to see if it is synced. 
<br />
<br />If not...
<br />
<br />Sign into Skype for web to see if it might be there.

                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I have not had access to my hotmail for months since upgrading to the outlook.com preview. I suspect this is because I signed up to an O365 trial using my live ID. Whenever I go to outlook.com I get the following error message:</p>

<p>You can't login to office 365 with a live ID:</p>

<p>I want to login to outlook.com as a personal user using my live ID. My live ID does not work because somehow it is still associated to an old office 365 trial. All I want is these associations removed and I really don't understand why this is so hard. Months
 later I am still without access to my mail and there is no way to get any help from Microsoft.</p>

            Hi  Arjanvan
<br />
<br />That cannot be done automatically in the new Skype App . .. 
<br />
<br />Here is a workaround, that should work for you
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer, in the address bar, paste this and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />shell:startup
<br />
<br />Find the new Skype App in the alphabetical list of apps on your Start Menu
<br />
<br />Right click that, and choose 'Pint to Start'
<br />
<br />Then drag the new Skype tile from your Start Menu into that folder in Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Then delete the new Tile on your Start Menu if you wish . .

                    <p>If I was to do a 1 time purchase of Office Home &amp; Student 2013 or 2014 if it happens to be released will I be able to use the key multiple time?</p>
<p>I get new computers some what often 1 and half year to 2 years and i would not like to pay 130~ dollar each time extra for Office so if i was to uninstall or remove the old copy of Office on the old computer and install it on the new computer with the same
 product key will that be possible?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>several possible reasons and solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The formula starts with a space character before the = sign &nbsp;-- remove the space</li><li>The spreadsheet shows formulas instead of values -- use Ctrl -` (that is the key to the left of the 1 on a US keyboard) to toggle between formulas and values</li><li>The cell is formatted as text -- format the cell as General, then edit the cell and hit enter again. Just changing the format will not recalculate the formula.</li></ul>

<h2>            HOW CAN I REPAIR THE SLOW RESPONCE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE WHEN WRITING AND BACKSPACING  IN WORD TABLES OF OFFICE 2013&#63;</h2>
                    Hi everyone, I made some tables in Microsoft Word 2013 to write some census data and I have a slow response problem when writing and backspacing. It is time consuming because I have to wait some seconds to see the display of words and the same occurs when
 eraising a word with backspace. I uninstalled and reinstalled Microsoft Office Professional Plus and activate but the issue was not resolved. I own a new Gateway notebook with 64bits Windows 8 operational system.&nbsp;

            Addins is a good place to start.&nbsp; If that does not help, take a look at the new 2013 "Animation" feature. Although I didn't find it as annoying as you did in Word, in Excel animation alone was enough to convince me to dump 2013:<br />
<br />
<div><b><span>Slow Excel 2013 - Rubber band effect, delayed Response time when typing – Disable Animation feature</span></b>
<p>In Office 2013 MS added a funky new UI feature called “Animation”. It is supposed to “smooth out”, or some such nonsense, cursor movement in the applications. I first noticed it in Excel 2013. I found it so annoying that that “feature” alone was enough to
 completely turn me off from using the whole Office 2013 bundle. Fortunately, or not (?), I found these fixes.</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; Hi, I have exactly the same problem, Excel2013.</p>
<p>Just opened a new spread sheet, typed the nr 1 in cell A1 to A22, took me about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Took excel 55 seconds to display, looks like slow motion.&nbsp; &lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article in the first link has a link to another article with a downloadable file that will make the change without you having to edit the registry manually</p>
<p><b>**********</b></p>
<p>There's an easier fix for the "rubber band" animations in Excel - just turn them off in File menu &gt; Options command &gt; Advanced option &gt; Display section &gt; turn on “Disable hardware graphics acceleration”</p>
<p><b>*********** Registry Hacks *********</b></p>
<p><a href="http://winsupersite.com/article/office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winsupersite.com/article/office</a>-2013-beta2/office-2013-tip-disable-animations-143779</p><span><b><span>

 - Reg hack</b>
<div>
<p>Note, you may have to also add the “Graphics” key. </p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Graphics]<br />
"DisableAnimations"=dword:00000001</p>
<p>To see the effect of disabling Office 2013 animation, you’ll need to reboot your computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reverse the effect, change the value of the added DWORD to its default of <i>
0</i>.</p>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************</p>
<p>Alternate, related solution</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 8, and found a different solution there: </p>
<p>To disable Windows animations (this is secondary IMHO, but may be required):</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the metro start screen type Edit, </p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>&lt;tab&gt;, &lt;down Arrow&gt; to then move the search results down 1 to "Settings"</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>"Edit system environment variables" is the first thing in second column on my search results, yours may vary
</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>double click on it</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>provide the admin password to display the "System Properties" dialog</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the "Advanced" tab, Performance section, click on the "Settings..." button to display the "Performance Options" dialog</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Personally, I prefer to select the "Adjust for Best Performance" option to get rid of the frilly "bells &amp; whistles" that do not contribute to efficiency of my system.</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At a minimum, confirm that the "Animate controls and elements inside Windows" option is disabled/unchecked.
</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Click on Apply</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>OK out</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>boot the computer</p>
<p>*************</p>
<p>Under options &gt; advanced &gt; turn off<span>&nbsp; </span>“allow editing directly in cells”</p>
<p>**************</p>
<p>Here is another idea worth looking at :&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>I have had this problem also when authoring user guides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually I found that if I switched off the "Maintain compatibility" check box in the Save As dialog the problem disappeared.</p>
<p>Word may be scanning each element to make sure it maintains compatibility.</p>

            The problem was resolved for me by making sure that I was connected to SkyDrive when working with a file that I downloaded from SkyDrive. &nbsp;As soon as I reconnect, Word and Excel are instantly faster. &nbsp;Every so often when I open a file from SkyDrive I get
 a message stating I'm not connect (don't know why that happens), just reconnect/re-sync and you should be fine.&nbsp;

    <title>How to make the tab text bigger and How ti hide sites permanently. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to make the tab text bigger and How ti hide sites permanently.</h2>
                    <p><strong><u>Original title: Tabs</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When I check&nbsp;"show tabs on a separate row", the tabs go below the address bar but&nbsp;they become smaller. Can IE preserve the size of the tabs?</p>
<p>2. On the new tabs page, how do I permanently hide sites rather than clicking "hide sites" everytime?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>It is by design, if you select show tabs in separate row, then the size of the tabs will become small. This is to avoid wastage of the Internet
 Exporer screen. </span></p>
<p><span>Each time when you open Internet Explore, you might open different websites in different tabs. So it has to be selected each time you want it
 to be.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps to open blank page when you open a new tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Tools menu and select Internet options.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select General tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Settings option next to Tab option.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select dropdown arrow next to “ew tab is open”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Selct “A blank page”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click OK and Ok again.</span></p>

            <p>According to the below announcement from 20th July, w<span>hile support will no longer be available from October 2016, the Skype app on Windows Phone 8 and Windows Phone 8.1 will continue to work (possibly with some limitations)
 until early 2017, when they finish moving Skype calling to the cloud. Most probably the Skype app has already been removed from the store for WP8.1 devices.</span></p>

</p><p>Basically Skype soon will stop working on WP8 devices and is no longer available to install from the store.</p>
