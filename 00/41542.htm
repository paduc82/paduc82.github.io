    <title>Generic Postscript Driver - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Generic Postscript Driver</h2>
                    We have an OKI printer that is not a postscript printer.&nbsp; It does not print reduced scale prints (IE - A1size drawings printed on A3 paper have half the lines missing). We have been told that we need to install a generic postscript driver for Windows 7
 (64 bit).&nbsp; I am after some advice on what driver to install and how to install it so that it works with our OKI printer.<br />

            Thank you Babu,<br />
<br />
Yes, I have already ascertained through Oki that there is no Postscript driver available for the printer, which is why I was looking for a generic driver.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I share an office with someone who has an Apple computer, the reduced size prints print perfectly from his computer, and I have been advised that it is because Apples built-in driver is postscript, whereas Windows is not.<br />
<br />
I found and installed a generic driver, however the printer would not work with it.&nbsp; Do I just need to keep trying different drivers or is there something else I can try?<br />

&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for the reply.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I understand that you have issues with the Generic Post Script driver for&nbsp;OKI printer.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Do you get any error message while printing fromt he OKI printer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try&nbsp;manually install the printer drivers from Add Printer options and if Postscript drivers are not available, install Generic Microsoft PS Class driver. Follow the steps mentioned below to fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Determine the type of printer you have. If you've misplaced your printer's manual, you can locate the make and model of your printer by looking on the printer itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Know what operating system you're running on your computer. To find your operating system, go to "<strong>My Computer</strong>," then
<strong>"View System Information."</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>3)Locate your printer manufacturer's website by searching for the name of your printer in a search engine. Adding the word "driver" to your search can aid in finding the specific page with one search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Download your printer's driver and install your printer. To do this, after the driver has downloaded, plug in your printer and through your computer's
<strong>"Control Panel,"</strong> go into <strong>"Hardware and&nbsp;Printers".</strong> Go to
<strong>"Add printer".</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Now select the printer and then, install the printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) Once the printer is added, Print a test page to make sure your printer is working. In<strong> "Printers and Other Hardware,"</strong> view your installed printers and<strong> "Right Click"</strong> on the printer you're interested in. Go to<strong> "Properties"</strong>
 to find <strong>"Print Test Page."</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Also refer to:</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks Shalini,<br />
Firstly, no, there are no error messages when printing to the Oki.&nbsp; It prints completely fine for everything, except when I am printing an A1 size PDF, reduced to fit A3 paper, then it doesn't print lines etc.&nbsp; If I print the same reduced size drawing from
 my colleague's Apple computer it prints perfectly.&nbsp; I have been told that this is because Apples have a generic postscript driver "built in" whereas PC's don't.<br />
<br />
Also, there are no postscript drivers available for the printer as it is not a postscript printer, which is why I was asking about a generic driver that I could use in place of Oki's standard driver.&nbsp; I have tried replacing the Oki's driver with a generic PS
 driver, however the printer just doesn't work when I do this.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if&nbsp; it may not be the actual printer driver that I need to change but some other setting/driver that allows my computer to communicate to the printer in postscript??<br />

            <p>According to the specifications for the OKI C810, it is not a PostScript printer. This agrees with the statement you make in your original post, "We have an OKI printer that is not a postscript printer." Therefore, a PostScript driver would not be useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming 64 bit Windows 7 as your operating system, the&nbsp;driver available here:<br />

<p>Try setting the printer to its highest resolution if it is not already using that setting. This might lessen the problem with drop-outs.</p>

<h2>            Logitech g920 Wheel Stopped Working</h2>
                    After putting USB into the xbox it calibrates perfectly and the light stays on so it is connected, however. The buttons on the wheel have changed or something because only the xbox home button works, a does something but don't know what. Every other button
 doesn't work. I was pressing random buttons on it and it somehow turned the narrator on. My xbox control works perfectly. Does anyone know why this has happened? It was working perfectly normal the other day and was playing a game until it just stopped doing
 nothing.&nbsp;

            I recently set up my Logitech wheel after nearly a year off and was disappointed to learn of this issue. &nbsp;While it is not ideal, i have found that the wheel connects every time if I unplug &amp; then plug in the power from to The Xbox. &nbsp;

            Whenever I get these types of issues I usually unplug the usb from the wheel perform a full restart of my xbox then plug the wheel back in. This usually works. I have also realized that if you connect the wheel while a controller is on and connected it
 also causes issues so I turn the controller off first.

<h2>            Problem with Screen Cursor &#40;and keyboard&#41; Surface Pro 4, Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>My cursor starts to flash and is difficult to use when it is flashing. It appears it has something to do with a transparent Semi Circle that appears in the upper part and slightly above the right end of the taskbar. If, using my finger, I touch the screen
 within the semi circle, I can drag a solid cursor onto the screen to use. However, it usually starts flashing again and I have to do it again. Sometimes, a short white vertical line appears about 3/4 up the screen from the bottom, also on the right edge of
 the screen, and I have to pull the cursor from that location instead of the semi circle on the bottom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started immediately after I had a cracked screen repaired. I took it back to the repair person, and was told "It was nothing I've done", I can't help you and I cannot give you your money ($220) back. I suspect it was her fault, but I do not know what
 to do in this situation. Also my keyboard stopped working a couple of days after the repair. I'm am now using a Bluetooth keyboard to type this out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh, I was aware of that, and I'm sure i'm out of the repair money. But my question is ... What can I do to work around this irritant? I wish to continue using the Surface and there must be something I can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried resetting the surface. That did not work, so I tried something that Microsoft warned against, but I thought it might help ... that is I stopped encryption on the Hard Drive,&nbsp; went into the BIOS, turned off "Safe Boot", placed a USB Boot
 drive with Windows 10 Pro on it, along with a Keyboard and a mouse attached to USB Hub into the USB slot, and booted to first wipe the drive completely and then to install Windows 10 Pro. I then went to Surface Support and installed the necessary drivers for
 the Surface. All went OK, but that darn cursor problem continues.&nbsp;</p>

<div>I'm sorry, there is nothing we can suggest to work around the damaged caused</div>
<div>when the vendor replaced your screen. We don't know what damage was caused by</div>
<div>this repair, but it is hardware related and not software. If the vendor does not</div>
<div>guarantee their work, perhaps the credit card company you used to pay for this</div>
<div>will assist in getting a refund for the work they performed. </div>

<h2>            Xbox live not loading properly in Black Ops</h2>
                    
<p>I have been having this issue since the last xbox live update. In COD: Black Ops, after the teams are split and we leave the game lobby to the loading screen it never loads the map and I get stuck on the loading screen with the wheel spinning at the bottom
 and my only option is to exit to the dashboard and restart the game. Any clue as to what may be the problem?</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Shaunna,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you not able to exit from Aptio Setup Utility?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the methods below and check if that helps:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span><span>Try to boot into <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> and perform the Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p>Press and hold the <strong>shift key </strong>while clicking on <strong>Restart
</strong>at the login Screen (Bottom right corner).</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Select <strong>T</strong></span><strong><span><span>roubleshoot </span>
</span></strong><span><span>and click on </span></span><strong><span><span>Advanced Options</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Select </span></span><strong><span><span>Startup Settings </span>
</span></strong><span><span>and click on </span></span><strong><span><span>Restart</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>After restarting, choose </span></span><strong><span><span>Enable Safe mode</span></span><span><span>with networking</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<span><span>
<p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a Clean Boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</p>
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method&nbsp;2:</strong></p>
</span></span></span>
<p>Put the computer in Clean Boot and check if it helps. By setting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

            Hello Lawrence, my name is Alexander. I'm an Independent Advisor and I'm happy to assist you! 
<br />
<br />It is a background music built in Jigsaw. But you can google to find the music album of this game.

            <p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Store, Edge and Cortana bug&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carnageg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Store, Edge and Cortana bug&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have recently just upgraded to Windows 10 from a Windows 8.1 build (and did not do a clean install) and I have recently been experiencing some bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I am unable to download any apps from the Windows App Store. I have tried many different apps but I always get error 0x80070002. This only seems to occur when I use my Microsoft Account and link it to my PC. When I tried downloading apps using my
 Microsoft account for the store but a local account for the PC, they installed perfectly fine. I am using a third-party firewall, McAfee Security Center which I have disabled temporarily but the issue still occurs. I have tried several solutions on the Internet
 such as using WSReset.exe, deleting Download and DataStore in SoftwareDistribution in the Windows folder, using Windows FixIt (which detected a service registration error and claimed to have fixed it, although whenever I run it again this same error pops up
 with it saying it fixed it again.) and even reregistering the program (which didn't work either).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issue I am having is that when I was using sfc.exe /scannow in the Adminstrator Command Prompt to check for problems, it detected a problem of some sort of image in Microsoft Edge. I have used this command before on my previous operating system
 and it didn't detect anything. It also said that it failed to repair it and I have the log which is attached. I, personally, don't notice any problem with Microsoft Edge but apparently there is one according to the system file check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried repairing both of the issues above by using dism.exe but it didn't go far as when I attempted to checkhealth with it, it said it had detected repairable issues and upon using the restorehealth command, it kept saying it couldn't find any sources.
 I then downloaded the Windows 10 installer and made an .iso out of it using the Installer and linked the WIM Source to the install.wim located in there but it still said it could not find any sources. (I repeated this multiple times) I also tried the ESD Source
 with my x64install.esd located in my $Windows~WS installation folder but it still had the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I did try to use sfc.exe /scannow in Safe Mode as well and it was unable to fix the error although it found one. DISM.exe checkhealth didn't work either, giving the same error (I didn't specify the source that time though)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, this isn't really an issue but I heard you could type to Cortana instead of using your microphone. I've attempted this and all I got wwas bing search results for whatever I asked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would greatly appreciate if someone helped me with at least one of my problems, preferably the first one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi! Thanks for the quick reply! If I'm not wrong, I only have had this PC connected to my current Windows Live account and I am using a wireless network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already verified my account twice (as I switched to local and back to Windows Live in an attempt to resolve the issue) and it is currently verified. Something that might be important: When I first upgraded to Windows 10, I signed into my Windows Live
 account to access Cortana but decided to go back to my local account however it was stuck at preparing my local account so I clicked cancel but I was already signed in locally and everything seemed fine. The next few times (as stated above), I was able to
 switch between accounts easily.</p>

            <p><span>This issue may occur if there are duplicate accounts on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please try the following suggestions and see if the issue can be resolved:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Backup registry key</span></p>
<p><span>==============</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, click Run, input "REGEDIT" (without quotation marks) in the Search box and press Enter.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Navigate to the following registry key by expanding the "+" beside the registry tree in the left pane:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows NT/CurrentVersion/ProfileList</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>3. Right click on "ProfileList", click "Export"; please name the file as "RegBackup" (without quotation marks) and then save it to the C:\ drive as a backup.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Note: In case we need to undo the modification, we can double click this RegBackup.reg file to restore the registry key.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Delete the duplicate account
</span></p>
<p><span>===============</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click the Start button, type
</span><span>â€œ</span><span>regedit</span><span>â€</span><span>
 (without quotation marks) in the Search box and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Navigate to the following registry key by expanding the "+" beside the registry tree in the left pane:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows NT/CurrentVersion/ProfileList</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>3. Delete the duplicate profile list keys there.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Exit the registry editor and reboot the computer to check the results.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please check if the issue can be resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>Thank you for taking your time to help me.&nbsp; Since posting my question I have chatted with Microsoft help. As it turns out they told me it could be a bad usb port. After unplugging one the sound has stopped, so I plugged it in to another port. Thanks again
 for your time.</p>

    <title>How do I uninstall Family Safety completely&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katiebug1297  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I uninstall Family Safety completely&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have tried everything to uninstall this stupid program. My mom felt most comfortable with&nbsp;it on before, but she has since loosened up since I'm older now. She removed me from the family settings list, deactivated the settings, made me the administrator
 on the computer as an adult,&nbsp;and deleted her account YET IT IS STILL THERE. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enter the family safety screen, it just asks if I want to add a child or add another adult. Every time my computer turns on, family safety greets me and family safety monitor is always running in the background (I check via task manager) even though
 I'm not even identified in family safety anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I WANT THIS PROGRAM OFF OF MY COMPUTER. It is EXTREMELY annoying because&nbsp;I can't download most apps. We have tried to delete this program countless times, it is invasive and irritating. Does anyone else have this problem or have any advice? Thank you.</p>

    <title>No automatic screen rotation on Inspiron 7000 2-in-1 following Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craigg58  say:</h3>
<h2>            No automatic screen rotation on  Inspiron 7000 2-in-1 following Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have an Inspiron 7000 2-in-1 that I just upgraded to Windows 10. Following the upgrade, automatic screen rotation stopped working, and I could not enable it since the button in the notifications area to do so was grayed out. I also found the checkbox to
 enable it in the display settings dialog, but after enabling that the screen still refused to auto-rotate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this function was working fine under Windows 8.1, so I know it can't be a hardware problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went into Device Manager and removed the two sensor devices, figuring that Windows would detect them and re-install the drivers for them once I rebooted. Unfortunately it didn't, and the sensor devices are still gone in Device Manager. I've never
 seen a version of Windows that didn't detect missing drivers for existing hardware following a reboot, and re-install them automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, every option to enable screen rotation has disappeared, so Windows apparently doesn't know the motion detectors exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked everywhere for drivers for these devices so I could install them myself, including the Dell support site using my service code number, and have drawn a complete blank. Where can I obtain the drivers for the sensor devices, or otherwise get this
 problem fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, a 2-in-1 is pretty useless if I can't get the display to auto-rotate. Thanks in advance!</p>

            Well, seems I figured this out...<br />
<br />
When you uninstall the sensor devices using Device Manager, Windows 10 does not detect them following a reboot and automatically install drivers like Windows would&nbsp;normally do for any other device (as long as you have that setting enabled in the "Devices and
 Printers" dialog, it's on by default), as I had previously mentioned.<br />
<br />
This is because the sensor drivers for my model laptop (Dell Inspiron 7000 2-in-1 (7348)) are part of the Dell "Intel Chipset Driver" package. There's absolutely no&nbsp;mention of this on the downloads page, which obviously isn't very helpful:<br />
<br />
http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=D689V<br />
<br />
Once I installed this package, all of the controls for screen rotation reappeared, but they were still grayed out.<br />
<br />
Turns out the controls for screen rotation now gray out when you have the laptop open in the "normal" position, that being with the keyboard on your work surface and&nbsp;the screen tilted back as you would normally use any other laptop. Once you either place the
 laptop on tent orientation or with the keyboard completely folded back,&nbsp;<br />
those controls "un-gray" themselves and can then be changed. To the best of my knowledge, this was not the case in Windows 8.1, and it's an easy trap to fall into.<br />
<br />
Live and learn I guess, but this isn't an obvious issue that's easily understood, or at least it wasn't to me. Hopefully this helps someone out.

<h2>            Microsoft security code problem</h2>
                    After updating BIOS on Windows 10 computer, the initial Windows Login PIN did not work and was asked to reset. This required me to log into my email at which point a security code was necessary. I selected delivery of the code to my email account email
 but the code received was not accepted by Windows. Have made 5 separate attempts but all rejected. Why is it happening and can I do to fix the problem?

<p>You cannot log into your PC because of the Windows Login PIN?</p>
<p>These Tips might help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try use a Windows Installation CD and re-install Windows 10.</li><li>Keep waiting until you get a response by Microsoft.</li></ul>
<p>If you have another PC, install the Windows 10 Installation Media and select "Install for another PC" and you'll be asked to insert a CD/USB into your computer. After that, boot the CD/USB on your Windows 10 computer and you should get the Windows Installation.</p>

<p>Workaround to overcome the problem</p>
<p>I found that the easiest solution was to logon to windows using my microsoft account logon (an alternative logon method was offered on the windows login screen). This allowed me to login and then go to settings and reset the PIN without needing the security
 code. After this, the PIN could be used successfully for future logins.</p>
<p>However, this work-around does not explain why the security code sent by microsoft was rejected.</p>
<p>Thanks to those who offered solutions.</p>

<p>Can I delete the "SaveData.mig" file after I run Windows Easy Transfer?</p>
<p>I used Easy Transfer to move files from an old computer to my new one about 12 months ago. The SaveData.mig file is taking up 22gb of space on the new computer. I would like to delete it but I am not sure if it will mess up any of my files that were transferred
 to my new computer. Does anyone know if I can safely delete this file to free up some space? Thanks</p>

<p>You can delete it safely. No problem . But all your data that you back up will be deleted. If you dont want the back up files in SaveData.mig , then i suggest you to delete it.</p>

<p>I agree with Mohdrafi - you can safely delete it; however, you should have a more recent backup of your current files just to be on the safe side (I do a COMPLETE image backup weekly and an incremental backup every day to an external HDD - I've seen too
 many people get burned when their hard drive crashes or someting worse and then they lose all their precious documents, pictures, audios, and other files).&nbsp; There ARE recovery procedures but they don't always work and they don't always recover everything (especially
 if you wait to address the problem or continue to use the PC in the meantime) - and depending on your version of Vista.&nbsp; Deleting this file will NOT affect the files and settings you restored using the process.&nbsp; You could have deleted it hours after the process
 was done (once you had a good backup) and it would have been fine then.&nbsp; If you have a good backup, I can see no reason whatsoever for keeping the file.</p>
<p>If the normal delete function in Vista doesn't work, t<span>ry using one of the following free products to delete the file.&nbsp; Unlocker at:
</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml</span></span></a></span><span>
 or File Assassin </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(with
 or without Force Delete: </span><span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/</span></span></a></span><span>).
 These programs often work when normal Vista delete functions fail to operate properly.</span></p>
<p>Congratulations on successfully using Easy Transfer - it's a pretty cool tool isn't it?&nbsp; You don't know how many threads we have here from people with problems doing it or recoving data from it - I've seen many.&nbsp; It seems easy on the surface, but when it
 doesn't work it can become quite complex and aggravating (and I know of some people who were unfortunately never able to recover their data and settings no matter what we tried).</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            I just bought my WD My Passport Essential SE and cant install the WD SES device driver which i think is needed to install the WD smartware. HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>

                    <span>
<p><strong>Everytime i plug in my WD portable drive it detects a new hardware called the WD SES device which it cannot install by itself. When i manually select the drive in which the drivers are located, it comes up with 2 different drivers of the same name,
 but no matter which one i pick at the end the dialog says that the specified file cannot be found. Manually selecting the driver itself also yields the same results. I brought the disk to the retailer, who tested it on his computer and found nothing wrong
 with it, so i think it has something to do with my computer.</strong></p>

<p>Since the device uses default Win drivers, if it is not detected when plugged in either their is a problem with your usb sys drivers, or the port. If on the otherhand you are saying that the WD preinstalled software is not running then that might be a Q
 for WD</p>

<h2>            Out of date drivers</h2>
                    I keep getting offers that say I have 15 drivers that are out of date. How do&nbsp;I know it they are out of date and if the offer is legit? Does Microsoft provide driver updates&nbsp;for free? I recently updated to W10 online from Microsoft but did not get the
 update for Office.

            <p>I get offers like that ... only they're for swamp land in Florida and the Brooklyn bridge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a come-on that you should just ignore. Allow The Magnificent BulldogXX to set you straight:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to know for sure whether a driver is out of date is to compare the version of the driver on your computer with the latest version of the driver on the hardware manufacturer's website. Don't trust a program to do that for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mere fact that a newer driver is available does not necessarily mean that you should install it. Drivers are modified to fix problems. If your hardware works fine, there's no need to install an updated driver no matter how new it is. If you really want
 to impress your geeky friends: Each driver update comes with an explanation that describes specifically what problems are being fixed. If you don't have those problems, you don't need the new driver. That simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft <em>delivers</em> drivers through Windows Update but it generally does not
<em>write</em> the drivers. The hardware manufacturer has the knowledge (and legal authority) to write the driver, which it then passes on to Microsoft. These drivers have acquired a bad reputation because they're not always the same driver you would get if
 you went to the manufacturer's website. That's why your geeky friends avoid drivers delivered through Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally: Drivers are always free, so don't let anyone try to charge you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The Magnificent BulldogXX" - sometimes I really outdo myself.</p>

            Hi MH.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then you can Reset and Repair Photos app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Photos app &gt; Advanced Options.  Your pictures will be safe in the User Pictures folder.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try reinstalling the Photos app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Some are temporarily installing the popular IrfanView photo app until MSFT gets this fixed:  <a href="https://www.irfanview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.irfanview.com/</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can try a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows fails to boot after blackscreen&#47;freeze and cannot repair&#47;restore in rescue environment &#40;Partial fix, work in progress.&#41;</h2>
                    <div>Hi all,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note: I will update this thread as I receive advice and apply tests.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have the following problem, which has occurred before, but continues today on a brand new win10 installation.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Problem:</strong></div>
<div>Windows freezes, becomes a black screen during use, or cannot see external HDD if it is connected. This requires system to be rebooted, or it reboots automatically. Upon reboot, system fails to boot successfully, often showing the Asus boot logo or stopping
 at the Win10 boot screen, after which it reboots again in a loop. Eventually, the Windows Rescue Environment (WRE) appears saying windows could not be booted and could not be repaired (shows restart and troubleshoot buttons).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. In the WRE, NO troubleshooting options work. Startup repair, load earlier restore point, uninstall updates, (insert any WRE options I'm currently forgetting) do NOT work. I've tried them all. They all fail.</div>
<div>2. CMD can be accessed on earlier cases of this problem. But I did not try it on the most recent one (yesterday evening).&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. Every time the issue occurs, I had to reinstall my OS.&nbsp;</div>
<div>4. Issue occurred on win10, but after using my win8.1 installation disk the problem also occurred on that OS soon after reinstall.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Most recent appearance of the problem:</strong></div>
<div><strong>19-02-19:</strong> Following the appearance of the Problem on windows 8.1 fresh install, I suspected a failing SSD.</div>
<div>I bought a new SSD (Samsung EVO 860 500GB) and replaced my OS drive. I downloaded the Windows Media Creation Tool from the Microsoft site on a laptop and created a USB boot media. With that, I booted the desktop and proceeded to create a partition on the
 new, empty SSD (sorted as Disk 2) and installed win10 to that drive. After installation, I rebooted the system twice to check for errors. Everything seemed fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The system had been deactivated for a while and I initially thought I was missing a partition on another drive (sorted as Disk 0), so I hooked up my external HDD to check if I had made a copy of said partition (I was mistaken as Disk 0 had some empty space
 I still need to resolve someday). However, Win10 did NOT add any Ext-HDD volumes to the Explorer list. It could not see the drive. I opened device manager where the Ext-HDD was present under disk drives, and opted to update the driver. Drivers already up to
 date. Win10 presented me with the option to search for updates through Windows Update, which I selected. (New installation, so Win-Update likely has updates anyway, better get it over with). Windows starts to search for updates, and begins to download updates.
 At that point, my screen starts flashing black, and eventually reboots. It fails to boot and hangs at the Asus boot screen. I press the reset button eventually, and it tries to boot (unsuccessfully) multiple times before entering the WRE with the message that
 Windows could not start.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>WRE shows two types of updates installed, but I cannot uninstall either of them. Their names have slipped my mind at the moment.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Startup repair sat on the 'attempting to repair' screen for the night, but in the morning it had the message that it was unable to repair anything.</div>
<div>System restore point finds no restore point.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Addition: I connected the Ext-HDD to my laptop where it showed fine without errors.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I think that covers everything. So the issue still occurs on a brand new disk, with a new windows install. I do not know what's causing this.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks to anyone for taking the time to try and help with this.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>My system components:</strong></div>
<div>Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4930K CPU @ 3.40GHz</div>
<div>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770</div>
<div>23 GB RAM&nbsp;</div>
<div>OS drive is a brand new (bought yesterday) Samsung 860 EVO 500 GB&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
=======================================</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Update 20-02-19:</strong><br />
Ran the <strong>memtest </strong>program which detected <strong>NO errors</strong>. Besides that, it dropped one note reading "RAM may be vulnerable to high frequency row hammer bit flips."&nbsp; I do not know what this means, or if it's even relevant to my problem.
 After exiting memtest the PC continued to boot successfully from the Asus boot screen into Windows 10 and I could even log in. Did not get far visually as the moment I pressed X to exit the memtest program, the computer made a strange sound (not a post check
 sound as I know them to be) and the majority of the screen turned white with alternating magenta + white and blue horizontal stripes. Moving the mouse in the windows environment changed the graphical glitch but not being able to see anything made me reboot
 to run a chkdsk in what little time I had left.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Chkdsk </strong><strong>result</strong>: I ran the chkdsk with /f /r /x flags, from the USB media creation tool, and that test also reported
<strong>NO errors</strong>. It did log 230895 KB in use by the system &amp; 65536 KB occupied by the log file. I do not know if this means that those areas were excluded from the scan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To target the chkdsk on the boot drive, I used diskpart - list volumes to detect the appropriate volume number. I did not alert at what I saw then but reading through this support forum this morning I realized I saw that the boot volume had been re-assigned,
 as mentioned in another post ( https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/system32logfilessrtsrttrail-error-on-boot-and/37624a02-fb9d-4ef5-8eef-c572e77b9479 )&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Upon reinstallation of the OS on the new SSD, I altered my volume's name so I could always recognize it as the OS drive. So I KNOW it was C: as expected. But last night in diskpart that volume had been reassigned to E: . this gives me a strong suspicion
 that these two threads have the same issue.<br />
<br />
(I did not see any messages listing srttrail, but I vaguely remember having seen it sometimes during at least one earlier occurrence of the Problem. It is a sidenote at best.)</p>
<p>=======================================<br />
<strong>Update 25-02-19:&nbsp;</strong><br />
After a fresh re-install, the OS worked once, giving me time to make a system restore point and get into safe mode through it. More details can be found in a reply in this thread.&nbsp;<br />
The Problem is caused by Windows Update, specifically: It auto-installs driver components that are not proper for my system and fails during/after installation. The Problem stops showing when booting in Safe mode. Event Viewer showed critical errors in a GPU-related
 driver, before I had a chance to retrieve the genuine NVidia driver from their website. So this is Windows Update's handiwork. Completely revoking Update's permissions stopped the system from crashing, while before doing so the Problem had been occurring non-stop.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
By keeping the Update permissions revoked, Windows has been performing very well with 0 crashes, and I've been able to reinstall all my software. I've decided to work with two partition backups: 1 complete reinstall with all my software present, but with no
 windows update permissions. And 1 backup partition which I will ever so often remake after I've given Windows the permission to update, and it has been running stable for a while afterwards.
<br />
<br />
Because I have had the Problem occur many times now, I think it's fair to say that Windows should no longer be allowed to just update whenever it feels like it on my pc. I get why Microsoft wants to, but so far I always end up being unable to do my work, and
 that's unacceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            Hi, EAlbers
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Diagnose memory problems
<br />Using these steps requires you to restart your computer, so make sure to save any files you may have open and close any running applications before proceeding. Here goes:
<br />1.- Open Control Panel.
<br />2.- Click on System and Security.
<br />3.-  Click on Administrative Tools.
<br />4.- Double-click the Windows Memory Diagnostic shortcut. Quick tip: Alternatively, you can also use the Windows key + R keyboard shortcut, type mdsched.exe, and click OK to launch the tool.
<br />5.- Click the Restart now and check problems option. (The tool also offers an option to schedule a test in the next reboot, if you can't afford to close your applications and restart immediately.)
<br />Once your computer reboots, it will start in the Windows Memory Diagnostics environment, and the tests will kick in the Standard mode right away. In this mode, the tool will run all the scans available in the Basic mode, in addition to LRAND, Stride6 (cache enabled), CHCKR3, WMATS+, and WINVC tests.
<br />You can simply let the Standard mode test your computer's memory, or you can also press the F1 key at any time to open the Windows Memory Diagnostic page to change the scan options.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            Hi Maritza,<br />
<br />
I am currently unable to access the windows environment as it won't boot at all, but if the WRE's command prompt function&nbsp; works tonight, what are the codes to use to do this memory check through that?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time,<br />

            I recommend you create a USB to check the RAM.

<p>Hello Maritza,<br />
<br />
I ran the memtest program you mentioned yesterday, as a USB media, with no errors and one note reported.&nbsp;<br />
After exiting memtest program I got to boot into windows but a graphical glitch occurred. It disappeared after reboot bc I wanted to launch into WRE from USB.</p>
<p>Ran a chkdsk with no errors reported.&nbsp;<br />
To target chkdsk I retrieved the OS volume, and noticed that the initial Problem reboot had remapped my OS from C: to E:&nbsp;<br />
I realized this after reading through this community forum post:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/system32logfilessrtsrttrail-error-on-boot-and/37624a02-fb9d-4ef5-8eef-c572e77b9479&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
I do not recall seeing srttrail mentioned with the Problem occurring on this fresh install on a new disk. I do recall having seen the message appear in at least one earlier occurrence of the Problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please find the full report of doing the tests as an update at the end of the original post (Update 20-02-19)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Status update:&nbsp;<br />
I disconnected non-OS drives and made sure that the OS SSD drive was connected to the mobo on the 1st slot. So even if I later on add the other disks back, the OS should be disk 0 or 1 (depending on count system). Miraculously, OS partition was marked as C
 again, and not E?<br />
<br />
The issue <strong>still persists</strong>&nbsp;with the other drives gone, so there is no interference from those.<br />
<br />
I was able to boot windows in safe mode, trying to install proper GPU drivers in case it's the culprit. However, that required a reboot after which the Problem pops up again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Resetting windows does NOT work, btw. I've seen some threads here where people give that advice. Please do not give it here: It has already been tried.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried to reinstall windows through the creation tool, but this caused a problem with multiple Windows 10 systems found on the same partition. I am going to set up to do a full disk clean and remove all partitions, maybe something has gone wrong in their setups?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still need help, as I do not know what is causing this issue. I am running out of ideas to try.&nbsp;<br />
After completely cleaning the disk and remaking partitions, I am going to try and lock Windows into booting in safe mode by default so I can get the GPU driver installed correctly.&nbsp;<br />

            So I recommend borrowing a computer to create a USB to repair Windows.
<br />Downloading the ISO already comes with the Windows 1809 updates

Hello Maritza,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time. Letting you know that I downloaded the mentioned ISO from the site last tuesday/wednesday and was already working from the USB it created. Repairing the windows installation from the USB tool was already attempted without success. Losing
 files is not a worry, since the disk was a new one, and I already formatted it yesterday.&nbsp;<br />
I am not reading anything that hasn't already been attempted?&nbsp;<br />

            I would recommend you to check your Hard Disk  with chkdsk.
<br />1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key  and S key at the same time, then type cmd in the search box. 
<br />2) Right-click Command Prompt, then select Run as administrator. 
<br />3) Type chkdsk /f /r, then press Enter on your keyboard.  
<br />4) Press Y on your keyboard. 
<br />5) Press the Windows logo key and R at the same time, then type mdsched.exe. 
<br />6) Click Restart now and check for problems (recommended). Your PC will restart immediately. 
<br />7) Wait for the scans to finish.

<p>Hi Francisco,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this issue with Assassin's Creed: Odyssey. As you may have already noted, this issue is a known one at both Microsoft/Xbox and at Ubisoft (the developer) for the game and the issue is being worked
 on at this time. Ubisoft does state that their developers are currently aware and hard at work to get everything back in order and, that for further updates, you may check on the game's official site for more information as it comes to light:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/1937294" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/1937294</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you called in and reported this to Xbox, or you set up a ticket with Ubisoft support, we thank you for all the data you've provided and hope that this is resolved very soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this information helps you out!</p>
