    <title>playing older games on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thinskin  say:</h3>
<h2>            playing older games on windows 10</h2>
                    I have been able to play my older games on windows 8 &amp; 8.1 up until the kb 3086255 update was installed which then prevented me from playing those games until I had to uninstall the kb 3086255 update allowing me to once again play the older games. I installed
 windows 10 and had the same problem with my older games not working. Does anyone know if this kb 3086255 update is part of the windows 10 installation and if so is there any way to disable the kb 3086255 in windows 10 or any other work around that will allow
 my older games to play on windows 10

<h3> battlegoatvp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media creation tool and windows version detection</h2>
                    <p>My question is will the Media Creation Tool automatically detect what version of windows i have? I have windows 10 pro on myn and i got the 4gb iso file, but it only gave me one option for Edition that just said windows 10, The other iso i want to get off
 another computer says it's windows 10 refurb edition or something like that, Will the media creation tool automatically detect that aswell and create the appropriate iso?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also will i need to reenter the product key? (which thankfully i wrote down) or will that iso have the activation information stored within the iso for that particular computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to install multiple versions of windows recovery iso's of my family's computers to one 32gb flash drive just incase something goes wrong with them, (one of them needs a hard drive replaced so i might aswell create recovery's for all) I'm assuming
 using the media creation tool</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a>), Is the way to do it, and then using this this tutorial to put them all on one flash drive (<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/262944/how-to-create-a-master-installation-flash-drive-with-multiple-versions-of-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/262944/how-to-create-a-master-installation-flash-drive-with-multiple-versions-of-windows/</a>).</p>

            Hi BattleGoatVP
<br />
<br />The installation media you create with the Media Creation Tool will automatically detect and install the appropriate edition (Home, Pro . . .etc.) of Windows 10, and there will be no need to use your Product Key . . .
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers

            Hello Isaacc, <br />
<br />
The Links folder is used to place the shortcuts which are pinned to Favorites in any previous version of Windows.<br />
<br />
In Windows 10, Favorites were replaced as Quick Access, but Quick Access is designed in a different way from Favorites.<br />
<br />
For reference, you may check and learn more about Quick access through our <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/06/08/get-your-work-done-faster-with-quick-access/#5O4oylQIIju8I8eA.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Blog</a>. <br />
<br />
Let us know if you have other concerns.<br />
<br />
Regards.

    <title>Office 2010 Update Failure Code 80070643 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kitmccabe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010 Update Failure Code 80070643</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are a billion of these things but so far none of the "answers" have helped.
</p>
<p><br />
I have a HP, Windows 7 computer that I purchased in 2012 with a non-activated Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010 on the PC. At the time of purchase, I also purchased a Product Key Card to activate the software. There was no disc involved. I still have the
 Pin and Product Key. </p>
<p><br />
Since December 9, 2014 my updates for the 4 Office programs ("Update for Microsoft Excel/Office/OneNote/PowerPoint 2010 32-Bit Edition") have been failing. I haven't noticed any issues with using these programs other than the icon being a generic Windows icon
 rather than the usual Office ones. </p>
<p><br />
So far, I have tried the following (not necessarily in the following order):</p>
<p><br />
<strong>1. Windows Automatic Troubleshooter on the Microsoft Support website: </strong>
<br />
When I open the troubleshooter I have two programs that load, (1) Windows Update and (2) Background Intelligent Transfer Service. When I run the troubleshoot for the Windows Update it finds that everything is fixed except "Windows Update Error 0x80070057".
 When I run the troubleshoot for the Background Intelligent Transfer Service it finds the same thing. When looking up that particular error code, I could only find answers for Windows Vista. After reading some of the suggestions, I did a hard disk scan and
 it found that everything was clean and ok.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>2. Change the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS):</strong></p>
<p>I followed the directions to start the service and no change.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>3. Repair.bat suggestion by Manasa P - Microsoft Support:</strong></p>
<p>I followed the instructions to create a Repair batch file (.bat). The file ran but no change.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>4. Command </strong><strong>Prompt Scan suggestion:</strong></p>
<p>I cannot find the instructions I found before, but someone suggested entering a particular code into the command prompt. I did so and no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5. Repair the Program:</strong></p>
<p>I went into my programs to see if I could "Repair" Microsoft Office, but it was not one of the options. I could only Uninstall or Change the program. I would just uninstall the program and reinstall it, but I decided to check that I could use the same key
 by going on <a href="http://www.office.com/getkey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.office.com/getkey</a>. Although I was signed into my account, when I entered the information I received this note: "The PIN entered has already been used to retrieve a Microsoft Office Product Key. To
 access this Product Key, Sign in to your account. NOTE: If you did not create an account when redeeming this PIN, the only record of your Product Key was sent to the email address provided at redemption.&nbsp; There is no record of your Product Key on this site."</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>6. Clean Boot:</strong></p>
<p>I followed the directions to do a clean boot. I disabled all programs that were not Microsoft, and restarted the computer. I tried to update, and no change.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>7. Ran the Microsoft FixIt:</strong></p>
<p>Ran the program, but no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>8. Restarted the Office source Engine (OSE) service:</strong></p>
<p>Followed in the instructions to restart this service, but no change</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I am running out of ideas. The update failures are not affecting my everyday use of my computer, but it is pretty annoying to keep seeing the failures pop-up when I try to do an update for anything else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated!</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per your description, I understand that you are experiencing a Windows Update issue while updating Office 2010 update on your Windows 7 computer and you are getting
 error code 0x80070057 while trying to update it from Windows Update. Error code 0x80070057 usually occurs when Windows is unable to create the backup file of your date. I will certainly help you with the same. However, we need few more details to understand
 the cause of the issue better.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Have you recently made any changes on your computer, prior to the issue?</span></li><li><span>What is the complete make and model of your computer?</span></li><li><span>Do you get any error message while using Microsoft Office 2010?</span></li><li><span>Do you have any third party security software installed on your computer?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is there any Windows Update which has been failed recently?</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Refer the links:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/is-is/windows/which-windows-updates-installed#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to check Windows update history</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I recommend you to go through following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try to do manual reset of Windows Updates Components.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press start button, search Command Prompt (CMD) on search box. Right click on “Command Prompt (CMD)” to launch it as an administrator.</span></li><li><span>Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>net stop wuauserv</span></p>
<p><span>net stop cryptSvc</span></p>
<p><span>net stop bits</span></p>
<p><span>net stop msiserver</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp; Now rename the
<strong>SoftwareDistributio</strong>n and <strong>Catroot2</strong> folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “<strong>ENTER</strong>” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></p>
<p><span>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Now, let’s restart the
<strong>BITS</strong>, <strong>Cryptographic</strong>, <strong>MSI Installer</strong> and the
<strong>Windows Update</strong> Services. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>net start wuauserv</span></p>
<p><span>net start cryptSvc</span></p>
<p><span>net start bits</span></p>
<p><span>net start msiserver</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify
 the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a
 problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once Step 1 would be completed, restart the computer and follow Step 2.</span></p>

</span><span>If prompted, reboot your computer.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If issue persists I would suggest you to perform
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>SFC scan</strong></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> and check if that helps. The

<p>
</p><p>If an Office application isn’t working properly, sometimes restarting it will fix the problem. If that doesn’t work, you can try repairing it. When you’re done, you might need to restart your computer.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to Control Panel.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Windows 8, on the <strong>Start</strong> screen, type <strong>Control Panel</strong>, and select
<strong>Control Panel</strong> in the search results.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In Windows 7 or Vista, click <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>Programs</strong> &gt; <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the Office application you want to repair, and then click <strong>Change</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In Office 2013, click either <strong>Quick Repair</strong> or <strong>Online Repair</strong>. In Office 2010, click
<strong>Repair</strong> &gt; <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If running Repair doesn’t solve the problem, you might need to uninstall and reinstall Office. See

            <p>Hello Shivam, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, the error code I am receiving when I try to update is Code 80070643. Error code 0x80070057 is what I receive when I try the Windows Automatic Troubleshooter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates in question are:</p>

<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Have you recently made any changes on your computer, prior to the issue? :
</span></p>
<p><span>No, there were no new changes. The only new program or update to my computer was the Adobe Photoshop Lightroom program that I added&nbsp;a couple days before the original update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. </span><span>What is the complete make and model of your computer?:</span></p>
<p><span>My computer is an HP Pavilion dm4 Notebook PC</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3.Do you get any error message while using Microsoft Office 2010?:</span></p>
<p><span>I have no issues or error messages that pop-up while using Microsoft Office.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Do you have any third party security software installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>I have Kaspersky PURE 3.0 security </span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">5. Is there any Windows Update which has been failed recently?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">My "Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2984976)" originally failed, but succeeded when I tried again. Other than that, everything has updated fine.</span></p>

            <p>Hello TaurArian, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates in question are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update for Microsoft Excel 2010 (KB2589348) 32-Bit Edition</p>

<p>Update for Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 (KB2880517) 32-Bit Edition</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I try manually downloading the update I receive the message "An error occurred while running detection".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I try Repairing Office 2010, I click "Change" and an Office pop-up comes up and says "Please wait while setup prepares the necessary files", but then nothing happens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am totally fine with uninstalling and reinstalling the program, just as long as I&nbsp;know unequivocally that the program will reinstall when I try. I am worried that it will not allow&nbsp;me to use the Product Key again when I try to&nbsp;reinstall.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained
 above, at the time of my computer purchase, I also purchased a Product Key Card to activate the software. There was no disc involved, though&nbsp;I still have the Pin and Product Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I checked to make sure that I could use the same key by going on
<a href="http://www.office.com/getkeyAlthough" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.office.com/getkey</a></p>,&nbsp;even though&nbsp;I was signed into my account, when I entered the information I
 received this note: "The PIN entered has already been used to retrieve a Microsoft Office Product Key. To access this Product Key, Sign in to your account. NOTE: If you did not create an account when redeeming this PIN, the only record of your Product Key
 was sent to the email address provided at redemption.&nbsp; There is no record of your Product Key on this site."
<p>

            You need a program that can open a SBK file - there are several options (Vista doesn't) and you need to have the exact program that created it to get the correct program to read it (not all programs that make SBK files can read SBK files made by other
 programs).&nbsp; I suggest you ask whoever gave you that file what program was used to create it so you'll know where to start.&nbsp; The links below and above give you some options, but you need to research the actual program to make any headway.<br />
<br />
Here's a link to a list of programs that deal with SBK files: <a href="http://filext.com/file-extension/SBK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://filext.com/file-extension/SBK</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the hyperlink to get all 9 entries.&nbsp; You can then put the names into Bing or Google and research each of the programs to find the one you're looking for.&nbsp; (NOTE: Do NOT try out the registry editor advertised
 on that page - it is worthless and possibly dangerous).<br />
<br />
Here's another link on SBK programs: <a href="http://www.ehow.com/facts_5014419_what-file-extension-sbk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

I hope this (along with David's link) helps.<br />

Good luck!

            <p>Hello Borate,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no way for us to disable error 69 reporting from the Event Viewer. However, we can create a custom filter for the event logs and hide error 69 from the report. You may follow these steps, how to:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hiding or stopping Event Viewer from reporting Error 69 may not address the root cause of this issue. We would highly suggest that you run the System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management&nbsp;
 (DISM) scans to check for missing or corrupted system files, if there are any. To run the said scans, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></li><li>Type the following commands, one after the other completes the scan:<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</li></ol>
<p>If the results of SFC or DISM scan would state that it found corrupted files and repaired those, you would need to restart your computer to apply the changes. Afterwards, check if you would still encounter the Error 69 from Event Viewer which you were getting.</p>

<h2>            Fifa 14 - Xbox One vs 360</h2>
                    
<p>I was wondering if you would be able to play online against each console.</p>
<p>Im getting an xbox one but not many friends are. Would i still be able to play them or would i have to go back onto the 360?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also can you plug the 360 into the Xbox One&nbsp; using the HDMI so they run along side each other?</p>

<p>Ah thats a shame.</p>
<p>For the second question i just come across this.</p>
<p><em>"Although PAR asked specifically about the PlayStation 4 and Wii U, Henshaw mentioned that he and his son have their Xbox 360 hooked up to the Xbox One. The 360 appears on the Xbox One UI and the Henshaws can seamlessly switch back and forth between
 the two while maintaining the functionality of the next-gen console"</em></p>

<p>actually...the answer is YES...you will be able to plug your 360 into your XB1 via the hdmi pass thu and play your 360 games. &nbsp;And for the rumor that you'd be able to do that with a ps4 also....again, the answer is YES. &nbsp; I read an article just the past
 few days where MS confirms this to be true.</p>

<h2>            Windows RT upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have recently bought a Lumia 2520 tab that works on Windows RT 8.1. </p>
<p>I wanted to know if this Windows RT can be upgraded to Windows 10. If yes, then it would be really great. Else I will have regret for buying an operating system that has no future.</p>
<p>Hoping for your quick feedback.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I wish people would stop saying this half truth all over the internet.&nbsp; Of course Windows 10 for RT is not going to have all of the full blown functions of x86 Windows 10 even if some legacy compatibility is transferred. There will still be an update for
 windows RT and it has been confirmed that Microsoft plans to continue&nbsp;pursuing&nbsp; ARM based software.&nbsp; The Atom chips still have nothing on the power speed sustainability and energy efficiency of an ARM processor in one package.&nbsp; The limits of the amount of
 RAM ARM processors can support are also being over come. Samsung for example has already proven this.

            <p>The problem is at the time of the OP Microsoft had said virtually nothing about Windows RT and Windows 10. Very soon after MS held the Windows 10 event and even then what was said was very much an aside comment, very guarded and contained little detail.
 As of today about the biggest glimmer of hope is the fact that there will be a Windows 10 for the Raspberry PI, also an ARM device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those of us used to the RT limitations would hardly expect Windows 10 RT to be fully functional, it is the dearth of detailed information from Microsoft that is the problem, quessworks by commentators is not enough. Yes the Answer is wrong and should be
 withdrawn, that is down to the mods.</p>

            <p>I agree 100%.&nbsp; I have given up waiting. I've been too patient in the past with 3 other devices that were useless soon after launch from MS and this is the most costly. Track record for info is very bad and the millions with RT do deserve to find out what
 they are going to be offered since there is no decent trade in offer for them and some bought in to the ARM and cross compatibility mumbo jumbo. Now the devices are taboo and worthless too. I gave up after being around since the MS-OS/2 days and bought some
 different hardware, but will keep the RT for lack of any way to get rid of it just to see what does come down the road for it. The lack of info is very scary considering how many MS devices seemingly were forgotten and ignored in what should have been their
 prime. <br />
</p>
<p>Also, it's already being reported that the new gen. apps wont even run on it - what is the good of keeping it really.</p>

            <p>Now we see the new Surface 3 I have even less hope. It has switched over to the Atom Processor and runs full Windows 8 which to me is a nail in the coffin for RT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A real shame because to me given support RT was and is an iOS beater. To a certain extent the issue has been solved for me because my Surface failed terminally. I did initially look to replace like with like but the device disappeared from the Microsoft
 Store and this lack of concrete information led me to go for the Pro3 instead. A really good device but bigger and heavier, I miss my little Surface RT</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really fail to see the logic in killing off RT yet supporting Raspberry Pi although Microsoft have not actually admitted to the former, it is difficult to see any other outcome.&nbsp;</p>

            Why are you running such as old version?
<br />
<br />Don't re-install McAfee.
<br />
<br />This does sound like a hardware issue. Have you added any new hardware lately such as memory or USB devices?
<br />
<br />Be sure the laptop has adequate cooling. Clear the vents and then prop it up and use a fan blowing under it to see if that helps.
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest BIOS, chipset drivers, and the major onboard and any separate device drivers.
<br />
<br />After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run 
<br />DriverVerifier. 
<br />

<p>im running an old version, because it wont allow me to update. I updated the bios but still get bsod. There are 2 driver that continually pop up for update even after i updated them. The laptop is a dell inspiron 5559. After Driver verifier this is the dmp
 for the bsod . https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ak8YZSWuNgPjgQqT5PxM_fAhdQ4B </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm noticing I get the bsod when I run a virus scan of any kind whether it Microsoft safety, adw, or even when dell run a support scan to check the system. It gets bsod (driver_overran_stack_ buffer). By any chance will the manufacturer replace laptop or
 Microsoft since this seem like more of a device and technology issue?</p>

            If the laptop is still under manufacturer's warranty you definitely need to check with their support. As OEM they are responsible for both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve.
<br />
<br />Note that I said to fully uninstall McAfee and stop using it. Use only Windows Defender. And if you want an on demand scanner use Malwarebytes - Free (not always running).
<br />
<br />The Driver Verifier minidump does not indicate a driver issue which usually means it is a hardware problem.

<h2>            Checking Disk - can I cancel&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(0, 75, 120, 1)">
Hi there! </p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 75, 120, 1)">
I bought my 3rd My Passport as previous was causing same problems - in case USB would get out by accident before I would eject disk, the computer wouldn’t find it anymore. This time it’s found but Windows said that it’s corrupted and it has to check it. I checked
 options: “Automatically fix file system errors &amp; Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors”. It’s a 3TB drive, probably about 2TB used. It’s scanning since at least 6h now and the computer shows the progress line, but no progress, so I have no clue where
 I stand. I could click cancel, but I’m scared. This is the drive where all my stuff is stored and I’m afraid of loosing anything.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 75, 120, 1)">
Can I press Cancel? How long can chkdsk go?? It was happening with the previous one that while I would move computer the cable would get out for a tiny bit and there would be a problem. I think it’s something that can easily happen. How can I avoid this?? Some
 other devices to keep my data safe?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 75, 120, 1)">
I’m afraid now …&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 75, 120, 1)">
Thank you &amp; have a nice day!<br />
Stela</p>

<p>You can probably cancel with Ctrl+C, and it shouldn't be terrible.&nbsp; But really, you should not do anything further until you have a backup of all your important stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go check on Google how long hard drives last -- on average, it's barely 4 years.&nbsp; And like people and everything else, some die younger and some older.&nbsp; So it's not a matter of IF you will lose all your important files, it's WHEN.&nbsp; If you don't have a backup,
 it's already guaranteed to get lost forever, the only question is how long until that happens. On average, just a few years.&nbsp; Like the popular company likes to say, "you gotta back it up to get it back."<br />

    <title>How to change a specific folder type template WITHOUT applying to all - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vlad l.  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change a specific folder type template WITHOUT applying to all folders</h2>
                    Pretty much what the title says, an issue with every major windows 10 update is that it resets (for the Documents template at least) the view settings back to default, so new folders created after the update will use the default "Documents" view. I want
 to prevent this or at least re-apply my settings WITHOUT using the "Apply to Folders" option from the folder options menu because, while indeed it would fix the above mentioned problem (that is: until the next update rolls up and i have to do it all over again),
 but in the process it will also <strong>overwrite every existing folder</strong> using the "Documents" template folder from my PC. I do
<strong>not </strong>want this. I've searched a lot on how the folder view system works and how it gets saved in the registry, and i couldn't figure out where this setting is stored and how to change it directly. Any advice on how i could achieve this?<br />

No, this is exactly what i do NOT want. I know how to customize the folder view. Have you even read my question? I need a way to do this via the registry or some other way, so as not to apply the option to all the already existing folders of the same (Documents)
 type.

</p><blockquote>Pretty much what the title says, an issue with every major windows 10 update is that it resets (for the Documents template at least) the view settings back to default, so new folders created after the update
 will use the default "Documents" view. I want to prevent this or at least re-apply my settings WITHOUT using the "Apply to Folders" option from the folder options menu because, while indeed it would fix the above mentioned problem (that is: until the next
 update rolls up and i have to do it all over again), but in the process it will also
<strong>overwrite every existing folder</strong> using the "Documents" template folder from my PC. I do
<strong>not </strong>want this. I've searched a lot on how the folder view system works and how it gets saved in the registry, and i couldn't figure out where this setting is stored and how to change it directly. Any advice on how i could achieve this?<br />
</blockquote>
<p>As usual, this forum is of absolutely no help unless your issue is something very basic. I wonder if those in charge of answering the questions here have any idea what they are doing or just copy/paste canned responses to everyone and hoping something sticks.
 Regardless, I've done your job for you and managed to figure it out by myself and I'm leaving the solution here for anyone else who needs to solve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turns out the thing I was asking above (as expected) does indeed have a way to be controlled via the registry without having to go through the folder options and **** every other folder of that type that you may already have.<br />
<br />
go to this registry key <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Streams\Defaults</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>here by default you'll have no entries on a fresh install or after a major update, but if you change any folder template, it will make a new entry here that will be used for any future folders of that type that you will open. I'm guessing windows wipes this
 clean after every major update and hence why the above mentioned problem kept re-appearing after every one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every entry here will be named something like "{5C4F28B5-F869-4E84-8E60-F11DB97C5CC7}" each representing a folder type (documents/photos/videos/etc.) being of type REG_BINARY and containing a long -almost unreadable- block of data in hex that I presume contains
 the actual view settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly I can't provide you with the actual folder types {gibberish} codes and the content for every view type. You'll have to find that yourself. I suggest doing that by basically biting the bullet and using one last time the folder "options&gt;view&gt;apply to
 folders" method to actually generate the entries you need and then writing them down or exporting them for later use. You could use a VM to do this if you don't have a "burner" pc to do this on (that's what I did).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I'd like to thank M$ for all the help Microsoft Answers provides! What would we do without you I wonder?<br />

                    I run Vista and opened the defragment program to run a routine defrag of the hard drive. I have done this many times before and have defragged the C and D volumes. This time the dialog box had an unknown volume identified as \\?\volume{c0d0a16f-f527-11df-b405-806e6f6e693}\....
 What is this volume......where did it come from and how do I get rid of it?

            <p>Hello Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guid in the ID&lt;{c0d0a16f-f527-11df-b405-806e6f6e693} should correspond to the drive within regedit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am guessing that this may be a drive that has not been assigned a drive letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First we can take a look in Disk management:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Click start and right-click Computer.</li><li>Choose manage</li><li>Click on Disk Management.</li><li>Look for a disk that has no drive letter.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is not present, then we can look in regedit:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on Start</li><li>Choose run</li><li>Type regedit and press the enter key.</li><li>Click Yes on the UAC prompt.</li><li>Navigate to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices key.</li><li>Look for the aforementioned GUID and see if there is a drive letter associated with it.</li></ol>
<p>Let us know if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

            <span>Hi Sandeep, thank you for your response. Answers to your questions.<br />
<br />
What is the complete error message?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-Windows installation encountered an unknown error and cannot continue. This is all I get, then when I click OK it goes ahead and reverts back to Vista home premium.
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What type of installation are you doing?
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I'm doing an upgrade from Vista Home Premium to Windows 7 Ultimate.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>At what stage of the installation do you get the error?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - It appears to be in the final phase of the upgrade where it is transferring files. It appears that it completes this task because it does a re-boot, the windows&nbsp; 7 logo comes up , it sits there for a few minutes then the pop-up window appears
 stating&nbsp; </span>"Windows installation encountered an unknown error and cannot continue" and after I click OK it starts reverting back to Vista. Then vista opens up and everything seems to be working OK.<span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Are you able to boot to the desktop?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Yes, after it finishes reverting back to Vista everything seems to be working OK.</span></p>
<p><span>I've tried the installation three times with the same results with the "UNKNOWN" error message at the end each time.</span></p>
<p><span>I did the upgrade adviser each time. The first time it told me that there were five programs/hardware that may not work correctly after install.. I uninstalled the programs and printer that it said may be an issue. I figured I could re-install them
 later.</span></p>
<p><span>I also uninstalled malware &amp; super anti-virus Programs. I'm running Norton 360 which I also disabled each time.<br />
</span></p>

            Hi Sandeep, reults not good. Clicked on&nbsp; microsoft fix it button and now it's worse. MS ugrade cd now won't autorun, I have to open cd and start .exe manually. Popup window appears and states same message as before "windows encountered an unknown error
 and cannot continue"&nbsp; but now it's at the beginning of upgrade process. I click the OK button (only option) and it starts searching for updates. This time after 1.5hrs it was still searching for updates??? Before it searched and after 5min it started the upgrade
 process. Now it's hung up in phase 1 (searching for updates). Frustrated I powered computer down and re-booted. Vista is back and everything appears to be working OK.&nbsp; Any other suggestions????<br />

<p><span>Does it happen with all the websites or only with one particular website?</span></p>

<p><span>If not, I suggest you to
</span><span>run Internet Explorer Troubleshooter and check.</span><span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
To run Internet Explorer Troubleshooter, follow these steps: Close all programs. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>. <br />
2. Under <strong>System and Security</strong>, click <strong>Find and fix problems</strong>.
<br />
3. On the task pane on the left, click <strong>View All</strong>. <br />
4. Click <strong>Internet Explorer Performance</strong>. This opens a new window.
<br />
5. Click <strong>Next</strong>. <br />
6. The troubleshooter will run and fix all identified issues automatically. Click
<strong>Close</strong>. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
After the troubleshooter has successfully run, try to browse to the Internet again.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn’t help, l</span><span>et's try&nbsp;running Internet
 Explorer in no add-ons mode and check.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Run Internet Explorer in "No Add-Ons" mode&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Internet Explorer add-ons, such as ActiveX controls and browser toolbars, are used by some Web sites to provide an enhanced browsing experience. An error
 may occur if an add-on is damaged or if an add-on conflicts with Internet Explorer. To determine whether the error is caused by an add-on, run Internet Explorer in "No Add-Ons" mode. To do this, follow these steps:&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start, and then type Internet Explorer in the Start Search box.
</span></p>
<p><span>Click Internet Explorer (No Add-Ons). Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.
</span></p>
<p><span>Test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If no errors occur, the problem is caused by one of the add-ons that typically load together with Internet Explorer. In this case, use one of the following
 options.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Option 1</span></strong><span>: Reset Internet Explorer</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reset Internet Explorer to its default configuration. This step will also disable any add-ons, plug-ins, or toolbars that are installed. Although this solution
 is quick, it also means that, if you want to use any of those add-ons in the future, they must be reinstalled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Option 2:</span></strong><span> Use the Manage Add-ons tool to determine
 which add-on is causing the issue</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Use the Manage Add-ons tool in Internet Explorer to individually disable each add-on to determine which add-on is causing errors. To do this, follow these
 steps:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Internet Explorer 8&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Internet Explorer 8.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Tools, and then click Manage Add-ons.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the Show drop-down menu, select All add-ons to display all add-ons that are installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>For each item in this list, select the add-on, and then click Disable in the Information window.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you have disabled all the items in this list, click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Exit and then restart Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If issues do not reoccur, repeat steps 1 through 3.</span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Enable for a single add-on.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Repeat steps 6 through 8 until you determine which add-on causes errors to occur.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After you have used this process to determine which add-on is causing errors, you can disable that add-on. Or, you can uninstall the software that installs
 the add-on. We also recommend that you contact the software vendor that provided the add-on for additional troubleshooting and support.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Connecting to Microsoft services issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kingkapps  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting to Microsoft services issue</h2>
                    <p>So i have had this problem for as long as i have had my computer it seems where i cannot connect to specific sites such as gmail, or the Microsoft login page (login.live.com). I have worked through everything that i could find and still cannot find a solution.
 My main issue as of now is that i cannot connect to the Windows 10 store page and it just loads and if i attempt to login i get the error "0x80190001".&nbsp;</p>
<p>For browser i use google chrome and if i go to Microsoft.com it loads fine but if i got to sign in (login.live.me) i get the error "This site cant be reached".</p>
<p>I tried everything i could until i came to adding a vpn just through a google chrome extension which solved the issue for the browser and i can now connect to the login page and everything browser related works but i still have the issue with not being able
 to connect to the Windows Store. I assume that the issue is internet related and have tried to change my DNS address and IP but neither seem to work.</p>
<p>Please help,&nbsp; thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>This did not work and i should have specified my problem better. I am pretty sure that somewhere things relating to Microsoft are blocked and cannot be connected. I am pretty sure it is an internet issue because a vpn extension on chrome solved the browser
 side of problems that i was having and allowed me to connect to the microsoft sites that i was not able to connect to before. So it is still being blocked but just bypassed because of the vpn. But i still cannot connect to the windows store because it is still
 being blocked overall and i cannot find the root of the problem and that was what i was asking for help to find. I have checked my firewall and tried to change my DNS address but neither seemed to solve it.
</p>
<p>Also the leading reason why i really want this fixed is for Sea of Thieves which i believe you need to be logged into the Windows store. Is there a way i can get and play the game without using the windows store and just through browser?</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. If you are using a third-party antivirus software, we suggest turning it off first and check if you will be able to connect to Microsoft store. Also, we suggest checking your firewall settings if there’s any blocked websites or
 files.</p>

            Thanks again but this did not work, i have done this before and still no fix. I have AVG and it seems to cause no issues and does not solve it when i turn it off. Also my firewall is fine and no things Windows or Microsoft related are being blocked. I
 really do not know what the issue is, all i know is that it is something internet related due to the VPN allowing me to connect to the websites. I know its not firewall or antivirus related but is being blocked in some other way that i cannot seem to find.

<p>Well now i'm really confused, i connected to my iPhone hot spot which i really thought would fix it because i can access those sites on my phone but this still did not work. I tried to connect to the sites through the hot spot while on my WiFi and while
 on LTE as well. I'm not sure entirely on if that removes the idea of it being an internet problem or not. Since i cannot find any other place where it is being blocked i am led to assume that it could be malware or something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, do you know if it is possible to buy and play a game that is exclusively on the windows store (Sea of Thieves is the game) through the browser? or can i only download it through the windows store app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again.</p>

<p>We want to know if the network that you’re using for your phone is different from the network that you currently have. If it’s the same, we suggest using a different network such as a public network and check if there will be any changes. Regarding the game
 Sea of Thieves, we recommend downloading this to Microsoft store only. If you will download it from a different website, you may encounter in-game issues and will have problems with the copyright.</p>

            So i found out that the windows store does kind of load if i leave it open for several hours. This does not solve it because when the store is loading for an extended period of time it does not ever error but when i try to login it loads for a minute and
 then errors with "Something went wrong. Please try again later. 0x80190001", so when it errors it no longer loads of course so i cannot ever login. But if i go in the Microsoft website and start a download from there so then it pops up in the windows store
 would it be possible to go through the whole downloading process for a paid game without ever logging in to the store app?

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The challenges that you are experiencing with Microsoft Store may be related to a corruption of system files. To continue troubleshooting, we recommend that you run SFC/DISM to find/repair missing or corrupted operating system files. Simply follow the steps
 on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">link</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I ran both of the tests several times and neither found anything.</p>
<p>To restate the issue i am having, my connections with some sites are slowed so much that it ends up coming to an error if it can, such as websites and the login screen on the Microsoft store. The only thing that i have been able to load is pages on the windows
 store after hours of letting it load because it does not have an error screen after not connecting for a certain amount of time whereas websites and the login screen do. I do not know the source of the issue but with a browser vpn extension all of my connections
 on the browser side of things are solved and i can access those sites. I did try to download a vpn application to solve the whole problem but that did not solve the store or the browser.</p>
<p>
