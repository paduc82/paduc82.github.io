<h2>            Hotmail account appears to have been hacked&#47;directed to Arabic Outlook inbox</h2>
                    Hi, I have a Hotmail email account that has been active for more than 10 years, without any issues or problems. Two days ago, someone sent "fake" message to many of my email contacts asking for money on my behalf -- it is clear that someone has hacked
 into my account considering that I have personally received such "fake" emails in the past.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That same day, I read the FAQs on Help Center link on the Outlook sign-in page. &nbsp;I was asked to provide an alternate email address so that I could get a link to reset my password. I did so and then via that alternate email ID, Microsoft support contacted
 me and gave me instructions to reset my password and to update the &nbsp;security information related to my account.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After doing the above, I tried to log into my hotmail account again, this time with the new password. &nbsp;When I did so, I was immediately taken to what looks like an ARABIC Outlook inbox with my name in English on the top left hand corner. &nbsp;It looks exactly
 like an Outlook inbox page, except that all the font is ARABIC and that there are absolutely NO messages in the inbox. &nbsp;I immediately contacted Outlook support via chat, and discussed my problem. &nbsp;I was instructed to create another Hotmail email account (the
 account I am sending this from) which I did (a temporary Microsoft account so that MS Support could help me resolve the problem).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It has been two days now, and this is where things stand. &nbsp;I have not gotten any further information about what might be wrong with my account and how to sign back in so that I can access my "English" Outlook page and all my "English" emails...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As I mentioned earlier, I have used this account for more than ten years, and all of my contacts from business and personal side use this email account to contact me. &nbsp;I DO NOT HAVE any other email account that I use to receive and send email at this time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help me in resolving the matter.&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

Upon further investigation, I see that at the bottom of the blank inbox, it says "Your mail is being forwarded to another account." &nbsp;When I clicked for details, I see that my mail had been set to be forwarded to a yahoo ID which I don't recognize and don't
 know. &nbsp;I clicked, "Don't forward".
<div><br />
<div>So does this mean that someone hacked into my account and had all my email forwarded to their ID?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The more and more I look into this, I think I need to close this hotmail account altogether and go with a non-Microsoft email option. &nbsp;</div>

                    <p>This isn't new- but I hope it helps get some faster action to solve a big issue I have as well as other with Windows 10 and phone APPS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Too many APPS (IOS/Android) don't have a Windows 10 equivalent to use!!!</p>
<p>Here's a candid message I got back from my request for an APP to use:</p>

<p>

<h2>            Printed Resource Usage report doesn&#39;t match what is on the screen...</h2>
                    <p>Excuse me if this has been previously reported...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have created a simple project schedule in Project 2013 (approx. 70 tasks).&nbsp; I assigned resources to the tasks and then started to examine the Resource Usage display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One resource has a 10 hour task assigned for the week of October 13, 2013.</p>
<p>This task (and resource assignment) is correctly displayed on the Resource Usage display.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp; when I print the Resource Usage display, the task is shown to be occurring on the week of September 15, 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until I resolve this issue, the Resource Usage feature cannot be utilized in any of my client reports. (And I really don't want to re-create the report in Excel!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            Hi JP_EA,<br />
<br />
This was fixed in the April 2013 cumulative update.&nbsp; See:<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2768336/en-us<br />
<br />
Specifically:<br />
<br />
<i>When you print or print preview a task or resource usage view in Project 2013, only the first one or two pages in a multiple page printout are printed or displayed correctly. Additionally, the remaining data on the pages may be misplaced or blank where data
 is expected.</i><br />
<br />
Download and install the cumulative update.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />

            So clearing the cache did not clear the count - and if you repeat the steps, you always get the negative count? 
<br />
<br />What browser are you using? 
<br />Do you have any script blocking software in use?

            I understood that from the beginning - it was obvious from looking at the screenshot. 
<br />
<br />I tried to reproduce it here and can't, so it's either a unique problem to you or is affecting a limited number of users at this time - it's something on your side or something gone wrong on the server. We can't fix server side problems but can make suggestions on things to try to see if it's a problem on the client side. 
<br />
<br />When weirdness like this happens there are basic steps to try - test it in a different browser, clearing the cache etc. If that doesn't fix it and you aren't using security software or browser settings that block scripts, then its on the server.  You can click the ?, search for something then click Email me to send an email to outlook.com support engineers.

<p>Thanks for your post in Microsoft Community. According to your post, seems it might be browser and cache issue, so would like to suggest you to open browser in In-private mode and check the result.
 Also to narrow down the issue, suggest you to check the issue status in Open network.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If still issue persist, may I know what the type of your account? Is it an Office 365 for Business(@contoso.onmicrosoft.com) or Outlook.com account? Please let me know the details so that I can help
 you investigate to it further.</p>

    <title>How can you hide the messenger panel in outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can you hide the messenger panel in outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this morning the Messenger Panel popped up on the right-hand side of the screen, taking up a third of the screen and making the simple task of email reading impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading the forum it seems that I should be able to hide the messenger panel clicking on 3 mysterious dots that should appear next to the text Messaging, but alas, there's no 3 dots, so I'm stuck with this annoying panel of dead contacts for a service I
 haven't used in at least 4 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make it clear I'm not talking about the ads or the reading pane, I'm talking about the Messenger panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how I can get rid of it ( rid of the pane, not of messenger )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Halleluja! If you mean the big Messaging box which, on my screen, resides on the bottom left corner of the Outlook mail screen and obscures view of Folders and Categories, I am finally able to shrink it. There is a little chevron at its top left corner and
 selecting this makes it much smaller. Having it gone completely would be better, but this is a great improvement. I could swear it was not there before. Perhaps enough people complained...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Cell value less than 0.05 = Green</p>
<p>Cell value between 0.05 &amp; 0.1 = Yellow</p>
<p>Cell value greature than 0.1 = Red</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, this would work if I was just formatting some cells but I need to compare the cells against another set of cells.&nbsp; then format in the way above depending on what the difference is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, If English SEND pupils working below target is 53.3% and overall English pupils working below target is 54.6% then the difference is 1.2%.&nbsp; So rather that add extra columns to first do the calculation difference I wanted to do this and format
 the cell in one go.&nbsp; If this is even possible!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this makes sense!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>OK, try this;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this example C4 is&nbsp;<span>pupils working below target is 53.3% and C4 is&nbsp;</span>English pupils working below target is 54.6%.&nbsp; Select the data you want to apply these formula's
 as conditional formatting</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF((D4-C4)&gt;0.1,1,0) - Red</p>
<p>=IF((D4-C4)&lt;0.05,1,0) - Green</p>
<p>=IF((D4-C4)&gt;=0.05,1,0) - Yellow</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you may need to apply the same formulas but with negative values to ensure you capture both values.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t F4 work to search an open e-mail in Outlook 2013&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, I already found <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-outlook/is-it-possible-to-remap-ctrl-f-in-outlook-to-find/e3ac9f73-58c5-4365-b52a-6e92ced8f468">
this post</a> explaining that ctrl+f does not do a find in Outlook. That post gives a list of the other keyboard shortcuts that Outlook does have. One of those is (supposedly) F4 to do a find. F3 does a search of messages, but F4 is supposed to find text. I
 have a long e-mail open (visible in the right-side pane). I want to find text in that e-mail. I hit F4. Nothing happens. I try typing. The status bar at the bottom says "This modification is not allowed because the selection is locked." A search of the web
 keeps pointing me toward F4. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I actually find text in an open e-mail? </p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I tagged this question as "Outlook.com" because "Outlook" isn't an option in the Category list, but I'm actually using the installed Outlook on my desktop, not a website. If this were a website, ctrl+f would be the browser's Find... and I wouldn't be
 having this problem. </p>

            <p>Outlook itself is not in the Category list, but Office is and since Outlook 2013 is a part of Office 2013 (or Office 365), you'll find it there. I moved your post to the correct forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you missed this link in the thread you cited:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Keyboard-shortcuts-for-Microsoft-Outlook-2013-and-2016-3e1090f6-a616-42db-abf5-269ca3d553ee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Keyboard-shortcuts-for-Microsoft-Outlook-2013-and-2016-3e1090f6-a616-42db-abf5-269ca3d553ee</a>.
 This gives a complete list of the keyboard accelerators for Outlook 2013 and 2016. F4 is mentioned in that list as searching in an open item. It does work, but be sure to open the item (i.e., double click a message to open it in its own window) first, since
 F4 searches in open items.</p>

            <p>I saw that link, but I clearly didn't understand what it meant. Perhaps you should change "Search for text within an open item" to instead say "Search for text within an item that is open in its own window, not just viewed in a pane. Just because you can
 read it doesn't mean it is 'open' in our parlance." ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad there's a workaround, but, really, this is dumb. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My company had me stuck on Lotus Notes for 15 years. I looked forward to moving to a good e-mail program. Oddities with ctrl+f are exactly why I was eager to leave Lotus Notes (ctrl+f worked as find, but it had its own mystical incantations). Please don't
 make me long for the old days! I hope that this gets fixed soon (unlikely given how old this bug is) or that you add keyboard shortcut mapping (seems like a better place to pin my hopes).</p>

</p><p>F4 does not search within an open contact (notes) in Outlook 2016, as it did in 2013 and earlier. &nbsp;F4 does search within open emails, but not contacts. &nbsp;Have you heard this, or is my copy of Outlook 16 bad? &nbsp;I cannot find any simple way to search for content
 within the open contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Followed your link to the MS shortcuts, but they simply say F4 works "within open items", which is not true for me. &nbsp;Very frustrating.</p>

<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>I'm using Windows 10, in practice, from build 10074 and used the builds 10122, 10130, 10162 and 10240 now, and since the 10130 version there is a serious problem of memory leak in the kernel, and one that has only one remedy
 and no solution.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>It takes place approximately as follows: placing the wallpaper of the desktop as a slide, no matter how many images or the interval between them or how to fill, after an hour or two the System process will start to allocate memory,
 usually it It stagnates between 240MB and 330mb, being much, and it is normal for between 24mb and 100mb, but in some cases it may take up to 1,1gb and at worst it allocates all available physical memory, freezes, the computer shows the blue screen of death
 and restarts.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>I did several tests in almost all builds I used, researched in various forums on the Internet to find that the source was the wallpaper, and thought it had been fixed, because we are in build 10240 and this problem date of build
 10130 But it was not. The only remedy for this is to use a still image or solid color, making it the System process remains at acceptable levels of memory consumption.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Additionally, this problem is more common in users of AMD graphics cards, although they also occur in the nVidia user, but more rarely, which suggests that the problem is in Windows, also as in Windows 8.1 and 7 , I wore before
 that, it never happened.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>My argument comes down to this: there is a memory leak problem in the kernel, a problem caused by the slide of use as wallpaper, and the only remedy is not to use slide as wallpaper, and happens mostly in users of video cards

<p>Hi Phonehacker, thanks for the response.</p>
<p>My model - Nokia 6800</p>
<p>Only problem is keypad related (only when unflipped) - Z key responds as Y and Y responds as Z, some special characters respond with symbols that aren't what&nbsp;is printed on the keypads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought it from Germany, it's QWERTY keypad, but responds as QWERTZ.</p>
<p>I think they updated the firmware to respond as QWERTZ (as how the keyboards are in Germany)</p>
<p>My local service center will not do repairs on my unit (no international warranty)</p>

<p>
</p><p>This was partially helpful, I downloaded updates and see that there is a grammar checker now. What is currently missing is the percentage of the text that is written in the passive voice, so is there a solution of getting that readability statistic or do
 I need to revert to Windows 2013 that may in the community suggest as a work around?</p>

            There is a new blue icon that starts Spartan. A blue square with a white world symbol inside as opposed to the IE icon. If you are starting a link from email, for example, it may go and start IE instead of Spartan. I haven't found how to set as default
 yet but i'm sure it will come down the road. Spartan is only a partial so far.

            <p>My build 10049 was a total failure. I had no Spartan, no Notifications, no Start Menu (could right click).</p>
<p>Therefore no way to get to Settings, Recovery to rollback.</p>
<p>Finally went back to 9926 for now. Will wait for the iso.</p>

<p>Hi Ted_512,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your case, may I confirm the following information with you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>When you said Exchange connected Outlook 365 for Mac, do you mean the impacted account is an Office 365 account and setting up on Outlook for Mac?</li><li>Does this issue only occurs on specific received emails, are all of the received emails impacted?</li><li>Please go to <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>, check the emails whether they are still duplicated On OWA.</li><li>What version of Outlook you are using? Please make sure it is up-to-date. Meanwhile, if you are using Outlook 2011 for MAC, please check this article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2434502/duplicate-email-messages-appear-in-outlook-for-mac-2011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Strange problem with adding checkboxes down column using VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kw_akn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange problem with adding checkboxes down column using VBA</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a workbook that used to work great, now it has an unusual problem. Here is some background:</p>
<p>The workbook has a macro that does several things and then saves the file. One of the things it does is run a loop to check for entries in a certain column, and if it finds an entry, it adds a checkbox to column A in that row. The checkboxes used to be added
 perfectly centered in&nbsp;each cell&nbsp;by using the code ActiveSheet.CheckBoxes.Add(c.Left, c.Top, c.Width, c.Height).Select.</p>
<p>The problem:</p>
<p>Now when this macro runs, the checkboxes are for some reason getting vertically&nbsp;spaced a shorter distance between each other than the height of the rows, causing them to slowly get higher and higher in the cell. Eventually, the checkbox is added so high
 that it is actually in the cell above the one it was added to!!</p>
<p>The rows are all .rowheight = 24, the cells never move or change size, the workbook never changes (it is a template that gets saved as a different filename once populated). And like I said, the checkboxes used to get added correctly. I even put this code
 into a new workbook and it worked as expected, centering the checkboxes vertically even when the rows were all different heights!</p>
<p>Between it working and not, I added some shapes to the form, and maybe somehow this has caused a problem? Here is my loop:</p>
<p>....................................................</p>
<p>dim c as range</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each c In Range("A18", "A116").Cells<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If c(1, 2).Value &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.CheckBoxes.Add(c.Left, c.Top, c.Width, c.Height).Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Selection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .LinkedCell = c(1, 49).Address<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Display3DShading = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .PrintObject = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Characters.Text = ""<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next</p>
<p>................................................</p>
<p>Any thought on why this would suddenly stop working the way it should?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

<p>Just a complete guess...</p>
<p>Do you have the zoom factor at 100%?&nbsp; </p>
<p>If no, try changing to 100% and retest your macro.</p>

Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a workbook that used to work great, now it has an unusual problem. Here is some background:<br />
<br />
The workbook has a macro that does several things and then saves the file. One of the things it does is run a loop to check for entries in a certain column, and if it finds an entry, it adds a checkbox to column A in that row. The checkboxes used to be added
 perfectly centered in each cell by using the code ActiveSheet.CheckBoxes.Add(c.Left, c.Top, c.Width, c.Height).Select.<br />
<br />
The problem:<br />
<br />
Now when this macro runs, the checkboxes are for some reason getting vertically spaced a shorter distance between each other than the height of the rows, causing them to slowly get higher and higher in the cell. Eventually, the checkbox is added so high that
 it is actually in the cell above the one it was added to!!<br />
<br />
The rows are all .rowheight = 24, the cells never move or change size, the workbook never changes (it is a template that gets saved as a different filename once populated). And like I said, the checkboxes used to get added correctly. I even put this code into
 a new workbook and it worked as expected, centering the checkboxes vertically even when the rows were all different heights!<br />
<br />
Between it working and not, I added some shapes to the form, and maybe somehow this has caused a problem? Here is my loop:<br />
<br />
....................................................<br />
<br />
dim c as range<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Each c In Range("A18", "A116").Cells<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If c(1, 2).Value &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveSheet.CheckBoxes.Add(c.Left, c.Top, c.Width, c.Height).Select<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With Selection<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .LinkedCell = c(1, 49).Address<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Display3DShading = True<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .PrintObject = False<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Characters.Text = ""<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End With<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next<br />
<br />
................................................<br />
<br />
Any thought on why this would suddenly stop working the way it should?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

<p>Great guess&nbsp;Dave, that was the problem! I somehow got just slightly away from 100% zoom while&nbsp;modifying the worksheet and didn't even notice.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;this is why I don't like working with&nbsp;Excel... lol. It just has a wierd way of doing things sometimes. Why would the checkboxes get added at&nbsp;a different&nbsp;zoom factor&nbsp;than what&nbsp;the worksheet is currently at? Strange.</p>
<p>Well that's what seperates the rookies from the pro's I guess. Knowledge and experience. Knowing this now, I will definitely add some code like OssieMac's&nbsp;suggestion&nbsp;to make sure the sheet is at 100% zoom when the checkboxes get added.</p>
<p>Thank you both for your help. Cheers!</p>

    <title>changing SMS messaging display options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zclubber462  say:</h3>
<h2>            changing SMS messaging display options</h2>
                    When I receive an SMS message from somebody that is in my contacts, it only displays the contact name, but not which phone number the message was sent from. This is a problem with any contact that has multiple phone numbers, i.e. a married couple where
 one number is listed under "mobile" and the second is listed under "car". Is there a way to change the display options so it shows the contact name and which of that contact's phone numbers the message is from?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />

            Yeah, I tested it, and it will reply to the number that the original message came from, but when I tap the name, it only highlights whatever the last number is that I used. Not helpful for incoming messages, though. It seems like it should be simply to
 change. Maybe a registry setting?<br />

<h2>            Account hacked and Im locked out. Hacker is trying to use it to get money</h2>
                    I have an old skype account i havent used for years. It was hacked today and password was changed and I was locked out of it. I cant reset the password because the form you fill in asks questions i can no longer answer and it refuses my requests, I see
 this is a serious issue that keeps happening to skype customers. I tried live chat and they were useless, can somebody please help in getting this account suspended or shut down. It seems I am powerless to stop this hacker keeping my account and using it for
 whatever they want!

<p>
</p><p>I definitely understand where you are coming from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if your account has been hacked, the system will definitely restrict it automatically, you can assure that even the hacker will not be able to access it,&nbsp;and the only option for you to recover it is through answering the recovery form and pass the
 verification process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the account cannot be deleted, one, we do not have an option to delete accounts anymore and second, you need to recover your account to process the deletion manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will assume it is safe but what I dont understand is the account has definitely been changed into the hackers email address and mine was removed and they then altered the password? Which suggest they did access it? I have email threads showing this process,
 i havent seen any emails in the last 24hrs where attempts for adding funds have been made but Im still worried they may happen again and i did receive one email saying that the auto recharge is suspended because the monthly limit has been reached, the email
 is addressed to the hackers name but comes through on my email (maybe these emails are spam but the address it came from seems legitimate)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To ensure your billing information's safety, I highly suggest to contact your bank and have the payment method, which is saved on your Skype account be blocked and advise them that if there are charges that will be addressed to that account, it should be
 blocked as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you attempt to still recover your account, you can still try it by answering the recover form:

            I assume that you must have tried something to install the font because otherwise a few files in the 8GB memory wouldn't affect the way the phone works.<br />
<br />
In which case, resetting the phone ought to fix the problem.<br />
<br />
There's a reset on start up key combination. Basically, you hold down 3 keys when you start up the phone and it puts it into a reset. Unfortunately, I can't remember the 3 keys - green, 3 and something else. A quick search on the board should find it though
 - it gets mentioned a few times every day.

            THANKS..BUT THE PHONE DOES NOT BOOT. I TRIED THOSE THREE KEYS ALSO.. I ALSO FEAR ITS IN THE MEMORY CARD AND IF I FLASH IT OR FORMAT OR UPDATE THE FIRMWARE IT WILL DO IN THE PHONE ONLY AND IT WILL TAKE THE FONT FROM THE MASS MEMORY AGAIN AND STOP BOOTING..
 I CREATED A FOLDER RESOURCE AND PUT FONTS FOLDER INSIDE IT.. I MUST DELETE THAT FOR MY PHONE TO BOOT. WILL FLASHING OR FORMATTING DO THE MASS MEMORY ALSO.

            what Patc recommended is the only way you can format the phone in your case<br />
1- turn off device<br />
2- hold down ( 3 + * + green)<br />
3- while holding the 3 buttons , press down power to start the device.<br />
4- don't release the 3 buttons until the nokia logo appears.<br />
5- wait for the device to start, if properly formatted it should ask you to enter date and time.<br />
6- if it failed try again, as you might have released the buttons too early.<br />
<br />
use of font changing softwares as fountrouter and others is not recommended in phones that do not have a removable memory card. these softwares hog the memory that the fonts are placed in , so in your case they prevent boot up. while in other devices with removable
 memory card they prevent access to the memory card in data transfer mode.<br />
<br />
let me remind you that formatting the phone will erase everything on your phone. if the 3 button manoeuvre recommended, then your only other alternative is to take the phone to the nearest nokia care point for reflashing. sorry for that.<br />
