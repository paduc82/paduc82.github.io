<h2>            Change the author name for new documents not fully true</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Was looking to know how to change the 'authors' default to something else.</p>
<p>Going to a microsoft.com page [or many other websites] will give you the following how-to:
</p>
<p>1-<span>&nbsp; </span>Click the Microsoft Office Button image, and then click Word Options.</p>
<p>2-<span>&nbsp; </span>Click Popular.</p>
<p>3-<span>&nbsp; </span>Under Personalize your copy of Office, type the author name in the User name box.</p>
<p>But what that does is actually change the title it does not change the authors (yes, plural, to be explained)</p>
<p>Assuming you did the above: When you right-click on the file icon and go to Properties you will find in the 'Details' tab that the name you placed in no. 3 above comes out as 'Title' (in other words, Title<span>&nbsp;
</span>TheNameYouPut. And under Origin you'll see 'Authors' (in plural) and next to it the name of your computer name and not 'TheNameYouPut". (And 'last Saved by' yet another name. So how does one change it so that all 3 are the same name 1- title -2- authors
 -3-last saved by</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Mich</p>

            HI<br />
Thanks for your link and your help but did u not notice that the link you provided is exactly where I took my 3 points above (Cut and pasted from that exact page)? The results is what I wrote and not what I want. If you have the time I'd appreciate it if you
 read my question again and see if you have a solution.<br />
Thanks again<br />

            Are you checking&nbsp; the properties in new documents?&nbsp; ---I notice that, although, the identity of the author of revisions and comments changes in the current document, the doc properties don't-- And I was surprised to see that the author property in new
 docs did change.&nbsp; (Learn something new.... )<br />
<br />
None of my author changes in Word Options changed anything but the author doc property (in new docs).<br />
<br />
If you want to change the&nbsp; properties of current documents, look at the last set if instructions that&nbsp; Chandra referred you to (enter doc properties and change the information there).<br />

            Take a look in Office button / Prepare command / Properties command.&nbsp; This will display a "Document Properties" bar below the ribbon. You will be able to Change the Author and title.
<br />
<br />
I don't know of any way of changing the default for those properties. I tried recording a macro, but it didn't pick up anything<br />

Are you talking about Authors captured by Track changes?&nbsp; Here are bunch of track changes related tips: http://wordribbon.tips.net/C0741_Track_Changes.html<br />

            Hi Pam. Thanks to you as well. What do you mean by, "Are you checking&nbsp; the properties in new documents?"&nbsp; As opposed to what 'old documents' I don't understand. In going through the steps above everything happens exactly as i wrote. (In right-clicking
 and going to 'Properties' of a doc file Not within Word itself but an icon within a folder in Explorer). What you get is the name you placed above under 'title' and not under 'authors'.<br />
And as far as going through the last point, <br />
" 1. Click the <b>Microsoft Office Button</b> , point to <b>
Prepare</b>, and then click <b>Properties</b>.<br />
2. In the Document Information Panel, type the author name in the <b>
Author</b> box.<br />
In such a place there is a name already there, the same name that appears under 'title' as mentioned above, and not 'Authors'<br />
<br />
In case I am still not explaining myself this is what I mean.<br />
-1- Go to Windows Explorer (or place a search for any word document)<br />
-2- Choose the document (represented by an icon within your folder)<br />
If this document is a shortcut to your document and not the document itself then<br />
-3- Right-click this document (icon) and choose 'Properties'<br />
A window will pop up with 5 tabs (General, Shortcut, Security, Details, Previous versions)<br />
-4- You will not see 'author' anywhere but you will see 'Owner". Besides 'owner' you will NOT see the name you placed for author (above) but rather the name of your pc. In my case it says, "user-PC\user<br />
However, this is not what I am referring to either it has just been added for a reason<br />
now if you do steps 1,2 and 3 above but this time do NOT choose a shortcut but rather an actual word document itself and then choose properties' you will again see 5 tabs--different tabs to the above (general, Security, Custom,Details,Previous Versions)<br />
If you click on the Details tab you will not see what you wrote under 'Start, Word Options popular, Personalize your copy of Microsoft but rather either the name such as Mich-PC (in my case) or the name seen in the shortcut example above.&nbsp; You will see this
 under 'Authors" (And why it's plural is beyond me) and under 'last saved by', And yes this may be the name placed under "Prepare' tab 'Document Properties.<br />
But this change will only do so for the current document and not for all our documents.<br />
<br />
Thanks again and sorry for the length<br />

No, I'm not referring to "Authors captured by Track changes". I'm referring to going to a doc file in Explorer, right-clicking, going to Properties and then going to the 'Details' tab. There under the heading 'Authors' is what I mean.<br />

            The instruction you followed and quoted in your first message were for changing "the author name for
<b>new</b> documents". &nbsp; It does not change the author name property for the document you are in, although it does change the reviewer name for tracked changes and comments. New documents will have that new author property and the reviewer. &nbsp; But existing documents
 will not be affected. I've changed the&nbsp;author&nbsp;property today in W2010, 2007, and 2003 and did not see any change to the title property and so can't comment on that.
<div><br />
<div>Even with the unexpected behavior when you change the author in doc properties from within Word, &nbsp;everything seems to be working as described in the
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/change-the-author-name-for-documents-HA010024061.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Help&nbsp;and&nbsp;How To</a>. &nbsp;But that doesn't mean your problem is solved. So, please tell us what you want. Do you want to change the author property in a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;document, in new&nbsp;documents, or in all documents in a folder or on your computer? &nbsp;</div>

            Hi Pam<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping me again and for such a great clear question. <br />
Basically I noticed that when going to a file (in windows explorer), right-clicking and choosing 'Properties' and then going to the 'Details' tab and then looking next to the "Authors" area, in some cases it has my full name, as I want. In other cases it has
 only my 1st name, which I do not want, or the computer name, which I also don't want.<br />
hence I want to change the 'authors' where I dont have my full name as my full name.<br />
<br />
thank you<br />
<br />
M<br />

            Hi Suzanne,<br />
Yes, the bottom line is indeed that Windows Properties are not the same as Word Properties. But since somehow, "Windows Properties" does have my full name while others not means that at some point someone, it would have to be me, somehow placed the name there,
 knowingly or not. So "how does one get the name you want there?" Is how my question grew.<br />

<h2>            My last saved 2010 Publisher Doc won&#39;t open, Error 110009</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>Yesterday, I spent about 6 +hours on a project I'm writing in Publisher 2010. I'm a tech writer and the work involves a lot of concept &amp; design work along with the text and I completed about 2 .5, very detailed pages before saving
 and closing it for the day. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I went to the latest saved version and when I tried to open it, it said "Publisher Cannot Open File". I clicked Ctrl+Shft+I and got Error 110009 as the culprit. Every previously saved version of my document does open with no
 problem. I save each variation at the end of the work day with a slight file name change such as "New Manual A", New Manual B", New Manual B1", etc..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did notice that in all my previous saved documents as well as all of the ones I’ve saved and opened with no problem since that “Bad File”, had one extra tab in the properties dialog box that the “Bad one” doesn’t have!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean, if I right click and select “Properties” on any of my other Publisher files I’ve saved, the box opens with 5 tab selections: General, Security, Custom, Details, &amp; Previous Versions. But the Bad file is missing the “Custom”
 tab. I don’t know what that may mean but it may help someone figure out this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have gone to the Uninstall Programs and clicked "Change"/"Repair" after selecting MS Office Pro Plus 2010 and let it do its thing with no success.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two computers with the same exact O/S and MS Office Pro Plus 2010 is on both. I tried to open the Publisher document on the other computer after transferring it over DropBox but it failed there as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the hotfixes for this error are for Office 2007 and they are not recommended for any other versions than those specifically listed, (per Microsoft). But I’m almost ready to try it. I have it ready to download but I’d rather not
 use it if there’s another possible way to recover it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may help to know that I design and save "building blocks" to recover using the Page Parts when I need them. I read something about possible corruption cases involving some incorrectly constructed and/or saved building blocks but
 I don’t know if I understood that right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe someone can tell me where Office saves its ‘safety-backup’ versions of documents that are being worked on? I have Publisher set to save a backup once every 10 minutes but I don’t know where it puts them! If it was possible to
 retrieve the 10 minute backups, I could maybe recover 90% of the work I did yesterday but I have a feeling this can’t be done…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks, Rich</p>
<p>&nbsp;O/S Windows 7 64bit, MS Office 2010 Pro Plus, Internet Explorer Browser is deactivated and has been for almost a year so I don’t have that running. I use Google Chrome.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe someone can tell me where Office saves its ‘safety-backup’ versions of documents that are being worked on? I have Publisher set to save a backup once every 10 minutes but I don’t know where it puts them! If it was possible to retrieve the 10 minute
 backups, I could maybe recover 90% of the work I did yesterday but I have a feeling this can’t be done…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks, Rich</p>

Excellent documentation and backup procedures, I must say. The only thing I do different is to save&nbsp;work after every hour or so instead of the end of the work session.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must also say that I have no good ideas of how to fix the problem. You might reference the proposed 'fixes' in this thread:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you save the file locally or on a network drive or some other external drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that you cannot open the file on either computer suggests that the file has gone corrupt in some way. I am not hopeful but I would be happy to try to open your file if you want to post it somewhere for download.</p>

Sorry, I am not more helpful. One more idea:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Type %temp% in the address bar in Windows Explorer, find&nbsp;a recent&nbsp;file with the pub prefix, change the .tmp extension to .pub, try opening the file...or</div>
<div>1. Go to the start menu and type in "run"<br />
2. Open up "run"<br />
3. Type in %temp%</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>At least this way you might find an old temp file with the work you did.</div>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A folder opened (...Username/Local/temp), and because this problem occurred on the 13th, I figured I should focus on those folders.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are many but only 7 dated 12-13-13. of that, 4 are named "scoped_dirxxx_xxx" (where the X's represent some numbers), 2 named "Photoshopcrashes"

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;The "Scoped" folders all have 2 folders inside named "AppCache" &amp; "Local Storage" for which are all empty, and then they also have several
 files named "data_0" through "data_5" and each has one file named and "index".</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I don't see any publisher prefixes in any of the names of any folders or files. I went on down farther and searched through a number of 'loose'

============================================<br />
If you wish to pursue changing the extensions...the following <br />
free utility can easily and quickly accomplish that on a large <br />
batch of files very quickly.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Bulk Rename Utility<br />
<a href="http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Download.php</a><br />

Bulk Rename Utility Tutorial<br />
<a href="http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Tutorial.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Tutorial.php</a><br />
<br />
The task is easier to do than it is to explain. I would<br />
suggest that you create copies to experiment with <br />
just to familiarize yourself with the interface.<br />
<br />
Download and install the utility...(you can uncheck...<br />
'Install Windows Explorer Extension' and 'Install<br />
Samples')<br />
<br />
Once installed...open the program and in the top left<br />
pane...drill down to the folder your files are saved in.<br />
<br />
When you select the folder...the file names should<br />
appear in the top right pane. (You'll notice...there is a<br />
'Name' column and a 'New Name' column...so you<br />
can see the changes that will be applied.<br />
<br />
First...go to...Actions / Select All...(you will not see<br />
the changes and you cannot rename unless the files<br />
are selected/highlighted)<br />
<br />
In the 'Extensions (11)' section of the screen...open<br />
the drop window and choose 'Fixed'...now type PUB<br />
in the blank field.<br />
<br />
When the New Name column looks correct...left click<br />
the 'Rename' button...then...OK / OK.<br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />

I would look at one of your .pub files and see what size that file is and try to find a temp file that is of similar size. After I put '%temp%' in 'run' and generate the temp folder I click at the top of the file size column which puts all the files in order
 by file size. That makes it easy to scroll&nbsp;through the temp files&nbsp;to find the ones that are the right size. I assume that you have your computers set up to show the file extensions? If so then&nbsp;you can just right click the file and rename it with the .pub extensions
 rather than the .tmp extension.</p>

            Hi Richard,
<br />Can you provide the SQL view of a query that doesn't work? Are there any parameter prompts or filters on the query?

<p>Duane, thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I found the issue with more searching.&nbsp; It was the issue of Excel not recognizing the "*" wildcard in the Access criteria.&nbsp; I had to change the setting in Access to make it use SQL (ANSI 92) standard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those "non-SQL" folks, perhaps MS could put an option in Excel such as "Work with Native Access Wildcards".</p>

<h2>            Bug&#58; png turns all white randomly</h2>
                    <p>Hi out there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a very specific problem which happend to me with PowerPoint (2013 &amp; 2016).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use png icons with transparent background from the noun project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I import them into powerpoint (by dragging and dropping them from my downloads), which makes for a black icon like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf361717-354a-4adc-bca5-72050306e17f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf361717-354a-4adc-bca5-72050306e17f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I want it to be white to go nicely on my dark background. So i follow the steps:</p>
<p>1. Right-click on image</p>
<p>2. Format picture...</p>
<p>3. Select tab picture</p>
<p>4. Picture corrections</p>
<p>5. Set brightness to 100% which makes it come out white nicely like that</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e48b98e-d23d-46e7-9e01-0c1864f8878d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e48b98e-d23d-46e7-9e01-0c1864f8878d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the ppt. some time in the future, randomly some of my icons are shown like that:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0456e165-f42e-4a2c-aa23-45b65e2d20b7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0456e165-f42e-4a2c-aa23-45b65e2d20b7" /></a></p>
<p>Which is, as you understand, very annoying as I have to redo the whole thing before converting the powerpoint into a pdf, where it then stays the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some hints as to what is NOT the source of the problem:</p>
<p>- It happens to several people that I know with different versions of powerpoint</p>
<p>- It happens when using the same computer or different ones. In the office we use dropbox and the picture shows white independent of os &amp; ppt version</p>
<p>- It happens as well when the file is stored locally and not in Dropbox</p>
<p>- It doesn't happen to all icons treated this way at once, it only happens to some of them some time within the presentation</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be glad for any hints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simon</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Please don't answer with workarounds to fix broken images, I have found some. But I still don't want to check every presentation for this error periodically. If you have another way of making icons turn white, you can tell me this (but not the recolor
 option in the format tab, as I can't change the colors to select without changing the theme).</p>

            <p>Drag/Dropping things into PowerPoint can sometimes cause odd problems, and even problems that appear on some systems but not others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely that's not the case here, but as a general best practice, it's a good idea to Insert | Picture rather than mess with dragondroppings.&nbsp; And it's worth trying that with the same picture files to see if it makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in case there's something odd about the PNG that PPT isn't handling correctly, try opening it in an image editor (whatever MS supplies with your version of Windows or the free IrfanView) and resaving to a new file name as PNG.&nbsp; Then Insert | Picture
 and choose the new file.&nbsp; Again, see if it fares any better than the ones you've been using.&nbsp; If so, you have a workaround, if not a real solution.</p>

<p>Either or...</p>
<p>In VBA it doesn't make a difference.&nbsp; But IMHO, it is simply best practice to always put it in.&nbsp; That way no matter what you are workig on query, vba, you know it will work.</p>
<p>Also, if you are troubleshooting you vba and copy/paste your sql statement... it avoids you having to remember to add the ; at the end....</p>
<p>Best to put it in!</p>

<p>In my experience, Access doesn't require the semi-colon in queries either. It is, of course, required by other DBMS (such as SQL Server) which allow multiple queries to be run sequentially.</p>

<h2>            get older version powerpivot &#40;version 10.50.2500.0&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I had released my excel 2010 with PowerPivot version 10.50.2500.0 previously to my customers&nbsp;and&nbsp;with a system upgrade I installed the&nbsp;PowerPivot version&nbsp;11.0.3000.0 which is the latest form the website for Excel 2010.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now with a new release of my excel to my customers they are complaining about compatibility issues. Any advice on how to revert back to the old version on my machine? I am not able to find the PowerPivot version 10.50.2500.0.

<h2>            Pivot chart automatically adds markers when clicking slicer</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a pivot chart with a few slicers set up in Excel 2010. I set it up as a basic line chart (without markers), and I would like to keep it this way. However, when I click on one or another of my slicers, more often than not, Excel automatically adds
 markers on one or some or all of my lines, and I have to manually change the chart type back from Line with Markers to Line. How do I get Excel to stop doing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            N73 keeps crashing and loading up photo albumn</h2>
                    
<p>I sent my old N73 away for repair, got a return and didn't check it thoroughly as I had a new phone to play with.</p>
<p>How ever once the warranty expired I gave the&nbsp;N73 in question to my wife, we noticed that the phone wont take pictures or record films, even with having a 500mb memory card in it. Also it keeps loading up pictures off of the memory card, ie in albumn mode
 on its own and keeps crashing and turning itself off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have loaded on again the latest updates from Nokia but the phone is still acting in this manor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions??</p>

<h2>            Junk Email - New Outlook Mail - rules and Safe senders ignored</h2>
                    <p>I have my bank's email domain in my safe senders list but the mail still goes to Junk. When I open the mail it says its a trusted sender. What do I have to do to stop outlook from ignoring my rules and trusted sender list! How do I get it to stop putting
 my mail into junk before applying the rules etc - this is clearly what is happening.</p>
<p>All started suddenly when my account changed to OUTLOOK MAIL. I am a long time hotmail user and would sincerely like to remain this way but having the bulk of my rules and safe senders list ignored is making the tool more trouble than its worth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm running through my Safari web browser on a MAC - I do not have outlook local to my machine.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, I suggest you to remove all the rules which who have created in your Email account. Now, recreate the rules for your incoming Emails and check if it
 resolves the issue. </span></p>

            <p>Ok that's all well and good. </p>
<p>However how am I supposed to recreate rules for things that go into my Junk folder. The Rules interface specifically says inbox rules. If the system will not let anything into my inbox then it seems like none of the rules will be applied. Is this a correct
 assumption?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking at my outlook mail through Firefox as well but I fail to see how a different browser will make a difference. Perhaps you can explain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way all communication from the Microsoft Community is being marked as spam (!) I've put the address in my contacts to see if the messages will appear in my inbox.</p>
<p>Will let you know what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just and FYI I have my filter set to Exclusive.</p>

<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/two-step-verification-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
two-step verification</a>, some apps (like the mail apps on some phones) or devices (like an Xbox 360 or Windows Phone) will show an incorrect password error because they can't prompt you to enter a security code when you try to sign in.
<p>If you've turned on two-step verification and you see an incorrect password error with an app or device, you'll need to get and enter a unique
<span>app password</span> to sign in. Once you've signed in with your app password, you're all set to use that app or device. You'll need to create and sign in with a new app password for each app or device that can't prompt you for a security
 code. </p>
<p>The steps for generating a new app password are always the same:</p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=263779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Sign in</a>, and sign in with your Microsoft account.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under <span>App passwords</span>, tap or click <span>
Create a new app password</span>. </p>
<p>A new app password is generated and appears on your screen. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter this app password where you would enter your normal password.</p>
<p>Repeat these steps to get a different password for every app or device that needs an app password.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>The way you enter an app password can be slightly different, however, depending on the app or device you're trying to sign in to. Several of the most common ones are listed here. Tap or click the ones that apply to you.</p>

<h2>            Links in &#34;Files&#34; &#40;aka Sharepoint&#41; change when they are moved</h2>
                    <p>I have a question about the links that are created to a folder or single asset in the "Files" part of Planner. This is also labeled Sharepoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As we start to get more assets (Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, imagery), I began to create a simple taxonomy for our folders. I couldn't have everything top level! Simply put, I started to move things around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realized that if I moved something that had been shared as a link, such as in Planner, that link was now dead. This concern could apply to the Notebook, too. I've shared pages and notebooks within Planner and with individuals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: is there a way to keep the URL for folders, assets, notebooks and pages so that even if they are moved within the front-end interface, the shared URL doesn't break?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Laurafu318,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you share files with others, they only get a valid permission to the files and a link of the files location. But when you move the files to other locations, the previous links will not
 work anymore. You may need to re-share the files. Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,<br />
Ran</span></p>

            <p>Ran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I understand the limitations of the tool, I'll have to figure out how to prevent broken links by either not sharing or not organizing content. When you start with an empty folder, you don't know what taxonomy you'll have yet, so I can't promise
 restructuring to the folder hierarchy won't be necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other DAMs I've built or used have permanent links to files. I know a DAM is a much more professional and dynamic tool that Office 365 is intended to be, but that would be an extremely useful functionality, especially since there is the ability to link within
 Planner directly to other modules. It would only be right to keep users within Office 365 (as opposed to, say, using Dropbox or Box.com to link their files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Laura</p>

            <p>Ran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow-up question. In regards to this work-around, is there a way to see where a link has been used within Office 365? Like a reverse CMS look-up, so that I know what links need to be updated. If the link to an asset or folder is generated within Office
 365 and then added to a Planner task or OneNote notebook, it would be great if there's a way for the Office 365 system to identify where those have been added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I have a policy form as a Word doc in Files/Sharepoint. We have a task in Planner related to editing this policy, and a direct link, created in Office 365, has been added as a link in the Planner task. Within a week, we have other versions of
 the forms, from different departments and affiliates, so I create a folder in Files called "Policy Forms", and place everything, including the first linked files, in there. Would the Planner task know it's moved? Or would the file show where the auto-generated
 link lives in Office 365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Laura</p>

            This is pretty much a standard for a cloud storage service and for it not to be supported in a supposedly "enterprise" solution is a joke. Does Msft have any clue how the real world works? This needs to be addressed immediately.

<p><span>Sorry about my wrong information above. According to my further testing, the sharing links are still working if I move the files to another folder. So, could you please let me know how the

            <p>Ran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to replicate this issue that had occurred at least 3 times in the first 2 weeks of our using this new tool. Since I'd been instructed to correct the broken links on those affected, I have already done that, and I do not recall which ones I had
 to correct. Therefore, I'm unable to backtrack to investigate the specifics of those broken links.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I repeated the same steps that I've used since I started using this tool to share Files links 2-3 weeks ago, and the links are working as of now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here my steps to replicate:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Add/Drop a file or create a new document in Files (I added a jpg file and also created a new online Word document)</p>
<p>2. Click the circle to the left of the file and select "Create Link" from the top nav bar</p>
<p>3. Select and copy the link that is automatically generated</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cd714578-59f7-42f1-9537-aa827dfb93b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cd714578-59f7-42f1-9537-aa827dfb93b2" /></a></p>
<p>4. Go to a task in Planner</p>
<p>5. Click "Link" and copy the URL in</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/202d17a9-1e59-4737-92ab-7dec0f85af23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/202d17a9-1e59-4737-92ab-7dec0f85af23" /></a></p>
<p>6. The link saves</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what happened the first several times I changed the Files taxonomy was as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Move a file or document or rename a file or document</p>
<p>2. Go to a task that had linked to it</p>
<p>3. The task showed a broken link icon and the link opened an error page</p>
<p>
</p><p>To correct this last week, I followed the prior steps to create a new link and add it to the task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>Hi Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running into a similar problem, can you help?</p>
<p>1) Here is the symptom when I click "sync" from within Sharepoint:</p>
<p><a href="https://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9993c2d9-f345-4f89-8b33-411ac7698859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9993c2d9-f345-4f89-8b33-411ac7698859" /></a></p>
<p>2) I have completely removed the OneDrive Mac Store app to the trash, before installing the Preview app.</p>
<p>3) I ran the terminal commands. &nbsp;<strong>Note that there is no preferences file com.microsoft.OneDriveUpdate.plist, but there is one called com.microsoft.OneDriveUpdater.plist
</strong>(with that extra "r"). &nbsp;Just in case, I wrote "Tier Team" to both. &nbsp;Screenshot attached.</p>
<p><a href="https://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=928d417b-38fb-45e2-ad7a-f882a3036f66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d928d417b-38fb-45e2-ad7a-f882a3036f66" /></a></p>
<p>4) I tried a different site that I have access to, but this is another subsite of the same parent; I don't have access to other sites where the "sync" button appears.</p>
<p>5) This is on Mac OS 10.10.5 and OneDrive version 17.3.6760</p>
<p>6) When I tried from Classic Sharepoint, things seemed more promising, but I just get this window that is "Calculating" forever and never enables the "start sync" button (screenshot):</p>
<p><a href="https://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=10869e51-241c-4d4e-b2a3-b9a406f3d9ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d10869e51-241c-4d4e-b2a3-b9a406f3d9ec" /></a></p>

            Hi All,<br />
<br />
The updates from the related team show that the issue will be fixed in the future.<br />
<br />
Here is a summary to seek out the information easily:<br />
<br />
=============<br />
<br />
<br />
When using the new OneDrive sync client for Mac to sync files from SharePoint document libraries, you get an error message “Sorry we can't add your folder right now. Please try again”. The OneDrive sync client for Windows doesn’t have this issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are space characters in the entire URL address of your SharePoint site. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue will be fixed in the &nbsp;future release and the solution will be available around the middle of April. Currently, you can take the following workaround.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
If the issue happens in a SharePoint subsite, you can go to Site Settings &gt; Title, description, and logo under Look and Feel section, and delete the space characters in the web site address as below:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2ca35fc-7545-4c8b-9add-d38f1ca99cf4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2ca35fc-7545-4c8b-9add-d38f1ca99cf4" /></a><br />
<br />
If the issue happens in a SharePoint root site collection, as the web site address cannot be changed after it &nbsp;is created, &nbsp;please wait for the fix.<br />
<br />
=============<br />
For affected customers to easily identify the information here, this thread will be closed. If you have any other questions, feel free to post a new thread. We will continue to assist you from there.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shirley

<h2>            updating error 0x800705b4  on lumia 640xl</h2>
                    I am trying to update my phone but after downloading and 4% complete of installation it says (every time) error 0x800705b4

            <p>I share your pain, I have a Blu win hd lte running on 10.0.1586.545 and when I try to update to the anniversary update .67 it gets stuck on 15% and I receive that same error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a soft reset with no effect. No one seems to know how to fix this, and all I can find is to do a hard reset...which I find to be absurd, because we shouldn't lose our information (or backup/restore everything) if this is window`s problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets see what happens</p>
