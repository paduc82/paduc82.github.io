    <title>Obtaining Count of Unique Students Using Slicers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pduffer212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Obtaining Count of Unique Students Using Slicers</h2>
                    <p>I'm working on a report that will utilize slicers to report enrollments, total credits, and unduplicated headcount by year and term.&nbsp; Getting the number of enrollments and total credits is easily done using pivot tables.&nbsp; However, the unduplicated headcount
 is where I'm encountering a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, my table of data contains columns similar to:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Year</td>
<td>Term</td>
<td>Subject</td>
<td>Course</td>
<td>Class Number</td>
<td>StudentID</td>
<td>Credits</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;I can count the number of StudentID's to get the number of enrollment and sum the Credits to get the total credits.&nbsp; Using slicers, I can filter the results by Year, Term, Subject, or Course.&nbsp; What I want is to be able to get a count of
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">unduplicated</span></strong> StudentIDs based on the slicers used.&nbsp; A student may be taking any number of classes in different years, terms, subjects, or courses.&nbsp; However, I want to be able to count each student
 only once.&nbsp; In my actual data I have 44,899 enrollments for 17,056 students.&nbsp; I also have a far greater number of columns than indicated above, including a total of 12 columns with slicers.&nbsp; My ultimate end results will be a chart showing the unduplicated
 headcount, total enrollments, and total credits by term for any combination of slicers used.&nbsp; I currently have everything working fine except the unduplicated headcount (number of unique student id) portion.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone can provide or direct me to information that will help me finish this I will greatly appreciate it.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Select range A1:H68 of the Data worksheet and go to Insert &gt; Pivot Table.&nbsp; Check the box there for "Add this Data to the Data Model"</p>
<p>2. Drag Term to Row labels, Student ID and Credits to the value area section to get the Pivot Table that you have already created in sheet5</p>
<p>3. Drag Student ID once again to the Value area section and right click on any number there &gt; Summarise Values By &gt; More Options &gt; Distinct Count</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            My Nokia N95 wont switch on, but the white background light comes on when charging &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    
<p>My mum only gave me this phone 2days ago as she got a new one.&nbsp; She's never had a problem with it and has kept it in a hard case so still looks brand new.&nbsp; I always have a habit of breaking or losing phones, this is 3rd one in 4months :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway I picked my phone up and it was switched off but I presumed it was dead as I had left my music playing.&nbsp; I put it on charge only for 10 minutes but i never tried switchig it on as i forgot to take it out with me.&nbsp; I put it on charge again last nite&nbsp;but
 it won't turn on this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;The screen comes up white with the battery sign on the right which stops after a minute as i assume its fully charged now. Its not the charger as&nbsp;my bf uses&nbsp;it for his and the phone does seem to be charging.&nbsp; The on button can't
 be broken as when i press it the white background comes back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried the hard reset wth the 3 * and green button but nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help, can't afford to pay to have it repaired and my mum will kill me as&nbsp; it has loads of pics and videos&nbsp; :-(</p>

<p>1. Take out the battery, leave your battery and SIM out for 5-10minutes and put everything back in and turn it on .<br />
<br />
2. Hard reset: This is the last resort. All data stored in the phone memory wil be lost. This is how you do it: Press and hold down these keys: the call (Green) button, '*', '3'. Turn on your phone without releasing them. Leave the keys only after you see the
 region selection screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might need multiple attempts to finally get it right. Try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck... Hope your mom doesn't find out what you've done with her toy :smileywink:</p>

    <title>Bi-weekly Mortgage Amortization - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> excelrocks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bi-weekly Mortgage Amortization</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create a mortgage amortization based on bi-weekly payments.&nbsp; I've tested the PMT function based on past payments and it does not charge interest correctly, or the same as interest is applied for each of my payments.&nbsp; I believe this has to do
 with the two additional payments per year that are applied directly to the pricipal.&nbsp; I'm serviceable in excel, so I fairly certain that if I can determine how many pay periods there are in any given month, I can then use that determine how many payments are
 made each month, and apply any third payment to the principal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If tomorrow is a pay day (2/3/2012) and I'm paid bi-weekly, how would I go about determining past and future pay dates and how many pay dates are in each month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<br />
That template duplicates the mistake that I presume "ExcelRocks" made when he/she complained that "the PMT function [...] does not charge interest correctly".<br />
<br />
The template incorrectly computes the biweekly period by the following paradigm:<br />
<br />
=PMT(D5/26, D6*26, -D4)<br />
<br />
where D5 is the annual interest rate, D6 is the loan term in years, and D4 is the loan amount.<br />
<br />
Although there are a variety of ways that biweekly loans are implemented, that is not one of them, AFAIK.&nbsp; There is little benefit to structuring a biweekly loan that way instead of the more common semimonthly loan.<br />
<br />
Instead, the payment for biweekly loans is usually half the monthly payment for the same loan terms.<br />
<br />
For example, for a 30-year loan of $100,000 at 6.5%, the biweekly payment is:<br />
<br />
=PMT(6.5%/12, 30*12, -100000) / 2<br />
<br />
That results in a significant savings in total interest and a shorter loan term because the total of 24 payments is the same as 12 monthly payments, but we are making 2 more payments each 12 months.<br />
<br />
That gives rise to the often-repeated, but usually incorrect statement that "the two additional payments per year are applied directly to the principal".<br />
<br />
That might be true for some implementations of biweekly loans [3].&nbsp; But generally, it is an over-simplification.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it is true that the principal is reduced significantly more quickly with most biweekly loans.&nbsp; (All but the paradigm used by the template
 that GS points to.)<br />
<br />
I believe the correct amortization of the most favorable implementation of biweekly loans would use the aforementioned payment (half the monthly payment), but charge interest at the rate of 6.5%/26 in my example.<br />
<br />
That paradigm matches the amorization schedule produced by one online calculator [1].<br />
<br />
However, it differs somewhat from the amortization schedule produced by another onlilne calculator [2].&nbsp; I am still trying to figure what variant of a biweekly loan this calculator assumes.&nbsp;
<br />
</span>For a comparison of some different implementations of biweekly loans, download "biweekly amort.xls" (<a href="http://www.box.com/s/y4hg724xcjuh6ep3jl2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here</a>) [4].<br />

<br />
<br />
The small difference between this amortization schedule and mine is due to my rounding the biweekly payment.<br />

<br />
<br />
[3] In some cases, biweekly loans involve a thirty-party who holds the biweekly payments in an account, then pays semimonthly or monthly payments to the lender, adding the 2 remaining biweekly payments to the last payment after each 12 months.&nbsp; This arrangement
 does indeed apply the last 2 biweekly payments entirely to principal.&nbsp; But this is not the most favorable implementation of a biweekly loan.<br />

<br />
[5] <span style="font-style: italic">[EDIT] Although a lender is free to calculate actual interest by any "reasonable" method in the US, they must calculate the APR for biweekly payments based on 6.5%/26 in my example, according to Appendix J of the Truth In
 Lending Act.&nbsp; I believe most lenders will calculate actual interest the same way.</span><br />

    <title>Microsoft Account Not Sending Messages&#59; Error Code&#58; -19999 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rollk1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Account Not Sending Messages&#59; Error Code&#58; -19999</h2>
                    <p>I have an IMAP email (hosted by siteground.com) linked to my Microsoft Account which gives me access to outlook.com (works fine).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Outlook desktop app I just have the IMAP account link (works fine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently changed the Outlook desktop account from IMAP to my Microsoft Account because it gives me access to the add-in store and features like "send later". It receives messages, however sent messages aren't being received by the recipient. There's also
 a few minute delay when receiving new messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the following sync log error: "Could not synchronize record: test to Exchange server: [EMAIL]", "Access is denied. Check credentials and try again., Cannot save changes made to an item to store.", "Error Code: -19999"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The credentials are correct, although it's not an exchange server. Any advice?</p>

    <title>How do I close an excel file with a syntax error in the macro&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> armanschwarz  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I close an excel file with a syntax error in the macro&#63;</h2>
                    I have an excel file called "records.xlsm", and it contains several macros that have syntax errors.<br />
<br />
Here is what happens when I try to open the file:<br />
<br />
1) I open the file,<br />
2) I click "enable content"<br />
3) I get an error message stating "Compile error: User-defined type not defined"<br />
4) I click OK and try to stop the debugger (by pressing the "stop" symbol).<br />
5) I get the same error as from step 4<br />
6) I click OK<br />
7) I try to close the debugger<br />
8) I click OK on the "This command will stop the debugger" dialog<br />
9) I get the same error as from step 4<br />
10) I force close the debugger, Excel crashes and I start all over again.<br />
<br />
How am I supposed to get out of this file, and is this intended behavior for Excel when a file has a syntax error?<br />

            Hold down the Shift key while you open the file. That will prevent automatic macros (Auto_Open or Workbook_Open) from running. You can then go into the macro editor and either fix the problem or comment out the macros until you can examine them.<br />
<br />
The most common reason for "User-defined type not defined" errors is that you haven't set references to external code files that contain the definitions of objects used in the macros. For example, if the macros use a FileSystemObject to manage files, but you
 haven't set a reference to the Microsoft Scripting Runtime, you'll get the undefined type error (VBA assumes that any type it doesn't have a definition for must be user-defined).<br />
<br />
To set a reference in the macro editor, click the Tools menu and click References in the dropdown. Put a check mark next to the name of the code file for the object(s) in the macros. If you don't know which ones to check, post the Dim statements from your macros
 and someone will help you.<br />

<h2>            No restore option after hard reset windows 8.1</h2>
                    I did a hard reset and according to the directions I should get an option to restore data. &nbsp;Nothing. I tried adding a microsoft login and that brought in my contacts and new email, but still no restore function. &nbsp;HELP, the phone is useless. And before
 anyone asks, yes the phone was backed up.

            <p>you need to have an internet connection and add the account on the initial configuration to trigger the restore from backup feature.</p>
<p>if you went through without doing it, you will need to reset the phone again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but what exactly does the backup restore have that will make the phone less "useless"? the only thing the backup restore does is automatically install some apps. which you can still do manually.</p>

<h2>            Office 2010 SP1 &#39;unnecessary save&#39; bug in Excel</h2>
                    <p><span>I create and amend my spreadsheets (.xlsx) on a desktop running 32-bit XP SP3, then copy them across the network to my laptop running 32-bit Windows 7 SP1. I have religiously followed this procedure for years, using Win 98, XP, Vista and now Windows
 7&nbsp;so that the files are always synchronised, i.e. additions and&nbsp;changes&nbsp;are only made on the desktop machine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Yesterday I installed Office 2010 SP1 (KB2460049) on the laptop and every spreadsheet I open, read and close wants to ‘save the changes’ that have been made, which, of course, there are none.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I’ve just uninstalled SP1 and, thank god, normality has returned, so it’s a definite bug.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I found it hard to believe that Office 2010 Excel SP1 couldn’t read files created on another non-SP1 machine without wanting to save them, so
 I ran a few tests. All I can deduce is that there was some ‘flag/date’ corruption that didn’t show until SP1 was installed, so I reinstalled Office 2010, followed by SP1 on the XP machine and everything is back to normal.</span></p>

</p><p>Hi Ashanti,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to the increments under Calendar appearance? If yes, only 15 and 30 minute increments are currently available in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca00d544-4d33-4a4d-ad8d-f05e009a4273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca00d544-4d33-4a4d-ad8d-f05e009a4273" height="494" width="434" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>With this in mind, we suggest that you send a feedback to the link below so that 1-hour increments will be considered in future updates in Outlook.com.</p>
<p><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Feedback.</a></p>

    <title>Dictate on MacOS Teams App Permissions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrjarbenne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dictate on MacOS Teams App Permissions</h2>
                    <p>In Microsoft Teams I've given the Microphone and Camera permission in the Chat functionality, but the Dictate button -- when attempting to use speech to text in an Word Online document -- presents a dialogue that indicates that the "browser" (the build in
 browser in the Teams App) needs permission to access my microphone. In the Privacy Settings on my laptop, the Teams app isn't available to add said permission, and it doesn't prompt for permission in the same way that video or voice chat does, so I can use
 my microphone in some spaces within Teams but not others, and can't seem to use Dictate on a Mac in Word Online within Teams.</p>

<h2>            Edge</h2>
                    I ran panda cloud in my computer, and since then I can't see images&nbsp;nor videos in edge browser; ´but the funny thing is that&nbsp;it works&nbsp;on a&nbsp;new private window. I also tried to view the advance settings but the button doesn't work, it just close the window.
 I tried re-installing edge following all the procedure (deleting the folder in package, and installing form windows PowerShell), but the problem persists.
