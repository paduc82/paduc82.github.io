<h2>            REINSTALLING Windows on an SSD</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm aware that this is a common topic, but I just wanna be assured of what am gonna do is correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have window 10 installed on my HDD, I want to move it to my SSD. I prefer a clean install rather than cloning it. I have windows on the DVD that came with the license I purchased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm gonna boot from the dvd. Once in the setup, am gonna physically remove my HDD and continue with the installation. After completing the process, the installation DVD should have taken the SSD by default as the data partition to install windows on. Later
 after booting to desktop, I will reattach my HDD and format it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will this method yield any issues?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi Mike
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Your steps are correct. 
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi Mike 
<br />
<br />You have researched well and your method is correct, with the possible exception of removing the HDD while you are in Setup - remove the HDD before you begin the installation, this will ensure the boot config does not end up on the wrong drive . . .
<br />
<br />If you intend using the HDD as a data drive after the installation, move any data you need to keep temporarily to the SSD and wipe the HDD to remove Windows . . etc. form that drive
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will most likely not allow you to format that drive, so go into Disk Management and remove all partitions from the HDD and then create 1 new partition on that drive and copy your data back to the HDD
<br />
<br />That's It!

<p>Hello Andre,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My version of windows was a clean install, never did upgrade from a previous version. My windows does have a digital license connected to my Microsoft account, so the product key won't be any issue if I wanted to reinstall the OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the steps you mentioned, I'll apply them and update this post accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a bunch for your time and support. I appreciate the heads up!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Dave,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes of course, I'm gonna disconnect my HDD prior to the installation setup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the process is done, my machine should boot from the SSD, since I'm gonna reconnect the HDD after booting to desktop. I'll most probably be able to format the HDD, since it won't be the primary device Windows will boot from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your input!!&nbsp;</p>

                    Hi guys, I just found out that the selection for the storage of the game is not working properly. By standard it is set to C drive, I changed that to D drive. But it seems like it didn't work. I downloaded some games and they are still stored in the c
 drive which should actually not happen right ? Btw why cant I see where exactly the games are stored. Would be helpful if we could see the whole path.

            Probably just an issue due to it being in Beta. I'd recommend sending your feedback through the Xbox (Beta) app by clicking on your gamer picture and choosing "Feedback" from the drop down menu.

            <p>What many people aren't aware of is that CD/DVD/BluRay drives can go out of alignment over time simply due to usage. That could be happening here. Try reading any very old CDs you may have burned on that XP computer when it was relatively new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is that the read-write heads progressively&nbsp;move farther away from the specified starting track. Eventually the heads become so far out of alignment that discs written on the drive cannot be read by CD drives in other machines or by new&nbsp;CD drives
 installed in the same computer, even though those same discs may still be readable&nbsp;by the drive they were burned with.

                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I was checking out my user folder when I noticed a file named "agent.log" in there. It's empty and it's creation date is the same as the day I last reset my computer to its factory defaults.</p>
<p>It's completely empty so it kind of weirds me out to just see it there. I'm guessing it's a Windows thing, but what's it for? Is it needed or can I just delete it?</p>
<p>It's also in my SysWOW64 folder and in another folder called Intel(R) ME FW Recovery Agent, except that last one actually has something on it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I decided to try the link you suggested one more time, and this time&nbsp; it gave me a good result.&nbsp; Now I need to create a partition in the hard drive to install Windows 7.&nbsp; I have to use Command Prompt because I'm booting the PC with the Windows 7 Installation
 CD.&nbsp; The hard drive has 7811 MB in its full allocate space.&nbsp; Can I create just one partition to install Win 7, and then create more partitions after the installation, or do I have to create all partitions before install Win 7?&nbsp; May I have a well explain guide
 to use DISKPART on any of those two options?</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t change user account to &#34;Administrator&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iandshaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t change user account to &#34;Administrator&#34;</h2>
                    I have a Windows 7 PC where I have somehow incorrectly spelled the user name as "Adminstrator" (missing an 'i') instead of "Administrator".<br />
<br />
Using a second Administrator-level account, I have tried to rename the user account, but I get a message that, "The specified account name is not valid, because there is already an account with that name. Please type a different name."<br />
<br />
There is no user called "Administrator" listed, and no directory structure under Users, so I'm a confused as to what is happening.<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated. Cheers,<br />

<p>Actually, there is. It is the built-in Administrator which comes with the operating system.</p>
<p>In Windows 7, the Administrator is hidden by default. That maybe why you are not aware of it.</p>
<p>This Administrator, by default, does not have password. If you enable it, you can login without password.</p>
<p>This Administrator can do anything. It does not require permissions at all.</p>
<p>This tutorial will show you how to enable the built-in Administrator.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/507-built-administrator-account-enable-disable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/507-built-administrator-account-enable-disable.html</a></p>
<p>Option Two applies to all versions of Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, The name Administrator is reserved.</p>

            <p>Yes, it can, but if you can budge it, I would double the amount of RAM to 2 GBs.
</p>
<p>The 32 bit version of Windows 7 would also be sufficient for such a configuration.</p>
<p>System Requirements:</p>
<p>* 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor</p>
<p>* 1 gigabyte (GB) RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit)</p>
<p>* 16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit)</p>
<p>* DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/upgrade-advisor.aspx</a>

<b><u>
<p>Upgrading from Windows XP?</p>
<p>Please read these instructions carefully and completely before you begin installing Windows 7: There are important steps that you need to follow to upgrade from your PC from Windows XP to Windows 7 in order to preserve your files and settings.</p>
<p>Before you begin, you'll need to back up all your data to an external storage device, and you'll need all of the installation discs for programs you want to keep. Please make sure you have an external hard drive (see details below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</u>
</b>
<p>More detailed instructions are available at windows.microsoft.com/upgrade-windows-xp. Here are the basic steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.</p>
<p>2. Save your files and settings on an external hard drive using Windows Easy Transfer (windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer). If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer. Alternatively, you can copy files
 you want to keep on a USB flash drive, CDs, or DVDs.</p>
<p>3. You'll need to manually reinstall your programs, such as Microsoft Office, after you install Windows 7. Gather the installation discs for your programs and any associated product/license keys. You might be able to download some programs from the Internet.
 For example, Windows Live Messenger can be installed from download.live.com/messenger.</p>
<p>4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."</p>
<p>5. After Windows 7 is installed, use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files and settings.</p>
<p>If you're not comfortable installing Windows 7 yourself, check with a local retail store or PC services company to see if they offer upgrade services.

<h2>            Office 365 subscription - Skype calls to mobile numbers is rejected</h2>
                    <p>Q1: I have 60 min/month free calls to landlines and mobile numbers. However, trying to make a call to a German mobile number was rejected due to no missing credit. I still have 57 min balance left.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q2: I found out that I still had a credit balance but needed to reactivate it. The balance was Euro 2.34... After reactivating I could make calls to mobile numbers but it was taking from my credit and not from my 60 min free calls. Credit should only be
 used after the 60 min are used. Disappointing experience losing credit but having plenty of free call minutes available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/df861a91-6bac-4e59-8bcb-7c1c36e5b20b" title="StefanMuenker">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question 1:</strong> <em>I have 60 min/month free calls to landlines and mobile numbers. However, trying to make a call to a German mobile number was rejected due to no missing credit. I still have 57 min balance left.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> For the free 60 minutes bundled with Office 365, there are limited countries wherein calling both mobile and landline numbers is possible. And upon investigation, calling to a German mobile number is not included on the list.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to this link for the list of countries covered in the free minutes. <strong>
<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/offers/office365/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 free 60 minutes.</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Question 2: </strong><em>I found out that I still had a credit balance but needed to reactivate it. The balance was Euro 2.34... After reactivating I could make calls to mobile numbers but it was taking from my credit and not from my 60 min free
 calls. Credit should only be used after the 60 min are used. Disappointing experience losing credit but having plenty of free call minutes available.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Skype Credit will go inactive after <em>180 days of no use</em>. Make sure you place a call (outside your subscription, if you have one) or send a text every 180 days.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em>free 60 minutes</em> will only be used once you placed calls to the countries that are part of the list provided above. If so happens that, you called countries that are not part of the list, it will automatically use your existing Skype credits
 to cover the calls. That also explained when you make calls to German mobile, the error message received indicating
<em>"insufficient credits"</em> to make the call.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's doubtful if you can add more physical memory to that tablet. This is a question you will need to ask the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NextBook - Contact Us:</p>
<p><a href="http://nextbookusa.com/contactus.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://nextbookusa.com/contactus.php</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot add more RAM, you may be able to use to configure a USB Memory stick (if the tablet has a USB port) to use with the Ready Boost component in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the following article. (Windows 7 article, works the same in Windows 8x)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Turn ReadyBoost on or off for a storage device:</span></p>

    <title>HP 5520 wont print but will scan - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HP 5520 wont print but will scan</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was away for a couple of weeks and when I returned my HP 5520 would not print. Trouble shooting in devices and printers did not fix it. Printer install wizard confirmed current full HP S/W and drivers installed. Install wizard produced a test scan but
 not a test print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Print and scan doctor also identies printer OK but cannot produce a test print.&nbsp; Print and scan identified a problem with the S/W that "cannot be fixed without uninstalling and reinstalling" the software. I have checked the IP address of the printer and
 all appears to be well. I downloaded a discrete software package from HP and loaded that but no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reinstalled software as suggested several times but it has stalled on "checking network envirionment" each time so reinstal&nbsp; has not completed properly i guess. Now I seem to be worse off than I was before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked print spooler and its running ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked windows udates and they are all up to date</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have even tried system restore in desperation but that didnt change anything either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried using just USB to connect - no effect</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried using wireless only to connect - no effect</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just cant get away from thinking that there must be a driver problem somewhere but every test bar one so far says all is well.&nbsp; I have also tried switching off the firewall - no effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running windows 10 on HP pavilion laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I have crawled all over HP website and been to their forum but no one has any answers beyond " reinstall the software" I'm running out of ideas as to how I can get printing again, so any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>Ok, so for anyone who's interested i &nbsp;have solved this by myself. All driver checks were coming back as present correct and working normally but if the hp 5520 software was ok it had to something in windows even though all diagnostics were reporting all
 ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end i reset the pc and reloaded windows inc all drivers and bingo everything snapped back into life. But a dramatic solution for what was probably really a simple driver problem. There has to be an easier way to fix this kind of problem.</p>

<p>Hi Alecia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way to connect your computer on Windows 7 to a TV is through a&nbsp; VGA monitor cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the steps provided below:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Select <strong>the PC input on the TV.</strong></span></span></li><li><span><span><strong>Enable external display on the computer</strong>. It would be a good to consult your computers instruction manual or help file since this procedure varies from model to model. On most computers there is a F key that enables the external
 monitor. You will typically see an icon on one of the F keys that look like a monitor. Remember that you will also need to press the Function Key (FN) at the same time.</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Configure Windows Display properties.</strong></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Right click on the desktop and <strong>Left Click </strong>on <strong>Personalize.</strong></span></li><li><span>Left Click on <strong>Display Settings.</strong></span></li><li><span>Left Click on the <strong>Advanced button.</strong></span></li><li><span>You should see a <strong>tab </strong>along the <strong>top row </strong>
for your laptops specific video card. </span><span><strong>Left Click </strong>on it.</span><span><br />
</span></li><li><span>You should see a large button that says <strong>Start the Control Panel.
</strong></span><span>Left Click the <strong>large button</strong>.</span></li><li><span>You should see a Window with Displays as one of the options</span><span>.
</span><span>Left Click on <strong>Displays </strong>and then choose <strong>Change Display Configuration.</strong></span></li><li><span><span>Choose <strong>Clone </strong>or <strong>Mirror.</strong></span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the steps, kindly share with us the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            <p>When I press the Windows key&nbsp; + X, I get the mobility centre. Which version of Windows are you referrring to? I am using Win 7 Home Premium: is it different with Win 8/8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have three PCs (one a laptop) all running Win 7 Home Premium, all having the same problems/error code as the one rosesheridan raises.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have administrator accounts on all the machines, and those are my normal logins. I use MSE as my antivirus program. I have tried downloading the Win 10 u/g with MSE uninstalled - no different. I have tried the command line wuauclt.exe and updatenow commands,
 none of which have led the Win 10 u/g to work. I have downloaded and tried to use the mediacreationtoolx64 but nothing happens when I try to run it. I have obtained from a friend the files which downloaded when he used the tool, but the setup.exe file does
 not respond. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really annoyed that I have to download the Win 10 u/g <em>every time</em> as the file doesn't seem to be saved anywhere nor is it able to resume a partial download. At my Broadband speeds, it takes 2-2.5 hours for the program to download. Must have
 wasted literally days on downloads.</p>

    <title>WHEA-Logger Event ID 19 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calintm  say:</h3>
<h2>            WHEA-Logger Event ID 19</h2>
                    I am getting these warnings in the event viewer for about 2 days, now seems that these errors have stopped.<br />
<br />
Look at the photo, the processor ID is 7,0,1,6.<br />
<br />
http://oi47.tinypic.com/2s6nibl.jpg<br />
<br />
Why i am getting those warnings ? I am using windows 8, latest updates, and drivers.<br />
<br />
Also my PC is i7 3770k 4.5Ghz (multiplier) 1.21V PLL 1.6V, latest BIOS installed.<br />
<br />
I tested my CPU in intel burn test, the test passed, i am using this OC profile since i bought the rig, back in march 2012, and i didn't had a single problem. No bsod, no crash in games, no shutdown, nothing.<br />
<br />
Also, i have tested my ram (8gb black dragon geil 1866Mhz XMP) tested them on memtest bootable 4.20V and the test passed, no errors. Also, i don't have any error while using the PC normal, no crashes, bsod, etc.<br />
<br />
So, can anyone tell me what is that WHEA-Logger ?<br />

            I think i overclocked my CPU to 4.6Ghz without paying attention to the voltage, and that's why i got those instability WHEA errors. Now i entered my stable OC 4.5Ghz, and i don't have them anymore.<br />

<h2>            redid my XBOX ONE setup with new soundbar - now game&#47;party chat is through soundbar and I dont want that</h2>
                    
<p>I used to have an old receiver sound system and I could hear game audio on the TV and both game and player chat in my headset. I replaced my sound system with a soundbar, and now I hear player/party chat through the soundbar and I dont want that - only game
 audio.</p>

<p>My wiring is a linear sequence like this:</p>

<p>DirectTV Dish ---&gt; DTV DVR ----&gt; XBOX1 ---&gt; TV ----&gt; Soundbar</p>
<p>Everything works, but I hear player chat in both the headset and on the soundbar and I want player chat ONLY in the headset like it was before. Any ideas?</p>
