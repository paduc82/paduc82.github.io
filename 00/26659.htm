<h2>            Not enough memory error to print&#47;export report</h2>
                    <p>Access 2007</p>
<p>I've got a report that I'm trying to print or export to a pdf that comes up nicely in print preview.&nbsp; When I go for the print, I get the message: "System resource exceeded" &nbsp;followed by "There isn't enough memory to perform this operation.&nbsp; Close unneeded
 programs and try the operation again."</p>
<p>I have no other programs running and I have 16gb of memory on this machine.&nbsp; I've watched my task manager performance graphs but see nothing pegged out.</p>
<p>At this stage of printing I have 3 forms open and the single rather&nbsp;complex&nbsp;single&nbsp;page report.&nbsp; I've tried printing/exporting the report without the forms open but get the same result.&nbsp; It is a blank&nbsp;report&nbsp;but&nbsp;fairly complex with 83 sub reports.</p>

            <p>As a test, eliminate 25% of the subreports, or 50%. Does that make it better?</p>
<p>If yes, you may decide to print it as two reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've never even come close to 10 subreports. Are you SURE you have the correct design?</p>

            <p>Are you having this problem on ALL computers or just yours.&nbsp; If it is on just yours, you can try this (which helped me with this similar error not too long ago):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This might be caused by a corrupt VBA registry key. Open your registry editor by clicking
<b>START &gt;&gt; RUN </b>and then type <b>regedit</b> and click ok. Then navigate to the registry key below and delete it. When you try to run the VB editor again a new registry key will be created.<br />

            I have 4 reports that I've built and 3 of them have no problems even with an excess of subreports.&nbsp; However, when I get to the one report with the most of them, it will ot go on.&nbsp; Both machines I have do this as well as a friends machine.&nbsp; I'm sure that
 this db could be built simpler by someone with more knowlege of functions and code than what I have, but I'm just working with what grey matter I've got.&nbsp; Maybe some time in the future I'll see if I can take a course on visual basic.

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that the design is correct if it it fits into an Access report! ;)&nbsp;&nbsp;Our report contains 15 subreports and has been working fantastically under 2003 for 6 years.&nbsp; It is programmatically printed to a pdf file, so it is essential to have this as a single
 report.&nbsp; Just "upgraded" to 2007, now memory errors just for this report (which makes me wonder how many other reports we use are almost at the verge of crashing Access also?).&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks like a problem that is being ignored by MS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of posts out there
 about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any assist.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Following up on my first reply and thanks to everyone here-&nbsp; I've done these in my debugging:</p>
<p>1. Decompiled/recompiled/compacted/repaired</p>
<p>2. Cleared out the reg key</p>
<p>3. Changed default printer to pdf</p>
<p>4. Database has no relationships</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I haven't done is to rebuild each subreport and overall report, that will be a lot of work for questionable gain.&nbsp; If I do chop off pieces of this report it will print, as Tom implied.</p>

            <p>I was having this issue in Access 2010. (I suspect it was the image controls)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed it to export the report directly to PDF from the form instead which seemed to resolve my issue. That same report worked in Access 2013 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I recently was testing&nbsp;a similar report in another database using all the same code...<em>however potentially more image controls as part of the export.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The report with 32 subreports of which 6 may have any number of image controls whose control sources are set the&nbsp;a UNC path pointing at a network share.
<em>(for purposes of my tests, only 3 images each less than 200KB)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The direct to PDF export works fine in Access 2010. </strong><strong>But if I attempt to run it in Access 2013, I get the error;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>2004 - There isn't enough memory to perform this operation. Close unneeded programs and try again.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why... Access 2013 is a downgrade from Access 2010?</p>
<p>Am I using a legacy export method?</p>

<p>I believe the problem might be that the quiz is part of the daily streak for tomorrow on Bing, but it (as well as the other two activities that are part of the streak for tomrrow) is showing up today instead on the drop-down box. This might be the quiz isn't
 loading and the other two activities (Channel surfing and Down to earth) aren't providing the points or disappearing from the list after clicking on them.<br />
</p>
<p>Edit: Today (for me at least) the three offers that weren't working properly before worked fine and gave the points. Now there's another set of offers with the same thing though: they show up as tomorrow's offers for the streak, but the drop-down box on
 other Bing pages show them for today.</p>

<h2>            E71&#58; Bluetooth issues</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
first of all, i apologize for my english.<br />
<br />
i am currently using bluetooth earphones with my E71, but after some time E71 disconnects the earphones and i am unable to reconnect them to phone.<br />
<br />
Only way is turning off and on the phone.<br />
<br />
I think that the bluetooth stack is imperfect, and a firmware update about radio section is needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bye.

            Is this headset a supported by the Nokia E71 as shown here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/products/accessories/all_accessories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/products/accessories/all_accessories</a><br />
<br />
Select E71 from the dropdown menu on the left side of the screen and look if your headset appears.<br />
<br />
If it does then it should work and have full support. In that case I would contact Nokia directly.

            I have e51 and n82.both have this problem.a look at the discussions reveals that 6120c too has the problem.<br />
<br />
If you connect gprs via bluetooth it will get disconnected in some time.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you that 6120 is having this problem from 1 year and e51 &amp; n82 have it for 6 months.it seems to be a generic problem for newer s60 phones.<br />
So chances of your problem being solved are low .NIL actually.<br />
<br />
However do contact nokia by mail or visit nokia care he possible.

 &nbsp;I am having printing difficulty recently with publisher. &nbsp;There are various boxed sized darker color variations appearing on some of the colored areas. &nbsp;It is being printed to a Professional Canon Imagerunner Advance Copier/Printer. &nbsp;The techs have been out
 and have found no problems with the printer itself. &nbsp;Since this is a newer issue, I am assuming that it has been caused by an update at some point. &nbsp;I'm sorry the scanned copy is not very clear but if you notice the arrows that shows the color variances. &nbsp;There
 are light gray text boxes that do not show up in this copy, but they too have boxed shaped color variances that show up in a light yellow tone. &nbsp;If I save the document to a pdf they still show up, but if I save to a jpg they do not. &nbsp;Has anyone else been experiencing
 this issue? &nbsp;And most importantly, do you know a fix?

            <p>1. The color variations do not show up in the view of the digital document itself or in the print preview.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;I did not try printing to another printer as I do not have another color printer in the office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to somewhat resolve some of these issues with the following workarounds. &nbsp;I had to remove all shadowing text effects, which had also caused discoloration to the colored areas that border those text boxes. &nbsp;I also had to remove the blurring effect
 of a text box. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the darker vertical box on the left of the document, I found that some of the color variations were brought on by the manual line spacing I had placed between the areas of text. &nbsp;To resolve, I instead placed the areas of text into "no fill" text boxes
 and overlaid them in those spaces. &nbsp;I now have only one small area of discoloration on the text directly below the small photo in that area on the far right of the text. &nbsp;I haven't been able to resolve that small issue, but at this point I need to get this
 document in the mail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say that there needs to be some work performed on this program. &nbsp;I don't know if it's a communication issue between it and the printer or if it's something within the program. &nbsp;But if you take into account that it is not resolved when saving to a

    <title>Contacts - Display in Last Name sort order - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Contacts - Display in Last Name sort order</h2>
                    <p>I have used Outlook 2002 for years and now am using 2013.&nbsp; Under People (contacts) I am able to get them sorted in Last Name / First Name sequence.&nbsp; But they are still displayed as First Name then Last Name under People.&nbsp; How can I get them to also display
 and show as Last Name then First Name?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When viewing as People, it is sorted by Last Name but it displays First Name first and then Last Name.&nbsp; So when looking for a last name, the eyes have to dart back and forth which is a pain.&nbsp; For example, I'm looking for Smith:</p>
<p>John and Jan Semler</p>
<p>Bob Shoals</p>
<p>Jennifer Shuster</p>
<p>Nicholas and Elizabeth Smathers</p>
<p>Ed Smith</p>
<p>Richard Smoker</p>
<p>Last names do not line up.&nbsp; And it helps to have the alphabet listed along the left to jump to that letter.&nbsp; This is where I'd like it displayed by Last Name first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When viewing as Business Card, the display is correct in Last Name sequence but I don't like the list going horizontal.</p>
<p>Same with viewing as Card.&nbsp; Eyes have to go up and down and left and right to find what I'm looking for.</p>
<p>Viewing as List or Phone is much better as the File As column is exactly what I am looking for.&nbsp; But this doesn't show the alphabet to quickly jump to the end.</p>
<p>So the issue is just with viewing as People.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Appreciate any assistance.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The People view shows the value of the &lt;FullName&gt; name field using the default setting for that field. The only way to have it show as Last, First would be to change the default setting:</p>

<p>I already know that WP7 still doesen't have an equalizer so my question is -When are we getting an equalizer to our multimedia machines aka smartphones?</p>

    <title>Fuzzy Lookup Not Working for Excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackytran6793  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fuzzy Lookup Not Working for Excel 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Excel 2010 on Windows 7 64-Bit system. I successfully installed and added the Fuzzy Lookup Add-In, but nothing happens when I create my tables and press go. It seems to think for a few seconds and then nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried running it as administrator, uninstalling &amp; reinstalling, and restarting Excel. In addition I can't install for all users anymore during initial installation as the setup wizard says: that local administrator privileges are not required
 and that the program will be installed on a per-user basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled, and reinstalled as admin. Then restarted excel and then my computer, but the issue is still the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice that when i try to remove the fuzzy lookup add-in from excel via the settings tab, it will remove it for that session. But when start Excel up again, the Fuzzy Lookup Tab is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, this is where i installed the file:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Fuzzy Lookup Add-In For Excel\Bin</p>

<p>Hi- Two options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the connector invisable (no line color), or </li><li>When you have fnished your drawing (Smart Art), right click on it, Ungroup, and ungroup again. That will bust it into shapes you can move or delete. But keep a backup copy of your Smart Art diagram on a hidden slide- ungrouping loses the Smart Art capabilities.</li></ol>

<h2>            Powerpoint on Mac - same font rendering differently on different Macs</h2>
                    <p>Hi - wonder if someone could help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two Macs - on an iMac and one a new MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Powerpoint is installed on both - running same version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an OpenType font installed on both machines through FontExplorer 6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the iMac, presentation looks great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the MacBook Pro, the presentation headings appear over italicised which just looks really odd as the italic version of the font is key to the clients identity (it lines up with other objects set at the same angle).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone any ideas as to how to get around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

<p>Couple of questions,&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Does the font render differently just in powerpoint ? Can you please try the font in another app like textedit on both machines.</p>
<p>2) Is the font embedded in the document ?</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your replies so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been some updates since I last posted in trying to follow your suggestions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to Sarang:</p>
<p>The fonts only render differently in Powerpoint. I tried several applications and it was only Powerpoint on the Macbook Pro that was rendering incorrectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c6d3623-652b-4989-844d-9e8f1e2f2cda?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c6d3623-652b-4989-844d-9e8f1e2f2cda?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the font embedded? Well, this is where it has got interesting (or not!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to look up how to embed fonts on a Mac and found that I was using a version prior to that ability. So I have updated my iMac to the latest version and now the font is rendering incorrectly in Powerpoint on both machines! (The Macbook Pro would already
 have been updated to the latest version as it was a clean install).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to Jim (and Tisky):</p>
<p>Yes, the fonts are definitely the same on both machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that the issue is either with the latest release of Powerpoint or with the font's compatibility with PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The font is a proprietary font to my client, so I am also going raise the issue with them to see if there have been any updates to the font or known issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise if anyone else knows of latest version of Powerpoint causing issues with fonts that previously worked fine and developed a work around, please let me know!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks<br />
<br />
Lee</p>

<p>Hi Lee,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to confirm some information first:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Please provide the version of the PowerPoint, you can check it in PowerPoint &gt; About Microsoft PowerPoint.</p>
<p>2. I have checked in the FontExplorer, but fail to find the OpenType font, would you please provide the font file to us via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Message</a> so we can test on our side?
</p>
<p>3. Have you tried reinstall the font? Please share the test result with us.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for providing the font file to us, however, since there are too many fonts in the list, would you please confirm which of them encountering the issue? And I also need to confirm

<p>Hi Lee,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tested some of the italicized version of the fonts in the list you provided and found that only Black Italic in Playoff Pro Cond encounter the problem which is the same font in your screenshot.
 So I would like to confirm whether the following fonts also encounter the problem, and would you please share the screenshot of the result to us?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playoff Pro Cond:</p>
<p>Medium Italic</p>
<p>Bold Italic</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playoff Pro Sans:</p>
<p>Bold Italic</p>
<p>Heavy Italic</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the meantime, I would still suggest you contact the font developer to confirm whether the problem happens to him also since this is not the built-in font in PowerPoint 2016 for Mac.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Custom ribbon disappears - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Custom ribbon disappears</h2>
                    <p>I am using Word 2010 on Windows 7.&nbsp; I have created a custom tab for the Ribbon so I have my frequently used commands in one place.&nbsp; Periodically, however, this tab will disappear.&nbsp; Fortunately, I have saved my custom settings and am able to import the customization
 file so I do not have to recreate the tab on the Ribbon, but I would like to know if anyone may have an answer as to why this happens.</p>

            <p>Hi Aravinda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the problem is very sporadic - probably has happened 6-8 times in the last year; enough to catch my attention, but not enough to cause a tremendous problem.&nbsp; I have a program that I use constantly that&nbsp;utilizes a Word&nbsp;add-in, and due to the
 length of time between occurrences I cannot disable this add-in.&nbsp; The other program is Prolaw by Thomson Elite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue&nbsp;seems to only occur in Word, but I do not&nbsp;have a custom ribbon tab in&nbsp;other Office programs (Excel, Powerpoint).&nbsp; I have added buttons to the Home tab in Outlook, and&nbsp;have not had any problems with these additional buttons disappearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't sure if this was a known issue with Word, or perhaps a problem with my other program that "Links" to Word.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Kathy</p>

</p><p>I have a very similar problem where my customized word tabs seem to dissapear every now and then. It is a very sporadic problem so I'm not able te reproduce it in a controlled manner. I've not found a common trigger nor action I've done before this happens.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry to say, I have never had the problem resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;My "work around" is to&nbsp;save my ribbon customization&nbsp;whenever I make a change to the ribbon (which is fortunately infrequent now) so I can have a backup on hand to be imported when the problem occurs.&nbsp;
 I haven't had the custom tab disappear in&nbsp;a while, but I have had an individual command on the custom tab that likes to disappear&nbsp;periodically.</p>

            <p>Hi Tim and Kathy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the reason you are not getting help is because regular contributors here do not generally use the user-interface ribbon customization and so have not experienced this. They customize the QAT, often saving the customizations in a
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm#Global" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Global Template</a>, or they do manual XML modification to the ribbon. The latter is more involved but much more flexible and powerful than the customization available directly within Word.
 The following article provides a jumping-off point for exploring customization, including through the interface and discusses the files involved with Ribbon and QAT modification through the user interface.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Charles.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still learning Word, having had to convert from Word Perfect for compatibility with our legal software, but have not yet had time to learn beyond the basics.&nbsp; I just yesterday started to review information about Global Templates and XML modification
 to the ribbon, but&nbsp;the initial documentation I found was overwhelmingly advanced.&nbsp; I'm fairly tech savvy, but get lost&nbsp;between Word features either wanting to think for me, or my needing to know program code to tell Word what I want accomplished.&nbsp;

<h3> grevestephan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powershell Automation for Licenses of O365 in Azure Automation</h2>
                    <p>I use the Get-MsolUser&nbsp;command with $_.Licenses[0].ServiceStatus[X].ProvisioningStatus -eq "Disabled" in a script to check, if all Services for users inside a defined&nbsp;Group have been enabled/disabled correctly. If not, they get their -licenseoptions set
 newly.</p>
<p>All this is automated in Azure Automation. I'm afraid my runbook will fail, when new Services will be added to O365 and the numbers in the Array: "ServiceStatus[X]" will Change and f.e. Exchange Online Service Plan 2 will no longer be ServiceStatus[15] and
 Change to ServiceStatus[16] or something else. </p>
<p>Has anybody any ideas how to get around this?</p>

<p>Hi Alison,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your reply! I wanted to avoid using the index numbers. I got an answer in the TechNet Forum, which helps:</p>
<p>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/3993ed5f-bedb-4ac8-bfcf-4114702fbd3c/powershell-automation-for-licenses-of-o365-in-azure-automation?forum=onlineservicesmigrationandcoexistence</p>
<p>
</p><p>"</p>
<p>Or simply use the actual ServiceName values. For example, this should list all users with SfB disabled:</p>
<pre>Get-MsolUser  | ? {$_.Licenses.ServiceStatus | ? {$_.ServicePlan.ServiceName -eq "MCOSTANDARD" -and $_.ProvisioningStatus -eq "Success"}}</pre>

<h3> peewil  say:</h3>
<h2>            drop down information boxes scrambled</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm using ie 10 in windows home 7. I'm using an ati hd 4000 graphics card with the latest drivers. I am having problems with some drop down boxes being scrambled on web sites. Also when I point to the start menu I get a strange box appear.
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19d16b4b-84a6-446f-9240-3e9dfa9c591f" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the effect I get on drop down boxes. The image below is what I see when I run the cursor over the start menu. I downloaded the latest firefox browser to try. This doesn't have the problem with the drop down boxes. I also reset my ie 10 using the
 online tool but that didn't help. Can anyone help? Thanks.</p>
<p>Just checked on the problem when I open in safe mode. It doesn't happen in safe mode!</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>thanks for the reply which I followed. Unfortunately it didn't solve the problem. It's quite frustrating because if I have to fill out any online form which involves drop down boxes it is quite difficult! I'm just wondering whether to start from scratch
 and reinstall my copy of windows and all my drivers from the beginning. If I don't find a solution soon that's what I may do. Thanks again for the suggestions.</p>

            I've gone through troubleshooting options. I discovered that by disabling my ati radeon hd4000 series display drivers and reverted to the legacy windows 7 drivers the problem disappeared. When I reenabled the graphics card the scrambled box over the start
 button had disappeared leaving me with the proper start window. Unfortunately the drop down box problem reappeared. I deleted the ati drivers and associated programs using uninstall through ATI and windows control panel. I then downloaded a fresh version of
 the drivers from the ATI site, installed them but the problem reappeared. It seems to me that the problem lies with the graphic card drivers so I might try and find an older set of drivers for this card to see if this alters things. Thanks for your advice.
 Any more thoughts on this problem very welcome.

<p>I downloaded the drivers from the amd website. They were the correct drivers for the card I have. Interestingly whenever the computer is rebooted the start button text is scrambled and only reappears when I disable and then reinstate them. I have also noticed
 that when I am using media player 10 to play a video the progress bar text when the cursor is hovering over it is also scrambled. Thanks for your interest.</p>

<p>Instead try causing a screen refresh in a less invasive way.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. press Win-P&nbsp; and see what you can do with that (Second Screen) dialog, or simply switch into a High Contrast display theme, e.g. press LeftAlt+LeftShift+PrintScrn&nbsp; as a toggle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
 option is to stop using GPU rendering and switch to software rendering (e.g. via Options, Advanced tab.)&nbsp;&nbsp;With AMD you probably also have its Catalyst Control Center and would have diagnostics and similar tools available&nbsp;in it.</p>

<h2>            apps installation in WP 8.1 Store</h2>
                    <p>This is the first time I use Lumia Device but unfortunately I got many bad experiences with it. I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the problems: I can't install many apps from the Store. It gives me "pending" for a long time. Then it fails and gives me "space required to install it".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Lumia 640, WP 8.1. I have free space on Phone and SD Card Storage; more than 2GB for each. The apps I want to install aren't bigger than 10MB. Some apps are installed correctly but many are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please I need Support</p>
<p>Thanks :(</p>

    <title>Data validation list based on records that match criteria - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sebastiancorrea  say:</h3>
<h2>            Data validation list based on records that match criteria</h2>
                    Hello gurus...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm working on a spreadsheet for work and need some help getting one part of it to function as I want it to.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's the scenario:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a workseet where the daily transactions are entered. &nbsp; These transaction entries contain data like transaction date, transaction type, invoice number, amount, reason code, and a few others.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a second worksheet where I have named ranges for Transaction Type and Reason Code as follows:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Named Range: mstrTranType -&gt; First row of list is excluded as it is a label and not an actual transaction type.</div>
<div>
<div><b><u>Transaction Type</u></b></div>
<div>All Records</div>
<div>Adjustment</div>
<div>Go Smart Act</div>
<div>T-Mobile Act</div>
<div>Top Up</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Named Range: &nbsp;mstrRsnCode -&gt; First row of list is excluded as it is a label and not an actual transaction type.</div>
<div>
<div><b><u>Reason Description</u></b></div>
<div>All Records</div>
<div>000 - Commissionable</div>
<div>001 - Activation Date - First Usage Date</div>
<div>002 - Static Serialization IMEI Validation</div>
<div>003 - Ship to Dealer Channel commission eligibility check</div>
<div>004 - Last Usage check based upon Subscriber data</div>
<div>005 - Commissionable &nbsp;Handset Check</div>
<div>006 - IMEI IMSI Pairing Check</div>
<div>010 - Activation Dealer Status</div>
<div>011 - Port In Activation Date Range Eligibility</div>
<div>012 - Payment Vendor Record Match</div>
<div>019 - Activation Dealer Status</div>
<div>020 - Original Activation not Paid</div>
<div>022 - Previous Period Record Not Paid</div>
<div>023 - Subsequent Activation already paid</div>
<div>024 - Refill/ Renwal record outside eligibility range</div>
<div>025 - Refill Threshold Check</div>
<div>026 - Renewal Value Less than Activation</div>
<div>027 - Refill data match with Payment Vendor</div>
<div>030 - Compensation Assignment Mapping not Found</div>
<div>031 - Other Non-Commissionable Reason Code</div>
<div>033 - Duplicate Payment Vendor data</div>
<div>No Reason Code</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And here is what I haven't been able to figure out:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- &nbsp;I have a few thousand rows of data.</div>
<div>- &nbsp;Every row of data has to have a transaction type and a reason code.</div>
<div>- &nbsp;There are many transaction types that won't have entries for every possible reason code.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So what I would like to achieve is that whenever I select a Transaction Type and the data gets filtered by that value; the second list (the one where I get to pick the reason code) shows only those codes for which there are entries matching the transaction
 type.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Example</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div><b><u>Transaction&nbsp;<span> </span>
Reason Description</u></b></div>
<div>Adjustment<span> </span>000 - Commissionable</div>
<div>Adjustment<span> </span>001 - Activation Date - First Usage Date</div>
<div>Adjustment<span> </span>002 - Static Serialization IMEI Validation</div>
<div>Adjustment<span> </span>003 - Ship to Dealer Channel commission eligibility check</div>
<div>Adjustment<span> </span>004 - Last Usage check based upon Subscriber data</div>
<div>Adjustment<span> </span>005 - Commissionable &nbsp;Handset Check</div>
<div>Adjustment<span> </span>006 - IMEI IMSI Pairing Check</div>
<div>Adjustment<span> </span>010 - Activation Dealer Status</div>
<div>Adjustment<span> </span>011 - Port In Activation Date Range Eligibility</div>
<div>Adjustment<span> </span>012 - Payment Vendor Record Match</div>
<div>Adjustment<span> </span>019 - Activation Dealer Status</div>
<div>Top Up<span> </span>020 - Original Activation not Paid</div>
<div>Top Up<span> </span>022 - Previous Period Record Not Paid</div>
<div>Top Up<span> </span>023 - Subsequent Activation already paid</div>
<div>Top Up<span> </span>024 - Refill/ Renwal record outside eligibility range</div>
<div>Top Up<span> </span>025 - Refill Threshold Check</div>
<div>Top Up<span> </span>026 - Renewal Value Less than Activation</div>
<div>Top Up<span> </span>027 - Refill data match with Payment Vendor</div>
<div>Top Up<span> </span>030 - Compensation Assignment Mapping not Found</div>
<div>Top Up<span> </span>031 - Other Non-Commissionable Reason Code</div>
<div>Top Up<span> </span>033 - Duplicate Payment Vendor data</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I filter the Transaction Type Column by "Adjustment"; the Reason Code column will only show reason cods from 000 to 019. &nbsp;And if I choose "Top up" from the filter in the Transaction column; the reason code column will only show codes from 020 - 033.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>I have set up a couple of cells with data validation (list) to allow me to select the Transaction Type for one and the Reason Code for the other. &nbsp;The data validation is done via "LIST" and the source for the lists is done via named ranges that refer to
 the two tables shown at the top of this post.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also have some vba that looks at the the two cells mentioned above and whenever there is a change to the value of the cell; the vba will filter the data to show only records that match the selection. &nbsp; &nbsp;The issue I'm having is that the list for Reason
 Codes always shows all the possible codes and that may lead to a combination of Transaction Type and Reason Code that has no data and it will simply hide every row of data in the data worksheet.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way I can have the second data validation list only show reason codes that exist for the chosen Transaction Type? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I've looked at dependent lists, dynamic data validation, etc and can't get my head around getting the second range to update based on the parameter set by the first selection.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.</div>

    <title>is it possible to change the default setting of a check box so it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chieflx  say:</h3>
<h2>            is it possible to change the default setting of a check box so it inserts a tick rather than an x in word 2007&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to fill in a form which contains check boxes. The instructions ask for you to put a tick in the check box to indicate my choice. By highlighting the box and pressing enter I am able to get an x in the right place. I assume this is the default
 symbol used when creating check boxes. I have tried finding a way of changing this to a tick but so far have had no success.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Does anyone know if it is possible to use a tick and if do how do I change the x to a tick?</p>

            <p>Rob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not likely with the form you are using.&nbsp; In Word 2007, the&nbsp;checkboxes available are the protected form checkbox or ActiveX checkbox.&nbsp; The former uses a "X" and the later uses a "Tick."&nbsp; So while you could use one or the other, you can't change the symbol
 in either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wore 2010 introduced a checkbox content control where symbol used for either state can be practically anything you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a tool for creating "toggle objects" including checkboxes here:&nbsp; <a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/add_interactive_toggle_objects_to_document.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Dude,<br />
I guess you went to site that requires ADOBE FLASH PLAYER 9<br />
And so it said to do.<br />
But unfortunately, the series 60 3rd editions phones support only flash lite 2.1/2.2 (equivalent to flash player 6) that is different.<br />
I wonder N800 is linux based and it supports full original flash 9.

            On my v12 N95 if you go to Menu &gt; Applications &gt; Flash Player &gt; Options &gt; About application, it says "...Flash Lite 2.0..."<br />
<br />
I don't think earlier f/w versions had the version number.

<h2>            consequences of converting a Hotmail account to Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I just now inadvertently converted my Hotmail account to Outlook. I had the Hotmail account for more than 20 years, and I conducted all my correspondence through it. It was my link to the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---Will the conversion require me to notify all my many contacts of the change? Or will messages sent to my old Hotmail address be forwarded to my new Outlook address?</p>
<p>
</p><p>---When I send messages from the new Outlook address, will they continue to show the old Hotmail address as my sending address?</p>

<h2>            One or more network protocols missing - Windows 10</h2>
                    I'm constantly troubleshooting my WiFi lately and getting the "one or more network protocols are missing" error message. &nbsp;I'm running Windows 10, and this has been going on for a little over a month now. &nbsp;I don't have any issues with my WiFi unless I'm
 at home in my apartment. &nbsp;When I'm out and about or anywhere else, I connect and never have any issues with my WiFi. &nbsp;This is getting really frustrating and I can't keep troubleshooting every 20 minutes for my WiFi not working.

            Tried, still not working. &nbsp;I don't have access to my wifi access point as the wifi is provided by the apartment complex I live in. This isn't the first time I've had issues with wifi here either. &nbsp;Last time the excuse they gave me was everyone was on the
 wifi at once, therefore using all the bandwidth or something.

            I tried doing a system restore to an earlier point, that worked, but then windows updated again and now it's back to giving me that error message again.
