<h2>            Publisher &#40;2003&#41; macro required, please</h2>
                    I have a Publisher Document with some 500 pages (actually split into 8 files) and I have decided to reduce the top margin by 1 cm, i.ei top margin from 3 cms to 2 cms. Obviously, to do this manually would take ages (but probably quicker than the time I
 have spent trying to create a macro! There is very very little on the 'net about VBA for Publisher whereas, there is plenty for Access and Excel.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I need to move the shapes upwards on the page. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;Each pages contains just two items (shapes?), a text box and a picture (the picture takes up most of the A4 size page).&nbsp; I need a macro to move the two objects upwards on the page, but have absolutely no idea of how to do this.
<br />
<br />
It appears that Publisher has a completely different approach to VBA than MS Access.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Any help will be very much appreciated.<br />
<br />
To try to learn something about VBA in Publisher, I found the following (From the Knowledge database, if I remember correctly) but it does not do what it should do; I get a message: Run time error 9. Subscript out of range.<br />
The code is as follows:<br />
Sub upwards()<br />
Dim theShape As Shape<br />
<br />
Set theShape = ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(1)<br />
<br />
With theShape.TextFrame.Story.TextRange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With .InlineShapes.Item(1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Flip (msoFlipVertical)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End With<br />
<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
<br />

            So, I have solved the macro in VBA myself, to move all objects on the page upwards by 11 points.:<br />
Sub Moveup()<br />
Dim pubPage As Page<br />
&nbsp; Dim pubShape As Shape<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each pubPage In ActiveDocument.Pages&nbsp; 'Do this for every page in the document<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each pubShape In pubPage.Shapes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Do this for every shape (object) on each page<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '.IncrementLeft Increment:=0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pubShape.IncrementTop Increment:=-11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Move 1st shapes upwards on the page by 11 points.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next pubShape&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Move next shapes in turn on the page<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next pubPage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go to next page<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
However, I haven't solved why the macro example in my first post does not work - I don't actually need to know as I am not using it, but just for curiosity I would be interested - and to help understand VBA in Publisher<br />

<h2>            Data transfer from External&#47;Portable Hard disk to One Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 1TB limit on One drive and 250GB MacBook pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to transfer my external/portable hard disk data (which is 900GB) to one drive on cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i try to upload it on one drive on cloud directly from my hard disk without transferring data to MacBook then i might have to connect my external hard drive wth MacBook for don't know how long as uploading speed is quite slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought i will transfer folder by folder from my portable hard drive to one drive folder on MacBook and it will automatically sync with my one drive on cloud. now its working fine..so far almost 100 gb data uploaded on cloud but to transfer more data from
 my hard disk to one drive folder on MacBook, i need to delete the earlier data from MacBook one drive folder...but it should not delete the same from cloud also. pls suggest how do i ensure my data from cloud is not deleted and i can transfer of folders one
 by one from portable hard disk to MacBook one drive folder and then delete it when it is uploaded on cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Lumia 820 - Camera problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hassan_ishak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 820 - Camera problem</h2>
                    Hello there, I am facing a problem with the my Nokia Lumia 820 camera.<br />
- Current OS version 8.10.12393.890 (Cyan)<br />
<br />
I bought the phone with Windows Phone 8. And later updated to Black, Amber and Cyan respectively. None of these updates causes any problems. But some weeks ago, I found that my front camera doesn't open. (Rear camera worked perfectly then.) Whenever I tried
 to switch to front camera, the app crashes and went back to previous screen and camera app won't start again until rebooting the phone. Once I reboot my phone, the rear cam will work, but if I try to switch to front cam, again it will crash. I tried everything
 to fix this except a factory reset, but none worked. I believed a factory reset can surely fix this problem, but since I am not a 'selfie' person, I ignored this and lead an 'normal life'.<br />
<br />
But today evening, I decided to fix this. I backed up every data I need and I actually did a factory reset. But the what happened is, my both cameras stopped working. When I try to open the camera, a blank black screen will appear for 2-3 seconds and will go
 back to previous screen.<br />
What can I do to fix this mess? I need my camera. At least the rear one.<br />
Don't tell me this is a hardware problem because I don't think resetting phone can damage phone hardware.<br />
Please HELP!<br />
Thanks in advance.

<p>Sorry to know about the problem you are facing ..</p>
<p>Since you have already tried the Factory Reset, only other thing that you may try is Fresh install the OS using the
<u><em><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Lumia Software Recovery Tool</a></strong></em></u>. If that too doesn't help, you need to visit a Care point to get the device inpected.</p>

            Since you have tried the factory reset and am sure u used the factory reset through going to the phone settings.......try this one *#7370# then enter 12345 that's if you din't change the default security code but if you changed then use the same one.

            Thanks for replying.<br />
I reinstalled the OS with Lumia System Recover Tool, but the problem still exists.<br />
Like I said, I lose the camera by an hard reset. I remember I have done an hard reset when my phone was running in Windows phone 8. There was no problem then. Now phone running windows phone 8.1 (Cyan) when the problem happened after an hard reset and this
 is the first time I am hard resetting after updating to windows phone 8.1. So, I think if I can roll back to windows phone 8, I may be possible to get the deleted/lost camera drivers.<br />
Please tell me if there is a way to roll back/downgrade to WP8 from WP8.1.<br />
Thanks<br />

            I had same issue but Nokia installed new cam and software under warranty. On last update I lost my flash. Nearest Care Centre 80 miles away and I cannot be without a phone so now flashless. This has put me off upgrading to another Lumia as do not want
 repeat. Other than that I love the phone.

<p>Hi, egyptianwife. This is for your Lumia 820, right? Are you referring to the Lumia Denim update? What camera app are you referring to? Does this also happen when using another camera app? If you haven't tried any troubleshooting steps yet, you may try the
 following:<br />
<br />
1. Reset your camera settings. <br />
2. Reboot your phone. Press and hold the volume down and the power keys simultaneously for about 10 seconds. Your personal files will not be deleted.<br />
3. Reset the phone: Settings &gt;about &gt; reset your phone. As this will wipe all your data, be sure to create a backup file:

    <title>Corrupted microSD card in 6120 classic - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Corrupted microSD card in 6120 classic</h2>
                    I have Nokia 6120 Classic. Today I've opened my music player and it did not find any songs that were on the micro SD card. I got the card out and when I inserted it again it said that it's corrupted and wanted to format it. After the format I got it out
 again and then back in. Again corrupted. No matter how many times I've done that the result was the same. I've connected it to my laptop via an USB cable in pc suite mode. When I've copied some mp3s and tried to read them they were corrupted. I've got the
 card out, put it in my laptop, formated it in fat32, inserted it again in the phone and copied some songs in data mode. The music players found them, added them in the music library but when I restarted the phone I had to add them again. And it adds the song
 rather slowly.. and the browsing of the files in the phone browser is slow So.. should I buy a new micro SD card or it is the phone? I bought it 2 weeks ago. The card is new too. What should I do? I've tested it under Windows for ba

            Try a friends sd card in your fone and visa versa to see if its the card or handset.<br />
<br />
It may just be a software update to remove the bugs !<br />
<br />
If so visit a NSC.

            Hi Alaerus, I have the same problem like you. My data in the memory card keep corrupted no matter how many time I format and save. If you have solved the problem, please let me know what should I do and I just bought 3 days ago. I'm using 4GB micro SDHC.
 Will it help if I use 2GB? But many people are using 4GB with no problem. Pls help.

            Hey there :). 6120 cannot use 4GB SD cards. It can use SD cards up to 2GB according to its specifications. I just bought a new SD card and till now everything is ok. Do not remove the SD card from your phone too often (I try to never do that anymore) and
 when connected in data mode, always use the safety remove feature of Windows.

            And here comes a little follow-up on this thread.<br />
<br />
I have now bought a 4 GB memory card for my 6120c and it works great. It's a 4 GB class 2 card from SanDisk.<br />
<br />
It is a little bit slow transfering files to it from my PC, but I blame Nokias USB interface that is built in this phone. USB 2.0... Pfft.

            Admittedly it does say "high speed USB 2.0", not "full speed USB 2.0". That's the catch. You have to read the small print!<br />
<br />
However, I agree that they could have sped the USB interface up somewhat, as most other manufacturers already have. We could then reap the benefit of Class 6 µSDHC cards.

 program; I use Excel, PowerPoint, Visio and Word weekly if not daily. I thought, ‘wouldn’t it be nice to have all of my documents in SkyDrive’; so I purchased the Home Premium version of O-2013/-365. I’m afraid to put any of my doc’s in the cloud for fear
 I’ll NEVER be able to access them. The password I setup at home couldn’t be used at work, and wouldn’t work at home that afternoon.
<i>And Why Do I Need To Ask <span>The ‘Community’</span> a question</i>? Is this a ‘Users Group” or is it a ‘MS-Filter’? When I just now tried to access O-365, I got: It looks like you don’t have Office yet. Do you want

            It's been "improved".<br />
<br />
<br />
The infrastructure and management of the forum is provided by MS, along with volunteer moderators.&nbsp; Most of the repliers are unpaid volunteers. There are a few paid MS employees and some of the development team members and managers "lurk" in the background,
 popping up to provide a reply a few times a year.<br />
<br />
First thing, if you have an earlier version of Office, you don't have to buy Office 365 / 2013 to use skydrive. Even with the older versions you can simply upload to and download from skydrive the files on your local HD.&nbsp; There you can use you older version
 of Office to edit them. Or you can use the free, dumbed down Office Web Apps 2013 (Word, Excel, PoserPoint).<br />
<br />
Your best bet is to contact the online store for help downloading Office 365.&nbsp; In theory, it should be usable in 5 minutes or so (when things works as designed).<br />
<br />
FYI: as an instructor, you may be eligible for the Office University discount package. Same programs as Home Premium, but only costs US$80 for a 4 year subscription. You should look into it to see if your school qualifies for the discount.&nbsp; If you do, this
 failed installation is a good excuse to get a refund on Home Premium.<br />

    <title>Email Alias not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david eileenprice  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email Alias not working</h2>
                    I created an outlook.com alias with the option "deliver to my inbox."&nbsp; I can send emails just fine, but mails sent to the alias just disappear with no trace.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what is wrong, but I have this working on other users in my Windows Live domain with outlook.com addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is just this user where the alias doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Where do I go to get this resolved please ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

    <title>Report With Multiple DCounts Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> debraann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Report With Multiple DCounts Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I have a report running off of a query which combines two tables of information (POs and Items).&nbsp; The report contains a bunch of unbound fields where I want to perform a bunch of different counts on fields in the query.&nbsp; My problem is I need the count to
 be a set of unique values of which I have many in the table.&nbsp; Therefore, I tried to use DCount but it is not working.&nbsp; Below are myfirst four unbound fields (I have a bunch more):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Total Items</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Field Name:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; txtTotalItems</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Control Source:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; =Count([qryDeliverablesList]![DeliverablesID])</p>
<p>
</p><p>Total POs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Field Name:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; txtTotalPOs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Control Source:&nbsp;</strong> =DCount("[CustomerPOID]", "qryDeliverablesList")</p>
<p>
Total Plans Required&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Field Name:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; txtTotalPlansRequired
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Control Source:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; =DCount("[CustomerPlanNo]", "qryDeliverablesList")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Total Plans Submitted</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Field Name:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; txtTotalPlansRequired
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Control Source:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; =DCount("[PlanStatus]", "qryDeliverablesList","6 - Sent for Approval") +
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DCount([PlanStatus]", "qryDeliverablesList","7 - Approved")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Field 1 works because it is just a Count.&nbsp; Field 2, 3, and 4 need to provide me with a total count of the unique list.&nbsp; For instance, I have 106 item records connected to a total of 70 POs.&nbsp; To obtain a total count of the POs, I need to filter on the unique
 values and have it return 70 and not 106. When I try to put any of the expressions for the DCount syntax in the Control Source, it does not work.&nbsp; I get an error:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><strong>The expression you entered contains invalid syntax.</strong></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><strong>You omitted an operand or operator, you entered an invalid character or comma, or you entered text without surround it in quotation marks.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen people comment that they created a query.&nbsp; Does this mean I need to create a query for every single field I want in the report?&nbsp; And then will I have to create a sub-report for every value so it looks at a different query?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any input you could provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            I don't know enough about your tables and relationships. I expect you have a table of plans and a lookup table for plan status. I expect you could create a simple totals query that groups plans&nbsp;by&nbsp;status and provides a count. Use this totals query as the
 record source of a subreport.

</p><blockquote>I need a group count of how many plans there are without the grouping of POs.
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an example using Northwind, which returns the number of instances of each status in the Order Details table:<br />
<br />
SELECT[Status Name], COUNT([Order Details].[Status ID]) AS StatusCount<br />
FROM [Order Details Status] LEFT JOIN [Order Details] <br />
ON [Order Details Status].[Status ID] = [Order Details].[Status ID]<br />
GROUP BY [Status Name];<br />
<br />
The query returns the following result set:<br />
<br />
Status Name&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;StatusCount<br />
Allocated&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6<br />
Invoiced&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50<br />
No Stock&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
None&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
On Order&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0<br />
Shipped&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0<br />
<br />
Note the outer join to return zero counts where a status is not represented in Order Details.&nbsp; You can base a subreport on such a query, or, rather inefficiently, have a set of unbound text boxes, each of which calls the DLookup function, with a criterion identifying
 the appropriate status value, e.g.<br />
<br />
DLookup("StatusCount", "MyQuery", "[Status Name] = ""Invoiced""")<br />
<br />
I regret I shall not be able to follow up this post as I shall be away from tomorrow morning (UK time) until the week after next.<br />

 the list of email accounts displays "Attention Required" for this particular account. &nbsp;When I choose to "Fix Account", it responds with a dialog box with a pulsating "..." and then disappears. &nbsp;When I choose "Change Settings", it opens a browser window and
 takes me to my Microsoft account where I can change my Microsoft account password. &nbsp;But I don't want to change my Microsoft password! &nbsp;I want to have the mail client login to my email account using the password I defined for it and NOT the one I defined for
 microsoft.com. &nbsp;When I choose to "Change Settings" on my Yahoo Account, it prompts me with a dialog to change my password - no problem. &nbsp;Why does it NOT do that for the default account?</p>

            Thanks for your prompt reply. I am not very technically savvy, but I thought the idea of Windows 10 was that it is a common OS across all platforms? I travel a lot in a motorhome and want to use my phone occasionally as a PC using continuum - particularly
 to show BBC iPlayer on bigger monitor!

<h2>            What&#39;s the future - Outlook Tasks vs Wunderlist &#63;</h2>
                    <p>MS Office had a very powerful task manager built into Outlook for ages. It syncs to Outlook.com, and has two-way linking to Onenote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also has features that most online task managers lack (e.g. the&nbsp;task start date).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just recently, MS acquired Wunderlist and from Onenote's team AMA on Reddit it appears the Metro version of Onenote (the one that does not support Outlook integration) is going to become the focus of development and may get Wunderlist integration in the
 future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, at this point, MS basically has two different offices - the Metro / Online office and the desktop office - with different features, different teams, and it seems, different development plans.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes it very hard to commit to using MS long term as any workflow is very tool-dependent and there's no good explanation from MS on what the future would be for the existing tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, Onenote+Outlook tasks+Exchange&nbsp;is a significantly more robust package than Outlook.com+Wunderlist. Both from reliability and features standpoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However it seems trying to build a team workflow around this package may be a waste of time and resources if MS selected Office online + Wunderlist for future developments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone from MS comment on this without telling us to go to Uservoice ?</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Tiffany,</p>
<p>To narrow down the root cause of the issue, could you please provide us with <br />
the following information?</p>
<p>1. After the organizer received the cancelled appointment email, check whether the appointment was cancelled in the organizer’s calendar.
<br />
2. Has the receiver delegated the calendar permissions to other users as well?<br />
3. Will the issue occur if another user (not delegate) send the invite to the user?<br />
4. Does the issue occur to a specific user? For example, you can give the delegate permission to another user, then check if the issue persists.<br />
5. Please disconnect your account from the Outlook client, then give it a shot in OWA and check if you can reproduce the issue there.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Toby</p>

<p>3. We have not tested that, the organizer schedules all appts.</p>

<p>Hi TClarkNRI,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>Does “<em>this only occurred once</em>” mean the issue “<em>appointment automatically cancelled</em>” occurred once before and, now it is gone? If so, it’s hard for us to find the root cause of a temporary issue, and we suggest you keep monitoring it. If
 not, could you please let me know the results after trying the suggestion 3-5 above?</p>
<p>Regarding “<em>we've been having other issues as well with the organizer's profile</em>”, I suggest posting a new thread with detailed information. Then, we can focus on them to provide corresponding troubleshooting steps. Moreover, doing that will help
 other users experiencing the same issue seek out the thread more quickly.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<p>Sorry I wasn't receiving any updates to the ticket.</p>
<p>Regarding “the issue is still occurring”, may I confirm the issue refers to appointment automatically cancelled or other issues with the organizer’s profile you previously mentioned ?</p>
<p>The issue is still appointments the organizer is setting are still randomly being cancelled.</p>
<p>If it’s the former one, could you please provide us the updates when you tried the suggestion 3-5 in the post above?</p>
<p>We experienced this issue again this morning with another appointment.</p>
<p>3. Will the issue occur if another user (not delegate) send the invite to the user?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We did not try this since these calendars are belong to executives. We would need to set up a test account to try this.</p>
<p>4. Does the issue occur to a specific user? For example, you can give the delegate permission to another user, then check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>Again same answer as above</p>
<p>5. Please disconnect your account from the Outlook client, then give it a shot in OWA and check if you can reproduce the issue there.</p>
<p>we will need to try with a test account</p>

<p>Hi Tiffany,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue, it may give some insights to find the root cause if you do some tests. I will give you two of my O365 Business Premium test accounts via private message, you can access it by the following link:<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations</p>

</a>using the test account I give on the affected Outlook Client to check if the issue is related to the Client.</p>
<p>Besides, it’s also necessary to have a test mentioned in the previous posts using the accounts from your organization to find the issue cause and let me know the results.</p>
<p>If you need any assistance in the process above, please don’t hesitate to post back.</p>

<h3> joscelynmilstone  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to use conditional formatting for dates based on two cells&#63;</h2>
                    I have a due date column (lets say column B) and a paid column (column C). I want the due date column to be highlighted Green or Red if the date is this week (red) or next week (green), but I only want the highlight to show if the Paid column (c) is blank-
 meaning it hasn't been paid yet. I was able to use conditional formatting to highlight the due dates, but I can't figure out how to edit the formula so that it will only show if the paid column is blank. Can someone tell me how to edit this?

            <p>Dear JoscelynMilstone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the cells in Column B, which are required to be conditionally formatted.</p>
<p>Go to Home - Conditional Formatting - New Rule - Use a formula to determine which cells to format -
</p>
<p>Format values where this formula is true:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Conditional Formatting, use the following formula for highlighting the cells Red (This Week)</p>
<p>=IF(AND(TODAY()&gt;(B2-WEEKDAY(B2)),TODAY()&lt;(B2+7-WEEKDAY(B2)),ISBLANK(C2)),1,0)</p>
<p>Format - Fill - Red</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Conditional Formatting, use the following formula for highlighting the cells Green (Next Week)</p>
<p>=IF(AND(TODAY()&gt;(B2-WEEKDAY(B2)-7),TODAY()&lt;(B2+7-WEEKDAY(B2)-7),ISBLANK(C2)),1,0)</p>
<p>Format - Fill - Green</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have considered Sunday as the first day of the week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ensure that the cells in column C are actually blank.</p>
<p>In case cells is column C, appear to be blank due to the result of a formula, then the above formulas will not consider the cells to be blank. In that case, you can change the below portion in both the formulas</p>
<p>from&nbsp;&nbsp; ISBLANK(C2),</p>
<p>to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LEN(C2)=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula can be shortened if required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let me know if this was what you wanted to do, or if any changes are required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Vijaykumar Shetye, Goa, India</p>

            Should be AT1 not AT4. From your screen shot you are highlighting cells from AS1 and your "Applies To" in your conditional format list is the whole of column AS so even though your actual data only starts at row 4, your conditional format needs to start
 at row 1.

<p>
</p><p>Can I make the conditional formatting apply to other columns (I have them separated out by month, you can kind of tell in the screenshot) so that the same formatting would apply to say "AM" and "AY" or do I have to start all over?</p>

            <p>Hi Jonathan</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem today, and cured it by going to Control Panel/Uninstall Programs, selected MS Office Home..... , right click offers Uninstall or Change.&nbsp; Select Change (right click), which offers a Repair facility - Quick or Online.&nbsp; I went for Quick
 Repair and it did the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier in the day I got myself in a tangle with OneNote and the print option, which on reflection I suspect disrupted some settings.&nbsp; Anyway I hope this solves your problem too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, good luck against Germany on Thursday.&nbsp; England are out of it (sniff), so I am now rooting for your boys.</p>
<p>

            <p>I spoke to 9 different Microsoft support representatives via chat/phone in the departments of Account support, Technical Support, and Billing; over about a 6 hour time span. They sent me back and fourth to different departments. Billing could not help because
 I did not purchase the product from Microsoft, I purchased it from an online retailer. For the most part, their "solution" was to use the recovery request form, which I had previously stated to them that I had tried it already and it did not work. I did the
 request form again each time anyway and it would fail. Nothing Microsoft support told me did anything, but waste my time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up finding out how to bypass my phone system menu and reset the password with the phone reset code.</p>
<p>Since everything is automated and no actual human discernment goes into account verification, this function is absolutely flawed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Something isn't right on your PC. There is either a conflict, a permissions issue, or undetected malware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior Security Software?</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</p>
