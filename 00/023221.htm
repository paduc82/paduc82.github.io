<h2>            Office is installing in the background and it&#39;s stuck&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I just bought this new laptop and I just bought the Office home and student. I started setting it up and now it says "OFFICE IS INSTALLING IN THE BACKGROUND (88%)"&nbsp; it's been like this for an hour now and it's very disappointing because I can not find
 any solution to this.

            <p>Hi Deepa</p>
<p>Thanks for the guidance.I have tried everything but it does not work.When applying the fixit for deleting/uninstalling I have noticed sometimes the process activates the C Prompt command which also get stuck at the last sstep which reads something like "failed
 to delete Microsoft Office/Click-to-run suit.......(unfortunately I missed noting down the full line as the black screen closed itself and does not come up each time.)But it was some kind of code running in to several characters &nbsp;like {DAF8AA24-CF50-4D29-A5DC-E8AC5CDA395A}
 in C drive/Program Data. I have even used REVO and PERFECT uninstallers and wise clean to clean all files. However,I have been able to install office 2010 plus but 2013 does not install.Both are on small business office 365.Sometimes when repeated/applied
 fix it again,it does not run full and end up saying "click-to-run suit deleted &nbsp; not fixed" or even No issue found.</p>
<p>It is strange that microsoft keep introducing new versions led by greed for money but can not handle even the existing problems which only leads to more and more people changing to Mac</p>

<h2>            Internet connection timeout &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I use a Moterola Q9&nbsp; phones w/ Verizon service for data transfer.&nbsp; All is well except the Internet times out after 10 minutes if we don't refresh Mobile Internet Explorer(IE).&nbsp; The time out is due to inactivity even though there is 2 way comm by other
 software.&nbsp; It appears the the only internet activity that Verizon considers is thew IE.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I called Verizon and they were unable to assist me with the problem, wanting to sell us additonal equipment to fix the problem.<br />
<br />
My solution is to install a Mobile IE add on that auto-updates any arbitrary webpage on a 5 minute intervol.&nbsp; The problem is I can' find one.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
There are a dozen add-ons of this sort for the normal IE.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea's or solutions for this problem<br />

            Does the connection drop or does it just go dormant?&nbsp; It's perfectly normal for the connection to go dormant when no data is flow but as soon as data any data starts flowing the connection should go to an active state.&nbsp; When the connection goes dormant
 for you what happens when you try to access the internet, what error msgs do you see and are the msgs on the Q9 or the other device?

<h2>            HELP&#33; I accidentally deleted all of my Inbox emails</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I was deleting everything in my Drafts folder (which was just a bunch of forgotten emails that were started but never completed for one reason or another). However, after I deleted the Deleted folder, I went back to my inbox and it was completely
 EMPTY. I am a high school teacher and had emails from ever since I've started teaching. It's absolutely CRUCIAL for my job... Is there ANY way at all that I can recover these emails? I tried the Recovery feature, but the only thing I can recover is Spam...
 Please help!!!!!</p>
<p><span>UPDATE:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I went back to the Recovery feature, and it looks like they're all there now! But when I go to select everything, it only gives me the option to delete, not recover. Is there a way I can recover everything at once?</p>

<h2>            Project Summary task not obeying exception working hours.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a frustrating problem. I'm new to project but have basic understandings of how it should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a project which runs on a normal Gregorian calendar (mon to fri, 9 - 5).</p>
<p>We have an implementation section which requires a single weekend working with 12 hour days.</p>
<p>I have changed the project working hours to add exception days for the 2 weekend days when we are working and the auto schedule is now showing tasks on those working days as expected.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Saturday I have a total of 12 hours worth of work (made up of 6 x 2 hour duration) and this is indented under a summary task. On the Gannt chart, the tasks show as all being scheduled for the Saturday and stretch over the exceptional working hours
 I have entered in the project working time screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the duration of the summary task is saying 1.2 days. so everything above the standards 7 working hours is being said as occurring on an additional day. This is misleading to the project execs and I want this to show as one day as it is
 all part of the current working day, albeit an exceptional working day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me what is going wrong here?</p>

            This is by design. 8h is one day so 12h is 1.5d and so on. You can only set the hours per day conversion rate for the whole project, not per task. Either educate the execs or copy Duration to a custom text field and edit as you want. I recommend the first!<br />

            <p>As Rod says, there is nothing wrong with MSP, but there is a mis-understanding or a mis-interpretation of what it is displaying.</p>
<p>There is a good reason for the way it is displayed. Basically, "day" is an ambiguous measurement of a certain amount of time, and the way MSP deals with that is to convert it to a defined number of hours, which is not ambiguous, according to the conversion
 factor specified in File, Options, Schedule. You say 1 day= 8 hours, or some other number of hours, but you only get to provide one conversion for the whole project. "day" is only allowed to mean one thing.</p>
<p>A couple of ways to make this clearer, perhaps, is to choose to enter all durations in hours so there is never any need for the conversion, and always display the time as well as the date. Both are available in File, Options.</p>
<p>Also, provide an explanation for the audience so you don't have to endure ill-informed nit-picking.</p>

<h2>            Strange Office 2016 issues with Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a new Lenovo laptop with Windows 10 and Excel has been acting very strange.&nbsp; Here are some examples...</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp; When you edit certain cells and push enter, the format changes.&nbsp; The new format is not at all associated with any of the cells referenced in the formula</p>
<p>-&nbsp; When do a find and replace (both through the Ribbon and through Ctrl + H), it opens up the Find box instead (not Replace)</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Excel sometimes misses a command when using F4 to repeat an action or Undo (e.g., if you paste a cell and then insert a row and you repeat or undo, it does the second to last action and tries to paste a cell rather than the most recent action).</p>
<p>-&nbsp; A formatting plugin I have used for a long time stopped functioning.&nbsp; The plugin was working fine with Office 2016 on my old computer (Windows 8).&nbsp; BTW... the prior three issues occur with or without this plugin installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above issues are unpredictable... they occur frequently but not all the time... and have occurred across multiple unrelated files</p>
<p>
</p><p>All minor inconveniences that eat up a minute here or there, but I spend all day on excel, so it adds up.&nbsp; I have tried the following...</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Safe Mode</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Repair (both Quick and Online)</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Uninstall and reinstall (both standard and Unistall with a wipe of temporary files in between)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Totally at a loss here and Microsoft support was not at all helpful.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern about Excel can be due to the changes in the configuration of the application. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last activities performed on your device prior to your concern.</li><li>The version of Office 2016 that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/About-Office-What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788B8-A3CE-44BF-BB09-E334518B8B19?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend running the <strong>Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer Tool</strong> (OffCAT) to find and diagnose issues related to the application. To do this, we'd recommend checking this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2812744/office-configuration-analyzer-tool-offcat-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to know about the process of installing and running the specified software. The link will also show the steps to uninstall the software after you're done using it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Thanks Jelu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issues started a few days ago, but to be honest, Excel has never really felt like it worked "right" on this computer in the 45 days I've had it and installed excel (I installed Office 365 on the computer after uninstalling the demo version of Office
 that came with the machine).&nbsp; Small performance issues like there is a lag when switching between tabs and things of that nature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My version of office is Version 1708 (Build 8431.2079).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Configuration tool you suggested and it found 11 potential issues... one Cached credentials, 7 registry value, one Profile type, two Windows updates.&nbsp; I will run the windows updates.&nbsp; Not sure how to address the other issues and would appreciate
 your advice.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've checked the suggested thread, I'm not sure it would be the same case than mine since we're not updating the Notebook simultaneously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I tried again emptying the RecycleBin and manually synchronize but still the same: Deleted section comes back to the RecycleBin and syncrhonization fails (<strong>Incomplete sync</strong>.)</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>OneNote_RecycleBin/MySection</strong></p>

</p><p>I have left as is this problem&nbsp;and passed to something else but I just wanted to clarify that the actions on the proposed "Resolve misplaced sections...." thread didn't apply to my situation (nothing was being shown under 'Misplaced Sections' for me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I tried again emptying the recycleBin to remove the corrupted section I deleted back on april.
</p>
<p>After that I did a new synchronization and this time it work without error and the corrupted section didn't come back again to the RecycleBin.

<h2>            Microsoft Office Standard 2016 encountered an error during setup.</h2>
                    <p>When I try to install Office <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>2016&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>standard</strong></span> VL on Windows 10 1607 version, it would show a similar image as below. It doesn't have
 error code. The error message is "Microsoft Office Standard 2016 encountered an error during setup."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7fd5162a-de0a-4dca-aa60-032dc57a4434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7fd5162a-de0a-4dca-aa60-032dc57a4434" /></a></p>
<p>I have tried the below methods.<br />
1. Uninstall Office 2016, Office 2013, or Office 365 from a PC: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-Office-2013-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8 &nbsp;(Manually and the tool)<br />
2. Rename %programdata%\Microsoft Help<br />
3. Deleting the registry key: AppCompatFlags<br />
4. Checked to see if the Task Scheduler was running, it is, and to see if there were any tasks. Removed all tasks.<br />
5. Ran CCleaner<br />
6. Tried to find the Rgstrtn.lck file, but it doesn't exist on my system<br />
7. Reboot in Clean mode<br />
8. Disabled my Anti-Virus and firewall<br />
9. Reset Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure the issue can be resolved if I could roll back to Windows 10 1511 or 1507 or some previous version. It bothered me for a long time, please help quickly.</p>

            <p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate your efforts in exhausting all available options to address this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, does the Office 2016 Standard VL you're trying to install in your system come with a product key? If so, the only option we can suggest for you to try right now is to download the trial version of
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Office 2016 Volume License Pack </a>from the official website itself and enter your product key. Let us know how it goes from there.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have a product key. I think what I bought is&nbsp;Office 2016 Standard VL, but when I executed the downloaded file, it shows the following message.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd1a5c1b-ddb3-4d90-8057-5d7e636d212e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd1a5c1b-ddb3-4d90-8057-5d7e636d212e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why Office 2016 VL needs Windows VL edition.<br />
<br />
Maybe what I bought isn't Office 2016 standard VL? The downloaded file name from the Microsoft License center (https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/) is "SW_DVD5_Office_2016_W32_English_MLF_X20-41370.ISO".</p>

    <title>Will i be able to install android apps in the future&#63; &#40;please - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Will i be able to install android apps in the future&#63; &#40;please read&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I am confused in buying an android or a windows phone. but the lack of apps have always made me reluctant in purchasing lumia phones. all i want to know is that if i purchase a lumia phone today, will i be able to port android apps and games which
 aren't available for lumia phones in the future. considering the fact that my phone's hardware may not be compatible with some of the high end flying simulators available in the google play store, will i be able to install apk files in my phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem had made me think many times whether to buy a lumia phone or not. if this wasn't the case, lumia phones are a lot better than android phones. please help me take a decision. i am very worried as well as waiting for an option to choose from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Main reason for this question: So that i don't get disappointed or sad with the investment in purchasing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi Tony,<br />
<br />
We suggest you try turning off add-ins in Office 2016 for Mac. Please follow the steps below:<br />
1. Go to<strong> Tools &gt; Templates and Add-ins</strong>.<br />
2. In the <strong>Global Templates and Add-ins</strong> list, all installed add-ins that are running will show.<br />
3. Check or select an add-in to edit, or turn it off by clicking the + or – option. Click OK when done.<br />
4. Exit and restart the application.<br />
</p>
<p>If the Office application starts correctly, and the add-in you unchecked is causing the problem, we recommend you visit the company website for the add-in to find out if there’s an updated 64-bit version you can install. If there isn’t a newer version or
 you don’t need to use the add-in you can leave it unchecked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an article for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Error-messages-after-updating-to-Office-for-Mac-64-bit-b62d842c-b099-434f-af65-96cb03c03242?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Lisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is happening when you are using a different app or website, that means there is something wrong with the settings of your camera and it is not with the Skype app. I suggest you to contact your device's manufacturer to configure this further.
 Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Pasting HTML into Word pastes all as Normal, does not preserve heading information</h2>
                    <p>Some HTML, when pasted into Word, behaves as I expect and preserves heading information, converting h1 to heading1, etc. Most, however, simply pastes all as Normal. It looks like it should, it just doesn't act like it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked my cut &amp; paste settings, I always paste preserving source format. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it.</p>

            Your first post indicates that <em>some </em>such text converts from h1 to Heading 1, which means it preserves the Style information, but other text doesn't. In that case, it's likely that the text that doesn't convert is being pasted into a document where
 the outline levels (which is what the pasted HTML content actually relates to in Word) aren't tied to particular headings in Word. For a discussion of this and a macro that should resolve the issue for any given document, see:

            Hi Robert,
<br />
<br />You can send sms through Skype, but you cannot receive, those should be routed to to your smartphone. 
<br />
<br />As explained in the following article:
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA675/i-have-a-problem-with-sms-text-messages-in-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA675/i-have-a...</a>?
<br />
<br />I sent an SMS text message to my friend but they can’t reply. When you send an SMS text message from Skype, the recipient will see the first 11 characters of your Skype Name and they won’t be able to reply to your SMS text message.
<br />
<br />To resolve this, you need to change the sender ID so it displays your mobile number instead of your Skype Name. The recipient will then be able to reply to your SMS text message and their reply will be sent to your mobile (not to Skype).

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a31205ba-e94c-46f0-b2aa-0c5d5e20261a" title="robertpugh2">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Receiving SMS through Skype is not possible if you haven't set up your Caller ID as the recipient of your text message would only see your Skype Name.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For them to reply back, you can set up your Caller ID with your mobile number. The steps to do this can be found on this FAQ:

    <title>Issues with changing the color and thickness of ink strokes in OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whathebronte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with changing the color and thickness of ink strokes in OneNote App for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After the Windows Fall Creator update, I have been experiencing issues with&nbsp;changing the color and thickness of ink strokes in OneNote App for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I select ink strokes with the lasso tool and attempt to change the colour, the ink strokes increase in thickness drastically and cannot be manually adjusted or reversed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not face this issue prior to the Fall Creator update and this issue also applies to adding shapes on OneNote despite the thickness being already set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See below for screenshots of the issue:</p>

<p>- Repair by resetting OneNote App: Didn't work</p>
<p>- Completely Uninstall 365 Suite including OneNote App and Fresh Install: Didn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in a bit of a loss here and this issue affects my productivity. Appreciate help on the issue.</p>

            Hi Catwoman0828, 
<br />
<br />My name is Dmitriy, I am an independent advisor. 
<br />
<br />To Calculate the number of months between two dates you can use =datedif (starting date value, ending date value, "m") ("m" means month in here). 
<br />
<br />If you need calculate half of the month I suggest you use the same formula
<br />=(datedif(starting date value, ending date value, "d")/15) --&gt; which means that it will calculate days, and divide it by half a month.
<br />
<br />I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />Have a great day!       
        </p>

<p>Thanks to both of you.&nbsp; Unfortunately, neither option gives me the answer I need.&nbsp; The requirements are that I use an IF statement to calculate the number of months (to the half month) between dates.&nbsp; I need to know the number of months only (not days).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The IF statement must contain "-0.5" to calculate the half month if the "day" part of date is the 16th.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, using my example, it must provide the # of months between 5/16/19 and 12/31/19 = 7.5</p>
<p>
</p><p>5/1/19 - 12/31/19 = 8 months</p>
<p>6/16/19 - 12/31/19 = 6.5 months</p>
        </p>

            There is no need for an IF, you can calcluate the result directly, see screenshot below.
<br />
<br />C1:  =YEARFRAC(A1,B1)*12
<br />and drag down.
<br />
<br />If the days are not exactly at the half of a month (as you can see in row 4) you can round the result to the nearest of a half or full month:
<br />D4:  =MROUND(YEARFRAC(A4,B4)*12,0.5)

<p>Hi Cat</p>
<p>In my humble opinion&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think your instructor should reconsider or refrase the assignment given to you.&nbsp; As you can see there is different ways of answer your question and none of them needs IF statements. And all of us agree in that matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Catwoman 0828,<br /><br />Excel recognizes severa date formats, datedif formula shows you th number of days or months between the dates that you have entered. You can check the date format in the tab when you go to the format option of the cell. In my previous comment as I mentioned, if you need to count 15 days and excel doesn't recognize that amount you need to divide it by 15. Check the formatting and I promise my advice will be useful for the task you're up to.<br /><br />Thank you^^

<p>Okay, this isn't go as I'd hoped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, and most importantly, thanks to all who have responded.&nbsp; I was afraid my post would go unanswered.&nbsp; Second, I'm not an Excel expert but I do use it quite a bit.&nbsp; I have very little experience using IF statements because I almost never have a need
 to use them.&nbsp; Frankly, I find them confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I am taking an accounting class that requires me to create/revise spreadsheets according to specific instructions.&nbsp; So, when the instructor tells me I have to use and IF statement, then I have to use an IF statement.&nbsp; It doesn't matter what
 the most effective or efficient way is to do something.&nbsp; I just have to do what he tells me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already spent a ridiculous amount of time on this project and I'm not finished.&nbsp; I'm running out of time....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I've come up with to calculate Col E.&nbsp; &nbsp; This column needs to show the number of months (to the half month) between 1/1/19 (I7) and the Lease Exp Date (D16).&nbsp; I've copied this formula down and it actually works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I need to complete Columns G &amp; H only as follows (must use formulas/functions as specifically stated by instructor).&nbsp; &nbsp;Instructions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Col G: Using MONTH function and Budget Year End Date (cell J1), create a formula in Col G to calculate the number of months (to the half month) from the lease expiration date through 12/31/19.&nbsp; Column H must be subtracted within the statement to get the
 final result in Col G.&nbsp; To get the half month, I'm assuming I need to use part of the IF statement I used in col E but I've tried several adjustments and can't get it to give me the right answer using it with month function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Col H:&nbsp; Use an IF function to calculate 2019 rental income budget (do not use VLOOKUP).&nbsp; Of course, vlookup is easier but I cannot do that.&nbsp; The answer provided for cell H16 is $8,175.&nbsp; However, when I calculate this manually I get $8,275 so I'm not sure
 what I'm missing.&nbsp; Either way, I need to use an IF statement to get that number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or guidance would be much appreciated.&nbsp; When I finish this horrible spreadsheet, I have another to do.&nbsp; The good news is that I've finished everything on that one except for the IF statement (of course).&nbsp; First, I need to finish this mess!</p>

<p>Hi Cat</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the formula with IFS statement to calculate Budget in cell H16.</p>
<p>Step by step</p>
<p>1- This IF statement is to retrieve Old Rates</p>
<p>&nbsp;=IF(C16=1,C7,IF(C16=2,C8,IF(C16=3,C9,C10)))</p>
<p>2-This IF statement is to retrieve New Rates</p>
<p>=IF(C16=1,E7,IF(C16=2,E8,IF(C16=3,E9,E10)))</p>
<p>3- We have to multiply each IF statements by the respective number of month.</p>
<p>

    <title>Access 2010 Shortcut Menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesjoey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2010 Shortcut Menu</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create an shortcut menu for my forms, which I have never done, and I'm having problems. I've copied and pasted code example form an office blog but it just made thing more difficult. I only want 4 commands run and they are public functions.
 Problem is I can't make heads or tails form the example.<br />
Hopefully someone can point me to examples that are a bit easier to comprehend for a novice?</p>

End Sub<br />
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error Resume Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommandBars("MyBar").Delete<br />

<br />
' These functions are executed by the shortcut menu items<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "This is MyFunc1", vbInformation<br />

End Function<br />
<br />
' **** End of code ****</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can modify CreateContextMenu as needed. You have to run it once each time you change the code. The command bar will be saved with the current database and will be available in that database only.</p>
<p>You can assign the command bar as shortcut menu to a form, report or control by setting the Shortcut Menu Bar property of that form, report or control to the name of the command bar (MyBar in this example). This will make Access display it automatically.</p>

            <p>In the example that I posted, the shortcut menu items are set to display only a caption:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Style = msoButtonCaption</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want only an icon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Style = msoButtonIcon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and if you want an icon AND a caption:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Style = msoButtonIconAndCaption</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two ways you can assign an image to a menu item:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can copy an image (preferably of the correct size) to the clipbard, then use the PasteFace method of the commandbarcontrol to paste the image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you can set the FaceID property of the commandbarcontrol to the numeric ID of one of the hundreds of built-in icons. See
<a href="http://peltiertech.com/Excel/menus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://peltiertech.com/Excel/menus.html</a>&nbsp;for a free utility to display all the built-in icons (it's a bit cumbersome in Office 2007/2010 but it works).</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />
<br />To remove a contact from your contact list:
<br />
<br />1-Sign in to Skype for Windows 10.
<br />
<br />2-In your contact list, find the contact you want to remove. Right-click the contact name and select Remove from Contacts.
<br />
<br />3-The contact is removed from your contact list but will still appear in the Recent tab with a question mark. Right-click the contact name to see the options: Add to Contacts or Block This Person.

<h2>            How to prevent unwanted change in the font color in Excel 2010 spreadsheet on a windows 8 laptop</h2>
                    I am having a strange problem with Excel 2010 on a Windows 8 computer.&nbsp; I will create a spreadsheet with the font color set on automatic--which is standard black.&nbsp; I then&nbsp;save the spreadsheet and close it.&nbsp; When I reopen it, the font color has turned to
 red.&nbsp; Does anyone have an idea as to how I can prevent this problem.&nbsp; Even when I save the spreadsheet with a black font color, when it reopens it is always red.&nbsp; I can find nothing to fix this.&nbsp; Any help?

<p><b><font><font color="#000000"><font>Step 1:</font></font></font></b></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>You may disable any Add-ins/Plugins in Excel 2013 application and check. To do that, do the following:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>1. Open Excel, click on File and then click on options.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>2. In the Options Window click on Add-ins.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>3. Select Com Add-ins in the Manage list in the Add-ins section and click Go. Now uncheck the all the add-ins and click Ok.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><font><font color="#000000"><font>Step 2:</font></font></font></b></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Let us change the default printer to OneNote 2013 or Microsoft XPS document writer and then verify the results.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>For more information on how to change the default printer on windows 8, refer to the following link:</font></font></font></p>

</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If changing the default printer works, then you may update the drivers for the problem printer.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I hope this fixes the issue. If you still have issues, you may reply and we’ll be happy to help you.</font></font></font></p>

            Thank you Girish.&nbsp; I found no COM add-ins listed.&nbsp; I also tried other add-ins in the Manage list, and none are activated, so I couldn't do anything here.&nbsp; I also changed the default printer to Microsoft XPS document writer as well as to two other printers
 I have here, and none of those switches made any difference.&nbsp; I have many spreadsheets in my files.&nbsp; Every one I open now shows the default font to be red as opposed to black.&nbsp; Any other ideas as to what could be the issue?
