            <p>As soon as we detected that you might be hacked, we started saving your deleted messages in a safe place. In the left pane of your Outlook window, click the Deleted folder. At the bottom of the window, click recover deleted messages.
</p>
<p>Outlook will recover as many messages as possible and put them in your Deleted folder. If you don't see the deleted messages that you wanted, it means they're permanently lost.
</p>
<p>If some or all of your contacts have been deleted, you might be able to restore them. See Restore deleted contacts to your Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>Here are a few other things to keep in mind:<br />
Email sent to your old address will still go to your account.<br />
Remember to always sign in with your new address; you won't be able to sign in with your old one.&nbsp; Why didnt you warn me first?<br />
If you'd like to stop receiving mail sent to your old address, just delete that address in account services.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;and simply dropped down the box showing @live.com, @hotmail.com, and @outlook.com. I selected @live.com - then re-selected @outlook.com

    <title>Cortana doesn&#39;t do math calculations anymore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter njeim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana doesn&#39;t do math calculations anymore</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 10 Pro right now, the version is 1703, build is 15063.296. I&nbsp;<strong>haven't
</strong>recently installed a Windows update and I used to be able to type "5+5" in the Start Menu search box and it would show:<strong> 5 + 5 =
</strong><strong>10&nbsp;</strong>without having to click the ENTER key! This was literally the best feature as I didn't need to use the calculator app, I didn't need to click enter, it updated in real time as I typed and changed characters, and it worked with advanced
 functions like roots and logarithms</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: If I use speech, Cortana does still show the answer. If I say "What's 5 + 5?" She'll say "The answer is 10" with a calculator for further calculations. I am looking for only text answers without speech.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried typing many things like writing "plus" instead of the "+" symbol, used all sorts of functions, but nothing worked. I don't know what's wrong, I signed out and in again (not a restart). I will try restarting to see if it will work, but can anyone
 using the same build of Windows type some math equations in Cortana and see if it works? Remember not to click enter, it should show the answer by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone had this problem and found a way to fix this, please tell me, any help is appreciated (obviously).</p>

            I found the cause of the problem and fixed it too. I had&nbsp;<strong>MANY</strong> files indexed and a lot of them had numbers in their names. Whenever I typed a number that a file or folder had in their name, it would show the file or folder as the result.
 I'm pretty sure in the Anniversary update Cortana prioritized math operations over file searching because I never changed my index locations, and it worked fine then. I guess things have changed now, but I unindexed&nbsp;<strong>MANY</strong> locations and now
 I believe all the folders and files I've indexed have no numbers in them. I wish for there to be a checkbox of some sort to prioritize certain features of Windows Search so that they don't conflict like they are right now. I know you'll tell me to do that
 in Feedback hub, so I'll do that. Thanks anyways, my problem is solved.

    <title>Recycled email is giving me a lot of problems... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taffx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recycled email is giving me a lot of problems...</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Until recently I wasn't aware of hotmail's or now Outlook's policy about recycling emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that, apparently the&nbsp;<em><strong>very first</strong> </em>email that I've created since... I believe it's 9-10 years ago, has been deleted, and the ID was recycled and made available for someone else to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The funny thing though, is that I wasn't aware of my account's deletion, and ever since then I've been using that email as an recovery option for
<strong>most</strong>&nbsp;of my other emails. (I found out about this when I forgot my password on one of the emails and tried to recover it.) Now... the owner of my previous ID, is free to "recover" ALL of my emails, which most of them have sensitive information
 on them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also want to point out that, I've changed the security info on the emails I can remember... but it's going to take 15 or 30 days to actually replace that info (a feature of outlook or something). During that time, that info can be replaced, and my account
 could get a new owner ~~ (another way of putting it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What now...?</p>

<p><strong>Browser 1</strong></p>
<p>1. Login to hotmail/msn/live (where you want to grab)</p>
<p>2. Go to renames page or alias (whichever you like)</p>
<p>3. Type in outlook.com address that you want to transfer (do not accept yet)</p>
<p>Now you're ready to grab it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Browser 2</strong></p>
<p>1. Login with your outlook address (that you want to grab)</p>
<p>2. Rename this account to your gmail account (this will change your @outlook.com to alias)</p>
<p>3. Login with gmail, confirm through verification mail</p>
<p>4. Go to accounts page and close the account (enter password)</p>

<h2>            Select a text box but not edit it- Possible&#63;</h2>
                    When I select a text box I'd love to just select the box and NOT go immediately into edit mode. I'm CONSTANTLY pushing escape. I'd rather double click to edit a text box. Is there a way to default shape behavior to NOT go to edit mode when selecting?

<p>Open both workbooks.</p>
<p>Select the destination workbook (the workbook where you want to have the data copied to). Let's say your destination workbook is named Book2.</p>
<p>While in that selected Book2 workbook, select the worksheet and the cell in that worksheet where you want the data copied to. Let's say the destination worksheet is named Sheet3 and the destination cell is J5.</p>
<p>While on that destination cell J5, hit the = key on your keyboard.</p>
<p>Activate the source workbook. Let's say the source workbook is named Book1.</p>
<p>In the source workbook, navigate to the source worksheet and cell where the original data is. Let's say it is on Sheet1 in cell A1.</p>
<p>Simply select cell A1 in Sheet1 of that source workbook, and hit the Enter key. You will automatically be taken back to Book2 Sheet3 cell J5 where you will see the data in that cell which is still originally existing in cell A1 of Sheet1 of&nbsp; Book1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, what you will actually have is a link formula in cell J5. If you want that to stay a linked formula, it would be because you expect that cell A1 of Sheet1 of Book1 will change at some point, and you want cell J5 of Sheet3 of Book2 to always show the
 same to-be-changed value. But if you think the original cell in Book1 will remain constant and you don't want to keep being reminded every time you re-open Book2 to refresh the link, you can make cell J5 a static value as well. Simply select cell J5, and press
 F2 then F9 then Enter.</p>

            It does not appear that your account is sending mail. Instead, it appears your address is being "spoofed", that is, it is being used as the sending address of spam that you, in fact, did not send. It happens to most people at some point. You can ignore the messages and it should stop on its own soon.

<p>We're sorry to hear you have this problem and it could prove to be frustrating, but ultimately, have you tried doing a soft reset on your phone? If not could you try this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Enter *#7780# into your phone's keypad and when prompted for a passcode, enter 12345 (set by default).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also could you update your store client to the beta labs version and see if that has helped. But before doing so, we recommend you to back up your data. Here is the link to the beta labs

</p><p>So what you can do now is, copy all the files on the USB stick to another place. Format the USB stick as FAT32 and then you may create a UEFI bootable disk by running the commands below. These commands will create a bootable USB stick for UEFI purposes only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open a command prompt with admin rights and type in</p>
<p>
</p><div>diskpart</div>
<div>list disk</div>
<div>select disk #&nbsp; ( where # is the disk number of USB stick )</div>
<div>clean</div>
<div>create partition primary</div>
<div>select partition 1</div>
<div>active</div>
<div>format fs=fat32 quick label="WIN10_SETUP"</div>
<div>assign</div>
<div>
<p>exit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now copy all the files back on to the USB stick. You can boot to this disk and install Windows 10 on UEFI disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>I have to disagree with this statement my friend. I just made a bootable flash card last week, but I formatted it first to FAT32, then I used Media Creation Tool to this flash card with release build for my surface pro. It remained as FAT32, it did not change
 to NTFS.</p>

<p>Your welcome. I was just messing around with my surface pro original, so I tried the format in fat32 first, and actually was surprised that it did remain that way. I was under the belief as you that it would have changed to ntfs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been considering changing the basic disk in the surface to gpt to see if there is really any difference in speed, but have not figured out how to go about that. Little weak in my diskpart commands if that would be what I use to convert the disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I know is that I would have to do this from a bootable flash card.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried several of my machines in both UEFI and Legacy modes...</p>
<p>Or specifically GPT vs MBR... I notice no difference in total boot time or speed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is with a SSD as the boot drive though, which would hide some of the possible speed difference if using a HDD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the only difference I notice is that the initial manufacturer's screen is different...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only real benefit of the GPT that I can tell, is that it allows a lot more partitions than the maximum of 4 with the MBR drive...</p>

<p>Thanks slance, curious as to what changed in your manufacturer screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is an original surface pro with 128gig ssd, guess it would not make any difference with such a small drive. I just cannot recall when I changed it to basic because I think it was originally gpt. It still is like instant on.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a bit hard to describe, but the manufacturer's logo... ASRock in my case... Is of a higher resolution and stays on longer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The staying on longer part is due to it replacing a good part of the initial Windows 10 Logo and spinning dots... It for the most part goes directly to the login screen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time wise the end result is about the same... I will mention something I was reminded of today with the receipt of a new 128GB SSD... A lot of SSD's automatically reduce their Write speed once they get half full... One of mine has specs that specifically
 a 50% reduction... I'm not sure if the Read speed is effected... I don't think it is...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one I received today has a HUGE reduction to the point it must need a firmware fix or something... During tests of writing 20GB Acronis TrueImage files to the new 128GB SSD, the speed dropped from 380mb\s to
<strong>15mb\s</strong>... At slightly below the half full point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in contact with the manufacturer to try to determine the reason for such a large drop...</p>

<p>Years back I ran an Asus Gamer MB and there was a setting in the bios to turn on the logo to have it hide the boot process. Think my Gigabyte MB does the same thing. I believe that was the default setting. I always turned it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would probably explain why you are seeing the difference with UEFI and legacy. Take a look in your bios if you have the chance and see if you have a setting for logo on/off or something similar.</p>

            Uninstalling and then reinstalling (not repairing) is the only way the problem got solved so far. There might be another option, but nobody has published it so far.

            I believe that it may have required an adjustment to the Enterprise config, but the problem persisted at my desktop until I created a new profile. Apparently my profile on my workstation had gotten corrupted, no way of knowing how that had happened. Only
 indication was the&nbsp;failure of the email delivery report, so it will have to remain a mystery until new information arises.&nbsp; Let me know how it goes.

            <p>I can confirm this bug. The plain lines are exported to PDF as lines, so 0.5 point line will export as that same weight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When an arrowhead is added, the line is changed to a rectangle, not a line. After opening a similar PDF in Illustrator, it appears that PowerPoint cannot or will not create a rectangle thinner than 0.0093" or 0.67 points. So any arrow thinner than that will
 be 0.67 points in a PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please create a slide with graphics that show the before and after as shown in your post. Then click on the small
<strong>smiley-face icon</strong> in the upper-right corner of the program window and choose
<strong>Tell Us What Can Be Better</strong>. Describe the issue in detail and include a screen shot showing the issue. Submitting sends the report to the Mac programming team. I've already reported this.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your response. I do not want numbering on the headings within my document - just on the TOC. I've tried the steps from the article you provided, but then my whole document has numbering associated with the headers.</p>

            If the numbering should only be visible in the table of contents, you have to set up a multilevel list which is associated with the TOC series of styles (TOC 1, TOC 2, etc.). The principles described in the article at&nbsp;<a href="https://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html</a>
 are still relevant, but you will have to apply them to the TOC styles instead.

            Since two PivotTables can look identical,<br />
yet have different source data,<br />
the comparison has to be done at the source level.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Please wait while OneNote inserts the document&#34; never finishing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To take notes at school I primarily insert Powerpoint files into OneNote. They can be long and picture-heavy, but usually they upload quickly. But there are occasional files that take exceptionally long to insert into OneNote. For instance, today a 45MB
 file took over an hour to finish inserting. I started uploading the file 10 minutes before class started and it did not finish until class was over. I just get "Please wait while OneNote inserts the document" perpetually, sometimes the green bar is completely
 full but doing nothing. Sometimes the file never finishes uploading. OneNote will be "Not Responding" if I click anywhere on the program while this is happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 Version 10.0.14393. My Office version is 15.0.4893.1002. I have a Solid State Drive so my computer should not be taking so long to run this process- and none of my classmates are having this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried using the "Insert Printout" method on OneNote, going into the Powerpoint and using the "Print to OneNote" through Powerpoint, and using the Send to OneNote app. The slowness happens with any method. It only happens with specific files, and if
 I cancel the upload and try it again, it will behave the same way.</p>

            Yes, those are the steps I follow to insert files as printouts- and then it can take over an hour to complete this process.

<p>I didn't have this issue but it has occurred within the last week.&nbsp; I have repaired - offline and online - several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one point nothing happened after i asked for a document to 'print' into onenote.&nbsp; I am currently getting the 'please wait while onenote inserts the document' poopup witha full green bar but the document doesn't arrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to print from (for example) WORD or Adobe using the send to onenote printer driver then OneNote doesn't fire up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the inbuilt send to onenote link in Outlook is still working.</p>

            Instant Search should be able to search inside attachments, but some file types may require an iFilter. For Windows 8.1 and 10, there is a built-in iFilter for PDF attachments. WIndows 7 needs one installed, typically with the installation of a PDF reader, like Adobe Reader. You can also get stand-alone iFilter for Windows 7 64-bit from Adobe.

            Moment you click in search box in a folder, the search tab will be enabled. You can go to More and select Attachment Contains. Now, you can search within attachments also.
