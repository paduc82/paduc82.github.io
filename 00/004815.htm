<h2>            WiFi Sense Feedback</h2>
                    <p>I recently read in an The Register article (http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/06/30/windows_10_wi_fi_sense/) that Windows 10 will share your Wi-Fi key with your Friends' Friends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having to opt a network out of WiFi sense by putting specific words in the SSID is a potential inconvenience and/or problem. Most people would not like having this forced on them they may prefer to opt into Wi-Fi Sense key sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also having to have "my network name_optout" in order opt out is a potential issue if the WiFi hot point has a character length limit on the SSID and a wireless network's one is close to its limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for an alternative method to be implemented to either opt in to Wi-Fi Sense or another method of opting out (e.g. including something in the wifi signal as part of IEEE 802.11 standard in the transmission). Another alternative is to have Wi-Fi
 Sense check with an online database of opted out networks in order to prevent key sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The online database of opted out networks would be able to have entries posted by those who manage the specific wi-fi network.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical preview.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Wi-Fi Sense automatically connects you to nearby Wi-Fi networks, helping you save your cellular data for when you really need it and giving you more Internet connectivity options. Wi-Fi Sense can do a lot of things for you to get you connected to the Internet
 using Wi-Fi, so you don't have to do them on your own.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As of now we don't have much information about Wi-Fi sense option which you are asking for. Please stay tuned to Windows blog for latest update.</span></span></p>

            <p>I would like to beg on bended knee that this is NOT ENABLED BY DEFAULT on the final release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe it is acceptable to require people to change network SSID to stop Windows from giving passwords to people. I don't want to change my naming convention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe it is acceptable to connect me to unknown networks without specifically seeking to do so just because a friend has used it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe it is acceptable for Windows to transmit my passwords ANYWHERE without my specific permission. Accepting the EULA is not good enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe it is acceptable to have an all or nothing switch for this. Just because I have someone on facebook doesn't mean that I want them to be able to use my ip address to download illegal material or waste my bandwidth to download large files.
 I may wish to do that with one person but not everyone on my social network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am enthusiastic to run Windows 10 on all my machines but i'm afraid this feature is a deal breaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE reconsider.</p>

            Here's a novel idea--why didn't they set it up for an "opt-in" choice?&nbsp; Probably because they know that no sane person would choose that option.&nbsp; If I contact my cable company via e-mail, why would I ever want to give them any information about my network?&nbsp;

            There is a fundamental difference between the way PowerPoint 2008 and PowerPoint 2011 save movies.<br />
<br />
PowerPoint 2008:<br />
All movie files are linked. PowerPoint saves only the file path to the linked movie content. If anything happens that would affect the link to the movie (say move the presentation file to a different folder, flash drive, or another computer) the link to the
 movie won't work. In 2008 you can avoid this problem by saving a version of your presentation as a PowerPoint Package. Use the File menu and choose Save As. In the Save As dialog click the Format pop-up and choose PowerPoint Package. This makes a new folder
 containing a copy of your PowerPoint presentation along with copies of all the linked media and generates proper links to the media automatically. As long as you keep the folder's contents intact, the presentation will work if you move the folder from one
 directory to another, to another machine, or to a disc or flash drive.<br />
<br />
PowerPoint 2011:<br />
By default, all movies are embedded, not linked. This is a major improvement over previous versions of PowerPoint . In 2011, when you put a movie (or sound or picture for that matter) into PowerPoint 2011, a copy of the media is retained internally by PowerPoint
 within the presentation file. There are no links to break, and the media content doesn't have to be in a file on the computer because it is already within the presentation. You can think of the 2011 file as a package in that sense.
<br />
<br />
I am getting a bit lost in the question, though. Is it that you can not get any movies to play in PowerPoint 2011 once you have inserted them? Or does this only affect files that were made in 2008, and then subsequently edited in 2011?&nbsp; I'm trying to figure
 out how to reproduce the steps you took and/or the exact scenario, but am not having much success, I'm afraid. May I trouble you to elaborate with more details?<br />

    <title>Internet Explorer 10 on Microsoft Surface Zooming Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaron brewer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 10 on Microsoft Surface Zooming Issue</h2>
                    Ever since the update to Windows RT and Internet Explorer 10 a few days ago, everytime I view a website in Internet Explorer 10 RT, the viewport is extremely zoomed in...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To where the viewport size of the browser is as follows:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Browser Viewport Width: 342px</div>
<div>Browser Viewport Height: 192px</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This becomes an issue, because on even a phone, the viewport isn't this small... what's the deal?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I cannot "zoom" out or extend the Viewport width or height.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this an update issue or a device issue? I am using the MicroSoft Surface with the latest updates.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>
<div>Aaron</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Thank you for choosing Windows RT.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Based on the description provided, it appears that the Internet Explorer viewport size is less.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have these steps which should assist you with this issue.</div>

            No man, that did not help at all.  



We tell you there is a problem with our zoom. The tablet automatically opens IE with the maximum zoom available, and there is no way of changing it back (restarting the tablet wont work, theres no response to the settings in the menu etc.). Ive been getting problems like this over and over, and nearly always theres a microsoft employee who will send me to a FAQ website  were i can find a **** of a lot of info about what the tablet/software should be doing, but never has anyone actually shared a site or a helpful tip with me. 



So im still stuck with the same problem even after a **** load of research. 


Im getting immensely annoyed by microsoft and its incompetency to offer a decent productTheir service in regard to guarantees is genius and quick, but in regard to their products and getting help when experiencing issues with the programme is the worst (examples include microsofts website that automatically changes to the language of the country your locate

<p>However, how do I access files under this folder? I use X-plore and Y browser yet they show no file under this folder [even with show hidden files enabled]</p>

<p>That is really good news. This was the only down side to my move from Windows to Mac when I retired. I have had to keep an old Windows laptop working just to maintain my existing Excel file / tools that occasionally require updating and that involves macro
 development work.</p>
<p>My IMac 27" screen has just failed (luckily within a 3-year warranty so is currently being fixed) but this was enough for me to reconsider my move to MacOS and get a new Windows10 laptop so at least my Excel will be fully usable again.</p>
<p>I will wait a bit longer and keep my fingers crossed that a fully functioning VBA editor is on its way as generally I have been very happy with the move to a Mac and MacOS (although my wife has a new DellXPS Windows 10 laptop, and hardware and particularly
 the new Windows have definitely brought things closer to the Apple experience).</p>

<p>I'm happy this day is an important day for me.</p>
<p>I'm using a lot of macros and VBA module in my excel since 2003, so it's necessary to have this on my mac notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I can leave at home my oldest notebook with windows that I use only to edit the macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To use the virtual machine for this was another opportunity but, asks too much resource on my mac to be used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks and many thanks also for all&nbsp;the improvements done since today on the VBA functions in MAC. One for all, the not monomodale property for the forms.</p>

<p>Very good news for all Office 365 users on macOS! 👍</p>
<p>Will be there some information about possible compatibility problems between Office for macOS and Office for Windows? Will VBA on macOS support everything what VBA on Windows can do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope MS will extend their support/development for even more Office features like Pivot Charts that are still not available on Office 365 for macOS.☹️</p>
<p>Keep going and thank you for VBA on macOS 👍</p>

<p>You will get to try it very soon, as indicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a problem when using ODBC as a data source for a PivotTable. This was fixed last December. This is something to test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a known major blocking error. This code fails in the current crappy VBE:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>With ActiveWorkbook.Connections("ConnectionName").ODBCConnection<br />
.CommandText = stSQL1<br />
End With</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently there is not a programmatic way to initiate a connection. It is unknown whether this blocking issue has been addressed in the new VBE. My hunch is that it has not. If you join Insider Fast and can test this scenario, please do and file reports
 against it if it has not yet been fixed. However, if the connection exists, you should be able to program the resulting querytable using the reduced command set in Office for Mac:</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see lots of questions about object model parity between Mac and Windows versions of Office. The object model is completely independent from the IDE and thus is not part of this particular effort to revisit the IDE. The object model depends on having the
 actual features supported in the app, whereas the IDE is a separate feature that allows you to browse, edit, and deploy code that uses the object model that currently exists (and may change over time) in the apps. For example, Mac Excel does not yet have OM
 support for Pivot Charts because the app does not have an implementation of Pivot Charts to begin with, but if Mac Excel gains the Pivot Chart feature it should also gain Pivot Chart object model support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each app team is keenly aware of the feature differences between the Mac and Windows versions. There is a separate effort underway to greatly improve the code convergence between the Mac and Windows apps, and that will make it much easier to achieve feature
 parity. Due to OS and platform differences, the apps will likely never have precisely matching features and abilities (such as the security restrictions of the Sandbox on the Mac that constrain feature behavior). Stay tuned for separate Insider discussions
 on app feature and object model convergence!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, I will be offline for vacation for the next two weeks and will follow up on any IDE-specific questions when I return. To Jim's point above, Forms will continue to run as part of macros as we roll out the new IDE; it's just that the new IDE
 will not yet support editing existing or creating new Forms when we first release it. We will add that support in the future.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi Schwieb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes to something like being unable to make a connection via VBA, it's hard for us on the outside to know whether that's an IDE problem or an Object Model problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding making a data connection, clearly, a new connection can be made using the interface, so Connection is working as part of the application. The IDE understands, but can not execute, the correct syntax. The failure seems to be in the communication
 between the IDE and the Object Model. Is the Object Model at fault or is it the IDE? Over here developer land, we can't know. All we can do is alert you to the error and hope that it gets resolved wherever it lies.</p>

<p>The IDE edits (and test-compiles) the code.&nbsp; The app runs it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the code doesn't work right, crashes or tosses errors, it's a problem with the code or with the OM or its implementation, not the IDE.</p>

<h2>            OneNote change system language</h2>
                    I want to change the language from Filipino to English. It's only small but the dates that appear on my notebook just below the page name shows dates not in English. How would I change that?

<p>Hi Juan,</p>

<h2>            Lumia 1020 not recognized by PC when plugged into USB</h2>
                    
<p>When I plug my Lumia 1020 into my PC using the USB cable, it will charge the battery but the phone is not recognized by my PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lumia&nbsp;does not show up in Windows Explorer and I can not use the Windows Phone 8 backup app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!&nbsp; This is keeping me from sharing my high quality images with others.&nbsp; This is the whole reason I bought the phone.</p>

<p>It makes no difference what app you use. None will work until the phone drivers install. Thie has to happen to be able to use windows explorer to see the phone and interact, copy paste ect.</p>
<p>When the phone is detected by the PC four drivers have to load, this takes a while.</p>
<p>First, turn the phone off, all the way and connect it to the PC. The phone will turn on and hopefully be detected properly and the drivers will load. The pc has to be connected to the internet.</p>
<p>There are other things but try this first.</p>

<h2>            HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; How to perform a one to many mail merge&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a tough problem that I have never tried before.&nbsp; I am needing to create letters that are sent to lawyers.&nbsp; The problem is that the letter will be sent to one lawyer but have multiple clients on the same letter.&nbsp; Previously, that lawyer would get 30 of
 the same letters, but with different clients, sent to him.&nbsp; I am trying to have one letter to the lawyer with many clients on it. In my excel file, each lawyer does have a unique id.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Any help is MOST appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
<br />
Steven

            That would be exactly what I need if I can get it to run lol.&nbsp; I had both add ins Graham's and yours) on the tool bar and both would not run for me.&nbsp; So I deleted both and reloaded your add in.&nbsp; When I try and run your add in on the toolbar under "Merge
 Many To One" by clicking "start merge" it gives me the following:<br />
<br />
"The macro cannot be found or has been disabled because of your Macro security settings."<br />
<br />
So I followed the "show help" instructions of enabling all macros and it still did nothing.<br />
<br />
I then opened a brand new document to play it safe and it still gives same error message.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<p>In that case, you would select the Lawyer Name as the key field and the</p>
<p>&lt;Mr./Ms. First Last Name&gt;<br />
&lt;Lawyer ID&gt;<br />
&lt;MM/DD/XXXX&gt;</p>
<p>as the child fields.</p>
<p>See the example that Graham gives for how to setup your document</p>

    <title>Updating year with VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sduffield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updating year with VBA</h2>
                    <p>Two part question:</p>
<p>1. Is there a way to update MM/DD to the current year (MM/DD/YYYY)?</p>
<p>2. What's the VBA equivalent of the excel function Date(Year, Month, Day).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be that a single answer will get to both questions but if there are other suggestions on how to update the year in a date to current year, I'd appreciate it!</p>

The VBA equivalent is DateSerial(Year, Month, Day)</p>

<p>The VBA equivalent of worksheet function TODAY() is simply Date.</p>

<h2>            Disabling Outlook Add-In as Administrator Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to disable slow Microsoft Outlook Add-Ins that I believe are causing Microsoft Outlook to crash every time I try to open an email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read in the forums what I need to do, that I have to run Outlook as an Administrator, when I hold the shift key down, right click on the shortcut and then click on Run as Administrator I get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14bcb968-024e-49d5-b8ac-05bcc8ea586a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14bcb968-024e-49d5-b8ac-05bcc8ea586a" /></a></p>
<p>Microsoft Outlook is at this location, I've checked, so I'm completely stuck as to how to proceed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you getting <em>This add-in is installed for all users on this computer and can only be connected or disconnected by an administrator</em> when disabling the add-in? You are doing the right step in running Outlook as an Administrator. Let's try opening
 it using a different method.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>In the search bar, type <strong>Outlook.exe</strong> and then right-click on the result.</li><li>Select <strong>Open file location</strong>.</li><li>File explorer will open, right-click on <strong>OUTLOOK </strong>and select <strong>
Run as Administrator</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, please do not hesitate to post a reply.</p>

<p>Hello Valentineashioma,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post in our forum. From your description, I understand that the issue may happen to many users in your organization. There was a known issue that Outlook crashes when try to open an attachment. But it has been fixed after
 the update. It is suggested to update to the latest version of Outlook desktop client to see if it helps(Version 1812 Build 11126.20196).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn’t work, please try the following suggestion to narrow down the issue:
</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4026478/outlook-open-outlook-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Open Outlook in safe mode</a> and open the attachment. This can help exclude whether the issue is caused by the add-ins.</p>
<p>2. If it doesn’t work, please open the attachment in <a href="http://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App(OWA)</a>. Make sure that the attachment is not corrupted. </p>
<p>3. Please check if Outlook crashes when you open all the attachments within emails.
</p>
<p>4. If you can always reproduce the issue, please capture screenshots of the entire error message and the Outlook version number. Click File-&gt;Office account and you will see the version number.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to post back if you have any update on it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<h2>            What am I paying Microsoft for&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using Office 2016 - Outlook 2016 in specific - has become a HUGE pain in the a**.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Couple of weeks ago, an update of the Outlook 2016 seriously f**ked up all POP3 servers and I therefore lost a bunch of important emails, I therefore switched to IMAP. Just now, my Outlook 2016 went BANANAS and cleaned all my files and folders (like right
 in front of my eyes and all emails start to disappear) and starts to re-sync all emails. I have, once again, lost all my emails and have no f**king clue where to look for an email that I must reply in a short time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, what is going on with Outlook? And remind me why am I paying for this kind of sh*tty *ss so called "service"?&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. Stop bulls****ing me with all kinds of stuff like "check your anti-virus software blah blah blah", I am losing my job here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Damn it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I regret using such strong words in this post but I have really considered Windows and Office as a part of my life. That's why I have such strong hope for it to be perfect and for most people a computer equals Windows and Office, everything they do with
 a PC involves using the OS and the software Microsoft provides. The way I see it, Microsoft should stop putting that much thoughts into making new stuff rather than perfecting existing stuff. Consideration of that smaller bugs are not more important than innovating
 something new is wrong, it frustrates users when they are in need of something but that thing is simply not in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started everything on a computer from Windows and Office, I love them, that's why I want them to be always functional and perfect.&nbsp;</p>

            I'm on your side. &nbsp;I used XP forever and loved it. &nbsp;It crashed finally and I replaced it with a new hardware with Windiws 10. &nbsp;I get why everyone hates it. &nbsp;Its like having to crawl again. I'm still trying to find how to put a shortcut on my desktop. &nbsp;I
 know I can because it came with 3 shortcuts. &nbsp;Also still trying to get an answer to why I pay MSN when I have broadband internet service but, if I don't pay MSN $9.95/mo., I lose service. &nbsp;I thought my ISP provided service and it appears I have to pay somebody
 for browser service yet I was told Internet Explorer was part of my ISP service. &nbsp;People are creatures of habit and having to constantly replace my hardware and update the OS to a freakish and completely different windows with new programs I never ask for
 to manage my files and photos all I can hope for is Window 11 is a long way off.&nbsp;

</p><p>It sounds like you are paying for 2 services and are connected to the "wrong" one. so when MSN lapses you lose your internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contact your ISP to confirm you are paying for internet service and allow them to check to confirm that you are connected to it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, there is no plan for "Win 11".&nbsp; In Win 10 MS says it has switched to a continuously updated product:

            Thanks for confirming what I thought but couldn't get anyone to answer. &nbsp;Hate being taken advantage of especially when I talked to MSN on the phone and they insisted I pay for the dial up service even though I kept saying I didn't have dial up and was
 using cable. &nbsp;And Charter never explained why there was Charter.com and Charter.net. &nbsp;It appears to me that keeping customers confused is the name of the game. &nbsp;I also see that other customers are still asking this question. &nbsp;I'm talking about hundreds of
 dollars for service I didnt need. &nbsp;Thanks for clearing this up.

            Resolution is independent of the kind of display technology that is used.<br />
<br />
Resolution is about horizontal pixel count times vertical pixel count (e.g., 176 by 208 or 240 x 320, etc).<br />
<br />
Then there are different LCD panel technologies (which can be made in any resolution). Generally they are either "passive matrix" or "active matrix" type.<br />
<br />
With passive matrix displays, each pixel is turned on/off with a "duty cycle" during every frame. The liquid crystal needs to be slow in order to avoid flickering and be able to create colour shades.<br />
<br />
With active matrix displays each pixel has it’s own switch (diode or transistor) and the right gray/colour value is driven directly through the switch.<br />
<br />
CSTN is the most common form of a passive matrix display and TFT is an active matrix display.<br />
<br />
Active matrix displays are faster, and consume more power.<br />
<br />
How bright or how they are visible in dark vs. daylight depends on other terms you might wish to look up, too: "reflective", "transmissive" and "transflective" + also "backlight" and "frontlight".<br />
<br />
A display characteristic to also keep in mind is the number of colours or the so called colour depth, of the display.<br />
<br />
I'm sure your favourite Internet search engine (or Google, if you don't know of any others) can find descriptions (in Wikipedia or elsewhere).

<p>Unless you've done something like install a "custom" rom to the phone all you should have to do to reinstall the windows mobile 6.5 OS to your phone is perform a factory reset.&nbsp; You can check the documentation that came with your phone to find out how to
 perform a factory reset of the phone or if you post the make/model of your phone, we might be able to provide the specific series of keys to press that is required to perform a factory reset of your phone.</p>
<p>If you've installed a "custom" or "cooked" ROM to the phone, I don't think you'll find much help here, since there's no way to know what differences there might be on these kinds of unsupported operating systems.</p>

            Go to http://www.lg.com/fr/support/mc-support/mobile-phone-support.jsp (I've selected the French language page for you)&nbsp; and download the official upgrader tool. Hope it will be able to "downgrade" your phone. If it isn't, let me know and I take a closer
 look.

<h2>            How to change the plot area of a chart made in powerpoint&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys</p>
<p>I am having problems to alter the distance between the right side of the plot area and the right side of the chart area for one chart. When I tried to move it, two blue dotted rectangles appeared and it seemed that the big one was constrained. But the other
 chart I made is ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the OK chart:</p>

<p>the not OK chart:</p>

            There is normally no gap between the vertical dotted lines on the right side. I would try deleting the chart and re-creating it.

<h2>            memory card</h2>
                    I have a nokia 6230 which i bought second hand because a previous 6230 phone got broken, when i take the memory card from the old phone and put it into new phone it asks for as password which i never set, have you any idea how to use this memory card in
 my new phone? also, the reason i want to use the old memory card is because my new memory card somehow will not store mp3s sent from computer but is the same memory card as the old memory card and i did not have any problem storing mp3s with the old one, hope
 you can help<br />
thanx!

            When you apply a password to a memory card in one phone, you can use the card without password in this specific phone, but other phones will ask for the password when using this memory card.<br />
<br />
-&gt; You set a password for the card in your old phone.<br />
-&gt; You should try to recall the password.

 this code. Thanks.

            Well, let me tell you I am having similar problems and some more. I have research the whole web, many different forums and it seems to be a big problem with a lot of Nokia phones. (Before you jump in with your criticism search and see how many people actually
 complaining about this.)<br />
<br />
I was told that I have set a password for my memory card (micro SD 2GB Sandisk Ultra II, N95). I tried for days to put different passwords, but later I read what I supsected, I never set one (even if you set one, later it can not unlock with your correct password,
 somehow it gets corrupted).<br />
<br />
Lucky people have a backup of their memory card, but I even did something worse (never knew I can't trust Nokia software !!!). I backed up the phone memory into memory card and then updated the phone firmware (all through Nokia updater of course). All went
 well but now the memory card is locked so my phone can not be restored to it's old settings and I can't read the memory card.<br />
<br />
So now I have a phone set to factory default and a memory card with every thing on it but can not be read anywhere. Well done Nokia, and please those who say the problem is that we forgot our passwords, read 100s of complains about this. This apparantly happens
 on variety of phones and in some occasions the password is set by itself/or memory card locked somehow !? Or in some cases the password is set by user but then corrupted and if the same password is entered it doesn't work - and NO WE ARE NOT FORGETFULL, it's
 the problem with Nokia software/firmware.<br />
<br />
Now I have't tried formatting it yet as I still have some hope of recovery but I hear some people can't even do that. So the memory card is lost for ever....!? (How do they manage that ? Perhaps should give Nokia software writers an award just for that).<br />
<br />
By the away I have tried everything you can possibly think of but still no harm if you want to have a crack....<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />

I the card locked it self automatically as I didn't put any lock on it for certain.<br />
<br />
Also I'm not able to format it from the phone as well (and I really don't want to do this :( )<br />

            I had a similar problem with my E65 where the memory card locked with a password that I did not set.<br />
<br />
I found out that when you use remote lock it also locks the memory card with the same password.<br />
<br />
Does the N95 have the remote lock feature?

            I loked for it and it doesn't have this feature...and if it has I didn't set this remote lock password...<br />
<br />
I tried all passwords that I ever used on any of my phones, pc's and even friends phones with who I was conntected and nothing works...<br />
somehow I think that this is a nokia firemware bug I on the google many people have the same problems with their phones and cards as well

            Try this:<br />
<br />
If you have locked your phone (not the SIM card, that is Pin Code. I am talking about Lock Code). Then type the same pass but don't try to get the numbers, just press the buttons without trying to get the numbers (the Lock Code is numeric only but the Memory
 Lock can take letters too).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work try your other passes but in the same way (don't press and hold buttons to get numbers just press once - you get the letter instead).<br />
<br />
Good luck,
        </p>

            I tried the default lock code for nokiad (12345) and the one Ausin recomended but non of them work.<br />
<br />
How did you Ausin solve your problem? As I see it we had the same issue!

</p><p>ClassicShell already does this, and I'm sure MS would prefer people to stop using 3rd party apps to overcome their start menu.&nbsp;</p>

            I understand your interest in different options for a start menu, and I think it would be great to have different "themes" of start menus so that users can personalize it depending on their own preference, but I personally enjoy the search. Why add more
 clutter if you can just search for it?

<p>
</p><p>Not sure why you don't like it honestly. It is much more efficient and gets you to where you want to go so much quicker. The search was introduced in Windows 8 and clearly with the Preview they kept it because it was popular. Again, I can understand if you
 are used to it, but don't we all want to get to the same place quicker?</p>

<p>I agree on options. However, I think the issue you are describing with Win8 search was fixed in 8.1. I always just press win + type + enter and get the program I want.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is about options, the option to keep doing things the way we are accustomed to. New ways are not always better, especially to those who work on their computer. I tried the 8 preview and didn't like it, but when it was time to put together a new computer,
 the pre- release price for 8 Pro was too good to pass up(net $38.88 from Amazon). What allowed me to be at ease with 8 was the Quick Launch toolbar on the taskbar. I put 14 of the file and program shorts cuts that I use almost every day in it, reduced it to
 minimum size, and could reach everything I needed with 2 or less mouse clicks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If I want to tinker with the system, there is the right click in the lower left hand corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't use search very often, for me it takes too much time, I would prefer a well organized start menu. I don't like the 8 start screen and the 10 preview start menu even less. In the 98 or XP start menu I could find a program in 3-5 mouse clicks. But
 I, also, prefer efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that if Microsoft is going with a one system fits all product, they are going to have to at least include a wide array of options for individuals to customize it to the way they want use it. But I am not sure that would be practical. &nbsp;

            What browser and browser version are you using? Since engineering on MyPhone was halted some time ago, compatibility with newer browsers (e.g. IE9) may be the issue. I believe that IE7 was the last "officially" supported version.&nbsp;
