            Try uninstalling your antivirus(if you have one). That would solve it.

    <title>Trouble getting Teams Meeting Addin in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardsfr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble getting Teams Meeting Addin in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>On one of two Windows 10 computers I use, I have been unable to find a way to get the Teams Meeting addin to appear in Outlook 2016.&nbsp; On the other machine, with the same version of Teams but running Outlook 2019, the add-in installed automatically and works
 fine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have already tried the steps recommended in other threads: Re-install Teams as Administrator, then start Teams, followed by starting Outlook.&nbsp; But the Teams meeting button does not appear and when I look at Files &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins, it is not there in
 the Active, Inactive or Disabled lists.&nbsp; The log file in appdata\local\Microsoft\TeamsMeetingAddin finishes with the line "Version 1.0.19106.2 of the meeting add-in is now installed" - which looks good to me.&nbsp; But Outlook does not pick it up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also tried installing Microsoft.Teams.AddinLoader.dll manually by using the Manage COM Add-ins option in Outlook, but then I get a strange response that the dll "is not a valid Office Add-in".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone come across this issue and found a fix please?</p>

<p>Hi Shyamal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I am running Outlook in normal user mode.&nbsp; I don't really want to go as far creating a new user account and doing a clean install of Office, so I think I'll just live with this.&nbsp; I am able to set up Teams meetings from within the
 Teams calendar, so the inability to do it from Outlook is an inconvenience rather than a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Richard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do you download and edit contacts from mobile device&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Vista, Mobile Device Center, and my phone all installed and connected.&nbsp; I have synced 100's of times trying to get my contact list (phone list) to load on my computer in Outlook 2007</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tasks, Notes, and other items from the phone will show up in outlook.. However NONE of my phone contacts, numbers, names, or information appears anywhere in outlook that I can find.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas on how I can download, view, or edit my contact (phone) list from my PC?&nbsp; The display on my cell phone was damaged and I need to get some numbers and such from it before using the replacement.</p>

<p>I've checked and unchecked every option countless times... I've tried it on 3 different computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some reason the phone list / contacts are not being uploaded into outlook.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm starting to think the phone book contacts are not part of anything that is synced with windows.&nbsp; Only the calender and other features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible that the phone contacts are different and not compatable with outlook?</p>

            There is not compatibility issue. It should sync flawlessly with your computer. Have you tried deleting and recreating the partnership? Also, the contacts are saved on the phone memory, not the sim card, right?

<p>Yes contacts are saved on the phone.&nbsp; Nothing is on the sim.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, Everything else syncs just fine with the phone.&nbsp; I have alerts, notes, and events I entered on my phone showing up in outlook.&nbsp; ZERO contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One interesting and super cool bit of information I forgot to add.&nbsp; When this phone first arrived I connected my old windows mobile phone and synced it with this machine.&nbsp; I then connected my NEW phone and (after a few attempts) my entire contact
 list was upload to the new phone.</p>
<p><br />
So apparently the contacts ARE being saved somewhere on my computer and being uploaded to the phone.&nbsp; However i'd like to consider myself "somewhat" computer savy and i've searched for HOURS trying to find where the heck it is saving these stupid contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be backing them up in some super secret magic location that is hidden from everyone... And will freely sync / upload that list to any other mobile phones connected to the PC, however you cannot view or see these contacts within outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm really stumped on this one.&nbsp; Everyone i've asked says it just "works" and has yet to have any new or useful information.&nbsp; I really need one of these numbers and not being able to get it is causing a lot of headache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just don't understand why it would sync everything else with outlook.&nbsp; It seems as if the phonebook list on my cellphone isn't compatable with outlook or something stupid like that.</p>

            Contacts on the device are sync to Outlook Default contacts folder. They won't appear anywhere else. Try to connect your device again. This time, create a new contact on the device. Let me know if the contacts sync after that. It's getting late here and
 I'm a bit tired. I'll catch up with you tomorrow.

<p>Unfortunately I cannot create new contacts on the device.&nbsp; The screen has been destroyed (Replacement device is on the way)... Which is why i'm trying to get contacts off the device as I cannot see them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had this problem since day one when I could view the screen... and i'm having the same problem with my OTHER windows mobile device.&nbsp; No contacts are showing up anywhere that I can find them.</p>

<p>I still haven't been able to pull numbers off the device properly... I'm starting to think it has something to do with the sim chip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I removed the chip and placed it in my old phone so i'd have a phone while I waited for the replacement.&nbsp; I think that even if the phone boots up it won't actually sync contacts properly unless a sim chip has been installed....&nbsp; If you boot
 these phones without a sim chip it will load up and start with a screen saying you can only use it to dial 911 or something like that...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried placing the sim chip back in the phone but i'm gonna guess something still isn't right...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've basically given up.&nbsp; I have gotten my old phone to sync properly... and the new one arrived and is also syncing properly....&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I did to get the old phone to sync (as I have been trying it along with the broke one this whole time)... but its working now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help anyway!</p>

<h2>            Contacts in Outlook all gone after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I upgraded to Windows 10, all my Contacts under the People tab in Outlook/Hotmail have disappeared. Only the most frequently used emails appear when I click on "To" next to the body of the message. All the other names and email addresses are gone.
 Can someone from Microsoft Customer Support actually help retrieve those, please? This should not be happening.</p>

<p>Ever since Hotmail was taken over by Outlook it has been one problem after another. Before it worked seamlessly.</p>

    <title>Word 2013 vs Word 2016 Styles Templates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> faszikam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 vs Word 2016 Styles Templates</h2>
                    <p>I am currently learning more of the advanced style and template features of Word within the framework of a Technical Writing course. The instruction is based on Word 2013. Initial web research shows me that there are a few totally new features in Word 2016,
 but it seems to me that existing features in 2013 have not been changed in 2016. Certainly the ribbons look almost identical, except for the addition of these few&nbsp;new features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is this: what are the differences, if any, in Word 2016, as compared to 2013, when it comes to character and paragraph styles, template usage and creation, table of contents, indexes, etc.? And are professionally formatted documents and templates
 interchangeable between the two latest versions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What kind of problems might I encounter if I use Word 2016 exclusively?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            While I don't have Word 2016, the report from a fellow Word MVP who does is that virtually nothing has changed. There are some improved collaboration features, but that's about it (aside from current deficiencies in "style" options in the new grammar checker,
 soon to be remedied). Your professors should have no difficulty opening and reading your documents.

<h2>            Find multiple letters in Word</h2>

</p><p><strong>k</strong>at <strong>kh</strong>an <strong>g</strong>et sor<strong>gh</strong>um</p>

<p>Both the hardware and the software may be broken.</p>
<p>Is there sufficient free space on the phone, seen in the Files manager?</p>
<p>- The phone need minimum 25MB free on its 'C' drive to work as expected.</p>
<p>- Any malfunction or alerts, when you use the phone for other things?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were just given the C6-01 then I suggest discard it and get a newer phone.<br />
The official support for Symbian phones ended years ago, and in my opinion it is too much work trying to figure out what is wrong exactly. After that it is days and weeks to find and apply unofficial updates to make it work on the modern Internet.<br />
</p>

<h2>            My outlook.com account isn&#39;t syncing with my Outlook desktop app</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I am having some problems with my Outlook(Desktop), which seems to be having some issues connecting to my Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically Outlook has been a bit irregular in downloading mail from Outlook.com, and none of the rules I programmed in were working.&nbsp; Plus the bottom of the screen has been alternating between saying [folders last synced at (Time)][(!Triangle) Disconnected]
 and [waiting for server response][connected] for several minutes at a stretch.</p>
<p>Using the Send/Receive all folders button is only bringing up the sending options for my e-mail, plus a separate G-mail account that is syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First for information, my MS account I log into Outlook.com with uses a non-outlook.com e-mail address, I did have a little trouble setting it up origionally, needing to manually set up the exchange active sync and eas.outlook.com&nbsp;with some MS tech support
 help.</p>
<p>I very seldom use the online Outlook.com so checking that out brings up mention of an upgrade, has the upgrade broken my account so it can't sync with Outlook? if so, how do I fix it?</p>

            When I try to download the adobe flash player update it said that it was not compatible with my computer. Also when I try to download any updates to run programs my computer does not want to download them. The downloads keep saying interrupted and/or network
 error.&nbsp;It will not play any videos on any site not&nbsp;just on youtube. My computer is a HP ENVY dv7 with windows 8.&nbsp;I'm connected on a wireless connection. There is a second computer that uses the same internet connection, but has Windows 7, and I have no problems
 with anything. So far I have had nothing but problems with the Windows 8&nbsp;operating system.

<div>Nope no reply or helpful insight. This tech support is pretty pathetic. I figured out the problem myself. I got a faster internet and all my problems seemed to be fixed. So if your having the same issues that I did I'd start there.</div>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Starting in Version 1708 (Build 8403.1000) in PowerPoint 2016, Word 2016, and Excel 2016 for Windows Desktop, we’ve added the ability to chat with your coeditors in real-time, without leaving the app. You
 may have experienced this feature before on Office Online – today we’ve extended the capability to Windows Desktop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When you edit a document stored in SharePoint while others are editing with you, you’ll see their faces in the top-right corner of the app window:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c673761-d7be-40c8-b6d8-fb71f818b73e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c673761-d7be-40c8-b6d8-fb71f818b73e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To the right of those faces you’ll find the Chat icon, highlighted in the above image. When you click on that
<strong>Chat</strong> button, you’ll see a chat window pop up in the bottom right of your screen. Use this window to exchange messages with your coeditors and share quick real-time feedback.
</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As long as your coeditors also have support for this Chat feature (i.e. they’re on the latest Office Desktop build, or using Office Online), you’ll be able to chat with them in real-time, without having to leave the app.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Scenarios to try:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Chat with an Office Online coeditor from within Win32, and vice versa.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In case the chat window gets in your way, try hitting the
<strong>Minimize</strong> button. The window shrinks to just its top bar, and you'll see notification text on it when there are new messages to see. &nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Watch users enter and leave the document through the chat window's participant list and inline messages.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p>

<h3> nick zee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Direct Link To Image in OneDrive</h2>
                    Hello!&nbsp; Thank you in advance for your assistance!<br />
<br />
We use OneDrive for business and I would like to use it for hosting social media images that will be bulk scheduled.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To bulk schedule, I have to add a direct link to the image into an excel file.&nbsp; Each new post is on a new row. The bulk scheduler will pull the image automatically.<br />
<br />
Here's the issue.<br />
<br />
When I "Share" or "Copy Link" (from OneDrive, or File Explorer) the provided link is not directly to the file.<br />
<br />
<br />
Instead, I'm given a link like this:<br />
https://companyname-my.sharepoint.com/personal/username_companyurl_com/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?docid=1b68f79a4b4b44026967b46dafa1cc0e1&amp;authkey=ATqTdljmyP_qfhI5QLkMxAI&amp;e=fae4533f72334d8b82ad561a12928196<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Which, when opened, gets redirected here:&nbsp;<br />
https://companyname-my.sharepoint.com/personal/username_companyurl_com/Documents/Social%20Media/imagename%20Bay%20Covered%20Bridge%202017.jpg?slrid=f9e52a9e-70cc-4000-7645-397cc0afcce1<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
And what I actually need is:&nbsp;<br />
https://companyname-my.sharepoint.com/personal/username_companyurl_com/Documents/Social%20Media/imagename%20Bay%20Covered%20Bridge%202017.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Having to enter the copied Sharepoint link (guestaccess.aspx) into a browser in order to get the actual link, is a step I don't want to be part of the work flow.<br />
<br />
Is there a solution, or admin option, to get the direct link the first time?<br />

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to change the behavior of the link in OneDrive for Business. By default, only you should have permission to the image, so OneDrive for Business uses the guest link as a way to provide access to the image for anyone who has the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the situation, we suggest you submit your idea via <a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive?category_id=86090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Outlook 2007 Contacts phone number location information loop</h2>
                    I am trying to enter phone numbers into Contacts in Outlook 2007. As soon as I enter the required number, the location information box pops up asking for dialing codes. Like most other people who have asked this question, I have absolutely NO intention of calling from my computer even if we had the capability. There is no modem installed. At this point it doesnt matter what I enter, the screen will go into a loop. I cancel, it tells me windows needs this information about the location. Am I sure I want to cancel? YES - opens same screen again and loops. Am I sure I want to cancel? NO - same screen again, but I try entering the correct area codes and it brings up the Phone and Modem window asking for location information again. What the ****... I try to enter and save a new dialing location, click ok, and I'm straight back into the previous Location Information window and it just loops again. The only way now to close the program is with task manager and ending it through there. It doesnt m

            You must set a dialing location for your operating system so Outlook will know how to format your phone numbers. You don't do that in Outlook. You do it in Control Panel &gt; Phone and modem

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - default calendar displays - why does it always show the work week</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We just upgraded to outlook 2016 from 2010, and i got used to most of the changes except one:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The calendar:</p>
<p>
</p><p>for starters, you always have to double click the date within the calendar widget in order to load the actual calendar (or use the calendar icon - but that's not what I am try to get at)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, when you double click a date, it does not load that day, it loads the full work week, with the day you double clicked on as the end date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>outlook 2010: click a date once, boom it loads</p>
<p>outlook 2016: double click a date, it loads a full week, and the first day you see, is not the one you double clicked on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>needless to say, this is a major step backwards in my point of view and I cannot find options to revert this behavior.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>

            <p>One easy way is to add a unique letter combination to the autocorrect list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use File &nbsp; / &nbsp;Options &nbsp; &nbsp;Proofing &nbsp; &nbsp;Autocorrect Options.... &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and then in the Replace: box, type something unique</p>
<p>
</p><p>SR</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in the With: box, type the repetitive text that you want to replace it with</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sheryl Reynolds, Excel expert</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when you type the word SR &nbsp;(or sr) you will get&nbsp;Sheryl Reynolds, Excel expert. &nbsp;If sr is part of another word, that will not get replaced.</p>

<h2>            Android apps for Lumia 950</h2>
                    <p>I find it very frustrating that I have bought into &nbsp;what I think is a great Windows Phone, Lumia 950, however there is limited number of apps. Some very useful apps for trading, MovesCount, Strava, etc are not in the MS Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure how the management of MS can arrive at this type of conclusion not to support Android apps as there is a limited selection of apps. It is time for the the executives a MS to wake up and smell the coffee. Great toy no content leads to a death.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will someone at MS &nbsp;care to comment on this. I would like to know what the plans are for the flagship windows phone, and how users can install android apps because I don't believe the market is going to support 3 phone OSs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way everything else about the phone is great, but this one downside could kill the phone, and time is running out!</p>
<p>

            We understand where you're coming from and we appreciate your honest feedback. Application availability depends on the discretion of the publisher. It is their discretion if they will create a version compatible to your phone's software. In this case,
 the best course of action is to contact the developer.

            <p>if you could just "support" android apps, why would you get a windows phone at all? just get an android phone and run those apps properly. converting android apps to windows &gt;&gt; GOOD. running unmodified android apps on windows &gt;&gt; BAD.
</p>
<p>developers would also stop developing any native windows apps, as you could just run the existing android ones. windows app development would die off completely. and it would make the platform even more redundant.</p>

            <p>I am sorry but you missed the point, and if this is what MS thinks, then it should rethink it's market position. It is frustrating to hear the defensive statements from employees who have to tow the corporate line. Simply stated MS has got it wrong, if it
 relies on the developers to make the decision then MS is in a loosing position. MS needs to take control and not depend on the developers to promote MS platforms/devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same holds true for CRM Dynamics where Sales Force Dot Com has a direct relationship with it's end users/consumers which is why they are number one CRM solution. Maybe MS can learn from Apple who have a direct relationships with their consumers. I really
 don't have time for this, but the one thing I can say is that MS needs to get back in touch with the end consumer and not depend on its partner programme, 2 steps removed from the end consumer in this digital age is suicide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS lacks the basic consumer experience and approach to marketing.</p>

            I'm going to have to agree with TTarczy here. I have enjoyed windows phones for quite a few years here, much to the humor of most of my friends and family. Hardware wise&nbsp;they (Lumia 950 and 950xl)&nbsp;are probably one of if not the best phones out there. Software
 wise second to none, app wise is where Microsoft phones have been lacking from the getgo. The early press releases hinted that the new windows phones would be able to run both apps from the windows store and from google play, thus ending the only downside
 for owning a Windows based phone. Weather its stubbornness, pride, or something else all together to say that programmers and their companies should work torwards making programs for what is a niche market compared to the apps of&nbsp;android and apple is surmount
 to a kid throwing a tantrum cause the other kids do not&nbsp;do what he wants. I have been on the fence about weather or not I was going to get the new Lumia 950 (I was waiting for the 950xl which was originally supposed to be released through Microsoft stores
 and ATT exclusively, then only released in the Microsoft store). During this time I was using a loaner from a family member. Six months with an android based phone and the only reason I purchased the Lumia over the new galaxy was the capability of upgrading
 the memory to use the phone as a 20m camera for the pictures I do and can display, without having to use the cloud. But six months I held out just because of the lack of decent apps.<br />
<br />
(my two cents)

<p>there are hundreds of thousands of windows phone apps.</p>
<p>the second that you allow android apps on windows phones, native app development would cease to exist and you might as well buy an android phone.</p>

            <p>Let's try this a different way.&nbsp; None of the people posting here about Android app compatibility want an Android phone.&nbsp; We don't need a piece of junk, set-your-pants-on-fire, buggy, insecure operating system on a phone with substandard camera hardware and
 display.&nbsp; We just want the apps.&nbsp; So, how does it not make perfect sense to ask for native android app support (when it was already included (and then removed) from previous Windows Phone builds)?&nbsp; I don't care if the emulation is a bit buggy, put a freaking
 disclaimer on it that says not all emulated apps will work perfectly.&nbsp; At least then, my phone, which is (in my opinion) superior in almost every way to other phones, would do what I need it to.</p>

    <title>Calendar permissions - can&#39;t add appointment - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rachelharmon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendar permissions - can&#39;t add appointment</h2>
                    <p>I am losing my mind!</p>
<p>Its so simple - I have a work calendar and want to create another calendar with all the 'family' stuff on. Then when I look at meetings etc I can overlay and check I'm not forgetting things. Simple...... I have created a calendar on the laptop in Outlook
 for family events, no problem added it all and can overlap - but for some reason this calendar doesn't' show up on my outlook on the phone or on line. There is another calendar on outlook on my desktop that does show up on my phone BUT I can't access it or
 add anything. I've changed and checked all the permissions and I should be able to add appointments - but it won't let me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I either need to be able to see the calendar I've create don my phone or access the 2nd one that I can see - I am starting to go mad. I've searched forums and can't find anything to help. Been looking into the is for days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help and demonstrate I'm doing something very simple wrong!</p>

            Thank you but unfortunately I am the owner of the calendar so adjusting permissions doesn't help. All the permissions are set me to to add but just doesn't work . Very strange. &nbsp;

            <p>Gina's code will certainly work, but there is a query approach too. It does require a small auxiliary table; I find this table useful in many contexts and routinely include it in my databases. I name the table Num; it has one long-integer field N as the
 primary key, and I fill it with values from 0 through 10000 or so (you won't need that many but it's still a tiny table).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could base your Label report on your existing query; add the Num table to the query with NO join line at all. Put a criterion on N of</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt; [Quantity]</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will give you 4 records (with N equal to 0, 1, 2, and 3) if Quantity is 4. You can use this to advantage by including a textbox on the form with a control source</p>
<p>
</p><p>= [N] + 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you want to print out "3 of 4" on the label.</p>

<p><span>Hi imadden2000,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></p>
<p><span>Configure the following settings in Internet Explorer&nbsp;8 (IE8) to make sure that user id and passwords are saved.<br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open IE 8.</span>
</li><li><span>Go to Tools &gt; Internet Options.</span>
</li><li><span>Navigate to
<strong>Content</strong> Tab.</span> </li><li><span>Click on
<strong>settings</strong> button under <strong>AutoComplete</strong>.</span> </li><li><span>Put a checkmark on
<strong>User names and passwords on forms</strong>.</span> </li><li><span>Also place a checkmark on<strong> Prompt me to save passwords.</strong></span>
</li><li><span>Click OK.</span>
</li><li><span>On the General Tab make sure that the
<strong>Delete browsing history on exit</strong> is unchecked.</span> </li><li><span>Click OK.</span>
</li><li><span>Go to Privacy tab and drag the slider to the lowest so that it accepts all cookies from any website.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>This should do the trick.</span></p>
<p><span>Most banking and other secure sites will</span><span>
 not allow passwords to be saved. As such you may check on websites which have lesser security and see if user id and password get saved.</span></p>
<p><span>For help with Firefox browser, please post your query at FireFox support forum.</span></p>
