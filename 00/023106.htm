<h2>            There are too many active sessions connected to this mailbox</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've seen many questions regarding this issue while I've been looking this morning. &nbsp;The difference here is that I am just a home user of Outlook.com, I am not a sysadmin, nor am I connected to a companies exchange server, or any private exchange server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have, at most, 4 devices that I access this account from: Mobile (signed out), Home Laptop (signed out), Home Desktop PC (signed out), and my work PC. &nbsp;I just cannot see how I've got too many, or even any, sessions connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I am able to sign in to my account, I'm using it to post here, but I just cannot access my mailbox. &nbsp;I have cleared my cache in both my work PC (where I'm having the issue), and on my mobile, and restarted both machines, both are returning the same
 error message. &nbsp;The work PC is running Win 7 with Chrome browser, and my mobile is Huawei P9 android 6.0 with Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There must be some help for a home user who cannot access a server to change the amount of log ins allowed, as all of the answers on here seem to suggest I need to do.</p>

<p>Hi Janeane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue appeared to have fixed itself about 3 or 4 hours after I posted this question. &nbsp;I say it 'Fixed itself' because there was no obvious action from me that lead to a noticeable reaction, other than waiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already changed my password prior to posting the question, and this didn't appear to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem stopped while I was still at work, so I had not been able to access any of my other devices to double check that I hadn't been signed in, although both home devices were powered off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only assume it was something at Microsoft's end that was having issues, as nothing I did made any obvious difference.</p>

<h2>            Compact on Close crashes multiple databases from various versions of Access</h2>
                    <p>I have been working with numerous databases in the past few months from my Access 365 for Business through the desktop program. As a "developer" of databases, I have always had the Compact on Close enabled to remove extraneous data and keep the database
 from growing wildly large. However, in very recent weeks, Access crashes when closing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft Access can't delete </strong>[databaseName]<strong>.accdb after compacting it. The compacted database has been named
</strong>..\<strong>Database.mdb.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens for ALL databases, current development, production, and old databases created with pervious versions of Access. They are not split, I have sole access, I have read/write permission, they are on my computer not on a network, and nothing else
 apparent has changed. At first I thought it was a fluke; created a new database, copied the tables and forms over, and saved it. But it too crashed on close.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recognizing it was not a problem associated with a single database, I figured my copy of Access had become corrupted. Corporate reinstalled the entire office suite, including Access. Alas, the reinstall did not solve the crashing issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am left with copying the file name, saving, manually compacting, accepting the error, and renaming the Database.mdb to the filename.accdb.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone else experiencing this issue? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Compact on close is typically not a good idea.&nbsp; Your database shouldn't bloat regularly and this this shouldn't be necessary.&nbsp; If it is then you need to address the issue causing the bloating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the problem you are facing, what is your Access build number?&nbsp; Have you tried reverting or updating your build?</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the reply (sorry for the delay).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For years I have had Compact on Close, but since disabling it, even if ran periodically, it still causes it to crash and rename to Database.mdb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version I am using is: (this is the version that crashes on Compact on Close)</p>
<p>Version 1808 (Build 10730.20262 Click-to-Run)</p>
<p>Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried a couple of the databases on my home computer</p>
<p>Version 1811 (Build 11029.20108 Click-to-Run)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had no problem with this version (Access 2016 Pro)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1808 is the version offered by my company. I may need to see if they can force the update to 1811. Maybe that is the issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also, while I am building out the database, (not just the data but the structure, forms, reports, VBA) can that cause bloating?&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>Hi Joey,</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you would like to change the Office 365 update channel, here is an article you could refer:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3185078/how-to-switch-from-semi-annual-channel-to-monthly-channel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to switch from Semi-Annual Channel to Monthly Channel for the Office 365 suite</a>. The version 1808 is Semi-Annual (Targeted) channel and 1811 it the latest monthly channel.
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/update-history-office365-proplus-by-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update history for Office 365 ProPlus (listed by date).</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>About the bloating issue, I think it's mainly on the datasets and their index. Usually, if you use the database, the file size should grow. There are some methods to prevent it like Compact and Repair&nbsp;utility.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>

            <p>Hi Melanie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Let me assist you with removing the birthdays of your deleted contacts on your Outlook Calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To remove birthday calendar:</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to <a href="https://calendar.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://calendar.live.com</a>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>gear</strong> icon located at the upper right part of the page and choose
<strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>Edit your reminder and calendar settings</em>, click on <strong>Birthday calendar</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Delete</strong> at the top of the page.</li><li>Confirm <strong>Delete</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>To add birthday calendar back:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the dropdown arrow next to <strong>New</strong> at the top of the calendar page.</li><li>Choose <strong>Birthday Calendar</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Save</strong>.</li><li>Wait for about 24 hours for the calendar to fully synchronize.</li></ol>
<p>Let us know if the issue persist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Johan</p>

 computer(the calendar app)&nbsp;yet but Im guessing that the change will be done automatically on there as well once I update the apps.</p>

<p>I have been using my Dopod 838 Pro to sync with my company's Exchange Server.&nbsp; It has been working fine.&nbsp; Recently, I have purchased a HTC Touch with WM6.0.&nbsp; The ActiveSync is no long working with my company email with the same setting I used before.&nbsp; The
 following status was shown:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The security certifcate on the server is not vaild.&nbsp; Contact your Exchange Server administrator or ISP to install a valid certificate on the server.&nbsp; Support Code: 0x80072f06"</p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; The problem was actually caused by a Chinese Character Enabler software called CE Star.&nbsp; The software registration problem of this software somehow affected the Exchange Server authentication process.&nbsp; The Sync problem with Exchange Server was gone
 after applying a software patch for the CE Star.</p>

            I'm glad that you've solved your problem. I would never have thought that a software could impact on an Exchange server authentication process. Thank you for sharing that with us.

<p>I was wondering how I could put the root certificate to my phone. Since I am seeing this problem too:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>0x80072f06</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>on my Windows Mobile 6 phone trying to sync with Exchange Server, it says that the SSL Cert on the server is bad.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help, thanks!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>From a computer that has the root cert installed you can use Internet Explorer to export the root certificate by going to Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Content &gt; Cerificates (tab)&nbsp;&gt; Trusted Root Certificates (tab)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find the certificate you want and export it to your desktop. Then copy the cert to your device and install it using file explorer.&nbsp; Some smartphone devices are locked from installing root certificates so this may or may not work.&nbsp; If you have
 a Windows Mobile phone with a touch screen you shouldn't run into&nbsp;this issue.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought an LG KS20 touch screen phone running WM6 Pro. When I try to sync with our Exchange 2003 Server I get the error:</p>
<p>"The security certificate on the server is not valid. Contact your Exchange Server administrator or ISP to install a valid certificate on the server."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed the recommendations and installed the root certificate from the Exchange server and it&nbsp;worked while it was connected to my laptop) The instant I disconnected it from my&nbsp;laptop and tried to sync wirelessly I would get a massage on the device saying
 "Connecting" but then no new mail would show up. I tried connecting it to my laptop again yesterday evening from at home and the certificate error returned.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon doing some more investigation I realized that when my laptop is jacked directly into my office network the sync works. When I try to connect via the internet (either wirelessly via my laptop or phone) the sync fails with the certificate
 error. This does not make much sense to me. Could&nbsp;this be due to a configuration issue with the corporate firewall proxying the SSL connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any assistance you can give me.</p>

<pre>Hi KevinVan,</pre>
<pre>From your screenshot, I realized that you just connected to Office 365 online service but Exchange Online module. As this Get-Mailbox cmdlet should be run in Exchange Online module, so it is required to run the PowerShell cmdlets below to connect to Exchange Online:<br />1. <i>$UserCredential = Get-Credential</i><br />2. <i>$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook.office365.com/.../</a> -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic –AllowRedirection</i><br />3. <i>Import-PSSession $Session</i><br />Here is an article about the details for your reference.<br /><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a></pre>
<pre>After running the cmdlets above, then you can use the Get-mailbox and Set-Clutter cmdlets.</pre>
<pre>Regards,</pre>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>They said that contact group is not within the search scope, so this doesn't seems to be supported now. And they give a clarification that the Teams doesn't support to launch the IM conference involving a group of people at
 the same time like Skype for Business which make sense to explain why Teams doesn't&nbsp; support the search of contact group.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>To delete a folder you just need to right click on the folder and select Delete.</p>

<p>Other users have previously asked this question on this form but have said they only have a single button mouse. In that case, hold down the CTRL key before you click the mouse button.</p>

    <title>Start Icons are just blue after installing a new build - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Start Icons are just blue after installing a new build</h2>
                    <p>I currently have some icons on my Start from doing a&nbsp;Pin to Start in Microsoft Edge. When they were pinned, they had a&nbsp;blue box&nbsp;with the Edge (the e) icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the last two build, 10525 and 10532, the icons have gone from a blue box with the Edge icon to completely blue after the install. The only way I've been able to fix it, is to do an Unpin from Start and then a Pin to Start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Pin to Start I have for YouTube doesn't do this. I guess it's because it has its own icon.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 532 upgrade</h2>
                    Hello everyone. I am an owner of a Lumia 532 which has been upgraded to Windows 10, version 1607. It is one of the models that are not eligible for the Creators Update 1703. If I upgrade my phone to version 1703 through the Insider Program, will it extend
 its lifecycle till November 2019, or will it be supported till October 2018? Thank you in advance.

            It makes absolutely no difference. The OS lifecycle has nothing to do with support for a specific handset.

<p>Cox.net does not use an exchange server. Does that mean it cannot be configured to work with Outlook?</p>
<p>If there is another way, any assistance is appreciated.</p>
<p>If Outlook will not work with my device, how can I configure the "other email" to keep email messages on the server so I may still send and receive emails and keep outlook to have access to other emails. I can later get the email on my computer
 and synch it to my phone into outlook.</p>

<p>Im transferring a lot of excel data into a new program. However, in one column, each cell has a number in it which represents different categories. For example 5=Corporation, 30=Union, etc. I was wondering if their is an easy way to replace all of these
 numbers with the text that they represent. For example, instead of having 5,5,30 in each cell respectivly, I wish to have corporation, corpoartion, union. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>if you have the numbers let' say in column A and you want to replace for the name, in sheet2 for example create a table where in column A you enter the number and in column B you enter the name</p>
<p>Then in your sheet in another column you need to enter this formula</p>
<p>=index(sheet2!$B$1:$B$1000,match(A1,sheet2!$A$1:$A$1000,0))</p>
<p>the above will give you the names, then you can copy and paste this column as value on top of the column you have the numbers</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I think I was not clear you need to create a table in sheet 2 where you enter the number and the name associated to it in column B, then in your sheet you enter the formula given before and copy the formula down to the 5000 rows, it will bring the names
 for example in sheet 2 create a table like this</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Com</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ram</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Esp</p>
<p>in your original data you have in column A</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>when copying the formula I gave you let' say in column D you will see your information like this</p>
<p>Column A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column D</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Com</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Esp</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ram</p>

<p>you can do two things,</p>
<p>1) Paste it as value on top of the column where you have the numbers</p>
<p>2) Keep both columns and work with the one it has the names</p>
<p>It's up to you but if you overwrite the column that has the numbers don't forget to paste it as Values</p>

 after the symbol (but not always).&nbsp; Other forums try and point to a language setting but my install has&nbsp;only&nbsp;English (US) setup.&nbsp; Anybody know what setting needs to get changed to fix this error?</p>

<br />
The problem looks like you have a stray Asian Unicode font. I know you don't think you have BUT...
<br />
<br />
Go to HOME tab &gt;&gt; Replace &gt;&gt; Replace fonts and pull down the arial dropdown.<br />
<br />
Can you see the Asian Font at the bottom??<br />
<br />
Try replacing it with MS Arial unicode see if that helps.<br />

    <title>Lumia 640 Black Screen Unresponsive showing as QHSUSB_BULK in device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vecdid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 640 Black Screen Unresponsive showing as QHSUSB_BULK in device manager since trying to restore to 8.1 from Windows Phone 10 using Windows Recovery Tool</h2>
                    <p>I currently have a Lumia 640 LTE I can no loner use. It is currently at a blank screen and does not seem to boot. It was stuck at a red screen with the Nokia logo , but after a reset that the application advised me to do it is just now a blank screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I connect the phone via any USB port and I have tried them all it shows as QHSUSB_BULK under USB devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Windows Device Recovery Tool version 3.10.24401. I reset my phone first and that went well, and I was still Windows Phone 10. I set it up to the point of normal usage and then ran the tool. It downloaded the OS and started to do the restore. It
 then stopped and said it did not complete the update and my phone as stuck at a blank screen, while it was updating it was red, but it is no longer red and seems to be bricked. I have tried a few things suggested on the forums to no avail. I cannot find the
 hex file for the phone anywhere to try some of the other suggestions. I get basically no response attempting to use Thor2. And when I try the Recovery tool and select my phone saying my device was not detected, it downloads the emergency flash but is unable
 to apply it with error "Operation ended with Failure" .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Root Key Hash is 831BE6B18E7006372069545885A80F786C33D064904732D39EFBE0EC7019B5D4 from the image I found from the phone, but I cannot get it to flash and cannot find the hex file for it. I believe it is the right image, but even when I select the phone from
 the recovery tool it tries to install the emergency loader and I get an error telling me it failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so frustrated, I have done this many times without any issue in the past and ha d read about others having this issue, but have not seen it myself. Please advise, what can I do to fix this phone?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>This problem on my Lumia 640 LTE RM-1073 has driven me mad. I have tried everything and nothing has worked. I have spent countless hours and days. I finally decided to call Microsoft and get warranty service, and what a pain even that was. First to get a
 hold of the right person/phone number was a royal pain, but finally got someone on the phone for Windows Phone support: (888)665-4228 and (800)246-6542. Turns out there is a 1 year warranty on all Windows phones. So they had me go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobi...anty-checkers/.
 Only problem was when I would enter my IMEI number it said it was out of warranty, yet I bought it from the Microsoft store. So while on the phone the agent took my info, sent me an email and I had to take screen shots of my order email from November of last
 year and email the screen shots back to him. I now have to wait 2-4 days to get a result from the warranty dispute and supposedly a shipping label. If it was out of warranty, it would be about $45 to get repaired from what another agent had said. Either way,
 hope some of this info helps someone else as it truly was a pain to just get a hold of someone at MS. I would love to fix the phone in the meantime, but I just cannot get it to boot not matter what I try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was sent my packing slip to send it back to them for warranty service today!!! June D. from Micrososft was so great, he called me four times throughout the process and really made sure I was taken care of, where all the other reps who disconnected me,
 even after asking my call back number, never called me back and we are talking like 8-9 people. Thank you June D. at address&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** you truly restored my faith in MS. Someone at Microsoft should acknowledge
 what a great job you did handling my case!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

            <p>I got my phone back from Microsoft today. They fixed it, it looks like pretty easily. It is the exact same phone/IMEI number. Inside was a note that said Sympt: &nbsp;&nbsp;IN: 4100 OUT: 630 repaired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then another paper that stated the following:</p>

<p>Now I have till Nov 27th to check out Windows 10 and roll back to 8.1 if I need to, but after my warranty runs out, I will no longer use the phone as an insider, I'll have to make a choice between 8.1 or 10 before then because I don't want
 to be stuck with a bricked phone again.</p>

To sync the SharePoint calendar with Microsoft Outlook, we can click the CALENDAR tab &gt; "Connect to Outlook". Then go to Outlook and choose Calendar, select the correct account to view the calendar events.</p>

                    While multiple calendars in Outlook is great (esp. the overlay view mode) -- worthless w/ Pocket PC as can only sync to "Calendar" -- thus can't really have separate calendars if want to know all your various work and personal appointments.&nbsp; Really need

            Thank you for taking the time to submit a feature request. This is a great suggestion! I'll be sure to pass it along to my colleagues in Windows Mobile.

    <title>Can&#39;t Remove Sort in Excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Remove Sort in Excel 2010</h2>
                    <div>Hi guys<br />
<br />
I have a particular spreadsheet which downloads our business mobile phone bills and shows it by user so we can see who has spent what a month.<br />
<br />
I sorted the most recent bill by largest to smallest so I could see who's bill was the biggest but I can't seem to take the sort off! And I need to take it off as the way the spreadsheet works is that the bottom of the list has the most recently added people
 (like new starters on there), having the list sorted means that the list isn't technically in oldest to newest users.<br />
<br />
There's a filter there across the rows but with no active filter and there is a litle picture of a down arrow. However no matter how I try and remove the sort, it doesn't change order of the spreadsheet.
<br />
<br />
If I select the column (AV) with the sort I want to take out in and click sort, I get a message asking me if I want to expand the selection or just continue with the current selection.<br />
<br />
If I select to expand it, it shows no active sorts. If I continue with the current selection it does show me the sort from largest to smallest but when I delete the sort, it makes no change to the spreadsheet and the down arrow still shows?!<br />
<br />
How can I remove it? </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am surprised your work server data files are not being&nbsp;fully backed up frequently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggest you talk to IT people and prod them about that.</p>

<h2>            Nvidia GTX 860m still not working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded W10 onto my laptop with an Nvidia card and it does not let me play games with this card. It will say the card is not supported and the game will crash. I am forced to use the integrated Intel graphics instead, which is mostly useless. I've had
 this problem for a couple weeks now I was hoping it would be solved by now. Anybody else have this problem and is there a fix for this yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw I already updated my drivers so I don't know what else to do...</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many developers will wait until a later, stable, build of a preview product before they release drivers for that new OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend that you check with Nvidia support about their plans to support Windows 10.</p>

            The original post was pre-build 9926, the new build works a lot different.... On my personal device, the Asus G750, gaming with the GTX 860M works fine? Have you gone into windows update settings and looked for updates? This came up with a few display
 driver updates that ge-force experience didn't find on it's own.

</p><blockquote>Have you gone into windows update settings and looked for updates? <br />
</blockquote>
<p>I applied all Windows updates. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Nvidia web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into Device Manager and selected to update the drivers for the video hardware (both Nvidia and Intel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still the Nvidia and Intel video hardware were not running, but drivers were installed.&nbsp; I had installed drivers from the Laptops Driver Disk, maybe there is some system driver not working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently back using Windows 8.1 on this laptop and updating its drivers and Windows updates. I must have a slow Internet link as this is taking several hours.&nbsp; Kind of makes me reluctant to try out things too many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope there will be people who can use Windows 10 and report great suggestions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Thanks for your suggestion, and nice to know that the GTX 860M works on other laptops, which is why I am wondering if my issues is related to other bus hardware components and drivers.</p>

            Same at my laptop, GTX 860M won't work neither will the Intel HD 4600. I'm just waiting for the drivers and I HOPE that they come out fast.

            what I &nbsp;discovered with 860m and intel, is that by disabling and uninstalling both set of drivers, restarting, install8ng the intel driver for 8.1 os, first then installing invidia after. &nbsp;everything works smoothly. &nbsp;hope this works for you guys
