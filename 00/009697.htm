<h2>            Calendar tile on Windows 8.1 phone does not sync with server</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The calendar tile on my wife's Samsung ATIV SE Windows 8.1 phone stopped syncing a couple of weeks ago; it had been working correctly for a couple of years.&nbsp; No new programs or settings have been installed or made for many months, so I can't figure out what
 happened.&nbsp; Pressing on the Sync button shows the calendar attempting to synchronize; after a while it shows that the calendar is not up to date -- last updated about two weeks ago.&nbsp; There is also an error message, as follows:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>‚ÄúOutlook error</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Last updated about 2 weeks ago</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>We‚Äôre having a problem connecting to eas.outlook.com.</strong><span>&nbsp;
</span><strong>Contact a support person or your service provider.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Last tried 4 seconds ago</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Error code: 86000C09‚Äù</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did contact Microsoft Support and chatted with a very friendly, professional support technician who, in the end, was unable to solve the problem short of resetting the phone to factory settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary Microsoft account on the phone is my wife's Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More information: On her <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">desktop</span> computer, the Calendar Live Tile works fine.&nbsp; On her phone, she can use the Outlook.com account to send and receive
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">email</span> messages.&nbsp; Moreover, she also has a Hotmail.com account which works fine on her phone; it's also set to the eas.outlook.com server, exactly like her Outlook.com account.&nbsp; I have a feeling the Calendar Live
 Tile has suddenly changed its link to a different password, or something like that.&nbsp; How can I tell exactly what the Calendar link is (account, PW)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything on the phone -- internet access, podcasts, downloads, OneDrive, texting, Hotmail, her University email account -- works splendidly, except for the Calendar Live Tile, which suddenly stopped syncing two weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to simply delete the calendar tile and then reinstall it?&nbsp; If not, can the primary Microsoft account be switched to her Hotmail account and then back again to see if that fixes the Calendar issue?&nbsp; And if not, does someone out there have an
 elegant solution -- or even an inelegant one?&nbsp; (I know that I could reset her phone and start all over again, but that's a last resort.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--Heinz</p>

</p><p>The error code <strong><span>86000C09 </span></strong><span>occurs when the system becomes unstable and some system files start missing.</span><span> To fix this, it is recommended that you reset the phone. Do not forget to back up your stuff before resetting
 the device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>By the way, if you would like to change the primary Microsoft account on the phone, you will have to perform a reset as well.</span></p>

    <title>Calculating Exact Birth Date From 13 Digit ID Numbers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Calculating Exact Birth Date From 13 Digit ID Numbers</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div>I have a data set with some ID numbers down Column B. &nbsp;In column C I need to calculate each person's exact age from the ID number in Column B. &nbsp;The first 6 digits of the 13 digit ID number reflect their date of birth. &nbsp;For example B1=8310095017082. &nbsp;This
 person is not 28 yet, however, the following formula takes only their birth year into consideration, calculating them as 28, not 27 &nbsp; =YEAR(NOW())-1900-LEFT(B1,2)</div>
<div>Please suggest a more accurate way of working age out.</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>
                </div>

            Hi guys,
<div><br />
<div>Well, I have now tested all your variations of your formula's. &nbsp;I don't know what I did yesterday with whichever variation of the DATEDIF function it was, but I get them all to work! &nbsp;And even better than that, I have gone over all your posts, and I have
 learnt a lot about functions I had never used, like DATEIF and MID. &nbsp;So, for that I thank you, especially Sheeloo, but even more so to Jepeed, RonRosenfeld, Rick Rothstein and JLLatham! &nbsp;Your patience and teaching is commendable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sheeloo's formula -&nbsp;=DATEDIF(DATE(LEFT(B29,2),MONTH(MID(B29,3,2)),DAY(MID(B29,5,2))), NOW(), "Y")</div>
<div>applied to latest mentioned ID Number, return the wrong age.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Jepeed's formula -&nbsp;=DATEDIF(DATE(LEFT(B1,2),MID(B1,3,2),MID(B1,5,2)), NOW(), "Y")</div>
<div>using =now(), and</div>
<div>JLLatham's formula -&nbsp;=DATEDIF(DATE(LEFT(B2,2),MID(B2,3,2),MID(B2,5,2)),TODAY(),"y")</div>
<div>using =TODAY(), and</div>
<div>Rick's formula -&nbsp;=DATEDIF(TEXT(("19"&amp;LEFT(A1,6)),"0000-00-00"),TODAY(),"Y")</div>
<div>ALL work and return a desired result, although, in all the correspondence that has gone on, my mind is a little boggled over trying to work out (if it were imperative) which would be the best to use, taking Y2K, 1900's, 2129 etc. into consideration! lol</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm also trying to work out who to give the glory of the 'Answered' click to! &nbsp;Much of it has been helpful too!</div>
<div><br />
<div>But it has been great. &nbsp;Thanks gentlemen!</div>
<div><br />
<div>From Lynds (the attitude chick!)</div>

<h2>            nokia 1661 speaker volume</h2>
                    
<p>Can the speaker volume on my nokia 1661 be turned up? And if so, how? It is so quiet that to hear someone that I am on the phone with I have to turn on speakerphone or be in a completely silent room and press the phone really strongly against my ear. This
 is very annoying, does anyone else have that problem?</p>

<p><span><span>My Samsung Focus user‚Äôs manual recommends the SanDisk 8GB class 2 micro SD card.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I installed the card and formatted it following the procedure recommended in the manual. After installation I checked in ‚Äúabout‚Äù for memory availability. It did say
 that my ‚Äútotal storage‚Äù memory was 16GB but the ‚Äúavailable storage‚Äù was something like 5GB. I also noticed weird behavior on the phone and when I wanted to ‚Äúreset‚Äù the phone it did not reset. I removed the card, reset the phone and it is now working properly
 again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I do not know if I made a mistake in my first memory card install/format procedure. Can I go back, re-install the card and re-format it?</span></span></p>

<p>There is an issue with SD Cards and the Samsung Focus, mainly that you shouldn't use any SD cards for that device unless they're specifically rated for that device.&nbsp; In a nuthsell the WP7 requires a special high performance SD card specifically engineered

<h2>            Word 2016 for Mac&#58; How to fit a table to a full page&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I want to create a table in word that spreads over the entire page - height and length.</p>
<p>Following the first full-page table, I want to insert another one. So two pages, both with nothing but a table spread across the entire page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 1) </p>
<p>Now, I managed to create the first table. The problem is that there is a blank page before the second table - word automatically inserts a paragraph.</p>
<p>How can I get rid of this paragraph?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 2)</p>
<p>For some reason, the height of one of the tables changed. I cannot drag the table by hovering over it. I also cannot delete this paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any advice, I'd really appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you!</p>

    <title>internal memory limitation in Access&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flor.in  say:</h3>
<h2>            internal memory limitation in Access&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have plenty of memory installed on my machine.</p>
<p>However, Access 2007 gives a memory error when reaching slightly over 100 MB of used memory.</p>
<p>Is there any reason for that?</p>
<p>The database is compiled (MDE) and it has no other problems whatsoever, it only starts crashing after this invisible memory limit is reached.</p>
<p>I've tried many solutions, including importing into a fresh mdb front end, running it as accdb and many more, the problem persists.</p>
<p>Any thoughts are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<h3> tmucci  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t Outlook 2010 &#34;remember&#34; the last indexing after reboot&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Sony Vaio notebook, Windows 7, SP1, 64-bit,&nbsp;using Outlook 2010. It is so frustrating that the indexing has to periodically rebuild from scratch. I have looked at so many comments on different forums and there appears to be no clear cut way to fix
 this issue, as I have tried many of the suggestions, including a complete rebuilding of the index, installing SP1,diabling Windows Search (and enabling&nbsp;it again) disabling Windows Indexing, and a variety of other options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, as some have suggested, in the File---Options---Search---Indexing Options---Modify ---&nbsp;&nbsp; although Microsoft Outlook appears on the list of included locations, it&nbsp;does not show on the top section of the dialog box of "indexed locations",&nbsp;therefore
 not able to be disabled.</p>
<p>The indexing of 69,000 items takes a few hours. Once indexed, iIf I leave the PC on, or let it hibernate --- then the indexing stays active. BUT, if I shut down, or even if I restart the system, the indexing in Outlook starts again.</p>
<p>I did not experience this with Outlook 2007 on a Sony Vaio, 32-bit system using Vista.</p>
<p>Is there a solution to this issue?</p>
<p>Tom</p>

            Thank you for your response, but I'm not following. &nbsp;I followed your direction, but there is no option to change password on this 'change an account' screen. &nbsp;Only 'family safety', 'change account type', or 'delete the account'. &nbsp;The problem occurs when
 I manually type her password in at logon screen. &nbsp;I know I can change her windows password at account.live.com, but I don't think that's what you're suggesting. &nbsp;Please clarify.

            We both log in using our MS ID, and neither of us use 2 step authentication. &nbsp;You refer to logging out and trusting the mobile device. &nbsp;Which I assume you mean phone - but the problem isn't with a phone, its with my detachable laptop. &nbsp;And I still can't
 log in my wife only on this laptop - everywhere else I don't have a problem. &nbsp;Any other suggestions?

            <p>It's a pretty shady move on the part of Microsoft to cut off people that are currently using this service, even when Google still allows users to be added/removed to their own Google Apps free service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, I still need to be able to reset a password from the control panel, and this is the forum where you're directed to request that ability be enabled. There's nothing that states the service is being discontinued, only that new accounts cannot be
 created after some point in June. This is for an existing account in an existing custom domain.</p>
<p>

    <title>Syncing Samsung calendar to outlook.com calendar and thence to Oulook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wayne &#40;live.com&#35;ankonaskiff17&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syncing Samsung calendar to outlook.com calendar and thence to Oulook 2016 Desktop, is it possible</h2>
                    <p>I currently have a Samsung Galaxy S8+ that I have all of my calendar appointments on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first got a smart phone, I used the native Android/Samsung calendar app to put all of my appointments in, as more often than not, I was on the go and it was readily accessible.</p>
<p>Times change and I am no longer working and would like to synch the native Android/Samsung calendar ultimately to the Outlook 2016 (Office 365) calendar as I am at home and on my desktop as my default now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, I am having trouble finding via MS Community as to how to extract the Android calendar information and send it to my desktop Outlook calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The help I do see seems to be all directed to sending Outlook calendar to the phone calendar which is the opposite of what I need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried seeing if I could sync the outlook.com phone app and the android app. I have the accounts setup in now in Outlook.com app but have hit a snag there also. The calendar doesn't want to sync, even though the mail does sync. Along with this I have gotten
 a message about the calendar being HIDDEN but can't find a way to unhide it. As a side note, I have two different email accounts, one is a yahoo account which it showed up as soon as configured. The second account is a TWC (Charter) IMAP account and it is
 more problematic. To to flip between the two accounts I have to find this account in settings select it there to toggle rather than in the menu. I think this is the "hidden" component.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, I'm trying to use the outlook.com phone app as a means to an end which is to send to Outlook desktop app. There are features in the desktop app, and the Android app that I like that outlook.com doesn't appear to support on phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on how to relatively painlessly move my Samsung calendar data to my Outlook 2016 application would be most appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello Wayne,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, when we want to see calendar events in the Outlook client, we need to configure the corresponding email account in the Outlook client. If you don‚Äôt know the account related to the calendar in your Samsung calendar, we recommend that you seek help
 from Samsung support. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you know the email account related to the calendar events on your Samsung mobile, you can directly configure the email account in the Outlook client. You don‚Äôt need to move the calendar events to the Outlook.com account and then configure the Outlook.com
 account in the Outlook client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm able to see the accounts and the advanced settings in both the Samsung app and in the Outlook client as you describe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this has an impact but the Samsung calendar app is a freestanding app, whereas in the my desktop Outlook the calendar, email, contacts are all bundled up together.</p>
<p>I have my email configured between the desktop client and the Samsung EMAIL app. I can delete an email on the phone and it is reflected on desktop client. That all works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the calendar app on phone my options are:</p>
<p>Add Account-&gt;Samsung, Exchange, Google, Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync. ActiveSync wont let me add the the correct calendar account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I snipped out what is showing on the desktop client. I just added the Samsung Calendar but you notice the (This Computer only) flag. Somehow this seems like it should be a shared calendar but I don't know how to get that to change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, the email portion of the client and the phone app are working fine, just this calendar issue</p>

<p>Hello Wayne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a lot of research on the Samsung community and tests on Samsung S8. It seems the calendar cannot sync to the Outlook.com calendar manaully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no official article regarding moving the Samsung calendar to Outlook. However, I found some solutions in some third party communities. You need to back up all the data before trying any third party tools and contact the support there for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, any commnutiy members are welcome to share their insights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<p>You should never have more than one security product installed on the PC providing active protection/scanning. This can cause performance issues, system instability, and can hinder the
 effectiveness of both products at providing protection.</p>

    <title>Outlook - Flagged Emails Disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook - Flagged Emails Disappearing</h2>
                    Latest update of Outlook for Mac 14.3.4 was installed yesterday on a Macbook Pro using OSX 10.6.8.Now since rebooting the machine all&nbsp;my previously flagged emails are ignored.
<div><br />
<div>I use my flags to determine what client's briefings are still to do, so this latest glitch is more than inconvenient, it is actually losing me work!<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is an IMAP account and on other clients (I have Entourage 2008 also on an older mac) these flagged emails are still visible.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have not filtered anything out nor changed any settings here. In fact if flag an email, it appears for a few moments, then the flag vanishes and the email is reset to unflagged!&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Obviously I have a workaround on Entourage, but this is inconvenient, and on a slower machine. I often need to copy/paste urls etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I could perhaps restore the previous version from TimeMachine, and wait for a stable update. Not done this before. Is it an easy restore?</div>
</div>
<div>Any advice welcome.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Craig.</div>

            <p>Thanks for reporting Craig and escalating Corentin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, this is a bug in 14.3.4.&nbsp; Apologies for the problem.&nbsp; We'll get it fixed.&nbsp; Assume patch Tuesday next month (6/11) as a rough expectation of when.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, restoring from Time machine would indeed be the easiest way to get back to the previous version.&nbsp; Restoring just "/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011" will be sufficient.</p>

    <title>Some text only appears in the PDF document, not in Word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Some text only appears in the PDF document, not in Word</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Word document that has some markups. When I convert the document to PDF (using Acrobat or Bluebeam) some text appears in the PDF that does not appear in the original document. It is not a markup because I chose to hide all markups when I converted
 to PDF and, indeed, all markups are hidden. This mysterious text appears to be instructions on how to edit the Word document, which is a construction specification.</p>
<p>How can I see this text in the Word document?</p>

<p>Try displaying the paragraph symbols by pressing the pilcrow (¬∂) on the "Home" tab. Once they are displayed, do a find to see if the text can be found.</p>

    <title>Data label parts in subscript or superscirpt &#40;not axis - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sub212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Data label parts in subscript or superscirpt &#40;not axis label&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    How can parts of a data label be subscripted or superscirpted in excel (not axis label, that's easy).<br />
Even if I use =A1 (where A1 is any random excel box with a text that is partially subscripted), the final result does not display this format in the graph.<br />
Workaround: delete label, enter textbox with smaller font and fudge it until it looks like a subscript.<br />
Any more elegant method out there?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can manually edit each data label. Using the mouse you can click the data labels to select all the data labels for a series.<br />
The click an individual data label to edit it contents.<br />
<br />
If you use the Calibri font it contains&nbsp; superscript numbers. ¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ‚Å∂‚Å∑‚Å∏‚Åπ‚Å∞

            Try this in search &nbsp;<em><strong>Product key for Windows 10 Pro insider build &nbsp;</strong></em>as I see a lot of posting about this problem most are for early builds as many of them are having problems because of the lack of being active in the program,

I suggest that you use Windows Media tool to download Windows 10 Pro ISO file. Then load ISO on USB with Rufus tool. Do a clean install. Then join insider program again for upgrade to build 10547.

<h2>            Microsoft Works 9 not working&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    I have windows vista and my Mircosoft Works 9 will not fully load. The first page comes up that has the selections for Works, spreadsheet, or database however when I click on any of them, they do not load.There is no error message, it just doesn't ever
 load however is not frozen. It just appears to keep thinking. I have tried reinstalling it (I do have the original CD) as well as tried the repair option and nothing is working.&nbsp; Any ideas? I am in need of doing some papers and am needing to get this working!
