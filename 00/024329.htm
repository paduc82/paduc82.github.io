            <p><span>Hi Manoj,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If only a few mailboxes need to be migrated to Office 365, you can refer to the following articles to import the emails and calendars to Office 365 using the Outlook client. A version of Outlook client is required for this task.</span></p>
<p><span>Export or backup email, contacts, and calendar to an Outlook .pst file:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a large number of mailboxes and the email server supports IMAP, you can try IMAP migration described in the following article:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please note IMAP migration only migrate items in a user's inbox or other mail folders. This type of migration doesn’t migrate contacts, calendar items, or tasks.</span></p>

<h2>            Started getting error&#58;  object doesn&#39;t support this property or method</h2>
                    <p>I use IE8 with Windows 7 - I started having the following issue 4 days ago.&nbsp; Didn't do any changes/updates on my computer so not sure why this is happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use duckduckgo as search provider - on searches i'm randomly getting the following errors.&nbsp; There is no rhyme or reason that I can discern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did all the troubleshooting listed on other posts with same issue and still get errors.&nbsp; Put in email to duckduckgo also, but I suspect it's not from their end where the problem is happening.</p>

<p>You could use Developer Tools, Script Debugger to get some context for that column address.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pretty long line?&nbsp; In fact, it probably means that the script is obfuscated and setting a breakpoint there may be difficult or impossible.</p>
<p>Downloading that file shows that all lines are 1024 characters, so it is not possible to guess using Notepad where line 3 and that Char offset would be.&nbsp; E.g. what would be the lengths of the&nbsp;first two "lines"?&nbsp; If this had been reported as being a problem
 in line 1 we might have been able to infer something better by dividing the 128325 by 1024 and computing the remainder as a line and offset in the Notepad window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asking for&nbsp;help from the host support is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; They will help you identify what that context is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, what is the consequence of this error message (diagnostic)?&nbsp; Is it preventing you from doing something?&nbsp; If not just hide it.&nbsp;&nbsp; IE9 and IE10 do a better job of hiding script diagnostics so you may want to try either of them instead.&nbsp; E.g. then
 you would only see&nbsp;script messages&nbsp;if you went looking for them, either in the Developer Tools, Console tab or in&nbsp;the (unnecessarily disruptive) popup warnings (if you allowed those).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Good luck</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; First off i'm not super tech savvy when it comes to this type of issue.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with getting these errors - they show up in lower left corner and most times don't allow pages to load.&nbsp; Today I've encountered the script errors on other sites - even got one on this site:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'm not sure what is happening.&nbsp; I know i'm using an older version of IE, but these errors only began within last week.&nbsp; I'm now certain it's IE and not the duckduckgo site since it's happening on other sites.&nbsp; Also not getting script errors when I try
 in firefox.&nbsp; All my settings in tools, advanced are set per suggested by msft to avoid script errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said I'm not savvy with this type of issue - just thought someone might know at least why it's happening.&nbsp; I might need to let go of using version 8 as much as I love it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Michelle</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They don't show up there any more in later versions.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned they are now hidden in the Developer Tools, Console tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;an error is preventing the page from loading it may be an idea to see what happens if you disable scripting entirely for that site.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. either put it into your Restricted Sites zone or use the Level slider to set the standard Internet zone to High.&nbsp;
 Notice that most sites would not allow you to post but most would allow you to see at least a warning about not allowing scripting.&nbsp; Then there would not be any script error messages because scripting was not being used.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another, less practical, option would be setting Active Scripting to Prompt and then finding a path through the prompts which minimized errors and maximized output.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. reply Yes as much as possible but No when you wanted to see if it would avoid an error
 and not impact your final result too much.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, this is a very coarse tool with no memory.&nbsp; You can change it via Custom Settings in the Security Settings dialog.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today I've encountered the script errors on other sites - even got one on this site:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Now all of your examples are showing&nbsp; Line 0&nbsp; Char 0&nbsp; which is clearly nonsense, unless this is a symptom that they need to be "signed".&nbsp; I'm not sure what that means for a script, unless it is happening because they were sent via GZIP?&nbsp; FWIW the only reason
 that I am mentioning this is that each time I try to use right-click Save As... on the example .js files and just do that I'm getting a warning to that effect.&nbsp; Bizarre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I think you are going to have to use the Script Debugger to break on error and find out what the actual error is that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Good luck</p>

<p>My Lumia 950 ran hot today 21.st of Dec. 2015</p>
<p>I suspect a faulty application.</p>
<p>I have removed the battery &nbsp;now and let the phone cool off for 5 min.</p>
<p>After reassembly my Lumia does not heat up again, which makes me suspect NRK's news application which was indeed stalling on a video just before this happened.</p>
<p>My Lumia is normally cool even with both wifi and 4G mobile data active.</p>
<p>And by the end of writing this I have postponed posting this for 30 min. and my 950 is still cool. So my conclusion is that the NRK application caused my phone to heat up.&nbsp;</p>
Battery life is good too.
<p>I hope you find what's causing your problem.&nbsp;</p>

            My Lumia 950 began to run hot &amp; have less than 4 hour battery life after I turned on location services and turned them off because they didn't even work in Miami. This is the worst phone I have ever owned.

<p>Same problem. It appears that some application had crashed and is dranning the battery by consuming too much CPU.</p>
<p>If you turn off the phone it will get cool again and the battery will stop being drained.</p>

            I had the same issue. What it turned out to be was there were updates that were trying to complete. The updates continued to fail and restarting. The solution that I had to do was reset the phone back to factory and then restore it. Open up your app store
 and see if there any updates failing.

</p><blockquote>I have recently purchased the Lumina 950 and it is warm/hot to the touch and the battery life is extremely short.&nbsp; The Rep&nbsp;at the Microsoft store it was because my Wi-Fi was continually on and should be turned-off. This solution
 does not appear to have solved the issue or I think it has helped.&nbsp; Any thoughts?&nbsp; Thank you!
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot get thru a day on a battery.&nbsp; My phone lasts for about 8 hours.&nbsp; One of many many many problems with this phone.&nbsp; The idea that you should shut Wi-Fi off is ridiculous!&nbsp; Why should we have to do something like that?&nbsp; It doesn't solve the problem
 anyway.</p>

            <p>The issue for me was update constantly going. I also only had to do a restore on my phone. I also unfortunately got rid of my 950 due to many problems, which was disappointing because I was a huge Microsoft phonefan.</p>

            Hi, had my phone now for 8 days, i am constantly looking at my battery life, I listed my old phone on eBay the other night, and it took 36% of my battery and got really warm. I don't think this is normal. Just posting this reply, I have lost 6%!!! Is my
 phone faulty?

<h2>            Can&#39;t install Office 2013 &#40;on Windows 7 machine&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This is a new Dell laptop.&nbsp; Sorry in advance if I am giving too much detail below.&nbsp;&nbsp; Advice is sought.</p>
<p>[Microsft]&nbsp;MS tells me&nbsp;(after I click&nbsp;&nbsp;on 'already purchased a different version of office) to do 4&nbsp;things:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Click the "Download Now" button.&nbsp; I click and a screen pops up asking if I want to run or save the Setup file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;I click&nbsp;a menu and save to desktop.&nbsp; (Task 2 of MS's list)</p>
<p>An icon appears on the desktop, checking its properties it is seen to be about 500KB in size.</p>
<p>3. Step 3 is to double click on the icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By now, however,&nbsp;a pop upappears and&nbsp;asks if I want to run or . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; I variously have either&nbsp;ignored this and double clicked the icon directly or I have toldl the pop up I want to run the file.</p>
<p>A new pop up appears that warns me of the dangers of the internet and asks if I [really] want to do what I am trying to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; I click "run,' then yet another pop up asks if I want to allow the program to make changes to the computer, I [wearily] click yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few seconds later the error message, "Something went wrong.&nbsp; Office can't do that right now because your product is busy with another atsk.&nbsp; Please wait for this task to complete and try again."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have waited, I have followed help instructions regarding "repair," regarding "uninstalling,"&nbsp; and I have no idea what "other tasks" refers to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have allowed differing amounts of time between steps.&nbsp; Always the same error message appears.&nbsp; I have never gotten to MS's step 4. "When promped type...Product Key and follow on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

How much time is allowed for the examination?<br />
Is the use of electronic devices allowed during the exam?<br />
<br />
Excel uses VBA not Python for programming.<br />
Creating that function using VBA is pretty simple.<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t clear flagged message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terradon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t clear flagged message</h2>
                    <p>Apparently I deleted a message from my inbox that was flagged for follow up. The message is still showing in the For Follow Up search folder. But if I try to clear the flag, I get an error that the message can't be found.</p>
<p>All accounts are POP3 accounts.</p>
<p>I have run scanpst on both the current and archive pst. Errors were found and corrected. I then closed Outlook, rebooted, opened Outlook to no change. I have the Follow Up folder in Favorites so it's always visible, but the nag doesn't work if it's not accurate.
 Ideas?</p>

<h2>            Percent Problem with the Text Box</h2>
                    <div><i>PERCENTAGE PROBLEMM WITH TEXT BOX</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
Hi Experts,<br />
<br />
I have a user form which includes some text boxes (textbox_discount for example) where I want to enter a number as a percentage. I divide the number entered by 100 to avoid Excel automatically multiplying by 100 and the result is displayed in the user form
 as the correct percentage.<br />
<br />
This works well, trouble is when I save and it writes the results to the worksheet, the numbers in the user form revert back to plain unformatted non percentage numbers (ie 5% goes to 0.05)<br />
<br />
Any ideas? <br />
<br />
note: The code are shown as below:<br />
<br />
Private Sub add_Click()<br />
<br />
Dim iRow As Long<br />
Dim ws As Worksheet<br />
Set ws = Worksheets("Sheet1")<br />

'find first empty row in database<br />
iRow = ws.Cells.Find(What:="*", SearchOrder:=xlRows, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SearchDirection:=xlPrevious, LookIn:=xlValues).Row + 1<br />
<br />
'check for a Name number<br />
If Trim(Me.textbox_attention.Value) = "" Then<br />
Me.textbox_attention.SetFocus<br />
MsgBox "Please complete the form"<br />
<br />
<br />
Exit Sub<br />
End If<br />
<br />

ws.Cells(iRow, 4).Value = Me.textbox_attention.Value<br />
ws.Cells(iRow, 5).Value = Me.textbox_tel.Value<br />

I am having difficult understanding the relevance of much of your description.&nbsp; So forgive me if I oversimplify the problem and, therefore, the solution.</p>
<p>Essentially, it seems to me that you are saying that when you assign Me.textbox_discount.Value to ws.Cells(iRow, 15), it appears as 0.05, but you would like it to appear as 5%.</p>
<p>I believe the problem is with the format of Cells(iRow,15) before the assignment.&nbsp; In particular, apparently it is not Percentage (and not General, based on your follow-up comments).</p>
<p>The remedy is to set the cell format before the assignment in VBA.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>ws.Cells(iRow, 15).NumberFormat = "0.00%"<br />
ws.Cells(iRow, 15).Value = Me.textbox_discount.Value</p>
<p>Using the With statement might be more efficient, but be careful to use leading periods appropriately, to wit:</p>
<p>With ws.Cells(iRow, 15)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.NumberFormat = "0.00%"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Value = Me.textbox_discount.Value<br />
End With</p>
<p>Of course, that will display 5.00%, not 5% per se.&nbsp; Change the format to fit your intent.</p>

<h2>            6070 inter net connect &#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I purchased a Nokia 6070 with a data cable CA-42, downloaded the latest PC suite and installed into my Windows XP PIII. When asked I connected the phone to the cable and PIII. The system sees the phone but when i try to connect to the internet it say "No
 MODEM FOUND". When i checked the website it says the modem drivers would be installed automatically but apparently not. How would i be able to connect to the internet?<br />

            You can connect your phone directly to the net by used of GPRS, just activate &amp; configure it, provided that your service provider offered that packet services in your acoount. If you want to use your PC to connect to the internet using the phone modem,
 check the system hardware if the driver for the Nokia modem is loaded properly. You will need also a dial-up account, with user name &amp; password.<br />

            I want to connect my 6070 to my computer and then have my computer connect to the internet through the 6070. You said check the system hardware if the driver for the Nokia modem is loaded properly.<br />
<br />
1. How do I check the system hardware to see if the driver for the Nokia modem is loaded properly.<br />
<br />
2. If it is not loaded properly what do I do?<br />
<br />
You also said that I will need also a dial-up account, with user name &amp; password.<br />
<br />
3. How do I get a dial-up account with usser name and password. Currently my SIMS is with Airtel--would they be the oone to give me the account with user name and password.<br />
<br />
4. I'm assuming that CA42 is the cable for this--would DKU-5 also work? Some people say it would.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the answers to the above--I need explicit answers.

<h2>            N93i&#58; died after NSU firmware update &#63;</h2>
                    Hi everybody!<br />
<br />
Yesterday, I've tried to update firmware for my N93i-1.<br />
Unfortunately, after several attempts , NSU crashed - `not responding` message appeared. I've took out battery and than inserted it back again. After that, my N93i tried to boot up, but nothing.... only initial screen on the LED-display ,with Nokia logo (white
 background, blue letters).<br />
<br />
Please help me to reanimate my phone!<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

            Only a servcie point can revive a phone that is the victim of a problem with NSU in this way, but if your phone is still under warranty it can be done free of charge under that warranty.

            Hello!<br />
<br />
Does anybody know , what kind of malfunction could invoke this type of reaction - small LED display , showing Nokia logo , without further reaction..?<br />
<br />
Local 'Nokia Care point' told me, that all things connected to the main display.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<h2>            Disconnecting and removing an Outlook account from a desktop</h2>
                    <p>I have been using a particular user account on an office computer for a few months, and so I linked my work email to the Outlook application on this user account. However, I will no longer be using this computer/user account going forward, and it is likely
 that other people may access it, so I want to remove any connection between the Outlook application on this user account and my email. However, when I got to remove the account I get the following message: "Before deleting the e-mail account containing your
 personal mail, contacts, and calendar data, you must create a new location for your data. To create a new data location, open the Account Settings dialogue box, click the Data Files tab, and then click Add." The relevant default data file, however, is located
 "Online", so I'm not sure why I can't remove my account!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way of disconnecting the Outlook application from my mail, because I don't want anyone to be able access my account and mail simply because they're using this user account!!!!</p>

    <title>Internet Explorer 8 Back Button &#38; Tool Options Quit Working in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tdshort  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 8 Back Button &#38; Tool Options Quit Working in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 Professional 64 bit&nbsp;installed on 2 different computers and am having the same problem on both. Both are running Windows 7 ver 7600 RTM that were purchased from my university as 2 separate copies.&nbsp; After a while, the Internet Explorer&nbsp;8
 back button stops working.&nbsp; You can click on it but nothing happens.&nbsp; At the same time, most of the Tool options on the drop-down menu become greyed out. You can right click on the screen and go back by clicking on the "back" option. The only way I can remedy
 it is to close my IE8 sessions and then bring up the task manager.&nbsp; Even after I close IE there are still instances of it running in task manager so I have to end each one of those before restarting IE 8.&nbsp; I did not have this&nbsp;problem with IE 8 in&nbsp;Windows XP.&nbsp;Any
 ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks&nbsp;

<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>We would like to know more information related to this issue</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Since when are you facing this issue? Do you remember any recent software or hardware changes made on your computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are both the computer on the same network?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message or error number when Internet explorer stops responding?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Steps I would suggest are:
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Option 1:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Run Internet explorer with no add-ons. Though you have not installed add-ons it<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>might have installed by itself as a part of malicious program. </span>Many add-ons come from the Internet, and they usually require that you give your permission before they are installed on your computer. Some, however, might be installed without your
 knowledge. This can happen if the add-on was part of another program that you installed. Some add-ons are installed with Microsoft Windows.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>Steps to temporarily disable add-ons</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Start</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click All programs</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>iii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Accessories
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>iv.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click System tools</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>v.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>And then select Internet Explorer(no add-ons)</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the browser works fine after these steps, add-on may be causing the error.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Steps to determine which add-on may be causing the error</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Internet explorer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Tools button, click Manage add-ons, and then click Enable or disable Add-ons.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>iii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the show list, click Add-ons that have been used by Internet Explorer to display all add-ons.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>iv.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Add-ons you want to enable, and then select Enable.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>v.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Repeat step iv for every add-on you want to enable. When you have finished click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;Option 2:</span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</span></span><span>If your browser is still not working after the above steps, you can reset Internet Explorer to the default setting using Control Panel.&nbsp; By resetting Internet Explorer
 to its default settings, you return it to the state it was in when it was first installed on your computer. This is useful for troubleshooting problems that might be caused by settings that were changed after installation.</span></p>

<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is a Fix It to reset Internet explorer settings. Below link will help you with the same</span></p>
<p><span>By resetting Internet Explorer settings, you return it to the state it was in when it was first installed on your computer. This is useful for troubleshooting problems
 that might be caused by settings that were changed after installation. When you delete personal settings, some webpages that rely on previously stored
</span><span><span>cookies</span></span><span>, form data, passwords, or previously installed
 browser add-ons might not work correctly. Resetting Internet Explorer to its default settings does not delete your favorites, feeds, Web Slices, and a few other personalized settings. See the table below for a complete list of all settings and information
 about whether they are reset or maintained.</span></p>
<p><span>Resetting Internet Explorer's settings is not reversible. After a reset, all previous settings are lost and cannot be recovered. Rather than resetting everything, you might
 want to reset specific settings or delete your webpage history.</span></p>

The problem is Google, as noted at <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/InternetExplorer/thread/023576dc-51a8-4983-ac7e-e073eb5576ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I have 32-bit Windows 7 Ultimate and it also happens to me.<br />
It's not showing in XP.<br />
I suspect it's caused by certain web sites/javascripts but there is no way for me to prove it -- many site's javascripts are random too.<br />
<br />
In all case, "malicious" sites or plugin should not be&nbsp;an execuse for this bug. It&nbsp;IS an IE8 for windows 7&nbsp;BUG.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Hector, Scarzia, Amoratinos,</p>
<p>Many thanks for bringing this to our attention!</p>
<p>Following our investigation it&nbsp;is indeed an issue&nbsp;in the Spanish build numbers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# 16.0.6366.2036, # 16.0.6366.2047, # 16.0.6366.2056, #16.0.6366.2062 &amp; #&nbsp;16.0.6366.2068.</p>
<p>The root cause was we were attempting to make some accessibility improvements but we implemented them badly for Spanish&nbsp;- please accept our sincerest apologies!</p>
<p>We have fixed it and the fixed build should be available in February...sorry I cannot be more specific than that.</p>
<p>I will come back on here&nbsp;and confirm once that build releases to the public.</p>
<p>In the meantime there is a workaround. I realise it is not ideal but it will allow you&nbsp;to&nbsp;move to the Subject line using your keyboard.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;in the "Para" (or To) edit box, please hit Shift +Tab 4 times to move the cursor to the&nbsp;subject line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do report anything you see on here and we will endeavour to address it in subsequent releases.</p>
<p>Thanks again for giving us&nbsp;this feedback&nbsp; - we really appreciate it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stafford </p>

    <title>IFERROR&#40;SUMIF Not Working&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mjb_86  say:</h3>
<h2>            IFERROR&#40;SUMIF Not Working&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relatively new to the community here, and I'm not an excel wizard of analyst by trade; it's a role I've recently had to take in as my job purview expands. I've learned a thing or two a long the way but I'm stumped on this particular problem, and was hoping
 that someone could enlighten me! :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to identify transportation costs (Column N) for a company project. I have thus far separated the transportation items (freight, shipping, etc.) via VLOOKUP "ITEM*" formula. Transportation items sit in Column Z.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now trying to extract the local currency values from the data table for the each individual transportation item; here I'm having problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying for example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IFERROR(SUMIF(Z1,"Transport*",N31),IFERROR(SUMIF(Z1,"Freight*",N1),""))</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are more than 2 varieties of transportation, I'm just limiting it to 2 for the sake of this example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Row 1 happens to have an invoice with the title "Transportation Fees" so I get the value from Column N.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next row down with any reference to transportation is Row 31; this has "Freight" in its invoice. Yet the formula I listed doesn't seem to be able to capture the number. What's driving me up the wall is if I break the formula down and just put in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IFERROR(SUMIF(Z30,"Freight*",N30),"")&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>it captures the amount! Can someone please help and suggest a more resilient formula that would capture the multiple items I'd need to use? I tried SUMIFS, but for some reason this doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate the input!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p />

<p>The formula doesn't make any sense. SUMIF will not produce an error so the 2nd part will never get executed. Also SUMIF is used for looking through a range of values and summing only values that match the criteria. Yours is saying if Z1 is Transport* then
 get me cell N1, but also saying IF Z1 is Freight* get me cell N1 as well ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without seeing your spreadsheet it is difficult to give you exactly what you want but SUMIF is usually used in the following way to get the SUM of all the rows where Transport is in column Z and SUM of all the rows where Freight is in column Z</p>
<p>
</p><p>Transport Total: =SUMIF(Z1:Z30,"Transport*",N1:N30)</p>
<p>Freight Total:&nbsp;=SUMIF(Z1:Z30,"Freight*",N1:N30)</p>

            An "enterprise" solution should NEVER allow this type of spam on their websites. Only Msft would do something stupid like this. Completely unacceptable and clueless on their part. I don't have time to check now but if you can access the master page for
 this site&nbsp; - add some css to hide the element or add it to a sitewide stylesheet. Inspect the page to figure out what element to hide. In my case it's the class "feedback_34dc3e7dd" but that would probably be different for you.

<p>Complete agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my modern sites, the feedback button has a generic class associated to it:</p>
<p><br />
So you can add this CSS to the page and will hide it:</p>
<p>.sitePage-uservoice-button {display: none}<br />
</p>
<p>Although as we all know, Microsoft might change this in the future just to annoy their clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

<h2>            EXCEL Margins that alternate on odd &#38; even pages for double-sided, binder-held printouts</h2>
                    EDIT:&nbsp; This question is regarding the EXCEL program. I thought I posted it in an EXCEL thread, but I guess I didn't, or that wasn't clear in my question. I know how to set up mirror margins in WORD.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have a landscape-oriented worksheet that fits 2 8.5x11" pages.&nbsp; It's a sheet for weekly tracking that I keep in a binder, so I print it flipped on long edge.&nbsp; Problem is, on 2nd page, the bottom rows of the data and the footer ends up with holes punched in
 it.&nbsp;<br />
How can I set the margins so that on the first page it's 1" at the top and on the 2nd page it's 1" at the bottom - and so that it alternates?<br />

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Mirrored margins still give you wide/narrow margins on the left and right rather than top and bottom in landscape pages.
<br />
<br />
The simplest method is to mimic them using even and odd settings in your headers and footers, adding extra paragraphs or paragraph spacing in the odd headers and the even footers. Here is a link to a sample document.
<br />
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/t5qjqs1qiausge8/Landscape%20Mirroring.docx?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/t5qjqs1qiausge8/Lands...</a>
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22c6a97b-6ffb-46aa-9c3e-912a4933a109?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22c6a97b-6ffb-46aa-9c3e-912a4933a109?upload=true" /></a><br />
Otherwise, you can leave the pages in portrait mode and rotate the text using a frame or a table. I recommend the first method.
<br />
<br />
I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />

            You are getting this error on both PCs?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It seems like an issue with Outlook. Open the latter on your computers and under the Help menu, click Office Diagnostics or Detect &amp; Repair. Re-connect your device after the repair is complete.<br />

            Outlook 2011? Perhaps you have Outlook 2010... 'File tab|Options|Mail|Tracking', you can set for both read and delivery receipts (which the receiver can ignore if he cares to, unfortunately). To the best of my knowledge, there is no such thing as a "clicked
 link" receipt available in email.
