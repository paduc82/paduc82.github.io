    <title>Help me restore SMS notifications and disable Skype integration in the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Help me restore SMS notifications and disable Skype integration in the Messaging app</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since I made the mistake of enabling Skype integration in the messaging app on my Lumia 950 XL I've lost essential functionality on my phone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not get any SMS notifications anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And my phone uses a lot more power (presumably to keep the skype connection alive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I wanted to disable the skype integration again. It shouldn't be that hard, right? Enter the messaging app, select "Skype Settings", and press "Sign Out". That will get you a prompt asking if you're sure, upon which I click "Sign Out" yet again. Okay..
 and then.. nothing. Enter the settings again, and it tells me "You're currently signed in as.... " with the Sign Out option yet again. So clearly things don't take.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can restart the phone... things remain the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please help me get rid of that integration and restore my SMS notifications. This is my business phone and my carrier has no visual voicemail so I keep missing the SMS telling me when somebody leaves a message :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>Stephan</p>

            <p>@Abi99: Your first link relates to emails, not SMS. The second one.. please re-read my post above, you will see that I've already tried what was suggested there and it did not work. What finally seems to have done the trick is downloading the Skype application
 and logging in there. However, there's still no SMS notifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for what I even mention Skype.. the problems started when in an attempt to disable Skype integration, I turned off the notification about IMs and incoming calls. That seemed to help with the power use of the messaging app, but at the same time it stopped
 SMS notifications and they never came back regardless of the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, you're on the wrong track with your questions I'm afraid. Windows phone shows you the battery use for every app, and as soon as I turned on skype integration in the messaging app, the battery use of that app went through the roof. Battery use for email
 is under "Mail and Calendar".. (and I'm not just saying that, I experimented with mail fetch times and it has a direct impact on how much battery that application uses).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Operator and country are of no concern. That because</p>
<p>1) The phone is unlocked and unbranded (bought directly from Microsoft) and contains no carrier crapware.</p>
<p>2) Plugging the SIM into a factory reset Lumia 930 means you get SMS notifications</p>
<p>3) Plugging the SIM into an iPhone or Android phone also means you get SMS notifications</p>
<p>4) Plugging another SIM (from the same or different carrier)&nbsp;into the Lumia 950 means that number gets no SMS notifications (note.. notifications.. the SMS are delivered but there's no notification and the tile isn't updated)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ergo.. it's the phone's settings that are incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thread you linked to goes into phone resetting. I'm sure you understand that I'm very much disinclined to go for such extreme measures. It would take me hours to restore everything to working order, and restoring the backup would restore the problem
 as well (I know since the problem started on my Lumia 930.. and migrated to the 950 when I got the 950 and migrated from a backup). Factory resetting the 930 did the trick by the way.. so I presume it would work on the 950, but factory resetting a phone would
 be a no go for pretty much everybody. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I did not get that and still do not get it, yet. Therefore, I have to double-check: You went not for the app ‘Messaging’ but for the app ‘Skype video’ and there for the button ‘Sign out’. However, that did not work? Instead, you had to download the app ‘Skype’
 from the Store, and sign out there? Mhm. Not normal, you found a software bug. Anyway, did you remove the app ‘Skype’ again? That is in conflict with Messaging, drains the battery, and I wonder why Microsoft allows us to download that app in Windows 10 Mobile
 at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Operator and country are of no concern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That question was about battery draining. There are some operators (or APN or proxy settings), which cause Windows 10 Mobile not to maintain its notification API stuff. Some apps go wild in that case. Therefore, the operator might be of concern. Because
 some operators run under the same name but with different settings in different countries, I have to ask about the country as well. If you do not want to share that information, it is OK. I am just asking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your first link relates to emails, not SMS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is quite the same. Anyway, thanks for the feedback. In future, I am going to mention that explicitly. Furthermore, that thread is the catch-all for those who have still no notifications even after double-checking those settings. Therefore, if you do not
 want to reset your phone, I recommend to select ‘Me Too’ in that thread.&nbsp;Then you are subscribed to updates automatically. When anything changes, you get notified by E-mail. Furthermore, only one thread must be updated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Factory resetting a phone would be a no go for pretty much everybody.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot judge on that. For some a reset might be viable workaround, for some it is a no-go. In any case, it is not a solution but a workaround. However, when you create a backup (and restoring that does not fail) via All apps » Settings » Update » Backup
 » More options » (Overview) Back up now, the overall procedure is quite streamlined. Yes, the culprit setting might come back that way. However, there is no proof of that yet either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, to sum-up your current situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are signed out of Skype.</li><li>You do not face battery drain anymore.</li><li><strong>You do not get SMS notifications.</strong></li></ol>
<p>Just to avoid a possible misunderstanding: Microsoft Mobile does <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/2115357c-0108-4469-abc7-0428b9e37bf8?threadId=55ddbe68-21fc-4f55-8110-feede6fa69f4">
not</a> leverage its Microsoft Answers for individual support cases. Why ever. Therefore here, you get community based best-effort help. Hopefully, Microsoft Answers finds the cause(s) why some users still do not get any SMS or E-mail notifications. Hopefully
 then, someone updates at least that other thread. I am not aware of any peer to peer support which has the qualification to address an issue like yours. The best you could go for: Microsoft » Microsoft Mobile » Support » Contact: Some countries offer a Live
 Chat.</p>

 not work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>They're one and the same... going to Skype Settings in the Messaging apps, or starting Skype Video and going to settings will take you to the exact same settings. And yes, that did not work as I wrote in post #1.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Anyway, did you remove the app ‘Skype’ again?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>No, as I'm worried that would restore skype integration in Messaging. But until yesterday I was never signed into the Skype app.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">That question was about battery draining. There are some operators (or APN or proxy settings), which cause Windows 10 Mobile not to maintain its notification API stuff. Some apps go wild in that case</p>

</p><p>If that were the case.. I wouldn't have written that things started with the Skype Integration. The 930 and then the 950 were running just fine (the 930 for over a year). I know you couldn't have known that and I should've put the "why is Skype integration
 to blame" in the first post so nobody could argue around me being right on my claims.</p>

</p><p>I have some nice &lt;NOT&gt; experience on that with the iPhone. One day into a 6 week holiday it turns out Apple&nbsp;*ç%&amp;* up and I had to&nbsp;reset and reconfigure everything. And.. I mentioned iPhone and Android. I'm not&nbsp;your 08/15 user. I have&nbsp;a bunch of token, company
 and personal accounts,&nbsp;all kinds of data that you cannot backup and restore. Bringing a phone fully online takes at least half a work day - I have to regenerate tokens left and right and apply them to all my phones. Just&nbsp;the migration from the 930 to the 950
 took half a work day because backup/restore isn't really restoring everything.. Microsoft is still lagging years behind Apple with respect to that (and even Apple doesn't restore&nbsp;everything). And from playing with the 930 I know just exactly how little backup/restore
 really does. Factory resetting the phone means half a day is gone. Period. So you see how I am not receptive to this at all. I don't like to shoot myself in the foot.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Anyway, to sum-up your current situation:</li><li>You are signed out of Skype.</li><li>You do not face battery drain anymore.</li><li><strong>You do not get SMS notifications.</strong></li></ol>
<p>That is correct. Some setting somewhere buried deep f**** up SMS notifications. And that's quite an important feature.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And.. factory resetting the phone and not restoring anything fixes this problem. I knew that before. It's just that unless you run a very basic setup, you lose hours setting up a phone anew and I'm sure pretty much everybody shares me sentiment about this
 being a nogo and having to go down that route is filled with expletives.</p>

<p>Please, uninstall that app or at least monitor the battery draining of the Messaging app. Several users – who never ever used Skype – report that the new Messaging app gets a bit crazy in battery consumption, when the stand-alone Skype is installed as well
 (because that was installed on a previous phone, because it came with that phone).</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You are the first I am aware of, reporting this. Could be true. Could be coincidence, especially if your phone setup is that complex. However, I am not aware of any approach to find the culprit. The next step would be to side-load an registry editor and
 crawl through the whole registry. That might take several days, if that is successful at all. Why ever, Microsoft does not leverage Microsoft Answers for individual support cases. It should be an ease for them, to troubleshoot something like that, find the
 software bug, and that way, avoid resets not just for you but for many, many users.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I am an end-user like you, so I am bit aware of what I am suggesting. A reset is even more complicated for those who are completely new to smartphones. If that much settings are missing on your phone after a reset, Microsoft wants you to report this via
 Windows 10 Mobile » All apps » (Windows) Feedback. Of course, it would be cool to read that list here at Microsoft Answers as well, just to learn from your situation. Anyway, I am still wondering why exactly this lost SMS notification setting is kept in a
 restore – you stated you migrated that issue over from your Lumia 930 to your new Lumia 950. Did I get that correctly? Which OS build was running on that Lumia 930 at that time?</p>

<h2>            Outlook Locked up with Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just downloaded the newest update for Microsoft and now my Outlook seized up. &nbsp;It says I'm not verified and when I click the button to go to a verification screen it locks up and crashes. &nbsp;Anyone else having this issue? &nbsp;October 11, 2017</p>

<h3> z_a_s  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;&#43;&#34; &#124; Datasheet View &#124; Query</h2>
                    <p>Sorry if this is confusing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a form (with subforms attached). When I switch to Datasheet View while in my form, there is a little "+" on the far left of the table. If I click this, it will open the subforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to incorporate this "+" into a regular query? For example, (and yes, I know that my database is not set up the best way) I have three tables (tblMain, tblPeople, tblDetails). All three tables share a common EventIdNumber. One table (tblPeople)
 has no primary key and you can input an infinite number of records. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create a query with tblMain and tblPeople, and I query all EventIdNumbers from 1-25, I was to see a query with only 25 results. However, because I have the tblPeople table open, and there are many records per tblPeople.EventIdNumber, then I end up with
 more than 25 results. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way that I can be shown ONLY the 25 records, but also have the little "+"? So when I click the "+", I can see all the associated people?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>First, let me say that your tblPeople ought to have a primary key.&nbsp; Every table ought to have a primary key, for best operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your question ...</p>
<p>Although most database developer would advise using forms and subforms to display data, if you choose to open queries in datasheet directly, Access allows you to set a subdatasheet for a queries, and specify the LinkMaster and LinkChild fields for that subdatasheet,
 just like a subform.&nbsp; So to accomplish what you want you would create a query of just your tblMain -- do not include tblPeople in the query.&nbsp; With that query open in design view, open the property sheet for the query (not the property sheet for any particular
 field in the query).&nbsp; On that property sheet, you'll see properties "Subdatasheet Name", "Link Child Fields", and "Link Master Fields".&nbsp; Set the Subdatasheet Name property to tblPeople, and set the Link Child and Link Master Fields properties to EventIdNumber.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open the query, you should see the "+" signs that you can expand to see the related tblPeople records,</p>

<p>
</p><p>That's odd.&nbsp; When I do it, I get a long list of "Table.this" and "Table.that", followed by a list of "Query.foo" and "Query.bar".&nbsp; I don't know what circumstances would be preventing you from seeing all tables and queries.</p>

<h2>            High contrast mode&#47;reverse contrast</h2>
                    Hi, I have a slight issue with using my phone.
<div>I have trouble seeing black text on a white background and find it easiest to use green or white on black.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know i can change the basic theme of the phone to such a coloring schema, but it doesn't seem consistent.</div>
<div>Is it possible to make it so the web browser and attachments (word and excel files) are also in a high contrast mode like you can do on a desktop computer?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you</div>

                    <p>This is a ~2008 iMac running Windows Vista Ultimate 32-bit SP1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I noticed on my partner's machine that MSE was no longer showing in the system tray. Viewing msconfig showed that the expected MSE entry was missing. When I started the MSE client I saw a number of malware items in qurrantine, all with the date and time
 of when I started the client. I decided to uninstall and reinstall MSE to fix the startup entry and then run a full scan.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What a fool I&nbsp;was.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I downloaded the 32-bit client from the MSE site. Uninstalled the existing copy (this may have been subject to the problems with uninstalling described later, but I'm afraid I don't recall) and reinstalled using the downloaded package. Verified the startup
 entry was now present and set about updating MSE from within the client. However, the update failed stating it was due to a network issue. The event viewer showed the following error multiple times:</p>

<p>There were no other installations occuring and&nbsp;a reboot did not resolve the issue. I decided to try a reinstall and I found that this would fail. I traced this back to a failure of the Microsoft Antimalware service to stop. It would change its status to
 Stopping but never stop. The only way around this I found was to change the service status to Disabled in the registry, reboot and then uninstall the product.</p>

<p>Stopped Windows Update and BITS, deleted contents of SoftwareDistribution folder and re-enabled</p>
<p>Manually install definition updates (extraction window appears and disappears, unsure whether it did anything or not)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of them have resolved the problem and as best as I can tell Windows Update is fully functional. There are no outstanding updates for it and MSE is installed successfully through it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The epp_install log shows the following errors:</strong></p>

</p>
<p>However, I checked on a machine where MSE was working fine and I see these errors there as well, so it looks to be an expected error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have run MalwareBytes Anti-Malware on the machine and removed some malware, but none of it looked serious. Nor do I believe it is responsible for the problem as it's not interfering with the Malwarebytes updates, nor has it stopped me putting Avast! (or
 its updates) on the machine. I did a follow-up with TDDSKiller and found nothing of concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My bet is that malware is still present or the damage that done was the initial problem and now the inability for it to update.</p>

<p>Each rescue scanner will miss things – because none of them will have a perfectly complete and up-to-date set of definitions; so you might need to use several of these rescue scanners, or something like
 the Shardana Antivirus Rescue Disk Utility, which creates a custom bootable CD or flash drive that includes multiple rescue scanners:</p>

<h2>            MSOSYNC.EXE hanging - Windows Terminal Services, Citrix XenApp 6.5</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First a little about our environment:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 2008 R2 with XenApp 6.5</span></p>
<p><span>Published IE10 and Office 2013 thru Citrix</span></p>
<p><span>Office 365 with mail and SharePoint</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When we access SharePoint through Word the Microsoft Upload Center (MSOSYNC.EXE*32) kicks in. That is expected for handling
 caching. We have applied two GPO's for handling caching.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Open documents from Office Document Cache first</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>-
 Disabled (Go online at first attempt)</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Delete files from Office Document Cache</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>-
 Enabled (Delete cache when closing application. (This works))</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After we close Word (only one application running), we are logged of the terminal server as expected. However, the MSOSYNC.EXE*32
 will still be running for approx. 25 minutes before this process is closed and a complete log off is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Why are MSOSYNC.EXE*32 hanging? We did not edit any documents, just opened and closed... Therefore, the sync should not
 have to upload anything to the SharePoint site.</span></p>

<h2>            record number field on a continuous form</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a continuous form that I would like each record to be numbered as new records are added.&nbsp; As each new record is added I want the record number field to be&nbsp;one more than the number of the previous record added.&nbsp;&nbsp; Aslo if records are deleted it would
 not affect the number of the next new record it should be one more that the last record added.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me how to do this?&nbsp; I'm using Access 2000</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Access Database Patients</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to set up a database patients with TB. i have 4 tables PATIENTS DETAILS, ASSESSMENT, BASELINE and FOLLOW UPS.</p>
<p>a patient can have one assessment, one baseline but many follow ups. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I want to have the patient details e.g. folder number ID, name to be pulled from the PATIENT DETAILS table to all the other tables.
<br />
2. I need to create a report that can display all BASELINES AND FOLLOWUPS done in a particular month. what formula should i use in the query?</p>
<p>3. how can i calculate the time difference between a date field in the ASSESSMENT AND BASELINE tables? date of start of treatment and date of end of treatment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help is very much appreciated! Thank you in advance!</p>

            <p>Re 1: You can pick up any PatientDetails (lose the all caps for readability, and the spaces and other funny characters for notational difficulties) in a query; they do not belong in related tables per relational database design rules.</p>
<p>tblPatientDetails<br />
PatientDetailsID autonumber PK<br />
PatientFN text(20) required<br />
'etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblAssessment<br />
PatientDetailsID long int required PK<br />
DateTaken datetime required<br />
IsAlive Boolean <br />
'etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblBaseline<br />
PatientDetailsID long int required PK<br />
DateTaken datetime required</p>
<p>Hearthrate integer</p>
<p>'etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblFollowup<br />
FollowupID autonumber PK<br />
PatientDetailsID long int required FK</p>
<p>DateTaken datetime required<br />
IsAlive Boolean</p>
<p>'etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to the Relationships window and drag-n-drop the lines between the corresponding fields. This will create the one-to-one and one-to-many relations. Make sure you check the "Enforce" box on the popup dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re #2:<br />
This would be an empty report with two subreports, one on tblBaseline and another on tblFollowups.</p>
<p>The query for the subreport would be something like:</p>
<p>select * from tblBaseline where DateTaken between Forms!myCriteriaForm!myStartDateControl and Forms!myCriteriaForm!myEndDateControl</p>
<p>So this query "looks back" on the report criteria form to get the date range to use.</p>
<p>Highly recommended to repeat this date range in the header of the report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re #3: Date intervals are calculated using the DateDiff function.</p>

</p><p>Thank you that was very helpful. It's been a very long since I messed around with access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>could you please explain the #2 reply in terms where I need to write that code? should I create a query first that looks for the baseline and then the report?</p>

            <p>This is an example query, which would become the RecordSource for the first subreport.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you typically write the query first, then base a report on it. Select the query and click on Create &gt; Reports &gt; Report Wizard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course since this query looks back on a Criteria form, you need to create that as well. For now it can be a simple form with two textboxes formatted as date.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007 Enterprise Edition slow to receive IMAP emails</h2>
                    I am running Outlook 2007 and using IMAP email my OS is Windows 7 Professional Edition, My email is through Go-Daddy webmail. &nbsp;Outlook will not receive emails into my inbox without shutting down and restarting Outlook. &nbsp;I have tried changing the ports
 to every known port configuration with and without SSL, I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Outlook, I have tried both removing and re configuring my anti virus software, I have tried compacting my pst/ost files, I have tried scanpst.exe, &nbsp;I have contacted
 Go daddy who claims its an issue with Outlook, I also tried running Outlook /cleanviews , running outlook in safe mode, &nbsp;I also searched the Microsoft network for a solution, only found 1 article that claims MS is working on the issue, no resolution listed.
 Any ideas here or anything I haven't tried yet?&nbsp;

<h2>            Office File associations</h2>
                    Recently we changed from Office 2003 Pro to Office 2010 Pro, for&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;reason, all .doc, .xls, and .pps files are not associated to any programs.&nbsp; Is there a way to do this globally as opposed to having to touch each computer?

            <p>Checking for Click to Run is first thing to do. After that here are several different ways of fixing file associations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just noticed, do you mean that you are having this problem on many computers? You will either have to fix your installation image, or do the required fix on each one, one at a time. You could also use a registry monitoring tool to track the changes made
 to one machine, then export the reg files and apply the reg files to the other computers.&nbsp; Some 3rd party "uninstall" tool track all changes made to the registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For both types of installation start by doing a repair</p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>If that doesn't work, try:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b>Re-register the application</b>
<p><span>There are several different ways you can reset the proper file associations. Word itself provides a way to do it. Open a command prompt window
 and, at the command line, enter the following:</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<span>winword /r</span></p>
<p><span>Nothing seems to happen when you press
<b>Enter</b>, but Word will reregister itself back in Windows. In the process, it resets the file associations for the files it uses, such as DOC and DOT files. You can close the command prompt window and double-click on a document; Word should start right
 up.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>If that doesn't work, try:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b><span>Alternate Re-register the application</span></b>
<p><span>Close the app. Open the Run Window: &lt;WIN&gt; R, use the following command (<b>Modify the Path to match your specific installation)</b>:</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<span>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\winword.exe" /unregserver</span></p>
<p><span>The quotes are necessary, but you may need to change the path so it reflects the location of the winword.exe file on your system. (You can
 use Windows’ Search tool to locate the path to the winword.exe file.) The /unregserver switch “unhooks” all the references to Word in the Windows Registry.
</span></p>
<p><span>You should then, immediately, use the following command:</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<span>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\winword.exe" /regserver</span></p>
<p><span>This command causes Word to rewrite all its Registry keys and to reassociate itself with document and template files. Now you can double-click
 a document file and see if Windows starts Word and opens the document.</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 sync to Outlook App on Android</h2>
                    <p>I switched from outlook mail (the version w/o tool bar that logged on to my Verizon.net e-mail) to Outlook 2010 so I could install Spamfighter.&nbsp; Computer running Windows 10.&nbsp; I cannot get it to synch with my android outlook app on my HC-10 phone.&nbsp; I tried
 all of the recommendations.&nbsp; I tried to set the app up as an eas account but unsuccessful.&nbsp; Didn't know what server to use or what domain address to use.&nbsp; Tried many but all failed.&nbsp; I read about a "Hotmail connector" which I downloaded from Micro.&nbsp; It appeared
 to attach to Outlook 2010 on my computer.&nbsp; When I tried to activate it went through a series of 6 send and receive actions but always came up with a couple of error message related to synching on the last send.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When I set up the android app as a POP account it sent/receive email and accessed my old calendar previously set up on my computer (old Outlook program) but&nbsp;would not sych. with my 2010 email or new calendar.&nbsp; Would appreciate detailed instructions to accomplish
 my goal.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by "when syncing" the email.&nbsp; Tonight I started over.&nbsp; I deleted my account on the Outlook.com on my computer and reset it. &nbsp; I uninstalled the Microsoft Connector program from my computer and reinstalled it hoping it would all
 work.&nbsp; No error messages after the reinstall.&nbsp; I received the&nbsp;Microsoft Outlook&nbsp;test message on my Outlook 2010 and on my Outlook program also on my computer as well as on my HC 10 android phone which has the Outlook android app.&nbsp; I also sent a test message
 from another computer which went to all 3.&nbsp; I don't know if they are synchronized or each independently got them from the Verizon server.&nbsp; I do know that the calendars are not synced because I added an item to the Outlook 2010 calendar hours earlier it did
 not show up on the computer Outlook or android app calendars.&nbsp; Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Junk Mail Filter keeps flagging non-junk messages</h2>
                    I think MS Outlook does a pretty good job of catching Spam, but consistently flags messages as junk from a couple senders that are safe. I keep marking them Not Junk, but MS doesn't seem to have a mechanism that will allow future messages from those senders
 to come through after they've been marked safe. Anyone else?

            I think so. It's not every email from these senders, just some. To be fair, they are from websites, like coupons, so I can see why they are initially marked Junk. but me marking them Safe doesn't seem to stick for long.

<p>I tried creating a rule to send messages from certain senders to my Inbox, but they are still ending up in the Junk folder. Am I supposed to leave the "Stop processing more rules" box unchecked? I left it checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's exactly what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. From the opened message, choose "Create a rule" from drop down menu on right side of top bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Under "When message arrives, and it matches all of these conditions", &nbsp;the box shows "It was received from", and to the right, the name of the sender appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Box below shows "And it was sent to", with my email address showing to the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I deleted the box "And it includes these words in the subject".</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Do all the following box says "Move the message to folder" and I choose Inbox from the drop down list.</p>
<p>I did not add any exceptions below that box, and left "Stop processing new rules" box checked.</p>
<p>

            Clicking "Not junk" doesn't mark a message as safe. Add the sender address to your contacts or put the sender address or domain in the Safe Sender list and anything from that sender should be considered safe.

            No Better. I marked the emails as not junk, moved them into the Inbox, set rule, and new messages from the sender STILL end up in the Junk folder. WHY DOES MARKING THE EMAILS NOT JUNK NOT PREVENT THE FANCY FILTER FROM SENDING FUTURE EMAILS FROM THOSE SENDERS
 TO MY SPAN FOLDER??? PLEASE, fix this glitch in your Outlook redesign.

<h2>            Suspicious messages starting with a number in the subject line</h2>
                    <p>I am receiving several messages each day that are suspicious. The originating addresses are never the same so cannot be blocked, and come from .com, .net, .org etc. and the subject line always starts with a number.

<p>
</p><p>Example:&nbsp;Glenda Beaumont &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subject:&nbsp;0591~Magst du das?</p>

            Unfortunately, unless the subject has some identical to search on, or the from address is the same (or same domain), rules wont work on it. If they are not being moved into the Junk email folder, mark them as junk and eventually the junk mail filter will catch up and block them.

<h2>            Date auto-fill on outlook not working.</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: justify">So as of the last update(10/28/2016), my outlook won't auto-complete the date when composing mail messages. &nbsp;It was working right before the update. &nbsp;Usually when you start typing the current month it'll give you the prompt to
 complete it, then when you hit space it'll prompt for the current date.<br />
<br />
<strong>Currently I have tried: &nbsp;</strong><br />
Untoggling and retoggling the 'Show AutoComplete Suggestions' in the Advanced section of Editor Options.<br />
Rebooting my machine.<br />
Quick Repair of MS Office.<br />
Long Repair of MS Office.<br />
Uninstalling and reinstalling MS Office.<br />
<br />
I run Microsoft Office 2016 and Windows 10, as does my boss who is having the same issue. &nbsp;Another computer, MS Office 2013 and also Windows 10 does not have this problem. &nbsp;The last two updates were KB3199986 and KB3197954. &nbsp;I'm assuming one of these caused
 the problem. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Has anyone else run into this issue and have they managed to correct it? &nbsp;If not, which update is causing the problem and will uninstalling it leave my computer vulnerable?</div>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, I know that the ‘Show AutoComplete Suggestions’ setting does
not work in your Outlook client.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To look into this problem, please provide us with the following information:</span></p>
<p><span>1. The detailed version of your Outlook 2016 client.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Your Windows OS version. To check it, click or tap the Start button and select Settings. Navigate to System &gt; About and scroll down. You’ll see
“Version” and “Build” numbers
here.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, please try safe mode to open your Outlook client.</span><span> This can disable those Outlook add-ins and help us determine
 whether the issue is related to add-ins. You can refer to “Start Outlook in safe mode and disa<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ble add-ins” in
</span></span><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>this article</span></a></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></p>

            <p>Barry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem still exists for me.... after many attempts to find out why. &nbsp;I've given up for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Home, Version 1607 &nbsp;OS Build 14393.447&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Outlook 2016 MSO (16.0.7329.1017) 32 bit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice to have that autofill for the date to be turned back on. &nbsp;It's nice to just type "Tuesd...."</p>
<p>and have the software complete the line with "Tuesday, November 22, 2016". &nbsp; This stopped working in the "body" of the Outlook message when I am composing a report. &nbsp;Autofill of the date not working in the subject area either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(77, 77, 77, 1)">We have recently implemented a security update called Familiar location protection to keep our customers’ accounts secure. The message "You haven't signed in from this location recently." will occur if you are signing
 in from a location more than 300 miles from your normal location. The Microsoft account service will prompt you for an additional challenge to complete the log in. Codes can be the date of birth, or receiving a code sent to your SMS number or alternate email
 if configured.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this you will need to conifgure your computer as your trusted PC and other security information for added protection to your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the new system update, you can remove old inaccessible security information on your account automatically after 30 days. To do that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log in to this<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>link</strong></a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Delete</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>on the security information you do not have access to. (Alternate email, Trusted PC, Mobile number)</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select&nbsp; "<strong>No, I Don't have access</strong>" button. (The date on when the security information will be removed will appear )</p>

 I can record a "dummy" macro, assign a shortcut key and then cut and paste the existing code into the macro.&nbsp; There must be another way - no?&nbsp; Any help, suggestion or feedback is appreciated.&nbsp; thanks</p>

<h2>            blocked from making local calls</h2>
                    For the past week I get a 'all circuits busy' recording when I dial numbers in my home-town. I can call numbers anywhere else in Canada no problem, but not the numbers with 235 prefix. Other Skype users and landline phones can call, so I know it is just
 my Skype that is the problem. How can I fix it? Many thanks to anyone who can steer me in the right direction.

<p>Hello Juan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yes, that is the exact message. People with regular phones and other Skype users in the valley can call no problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife and I have separate computers and separate Skype accounts, yet both of us were blocked at the same time, but just from numbers with the 235 prefix. We can call anywhere else in North America no problem, so I know it isn't the internet itself that
 is causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm totally stumped, so hope you have an idea. Thanks, Rod</p>

<p>Hello Juan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have caller id on my account, and yes, we both have Skype subscriptions that are paid up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might have another clue to our problem. If we keep re-dialing the number it eventually goes through. Usually in three or four tries. And still just the numbers with 235 prefix. Numbers anywhere else in Canada work normally. We phoned Northwest Tel and
 they claim that there is nothing wrong with their system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time on this. It must be frustrating trying to figure this out. Rod</p>

</p><p>We made several calls to 235 numbers today with no problem. I'm hoping it was some sort of bug or glitch that gradually fixed itself. Unless the problem returns in the next few days, I won't bother you with the chat support. Thanks a lot to you and Juan
