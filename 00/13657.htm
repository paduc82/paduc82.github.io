<h2>            Need help changing spacing of ellipses</h2>
                    When I use an ellipsis, the periods are scrunched together and I'd like to have more space between them. How do I do that? I'd like to make the change so it is universal for all of my MS Word docs.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks.</div>
                </div>

            Please don't waste your time trying to figure out Phillip's suggestion... If he'd tried it himself he would have found that it cannot be done. His suggestion lacks detail for the same reason.<br />
<br />
The ellipsis is a defined single character just like any other. The spacing between the 3 dots that comprise it is determined by the font designer based on standard guidelines. That spacing cannot be adjusted by the user any more than the height of a descender
 or ascender, or the length of the crossing of a "T"... or how much space is inserted when you press the Space Bar.<br />
<br />
When you type 3 consecutive periods, <b>AutoCorrect</b> converts them to an ellipsis character compliant with the font &amp; font formatting in use at the time. It's the same character you'd enter by typing the keyboard shortcut
<b>Option+;</b> rather than the 3 dots. You can eliminate the item from AutoCorrect, but if you do you'll simply wind up with the 3 dots as separate characters, which could become a serious problem for several reasons, such as separating line breaks.<br />
<br />
If you consider adding the ellipsis character from a differently designed font (such as Symbol) as an AutoCorrect item it won't solve the problem either. It would have to be saved as
<i><b>Formatted</b></i>, which means that the same size, font would be inserted each time &amp; could differ significantly from what was in use in the document.<br />
<br />
Depending on your actual definition of "<i>scrunched together</i>" you may have a font issue that needs to be corrected. I'd suggest that you follow the procedure offered here for clearing up conflicts:&nbsp;
<a href="http://word.mvps.org/mac/fontweeding.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Font Weeding.</strong></a> There may be some differences in terminology depending on your version of OS X, but the Help for your version of Font Book should make it easy to interpret.<br />
<br />
Run Disk Utility to repair disk permissions then Restart the Mac afterward.<br />

<h2>            I can&#39;t get a password recovery for my old skype account</h2>
                    <p>Dear Support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old skype account that I wished to login again after 3 years. </p>
<p>When I want to get a password reminder I fail.</p>
<p>I give my email address to request the code to reset my password I don't receive the code to my email address even when it shows the the code is sent to my email address. I don't get any email at all. The status shows that my email address is correct with
 the skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do? I don't remember for my old password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Unfortunately it didn't work for me at all. </p>
<p>When it asks my bank card details I am not able to select the expiry date at all because I used a different card that time. So I am not sure how to get my account back.</p>
<p>I am still thinking the password that I used that time.</p>
<p>I still don't understand why I don't receive email to my registred email account at all.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/044c5a71-ff86-49ae-a5ce-7c4c5518fe1c" title="MErno">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the prompt response. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>For additional information, here are some tips that might help improve your chances of successfully using the Account Recovery form to regain access to your account.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<span>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer you previously used to access the account.
</span></li><li>
<span>Also it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.</span></li><li>
<span>Even if your original information has changed, be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally.</span></li><li>
<span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You don't need to fill out the whole
 form; just the fields that you know apply to your account. Note: While most responses will come within a few minutes, it can take up to 24 hours for a response to be received.</span></span></span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since you mentioned that you are not getting the codes from the email address you entered, you might want to try checking the Spam, Trash or if you have put up any forwarding to the email which would restrict you in receiving the code.

<h2>            Adding a new record in a continious form</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I have a continuous form that when it opens fills the screen with records.<span>&nbsp;</span>I add a command button to go to a new record using the code:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>DoCmd.GoToRecord , , acNewRec</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When clicking on the button all the other records vanish and I have just one line showing which is the new record.<span>&nbsp;</span>Is there a way to
 basically have the screen scroll and have the new record being the last record on the screen?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></p>

<p>Good for figuring it out, but do you now know why it didn't work in first instance?</p>
<p>It is because DCount counts the number of non-null records. Apparently you have some ItemNames without a name. It's up to you to decide if that is normal, or if this should be a Required field.</p>
<p>Note that you can also use "*" for the first argument of DCount. This will count all records.</p>

<p>.RecordCount : &lt;Expression not defined in context&gt;</p>
<p>I do get a value for NumRec</p>
<p>Do I have to make a change to the "With Me.RecordsetClone"?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just FYI... Using the GotoRecord is pretty much the same as using the keyboard to navigate your recordset.&nbsp; If you use the argument acNewRecord, you are doing essentially the same thing as scrolling all the way to the bottom of your recordset.&nbsp; That is why
 your records seem to disappear.&nbsp; You've just moved to the bottom of the list is all.&nbsp; If you scroll up, you will see your records.</p>
<p>On another note... Zip, you seem to have a lot of questions based on the number of posts you've got on this site.&nbsp; That's fine.&nbsp; But I'm sure that all the people who have stopped to help you would like to know that they have managed to get you to your goal.&nbsp;
 Every one of your posts remains open.&nbsp; This causes everyone to contiously look to see what your question is in an effort to asnwer what may have already been solved.&nbsp; Please mark your posts as answered if appropriate.</p>
<p>On behalf of everyone here, thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Apollo,</p>
<p>I don't want the user to have to scroll up to see the last entries.&nbsp; I want the last entries to show and the first field of the new record ready for data entry.&nbsp; That way the user can see what was entered last and continue from there.</p>
<p>I never noticed the&nbsp;"Mark AS Answer" and always responded with thank you's in my last replys.&nbsp; I'll be better in the future about using that option.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One possible reason I can imagine .RecordCount causing that error is if the form is not bound.&nbsp; That might be the case if your continuous form is a subform and the button is on an unbound main form.</p>
<p>Check your references (VBA Tools menu) to make sure you you are using DAO and not ADO.&nbsp; If you intended to use ADO and not DAO, you'll need to translate the DAO code I posted to whatever is needed to get ADO to do the equivalent.</p>
<p>Other than that, it's conceivable that the line contains some invisible character that make it different from it appears to be.&nbsp; Try deleting the line a carefully retyping it.</p>

            <p>X58 is very widely in use! Sadly, it's no longer supported by Intel or the motherboard manufacturers. Those people who've gotten Windows 10 release version or higher to install on theirs have done some hacking of some kind (modded BIOSes or chipset drivers),
 but I can't get a bead on what they've done anywhere on the internet!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is is one of those things MS is going to have to do for themselves (via Windows 10 setup) unless they want to leave out a whole raft of people who are otherwise eligible for the upgrade, but are simply orphaned by the hardware companies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just so strange that the (past end-of-life) Core 2 Duo upgraded without complaint! I fully didn't expect that.</p>

            I have an HP Pavilion 6700dv laptop and got a chipset incompatibility notice for weeks leading up to RTM. &nbsp;Then a week after RTM the notice was replaced by notification that it was time to upgrade, and I did. &nbsp;It also is a Core 2 Duo. &nbsp;No additional drivers
 were needed, so it looks like Microsoft is indeed working on getting some older rigs over to Windows 10.

            <p>Well, your failure on a Core 2 Duo may have been a one-off. I've been running Win 10 on a Core 2 Duo rig since early builds of Insider Preview, and it has never failed to upgrade (even with the post-RTM Fast circle releases).</p>
<p>
</p><p>OTOH, people everywhere running upgrade-eligible Windows installations on LGA 1366 (or Socket B) motherboards with Intel X58 chipsets are finding that Windows 10 setup fails after the first reboot with the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We couldn't install Windows 10<br />
We've set your PC back to the way it was right before you started installing Windows 10.</p>
<p><strong>0xC1900101 - 0x20017</strong><br />
<strong>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course it doesn't clean up its installation mess, though that's easy enough with the clean disk utility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently this is a known issue, and is deliberate on MS's/Intel's part (as a result of the&nbsp;<span>KB3064209 update)</span>. Why, I do not know (and can't imagine), since it is *so* not the right thing to do. See here (Including the referenced link to another
 thread on <span>KB3064209)</span>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/the-installation-failed-in-the-safeos-phase-with/54db0c8f-f9f0-4093-b2fe-ad378685686a?auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, all of the individual past-End Of Life components on these boards (sound, SATA, network, USB 3, etc.), have drivers that are known to work in Win 10, at least minimally (sometimes minus a management console), so there's really no excuse, IMHO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone reading this has connections at MS, I'd really like an explanation of why Bloomfield-era systems are being excluded from the Windows 10 Upgrade when they are running eligible Windows installations, and the Get Windows 10 applet's "Check this PC"
 wizard returns a verdict that the system is ready to upgrade! A little light in this dark corner would be so welcome.</p>

    <title>Unresolved Items everytime i change an MS Office file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew daniels  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unresolved Items everytime i change an MS Office file</h2>
                    I've had a HTC Touch Dual for a few months now. I sync that to my home computer and also my work computer. Everything has been going fine until yesterday.<br />
I made a change to an Excel spreadsheet on my home PC I have in My Documents on my phone which is synced up.<br />
When I got into work the file was no longer there and when I checked it wasn't on the phone. Fortunately I recovered the file out of my Recycle Bin on my work computer. When I checked my home computer I couldn't find it anywhere.<br />
I restored the file on my work computer and made some changes to it on there. When ActiveSync synced it complained there were a conflict which needed resolving. I resolved it and left it at that.<br />
Later on I made another change to the file and I got the same stand unresolved item box. At this point I thought ActiveSync had got itself into a mess like it sometimes does and I decided to delete the partnerships and start again.<br />
I deleted the partnerships off my phone and also the ones on my work and home computer.<br />
I then created a new partnership and synced up my phone again to my work and home computer.<br />
After doing this I made a change to the spreadsheet and the same problem occurred. At this point I decided desperate times call for desperate measures. I did a hard reset on my phone, uninstalled ActiveSync and reinstalled it.<br />
<br />
And guess what, it's still happening!<br />
<br />
I've tried creating a txt file and seeing if that's effected but its fine. I can make changes to that and there are no syncing issues. I can also do this with a bitmap. I've tried it with new spreadsheet files (both xls and xlsx files format) and word documents
 and you get the same problem.<br />
<br />
Can any kind soul please help me as I'm lost at sea with this one?<br />
<br />
Many Thanks<br />
<br />
Andrew

<p>I don't have an answer for your question Dan but I can feel the pain.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have never had much luck syncing files and knowing that the updated version was transferred.&nbsp; The result is that I manually copy my edited files and I make sure I use a naming structure so I know what file is the most recent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion. The annoying thing is I've had Pocket PC's for years and I've had no major problems with it. Then one day you wake up and it doesn't work properly.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I can think to try now is try it on a machine I've never synced it with before and see if it works fine on that. If it works on there then at least I know a full rebuild of my two machines would fix the problem - which would be
 of small consolation. </p>

<p>In addition, I've just noticed that the phone syncs twice within seconds of each other. I'm not sure if it always did this or what. The first sync works fine and the file is copied to the device. But then the second sync happens about a second after and
 that is where the conflict happens. </p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

resolved until the next change/save I made--very annoying--and consequently, this just started happening.&nbsp; I went through all the 12 steps to recovery (deleted partnerships, hard reset the device, uncheck / recheck file sync, etc.),
 with no luck...</p>
<p>THEN</p>
<p>I decided to change the file from the Pocket PC (instead of editing on the PC and sending to PPC)&nbsp;to see if that would do anything, and voila, it fixed the problem.&nbsp; Now, it is business as usual...</p>
<p><br />
Hope this works for your situation as well.</p>

    <title>how to convert an Outlook alias into a Outlook account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> student computer services  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to convert an Outlook alias into a Outlook account</h2>
                    I have switched over to the new Outlook Mail account&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp; and have also created an alias&nbsp; - lets call it&nbsp; for example&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. All new mails&nbsp; to this alias go into a seperate folder.
<br />
<br />
Now I would prefer to have this alias upgraded or setup as a seperate Mail Account - basically no longer an alias, but an account which I can sign in with.&nbsp; How do I go about doing this?<br />
<br />
Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.<br />

            <p>Hey SCS,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All you have to do is remove that alias (so it's detached from the original account).</p>
<p><a href="https://account.live.com/ManageAssocIds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/ManageAssocIds</a>&nbsp;- remove the alias there.</p>
<p>Then you just have to give it some time to recycle back through the system before it's "available" again at the sign up screen.</p>

<div><br />
<div><span><b>6c23011641f24b8f2b797918240d55.pamx1.hotmail.com</b><br />
<br />
<font color="#444444"><span>I have provided this in the MX entry of my Cpanel and it has saved it. I gave it priority 0 (highest).

<div>Not sure, what I am doing wrong here. Kindly help</div>

<div>Edit: Just to add a bit further, I am able to create email accounts and use them to send and receive emails. Just that sender email (our domain) are send by hotmail's id on behalf of our id's and thats shown in receiver's address. Like the one below.</div>

            Hi&nbsp;Yasser,<br />
<br />
We're sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. I'll see what I can do to help you. Based on the investigation, we're seeing other MX records other than the one from custom domains. I suggest that you go to your domain registrar's website and delete
 the existing MX records. Replace it with the MX record propagated from out custom domains.<br />
<br />
With regard to the other issue regarding e-mails showing on behalf on the receiver's end, please refer to my private message. Sign in to this forum and click on the red texts saying you have a private reply.<br />
<br />
<div>Thanks!</div>

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft also allows users to download setup Wamedia of various Office versions in form of installation disc as well as offline ISO or IMG files. They provide the setup files of Office to help users manage
 and restore Office products in their computers in case they have lost the original setup disc.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Currently Microsoft is providing setup media of following Office versions:</p>

    <title>Embedded objects in a Word document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embedded objects in a Word document</h2>
                    I am using Office Professional Plus 2013. When I embed or insert an object (Excel File) into a Word Document, I save the file and attach it into an email and send that email to an associated with another company. &nbsp;When they receive the email, they open
 the email, double click on the attached document (opening it), then they double click on the embedded object (Excel File). &nbsp;They are unable to open the file. &nbsp;What problems are happening here?

            <p>Ask the recipient to save the attachment to a folder on their hard drive before opening it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open a Word file while it's still an attachment, Windows saves a copy of the document in a temporary folder. That's probably interfering with Word's ability to pass the embedded object to Excel when you try to open the object.</p>

<p>Hi, I have purchased a Microsoft 365 Office Home for 5 user last month and set up an outlook email account for the purpose to use the Microsoft license. Last week, I wanted to extend to a 2nd user, I have keyed in the product key number however, it said
 it has been used. That is when I tried to reconnect to the 1st user account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***), and the password I have set earlier was not usable. I went to the shop last week to ask for assistance, but the salesman told me it's only Microsoft
 people able to resolve it. Today I called the first number that appeared in microsoft website Malaysia, it's a corporate company. and they directed me to the hotline - 1800-81-8798. Then from this hotline, they directed me to 1-800-2200-30, then from this
 number, they have<span>&nbsp; </span>directed me to the chat room. This took me an hour of my time. Which is fine. In the chatroom, it took me 1,5 hours (see case number **********) and it got disconnected. I tried again after lunch, and for also 1,5 hours (even
 after with reference number/ case number: **********), they couldn’t even process my case from service to billing, and towards the end, they forward it to technical support, and he said “Please be advised that if you cannot recover the account where your office
 is associated to, you wont be able to&nbsp;install the Office anymore. But don't&nbsp;you worry,&nbsp;as long as&nbsp;you can provide&nbsp;us your proof of purchase, we can&nbsp;offer you&nbsp;Office replacement for only $40. What we will do is we will provide you the same office version if
 you would like to go with that process.”</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the same price for me to get a new one</p>
<p>I have wasted 4 hours of my working time today and I would have appreciate it if this information have been given to me before this all started!!!</p>

            Turn your phone on whilst holding the shift/space/backspace buttons, it should do a hard reset and hopefully sort out your problem, it will however format your phone to factory default you'll lose everything but your phone will work again, if my instrustions
 are not good then do a google search for how to do hard reset nokia n97.

<p>@tcwlam-if yougo to the website, you can download the app as a .sisx file, and you can just load the file onto your phone and install it there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@silvervectra- I'm guessing you downloaded it and just installed despite the compatibility warning? The problem why this is still not available to the n97 is likely&nbsp; due to software incompatibility, which is why it will be delayed to come with the new firmware.
 If so you just bricked your phone due to you not wanting to wait, congratulations (insert really sarcastic tone)! Anyway, just do the hard reset. Hopefully it would fix it and uninstall the ovi maps. Otherwise you would likely have to have the guys at the
 Nokia Care Center reflash your phone and roll back ovi maps.</p>

            Hiya everyone--&gt; I am the who had the above problem. Took well wishers' advice and hard resetted my N97. Freed up lots of memory on C:, total free memory equalled 60 Mb--&gt; believe me that's a lot on N97, probably the maximum one can gain on N97. Interestingly
 most of my applications were still on phone. I uninstalled ovi maps. Then i reinstalled the life time free ovi maps on my N97. It is working now full time flawlessly. Great. Now everyone with N97 can have above life time free ovi maps free forever. Enjoy.
 Take care

<h2>            Opening Two Instances of the Same Form</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to open two instances of the same form with different records?&nbsp; I have a form to enter contact records that checks to make sure the same person isn't entered twice for the same company.&nbsp; Right now, it just opens up a message box that the record
 they are attempting to save is a duplicate.&nbsp; I'd like to open the duplicate record for the user to see and/or modify without losing the data they have just entered in case it's not really a duplicate.&nbsp; Is that possible, or will I need to create a copy of the
 form to use in this instance?</p>

<p>You can't have 2 free instances of the same form open at the same time, although you can embed 2 subforms based on the same form into a primary form. Just name each instance differently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done this in one of my database projects where patients have a primary and a secondary insurance coverage. I named the first instance "frmINS1" and the second one "frmINS2." In this layout, both instances have the same recordsource, but you can try
 assigning a recordsource using the on the subform's OnCurrent event.</p>

 lack any ability to change anything except for style. I am unable to save or change formatting or really do anything but type. Also does not actually save documents to my computer and I have to open them up in "open recent" to see any changes. I've tried restarting
 word, using different templates, etc. Have no idea how to fix this!&nbsp;

    <title>excel macros slow over network&#59; only on windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertaylward  say:</h3>
<h2>            excel macros slow over network&#59; only on windows 8</h2>
                    <p>We have 30+ windows 7 64bit pc's in our office and only 2, with windows 8/8.1 64bit. &nbsp;All systems (win7/win8) are running same office version (office 365 business 32 bit, which is office 2013) and are on same gigabit LAN network. &nbsp;All PC's show Ethernet
 performing at 1 gig speeds. &nbsp;I have a macro that I use, to gather data from 3 databases (ms access) on 3 of our servers on the same network. &nbsp;This macro completes in about twenty seconds on the windows 7 pc's and takes 20 minutes on the windows 8 pcs. &nbsp;Very
 strange.</p>
<p>Anyone come across this before?</p>
<p>I'm an IT admin and do not see any issue with networking. &nbsp;The problem seems to be related to windows 8 and how it provisions network resource to excel macros being executed over the network. &nbsp;I dont have this problem if the same macro reads from locally
 stored databases on the win8 pc's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Server1 (server 2003) is hosting 2 of the 3 ms-access databases while...</p>
<p>Server2 (server 2008) is hosting 1 of the 3 ms-access databases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've revised the code to skip each database and narrowed down the server2008 hosted db as the culprit.</p>
<p>I still don't understand why all the win7 pc's can access this hosted database fast, while the win8 box takes 20 minutes. &nbsp;If I manually open and search this access db from win8, the speed is fine; only a problem when accessing the DB via vba to server 2008
 from a win8 pc.</p>

            Ram Kumar; you're suggesting I post a problem with excel macros performance between windows 8 &amp; server 2008 in the exchange server forum? &nbsp;Can you explain how that's going to bring me closer to my answer? (considering my question has absolutely nothing
 to do with exchange server.

    <title>alerts in onedrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martenm  say:</h3>
<h2>            alerts in onedrive</h2>
                    
<p>hi,</p>
<p>yesterday i configured onedrive (business) to send alerts when someone else makes changes in my documents (shared docs, that is). but i get a message when i myself make changes. why - the settings say that i will recieve notifications when someone else makes
 changes? i got over 800 alerts in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>the screenshot is in swedish, but it says send e-mail, for all types of changes, for changes only made by other people, immediately.</p>
<p>and by the way, will this feature be available after the classic view of onedrive is deprecated?</p>

<p>Hi Mand,</p>
<p>Could you check the following points?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Could you check if there are any other alerts under <strong>Alert Me &gt; Manage My Alerts</strong>?<br />
2.&nbsp;Could you try remove the alert and then set up a new one and check if the issue will also happen?</p>
<p>The classic view of OneDrive for Business is the default library interface of SharePoint Online (OneDrive for Business is based on SharePoint Online), so it may not retire. You can also access the library via you SharePoint Online personal site (Open Newsfeed
 &gt; Gear icon &gt; Site contents &gt; Documents).</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>hi mand,</p>
<p>i have done a test on my side and find if i choose “someone else changes a document” option, then when i (the shared folder owner)make changes on the folder, i will not receive the emails, only when other users make changes on the shared folder, do i receive
 these notification emails. to further investigate this issue, i’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. from the screenshot you provided, i notice there isn’t an <strong>send alerts to</strong> option like below, could you let us know the detailed steps you have done to set the alert on a document, folder or library?<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9e46a79e-58d6-4c07-8457-a768dd98ac22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9e46a79e-58d6-4c07-8457-a768dd98ac22" /></a><br />
2. as you have mentioned you have got 800 alerts, could you capture a screenshot of one alert message for our investigation?
<br />
3. do any other colleagues encounter the same issue in their own onedrive for business libraries? this will help us identity if this issue is related to tenant.</p>
<p>we look forward to your updates.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
kerwin</p>

<p>Hi Mand,</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>To troubleshot if the issue occur on other libraries, could you set up an alert on a new library in OneDrive for Business site? To create a new library, please click the settings icon like a gear<strong> &gt; Site contents &gt; add an app</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, could you share with us the tenant information for our further investigation? To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the information. You could check and respond to it via the link below:

<p>Hi Mand,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your confirmation. I'd like to write a quick summary about the issue. You get the notification emails when set an alert on your OneDrive for Business library with settings " Send me an alert when: Someone else changes a document". The issue persists
 after removing and re-creating the same alert on the OneDrive for Business library. And the issue only occur on your specific OneDrive for Business library.<br />
<br />
Please confirm whether other settings about "Send Alerts for These Changes", for example, "Someone else changes a document created by me". It will help to clarify whether the alert notification issue only occur when the settings set to "Send me an alert when:
 Someone else changes a document"<br />
<br />
If there is any misunderstanding on the situation, please collect me. We'd like to involve related team for further investigation.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Mills <br />
<br />

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>The summary is correct.</p>
<p>I do not get alerts from my own changes when I set up an alert for "Someone else changes a document created by me",but I do get alerts fro other people's changes, as expected.</p>

    <title>Starting to Unload MS Windows 10 TPE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rgloria  say:</h3>
<h2>            Starting to Unload MS Windows 10 TPE</h2>
                    I have started to unload some of Windows TPE because it takes almost 2 days for the systems to stabilized. &nbsp;Will I be able to use Free Windows Beta testing Copy? &nbsp;I suggest MS put the stipulation for getting the Windows TPE to just 2 or 3 copies per household.
 &nbsp;I also plan to buy an official copy but there is no information on the where, how and how much from marketing from Microsoft nor the their vendors.

            <p>Hello, Uninstalled and rebooted the computer, then installed the same new Outlook connector, rebooted and I still have the error message. There is something new, since yesterday when I use Internet explorer to access my Google account both the mail and contacts
 pagesa are all messed up, there is extra bit of information, none of wihch makes much sense. When I use Chrome, there are NO problems with the display. Still can not sync from my Motorola Droid X to my&nbsp;Google calendar. I have done three&nbsp;factory resets, two
 safe mode removal of information&nbsp;but the phone will not communicate with the Calendar or the Contacts. If, I enter the information on the Google side they sync fine. Both Motorola and Verizon says it's the other&nbsp;ones problem and then the blame Microsoft for
 creating the issues. If you read the recent problems, they are becoming worst. Thanks, for the lead but it does not resolve the Run time problem.</p>

<p>I accidentally deleted some files while&nbsp;in File Explorer.&nbsp; And now my Windows Media Player won't open &amp; on top of that, none of my MP3 files can play (even ones set as ringtone).&nbsp; When I press on the&nbsp;WMP&nbsp;icon, nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are my options?&nbsp; Any alternatives other than a hard reset?&nbsp; I'm running on Windows Mobile 6 Professional.</p>
