<h2>            I&#39;m getting kind of fed up with this</h2>
                    <p>I'm sick of "suggestions." even when trying to start this topic.&nbsp; I'm sick of this forum, not because of the contributions, but because of the ridiculous filters that never apply specifically to the situation, or just limit you to someplace that is never
 read.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The turning point was using w10 to print some tickets from StubHub.&nbsp; What was once a simple process of connecting to a home PC, just became inane.&nbsp; At every shortcut, I had to wrestle with the "app" for control.&nbsp; Finally, I was able to connect and print,
 but only through the app (I'm sure there is a way, but I just wanted it done).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; The "app" does not have all&nbsp; printer settings.&nbsp; Monochrome, or color only ... name your paper.&nbsp; No fast grayscale, etc.&nbsp; As someone who has students who need to print&nbsp; 40+ pages of PDF documents at any given time, this was crazy.&nbsp; The whole app experience
 has left me upset at the lack of control.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to commute, I am familiar with android apps and cloud services.&nbsp; I depend on them, but between commutes, I would relish when I could access an actual OS, windows 7 or Mac.&nbsp; Apps were a stop gap until real work could be done.&nbsp; There is a difference
 between cross platform sharing, entertainment, and actual functionality.&nbsp; Just look at this screenshot.&nbsp;" Food and drink"&nbsp; really?&nbsp; And no right click, no ability to easily find the folder for any app::&nbsp; Most of all, no details, no ability to scroll the menu
 bar to look at details or shortened descriptions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a desktop OS. this is a mess.&nbsp; One wonders why google has not released a desktop OS, though they were hyping it years ago.&nbsp; I am not going to hunt through the limiting app layer for important things, like printing tickets.&nbsp;Things that were seamless,
 and had the granularity that may not be needed everyday, but it was there, with limited hassle.&nbsp; As a long time windows user, for important things, I find this OS a hassle.&nbsp; For years, a learning curve has been set, but now you want me to use a phone, on a
 PC?&nbsp; Sorry, Used a phone and tablet. I want a desktop OS when I drag myself off of 4g and the CTA and Metra.&nbsp;

            This is BETA software. So by it's nature it's going to be buggy. Why would you use BETA software to print tickets? Why not use your regular OS?

            you are using a desktop OS. It's one thing to test the OS it's another thing to print tickets that you probably paid good money for on BETA software. MS is not going to significantly change Windows 10 between now and when it's released so you need to deal
 with it.&nbsp;So I suggest if you can't deal with Windows 10 then there is OSX or Linux. Enjoy.

            <p>Putting the "Beta is beta" attitudes aside for one moment, maybe, and bear with me on this one, he wanted to test a function on Windows 10? I like him would assume that a reasonably common function, like say printing a document, would be an area of Windows
 10 that would be reasonably complete. It's not and he is upset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now sure the tone of the op is a little grumpy and is obviously powered by frustration at more than just the printing thing, but it&nbsp;still makes a point, addresses a concern, and makes a suggestion. None of which your post does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we take the "Why would you use Beta software for that?" attitude you wouldn't really be testing anything would you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the only case I have seen of an app lacking even the basic features of its legacy predecessor. It's not unreasonable to think that when creating an app to replace old&nbsp;"program" that it would have all the same features (if not more) and perhaps
 be better in some way. This is not the case here&nbsp;and isn't the case with many other apps (I am looking at you Skype.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to add to the OP's complaint mine is this. Before an app is put up to be tested it should be a COMPLETE replacement to its legacy equivalent in functionality. Those functions can be buggy as hell, or not work at all, but the should exist. Anything else
 comes across as half-**** and causes the frustration expressed by the OP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the main reason that Win 10 is relegated to a separate boot rather than my daily driver. It's faster, more stable, and prettier than Win 7, but it is far too jarring having to use and rely on old programs&nbsp;when an app can and should contain the same
 functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>YMMV</p>

            <p>I have to say I agree with you even if it is a Beta there are some things that should be able to do what they intend to do Printers are not something new and printing is one of the main things in any OS ...so it would be ok to assume that something simple
 like printing would be easy and without any fuss... I for my part haven't tried any printing out yet but I will soon ......</p>
<p>the Beta will have Bugs that's why we are testing it and sending feed back it will be seen if things improve before it gets to RTM release

            Fully agreed. The "It's Beta" excuse&nbsp;is nothing&nbsp;more than a cop-out&nbsp;here. Even some well established web sites&nbsp;are starting to do the minimalist app looking interface that does not function worth a darn. Have a look at Pay-Pal. We recently had to do a
 money transfer transaction there. The new look site was nothing but a hassle with missing functionality that did not work right. Fortunately, we were able to switch to the classic site&nbsp;and&nbsp;we got our transaction done&nbsp;with no issues. I'm finding apps on Windows
 10 to be much the same.&nbsp;Some of them don't really work&nbsp;all that well. Switching back to classic programs and setting them as defaults solves the problem for me. I know we are supposed to be testing the apps here,&nbsp;but I'm finding that they are just not worth
 the effort to do so at times.

<p>Then you test it on a NON IMPORTANT document. You don't test it on something important then get mad when it gets screwed up.</p>

<p>AH bull. The same "established" sites bash windows 8 to death and made everyone hate it. When you have people that never tired 8 say is sucks when how would they know you know some serious bias is going on. Who are these established sites? CNET and ZDNET
 sites loaded with KNOWN&nbsp;Apple and Linux fanbois? Yeah totally unbiased. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Delusional people think if they whine here enough that somehow 10 weeks out from the RTM MS will suddenly decide throw everything they've done out and make Windows 10 more like Windows 7. Um no ain't happening . That's not even close to realistic thinking.</p>

            Speaking of Apps...We've had lots of issues with the mail program ever since after build 9926...now it's working but still not to my satisfaction...The Incoming is separate from the message..so I can only see one or the other...I don't like switching back
 n' forth...is it just me??....Also when I PIN the Mail App to TASKBAR...it does not SHOW...but it's there, ...just does not physically Show ...no matter how many times I try...but so far all other Apps DO Appear...so Ya'&nbsp; Why something worked fine before...is
 not going so well with NEWER BUILDS???...How can the engineers live with what is broke or is it just me again...*john&nbsp;

            <p>Having the same problem myself, running the 32 bit version. <br />
<br />
Gmail works fine. Hotmail - with the connector uninstalled and reinstalled at least half a dozen times - still fails. I've tried deleting the Outlook ost file, the generated hotmail pst file, I ave tried killing the account and recreating it.
<br />
<br />
In Hotmail, I have enabled POP. Everything seems fine there. </p>
<p>Outlook 2010. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the error I get stuck on when clicking on the folder created for hotmail in outlook:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/520089c0-4195-45b1-bd8e-7c910f048d2b" /></p>
<p>I opened up permissions on the folder, unchecking 'read only' and givning blanket security access.. no can do . still same problem!</p>

            I have become so frustrated with trying to get this to work that I'm giving up. I'll use something else, no, ANYTHING else but Outlook for looking at me four different e-mail accounts. This is just too messed up, heck can't even get my Outlook to open
 right, why would I spend hours how to get my Yahoo account to work in Outlook?<br />

                    Add me to the growing chorus of people that can't sync their new Windows Mobile 6.1 HTC Touch Pro 2 to Windows Vista 32-bit, Windows 7 32-bit or Windows 7 64-bit.&nbsp; I've tried every possible scenario, installing WMDC first, then plugging in the HTC, plugging
 in the HTC without first installing WMDC, and many other iterations.<br />
<br />
Basically, I plug the HTC into my computer via USB and I get nothing but a charging light on the phone.&nbsp; Nothing else.&nbsp; Funny thing is that I got this to work on 2 of my PC's a few weeks ago and it worked for a few weeks.&nbsp; Then today, suddenly nothing again
 on any PC.&nbsp; Could it be related to various Windows Update security updates that are pushed out?&nbsp; When I leave the HTC plugged in when I install WMDC the driver installation process starts and ends "successfully" it says but the device it says it installed
 is "unidentifiable device" or some nonsense like that.&nbsp; I've tried to manually install Windows Mobile Device and Windows Mobile-Based Device from the manual install process of the Device Manager.&nbsp; Those installs of those drivers ends in a Code 10 error that
 it can't start the device.<br />
<br />
Yes, I've checked all the easy stuff like ensuring USB sync is set and the advanced communication stuff is turned off.

            Let's try this. Just make sure that you backup your data.<br />
<br />
On the phone go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System tab &gt; About &gt; Device ID. Change the name of the device and restart the phone.<br />
<br />
Connect again.<br />

            I am thinking we are out of luck with HTC phones. I have Windows Embedded CE 5.2 on my HTC 6800<br />
<br />
I read the below&nbsp;on the Microsoft Site's Notes:<br />

<br />
<div>
<div>You can use Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1 only with phones running Windows Mobile 2003 or later. ActiveSync and<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> Windows Mobile Device Center won’t work with Windows Embedded CE 4.2 or
 5.0, Pocket PC 2002, or Smartphone 2002 devices.</span></strong> (To see which Windows Mobile operating system you’re using, and if your phone doesn’t have a touch screen, click
<strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong>. If your phone has a touch screen, click
<strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> tab &gt;
<strong>About</strong>.) To sync content to any of these devices, you must use a USB or serial cable and your computer’s Internet connection and File Explorer.</div>

            What the OS is on your HTC 6800 is immaterial to the situation with my and other HTC Touch, Touch Pro and Touch Pro 2 phones.&nbsp; Those are are well within the requirements of WMDC, and in fact have worked for most people for a long, long time, until recently.

            @ Len Todd: The HTC 6800 runs Windows Mobile 6. Therefore it works with Activesync 4.5 and WMDC 6.1.<br />
<br />
@J Carp: Try a repair of WMDC in Programs and features in the Control Panel. If that does not work, log on to your computer with another user account and connect the device. See if you are able to setup a new partnership.

            I created a new user on my Windows 7 32-bit machine.&nbsp; I gave the user administrative privileges.&nbsp; Upon creation of the user account, I logged off my existing user and logged into the new user.&nbsp; I opened WMDC and acknowledged the TOS.&nbsp; I connected the Touch
 Pro 2 and it recognized it right away and connected.&nbsp; After it was done, I unplugged it.&nbsp; I waited about 30 seconds and I plugged it in again and got nothing but a charge light.&nbsp; WMDC says "Not Connected" despite it being connected.<br />
<br />
This is the same case in all users I've read about on the Internet.&nbsp; They all get connected for short periods of time then one day out of the blue with no significant device or PC changes (other than the Microsoft Updates) their devices suddenly aren't recognized.

            Open the Task Manager app on your device. Do you see Activesync listed there even if the device is disconnected?

<p>
</p><p>Apologize for the late reply.</p>

<p><span><span><span>Hi,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Computer color can be created in RGB (Red, Green, and Blue), CYMK (Cyan, Yellow, Magenta, and Black), or
 Pantone color formats. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>RGB is the format normally used on cathode-ray tubes in computer monitors.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Colors appear vivid and bright, but do not translate well into printed images.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>CYMK is the format used when preparing artwork for print. CYMK color appears less
 intense.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Convert RGB color imagery to the CYMK format before printing or initially create
 imagery in the CYMK color format. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Pantone color is used for spot color and should not be used in four-color process
 printing.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>CMYK encoding is typically used for print, which as quality requirements that are
 overkill for the web, with a decent quality photo editing tool, such as Photoshop.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You should be able to get decent, web quality, versions of these photos using RGB
 encoding.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Outlook 2003 Stopped Working after Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    I have used Office 2003 successfully for the past 14 years.&nbsp; I know, I know, might be time to upgrade but all was working fine until the last Windows 10 update.&nbsp; My calendar and contacts are locked after the Windows 10 update recently.&nbsp; I don't use Outlook
 for mail.&nbsp; The error message for all functions on my calendar...new appointment, export the data, update an appointment, etc...all say "The operation failed".&nbsp; So far Excel and Word continue to work without problems that I have noticed. I am not sure what
 my next step is.&nbsp; Any help will be appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you.

<p>Try this:</p>
<p>1) Click on the start menu (bottom left of the screen).</p>
<p>2) Type in control, then when control panel opens, click on that.</p>
<p>3) Go to Programs and Features.</p>
<p>4) Look for Office 2003, and select it (only click once on it).</p>
<p>5) Select Repair on the top of that window (It will have other options like uninstall etc). Select OK if a window appears asking for permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When that is done, then try it again. I just had a client with the exact same issue.</p>

<h2>            Headset microphone registered but can&#39;t connect.</h2>
                    <p>I own a Turtle Beach Elite 800x, I usually have it connected via Bluetooth and the microphone work fine, have to connect it in Audio Devices sometimes though.&nbsp; Haven't used it in a week and discovered this morning that while Audio Devices registers the audio
 in the Playback tab, it won't let me connect when I switch to the Recording tab.&nbsp; Device Manager doesn't show the microphone driver in Audio Inputs and Outputs, even though when I select Show Hidden Devices, it still has a microphone driver for another Turtle
 Beach headset I own and haven't used in a while.&nbsp; Uninstalled, reinstalled, upgraded Bluetooth, troubleshooted everything, updated Windows, had Microsoft take over my computer and look at it.&nbsp; The headset works with my Android phone so it's not the headset.</p>

 make sure to try them:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>

</li><li>
<p>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Search automatically for updated driver software</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for the updated one from the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</p>

<p>Rolling back to the previous version of Windows 10 restores both drivers in Device Manager, but only the driver for audio functions.&nbsp; The driver for the microphone is faded.&nbsp; Both are the newest drivers and now there are many Bluetooth Virtual Devices, when

    <title>Office 2016 for Mac&#58; Startup Folder and Templates and Add-ins - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bj68  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 for Mac&#58; Startup Folder and Templates and Add-ins</h2>
                    <p>I have a template I created for Word for Windows. &nbsp;I am trying to get it to work on Word 2016 for Mac. &nbsp;To clarify, it actually works, but it's not sticky. &nbsp;Steps I have taken:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have added the template to the /Users/[username]/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Startup/Word folder.</li><li>When I first opened the file locations in preferences there was no path for Startup. &nbsp;So I added the path in the first bullet item.</li><li>When opening a new blank document, the template is not loaded.</li><li>So I go to Tools &gt; Templates and Add-ins and load the template as a Global template, including checking the box.</li><li>The Ribbon appears and works great.</li><li>I save and close the document and Quit Word.</li><li>I reopen Word, and whether I select the previously saved document or a new blank document, the Ribbon does not load.</li><li>So I go back to Tools &gt; Templates and Add-ins. &nbsp;I see my template in the list but it is not checked.</li></ul>
<p>My goal is to get that template to stay checked. &nbsp;In my experimenting I discovered that if I save a document as a template into the startup folder then it is added as a global template and stays checked. &nbsp;That solves the problem on my personal computer but
 I need to distribute the template to other users. &nbsp;I also tried saving the template itself as a template and that didn't work either.</p>

<h2>            How to create a Office 365 mailbox for AD user&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi<br />
<br />
We have a local AD and have moved all mailboxes to O365.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now we have 1 Exchangeserver left, the hybridserver for management purpose.<br />
<br />
The question is. How do you create a mailbox for an&nbsp;existing AD user? Thats the normal scenario. The user have been created / copied from an user.<br />
<br />
If I go to "create office 365 mailbox" it will be a completely new user.<br />
If I go to "create mailbox" it will be a user in the database on the hybridserver<br />
<br />
What is the procedure for this?<br />
<br />
BR<br />
Steen</p>

<p>
</p><p>I repeatedly got this message when trying to upload a photo to my MS account, using a Windows PC and Microsoft's Internet Explorer (11).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I logged into my MS account using my Microsoft Windows 10 phone. When I log in to my supposedly "single" MS account on my phone, I see a photo already there. On my phone I can change the photo, but it doesn't appear when I log in to my supposedly "single"
 account on any PC with any browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to add to the fun, when I sign in to Skype, using the same MS account credentials, I get yet another, different, photo. Not yet worked out how to change that one either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have one MS account, or multiple ones with different pictures and options depending on from where I log-in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(This is a rhetorical question btw - I sign in with the same credentials on different devices. It's *supposed* to be the same account, but obviously it's not).</p>

            <p>This is fairly straightforward</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the userform code enter the following (change the names of the buttons as appropriate)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option Explicit<br />
<br />
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()<br />
'OK button<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Tag = 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Hide<br />
lbl_Exit:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Private Sub CommandButton2_Click()<br />
'Cancel Button<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Tag = 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Hide<br />
lbl_Exit:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an ordinary module, setup the calling macro that does all the work e.g. as follows. Change the Userform name&nbsp; (here Userform1), the option button names, the template path and template filenames as appropriate. I have only included two case statements.
 You will need one for each button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the most basic code. You might want to include error trapping for missing templates or unchecked options (I see none is checked in your illustration).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option Explicit<br />
<br />
Sub SelectADoc()<br />
Dim ofrm As New UserForm1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The name of the userform<br />
Const sTemplatePath As String = "C:\Path\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The path where the templates are stored<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ofrm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Show<br />

            <p>WOW. Thank you very much Graham. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This code does exactly what I want. I will take time to understand it as I am new to this&nbsp;coding.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to learn more about error trapping for missing templates or unchecked options like you suggested. Any links that can teach me how to do it?</p>
<p>

            <p>I am&nbsp;lost. Where do I add the FileExists function? I would guess&nbsp;the code&nbsp;inside&nbsp;Private Sub CommandButton1_Click() command&nbsp;goes inside the form code under the command for OK Button which I named cmdOK. If so do add or&nbsp;replace the code from your first reply?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realised I have bitten more that I can chew. so I scaled down my form to grasp these concepts.

            <p>Works like a charm. :) Thanks. Ha</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have copied the form&nbsp;and the macros&nbsp;in my normal template and created a button for the macro. I then&nbsp;added the code below to ThisDocument under Objects.</p>
<p>
</p><div>Option Explicit</div>
<div>Private Sub Document_New()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frmStart.Show<br />
End Sub</div>
<p>The button works fine. If I click the button on my quick access toolbar select an option and click OK it opens a new document based on&nbsp;the selected template.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I would like the same to happen when I&nbsp;launch word, more like setting it as a default. The form does show because of the above code however when I select&nbsp;any option and click OK,&nbsp;it opens a document based on the normal template and not the selected
 option. How can I fix that? </p>

            <p>Wow. This is perfect. Thank you very much. I achieved more than what I had in mind when I started this little project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am moving on to the proposal and reports form. The aim of this form is to allow the user to type in the title, Full names, Student No. and Supervisor name. Things like the Faculty, School, Department, Degree and Programme are in separate combo boxes
 and the user select from available options. This information will be populated in the cover page according to university standard. If possible I would like the form to auto complete based on that combo box list when the user starts typing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 8 faculties in the University. Within these faculties there are school and within schools you have the department. Department offers certain programmes and degrees. Now my challenge is writing a macro for schools combo box. I want the combo box
 for schools populate based on what was selected in the faculty combo box. What is selected in the school combo box will determine what the user see in the next combo box I want to link this all the way to the degree combo box. Otherwise I have to list all
 programmes that the university offer in one combo box. This makes it a challenge for the user to find their programme and not practical (I am currently using this code to populate the comobox and realize that it won't work best for what I want to do).</p>

</p><p>Take for instance the faculty combo box, I want all faculties to show as they do now. If you click on the highlighted option for instance, I want what's currently in the School combo box to show. This goes on to the department and then the department determines
 both degrees and programmes. Now I will have to program this for all faculties. By grouping these I will be able to eliminate all other information that got nothing to do with your faculty.&nbsp;</p>

 I just cant seem to find what should be a very easy answer to find.&nbsp;

<h2>            Office 2010 &#40;Word&#41; accumulating CVR files in &#34;temp&#34; folder &#40;&#33;&#41; Bug&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm using licensed (retail) version of Office 2010 Standard on my Windows 7 SP1 x64 machine. I applied to Service Pack 2 to Office 2010 also with no problem. There was a long-term problem which was irritating me, and i found the reason, and as far as i think,
 it should be a bug, or a brief explanation is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the scenario to reproduce the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) First clean your current "temp" folder. The folder is accessible using <strong>
run &gt; %temp%</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Open multiple Word (docx) files one by one. The amount of opened documents must be at least 2 or more. Look at temp folder, and you will see
<strong>.CVR</strong> files created by each document by default. So, for example; if you have opened 3 Word files, you'll see 3 .CVR files present there. This is OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem starts here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If you close all the Word documents (.docx), in this case, 3 Word files at once, or one-by-one (it doesn't matter),
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>only ONE .CVR file is deleted</strong></span> and the remaining
<strong>2 .CVR files remain in temp folder forever</strong>! In fact, each CVR file has to be deleted
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">for </span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">each</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> corresponding closed Word (.docx) document</span> to keep temp folder clean, but no joy.</p>
<p>This causes temp folder to accumulate a lot of .CVR files if more than one Word files were opened at the same Windows session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone noticed this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

            <p>For other readers of this thread, the poster is referring to the User Temp folder as found in Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Temp, not the Windows system Temp folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried, but I can't duplicate your experiment. I see one .cvr and a .tmp file generated in the temp folder when I first open Word, no matter how many Word files I open. But those are deleted when I close. Typically with these files, a crash will leave
 the temp files behind, so they can accumulate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your installation of Word may need repair, it's worth a try to see if it eliminates the excess .cvr files:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close all Office programs.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Start button</strong>, then on <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Programs</strong>, then <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on <strong>Microsoft Office 2010</strong> and choose <strong>Change</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Repair</strong>, then click on the <strong>Continue</strong> button.</li><li>Allow the process to complete, restart Windows, then see if Word is still making extra .cvr files.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>It's a frequent practice of programmers to dump stuff into the temp folder and not clean up afterwards, so emptying the temp folder regularly is a good practice whether you see these files or not.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response. Actually "<strong>%temp%</strong>" is the global temp folder as far as i know, and based on the articles on the net, and it was what i was referring in my original post.
<strong>Not</strong> "C:\Windows\Temp" which requires UAC elevation and the problem is not there.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Isn't it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, it's not a matter of installation repair, there's something wrong with 2010's behaviour. I read somewhere that Outlook 2010 is doing the same thing and leaving empty (0 kb) .CVR files even after close, and recommended behaviour is to ignore them
 or delete them periodically using a batch file which is insane :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm surprised that you couldn't reproduced the issue. Have you opened 3 or more Word files WITHOUT closing previous one? I mean, you must open a new one, whilst an existing Word file is already open, more and more. And if you close them all, only one .CVR
 file is deleted whereas a lot of .CVR files had been created before.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I opened 8 files simultaneously. One .tmp file and one .cvr file were created and both disappeared when I shut down Word. So this is not a universal bug that happens in all installations. That's why I suggested a repair.</p>

<p>hi christian,</p>
<p>what do you mean by saying “i cannot login to the 365 support assistant on my pc using the proper credentials i have to login”? do you mean that you are trying to open a service request? in fact, you still can post your problems and issues here at our forum,
 our engineers are always to help you.</p>
<p>since your outlook 2013 keeps crashing after adding your office 365 account into it, to better understand the situation, i’d like to confirm some information:</p>
<p>1. how did you set up your office 365 account into the outlook 2013 client, via exchange connection, pop or imap?</p>
<p>2. since the outlook client keeps crashing, are there any error messages after the outlook crashes? if yes, please capture a screenshot and send it to us for further analysis. to upload a screenshot, please click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> &gt; <strong>insert/edit media</strong> button.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=bb23587e-7bf8-4ca2-a31e-a04bd21b3488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dbb23587e-7bf8-4ca2-a31e-a04bd21b3488" /></a></p>
<p>3. did this issue happen only to you in your organization?</p>
<p>4. to identify whether this is a client side issue or server side one, could you please try setting up your office 365 account into another outlook 2013 client to see if the same issue occurs?</p>
<p>5. did you try uninstalling the outlook 2013 client and reinstalling it to see if the issue can be fixed?</p>
<p>i appreciate your time and efforts.</p>
<p>best regards,</p>
<p>mouran</p>

<p>I mean that Microsoft, the company who created Office 365, has recognized that their services are quite a cluster of unresolved bugs that make it near impossible to be productive and therefore you offer a client based error check and resolution tool called
 "Microsoft Office 365 Support and recovery Assistant"</p>
<p>you can learn about it here: <a href="https://community.office365.com/en-us/b/news_hub/archive/2015/05/26/introducing-the-microsoft-office-365-support-and-recovery-assistant#pi14512=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
community.office365.com/.../introducing-the-microsoft-office-365-support-and-recovery-assistant</a></p>
<p>This tool requires an office 365 login. WHEN I login using my office 365 access credentials, which I am able to do to write this note here, it tells me the login is wrong. Without the login, it will not troubleshoot.</p>
<p>I dont want to uninstall and reinstall Outlook 2013 and I should not have to because the crashes I have been experiencing only began occurring when I started using 365.

<p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>Based on my understanding, the issue is about Outlook crashing after you added Office 365 account to Outlook 2013. If anything is misunderstood, please correct me.</p>
<p>Regarding the login to Microsoft Office 365 Support and Recovery Assistant(SaRA) login issue, I’d like to confirm if you can login to
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>(OWA). If yes, please then try to login to SaRA with the account and password which you login to OWA.</p>
<p>In addition, have you installed update 3097877 or encounter the similar issue of this link
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/158/t/419742? If yes, we recommend you
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3097877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">remove KB3097877 </a>as a workaround. Meantime, you can participate for further discussion on this issue and monitor the following thread:

<h2>            Printing PDF file in SharePoint taking forever.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users have recently ran into an issue when they open PDF files from SharePoint in the URL and print them. It takes about 20 minutes to print the 40 page document.&nbsp; Of coarse when you download it and print directly from adobe it prints instantly on our corporate
 Biz Hub 80 pages per minute copier. I went into Google Chrome and under advance features turned on the download PDF automatically when trying to print. This change caused the document to not even be able to queue the printer to print and just made another
 download duplicate when you click on it. Any Ideas or work around so the user can print directly from opening the file in the web URL so it does not take 20+ minutes to print out all the pages like some check box setting in SharePoint or setting that needs
 to be turned off or on that will cause this to happen.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook hangs on acceptance of meeting request - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook hangs on acceptance of meeting request</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I'm having a very peculiar issue regarding the&nbsp;outlook calendar and meeting invites.</p>
<p>If I accept a meeting request from within the reading pane or with the reading pane opened, outlook starts generating&nbsp;(literally) infinite amounts of error stating that: the operation has failed, object cannot be found (this is
 me translating the message to English so it could be the actual English error is slightly different). To get out of this infinitely looping error I have to end the task via task manager. It occurs on all calendar invites.</p>
<p>The strange thing is, this error does not occur when you close the reading pane, right click the message and select accept or if you directly accept the invite from the calendar. It also functions fine in OWA.</p>
<p>I've already tried a lot of things to fix this issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>Quick repair </li><li>Online repair </li><li>Creating a new outlook profile </li><li>Working without an OST file (no caching enabled)
</li></ul>

<p>
I hope someone has some experience with this specific issue and can help me resolve this. Might there possibly be a hotfix for this issue?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Here are the answers to your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's Outlook 2013 -&nbsp;I do not know outlook 2013 its version, but I know it regards itself up to date.
</li><li>no </li><li>Yes </li><li>I will as soon as I can. I suspect this wil work because OWA is functioning normally, so&nbsp;I presume server side stuff&nbsp;is probably OK.
</li><li>I do not have access to the system ATM, but I've got the exact wording and look of the error for you:<br />
"The attempted operation failed. An object cannot be found" is displayed in a small popup screen with a big yellow triangle in which there is a black exclamation mark. There is no additional information or any way to access it visible in this popup (E.G. a
 more or details links/button).<br />

<p>Hi Twanvan der Leij,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Based on your description, OWA is working smoothly and other users in your organization don’t have the same issue. Therefore, the issue might have nothing to do with our Office 365 online service and it is more related to the Outlook client. In this case,
 we recommend you turn to our <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook support forum</a> for more accurate information. Experts there are proficient in handling these issues.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Sam</p>

    <title>Account Hacked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel724  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account Hacked</h2>
                    Is there any way Microsoft can temporarily disable an outlook account after it’s been hacked? The hacker changed the password and the associated gmail account, and now i can’t recover the account. I’d like to talk with someone from Microsoft for advice,
 but the automated voice just redirects me to the online account recovery support, which I’ve tried, but it doesn’t help, by the time I’m to get back into the account again, the hacker changes the password and I have to start the whole process over again. I
 desperately need to talk to someone. I’ve had this account for 10 years and everything i have is associated with it, if I can’t get it back, I’m screwed. Please help.
