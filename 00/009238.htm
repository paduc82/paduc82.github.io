    <title>Skype&#47;Win 10 Invasion of privacy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seeker3010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype&#47;Win 10 Invasion of privacy</h2>
                    <p>I am a member of the Insider Preview. This morning I had a request to test the new Skype preview. I have used Skype twice in my life. When I opened the App there was a Thumbnail photo next to my ASSIGNED ID (one I have never used, EVER).&nbsp;The Thumbnail is
 a picture obviously from my computer's camera. It is NOT one I have ever knowingly taken.&nbsp;I can tell the circumstances of the photo, but not the exact date or reason for it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider this an invasion of privacy, and what to know how to avoid a future repetition, beyond the obvious disconnection of the camera. I do use it for other apps.</p>

            <p>Let me also add to all of you people beating the "invasion of privacy" drum--exactly what is it you're so scared of?&nbsp; That Microsoft is somehow spying on you?&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; If you want to accuse them, you have to accuse everyone from Apple to Google to Dell
 and everyone in between.&nbsp; I've got news for you...Microsoft is actually a late comer to the party.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>No one</em> is doing anything that you aren't either (a) agreeing to by use of the services and/or products, or (b) agreeing to by clicking "I Agree" on a EULA.&nbsp; Whether you read the EULA or not, you're still agreeing to its terms when you click the
 button, and whining about it afterwards does nothing but make you look foolish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, you should all be grateful for Microsoft's willingness to be open about what they're doing and how they're doing it.&nbsp; They aren't doing anything that hasn't already been done by other companies; the difference is, they're being very open about
 it, and if I were the person that made that decision, I'd have some harsh words for everyone who uses the phrase "violation of privacy."&nbsp; If you click through without reading--or read and don't understand--it's no one's fault but your own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it is, I have no compunctions against laying it all out, so I'll simply offer my own harsh words: you all make me
<em>laugh</em>.&nbsp; ***Nothing*** on the Internet is private or anonymous, and it's a
<strong>fiction</strong> (bordering on delusion) to think otherwise.&nbsp; My generation just shrugs and accepts it--we don't want targeted advertising any more than anyone else, but you have to accept the reality that if you use modern Web-enabled software, it's
<em>going</em> to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, folks, but there's no "invasion of privacy" here.&nbsp; Just an uninformed person clearly in the Insider program for the wrong reason.&nbsp; Move along.</p>

            I'm really fighting the urge to slip into some old habits here...clearly you've missed the point.&nbsp; Let me see if I can clear up your confusion.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; You have a Microsoft and/or a Skype account.<br />
2.&nbsp; Microsoft owns Skype.<br />
3.&nbsp; Your accounts were linked.<br />
4.&nbsp; The Skype UWP app was installed and you were signed into it.<br />
5.&nbsp; Microsoft wants you to try the app since you're already a Skype user.<br />
<br />
The problem with people like you is, you signed up for the Insider Program, so you should be expecting things like this.&nbsp; Except when they happen, all I hear is complaining from people who are just interested in advance builds of Windows for their own sake,
 not for function testing.<br />
<br />
And the worst part of it is, if Microsoft had based their process on peoples' usage patterns, instead of by who had a Skype account and who didn't, we would've heard more conspiracy theorists like the OP coming out of the woodwork and crying foul.<br />
<br />
You don't like it?&nbsp; Uninstall the app.&nbsp; You don't like the process?&nbsp; Get out of the Insider Program.<br />
<br />
/So sick of the uninformed masses flooding these boards with nonsense.&nbsp; Get with the program, people, or get off the train.

<p>No, the point is well taken. Dealing with surprises is nothing new for me when testing either. The point is, if I wanted to test a feature, I would have activated myself and not have it done for me automatically by someone else.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You're still missing the point, and now I'm suggesting you leave the Insider Program altogether--because it's clear that you
<strong>don't</strong> get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to explain it to you one more time, and this time I hope you get it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew the Skype app was getting ready to come out, and was in fact in this build, but I honestly wouldn't have thought to try it until it let me know I was automatically logged in.&nbsp; (I'm one of those Insiders that focuses more on testing basic things like
 Miracast, and leaves things like Bash to the more technically savvy crowd.)&nbsp; When it did, not two seconds later it came up with an alert that I had an IM, and when I opened it I saw the UWP app for the first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I barely use Skype, and part of the reason why is because the desktop app is...for lack of a better word...clunky.&nbsp; (The other, more important, reason is that I'm not overseas anymore.)&nbsp; Having tried out the UWP app, though, I might consider giving it more
 screen time.&nbsp; It doesn't quite take the place of the old AIM, but on the other hand it's a tad more lightweight than Facebook for messaging purposes.&nbsp; I also realized that there's an issue with sending messages, since I got an error every time I tried to send
 from the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And while I'm thinking about all that, I'm also realizing how convenient it was that it popped up in the Action Center, not just to let me know about the sign-in, but also that incoming IMs appeared there as well.&nbsp; I'm also realizing that another service
 can be activated using my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how it's <strong>supposed</strong> to work.&nbsp; Windows 10 is <strong>supposed</strong> to present you with things you might not consider otherwise.&nbsp; That's why there's that helpful "Wondering what's new?" prompt on new installations.&nbsp; Insider builds
 are no different, and this is just one more manifestation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we're agreed then that:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; You're an Insider, and therefore a beta tester.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Beta testers are supposed to test new features.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Therefore, Insiders are supposed to test new features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Griping about experimental features that self-activate should only bother someone who was using the OS for something other than testing purposes.&nbsp; I therefore submit this as evidence that you're using the software improperly, and should withdraw immediately
 from the Insider Program.</p>

<p>

</p><p>Your Skype contacts are tied to your account and are saved on our servers. They will not be removed from your account unless you removed them yourself. It might be possible that you are accessing a different account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly recommend that you sign out and sign back in using the credentials you used to
<strong>initially </strong>create your account. Sign in with a Skype Name if you created&nbsp;your account using a Skype Name, same goes&nbsp;with accounts created using an email address or a phone number. You can use the
<strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Accounts Diagnostic link</a></strong> to determine whether you have multiple accounts or not. Enter the email address associated with your account and click
<strong>Continue</strong>. We'll give you the list of accounts that are under your email address.

            Hi yasser m.abdel moneim,<br />
<br />
Based on my knowledge, the supported Windows operating systems for Office 365 for Business are Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows 10 Server, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2008 R2. For more
 details, please refer to the following article:<br />
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-sg/office-system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System requirements for Office</a><br />
<br />
Also, please be noted that previous versions of Office, such as Office 2010 and Office 2007, may work with Office 365 with reduced functionality.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I suggest you upgrade your operating system to the supported ones and <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-or-reinstall-Office-365-or-Office-2016-on-your-PC-or-Mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            The Templates and Add-Ins dialog box from earlier versions of Word is still available, but it has been well hidden. The easiest method to open the dialog box is by clicking the Document Template button on the Developer tab, but first you may have to display
 the Developer tab (which you can do via File | Options | Customize Ribbon).

<h2>            Encrypt folder in outlook for Mac</h2>
                    I have an encrypted disk image on my Mac. I would like one of my Outlook inbox folders to reside in the encrypted disk image, so the emails can not be accessed without using the encryption password. I tried dragging the folder icon into my encrypted disk
 image, but this didn't cut the mustard. Does anyone know how to permanently move a folder so that it will be always encrypted? I'd appreciate any thoughts or ideas.&nbsp;

            Well, I seem to be making progress but it is still not a working fix, and I might just abandon this altogether.<br />
<br />
I moved the 'Office 2011 Identities' folder to the encrypted drive. Made an alias, put it back in Documents, and named it exactly 'Office 2011 Identities'. Then, I dismounted the encrypted drive. When I tried to open Outlook again, Hallelujah! It worked! Very
 excited. However, I closed it, dismounted the encrypted drive. The drive would not dismount because it was still 'in use', even though no applications were open. I force ejected it (nervously because it warns you it can damage the data in the drive, and then
 tried to open Outlook again. No go. I got the beach ball and the following error messages. Outlook would not open at all, even if the encrypted drive was open.
<br />
<br />
I did a system restart, and lo and behold, Outlook opened again, with all of my messages. So I am able to do it only when its the first use of the application after restart. Obviously this is incredibly inconvenient for an email client. After trying all of
 these options and pulling my hair out, I think I will likely default to Firevault 2, and finally give up on this solution.
<br />
<br />
Diane, you were right, funny things happen when you mess with the User Data folder! I just hope I can get everything back in place... Thank you so much for your help on this - at least I know that I tried all the options, even if it didn't work in the end.<br />

Wap - Yes, no problem at all<br />
<br />
Web - Yes, but you would need a web browser (link below) and the correct settings from your network operator.<br />

<p>Thanks for posting in our forum. We will try our best to provide support for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We created a Waterfall chart (Insert&gt;Chart&gt;Waterfall&gt;OK) and managed to change the Chart title/Legend/Axis to other fonts like
</span><span>Blackadder ITC&nbsp;</span><span>(click Chart title/Legend/Axis, select the font in the Font list).
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since we can't repro, could you please share the following information for us to investigate the behavior you encountered?</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Your OS version</span></li><li><span>A screenshot of your Office Product Information. (Open PowerPoint&gt;File&gt;Account, capture a screenshot of all the info under Product Information.
 This will show us your Office version, subscription and channel.)</span></li><li><span>If our repro step is different from yours, please your detailed steps.
</span></li><li><span>Does this behavior persist if you select other font like
</span><span>Blackadder ITC</span><span>?</span></li><li><span>Please confirm whether this behavior occurs with a new file.</span></li></ol>

<p>hi benjamin,</p>
<p>in this scenario, please check if the <strong>custom script</strong> is enabled. if not, enable it and check the outcome. to do that:<br />
<strong>.</strong> log into <a href="https://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the portal</a> using the
<strong>global admin's account</strong>&gt;<strong>admin&gt;sharepoint&gt;select settings</strong>&gt;under
<strong>custom script</strong> choose:<br />
<strong>allow users to run custom script on personal sites.</strong><br />
<strong>allow users to run custom script on self-service created sites.</strong><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efa38ee5-232b-4c20-a896-e9508f01abff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efa38ee5-232b-4c20-a896-e9508f01abff" /></a><br />
<strong>.</strong> select <strong>ok</strong> to save it. <br />
<strong>note: it takes about 24 hours for the change to take effect.</strong></p>
<p>after that, if the issue persists, for further investigation, i'd like to confirm the following:<br />
1. check if the issue happens to the site owner or other site collection admins.<br />
2. check your permissions for the site. to do that: let the site admin log into the site&gt; click the gear on the upper right corner, select
<strong>site settings&gt;</strong> under <strong>users and permissions</strong>, click
<strong>site permissions</strong>&gt; under <strong>permissions,</strong> click <strong>
check permissions&gt;</strong>input your name or email address and click <strong>check now.</strong>&nbsp;please provide a screenshot of the result.<br />
3. could you provide a screenshot of the error message with the correlation id?<br />
note: to upload screenshots, you can click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> in the forum and then click the icon of<strong> insert/edit media.</strong></p>
<p>thanks,<br />

    <title>Formula not calculating numbers with plus signs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthewrosen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formula not calculating numbers with plus signs</h2>
                    I am using a formula in a Word table to add up budget modifications.&nbsp; I need to use pluses and minuses to denote each modification- for example, I'll use "+$500.00" or "-300.00."<br />
<br />
However, the formula only registers the minuses.&nbsp; So, if "+$500.00"and "-$300.00" are filled in, the formula will yield a sum of "-$300.00."&nbsp; I guess it is not recognizing "+$500.00" as a number.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to change this?<br />
<br />
(Of course, I know that removing the plus signs would fix the problem, but I'm required to use the plus signs on the forms, so that's not an option.)<br />
<br />
Here's a link to the document: https://app.box.com/s/430yc3hephrec3t3nydu<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!!<br />

            Well, I have a work around if nobody can come up with anything better.&nbsp; The method in my previous post will work if you select the content control box containing the $500.00 and cut it, then insert the + sign using the field method. And then paste the
 $500.00 back in.&nbsp; As long as the plus sign is in a field and is&nbsp;outside the content control box, it will work, although it is cumbersome.

            Thanks again, Mike.&nbsp; That's an interesting strategy, but you're right, it is pretty cumbersome especially since we would need to do it frequently and repeatedly.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know any other way to get the formula to add numbers with plus signs preceding them?&nbsp; Is there perhaps some kind of macro that would fix this problem?<br />

Well,&nbsp;I see cutting the content box can be avoided by tabbing into the $500.00 cell, hitting the left arrow twice.&nbsp; That will take you outside of the content box, but looks like you still have to insert the plus sign as a field and not just type it in, in order
 to get it to work.&nbsp; A copy and paste of the plus sign (field) would make it a bit easier.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>p.s.</p>
<p>you&nbsp;can create the first + sign as a field and then add that to the Quick&nbsp;Parts menu so it would be available every time you hit the two left arrows to get outside the content box.</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Here's a crude macro approach that seems to work if your tables consist only of manually entered numbers (the "+" and "-" figures in items A. through I.) and a calculated field at the
 bottom (e.g., an "=SUM(ABOVE)" field), Basically I did a universal find/replace, changing "+$" to "<span>&nbsp;
</span>$" (<strong><i>two </i></strong>spaces and the dollar sign). Then I selected the whole file and updated the fields using F9. Then I went back and replaced all occurrences of "&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;$" with "+$" (which just restores the original "look" of the
 positive entries). </font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Initially replacing the "+" with two spaces will allow the positive values to be included in the "update fields" calculation, and using
<em>two </em>spaces will (a) make it easier to find the "tweaked" entries and restore them, and (b) leave alone any uninvolved entries (i.e., the "$0.00" numbers) that might have been originally typed in with a single leading space (we don't want to turn them
 into positive values that read "+$0.00").</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If you gave this macro a name like “Compute_Totals” and instructed users to run it after filling in the appropriate blanks, they could get the right results without having to delve
 into rocket science. As a rank beginner in VBA, I cheated and just recorded the steps, so the code below is primitive and overly long. However, I’m sure the real experts on this board (CRD Maxey, Mr. Robbins, Rohn007, Ms. Barnhill? Anybody home?) could translate
 my notion into a cleaner and more robust piece of code. Hope this helps . . . </font>

            Or perhaps there is a way to create a separate command that both executes your macro and updates the formulas (in that order)?<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The macro includes two lines
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Selection.WholeStory</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Selection.Fields.Update</font></font></font></p>
<p>that will select the entire file (including all fields) and then update the fields. That supplants the need to update the formulas manually. Then the macro goes back and restores the original "+$xxxx.xx" appearance of your entries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it were me, I'd assign the macro to the Quick Access Toolbar (probably using the little calculator icon as a mnemonic device); distribute it in a macro-enabled template; and tell users to just "click on the calculator icon once you've entered all your
 numbers." </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as a VBA neophyte I'm still wrestling with the best way to package and distribute macro-enabled templates to other users. The templates have to be stored in the right place, and the security settings all have to be correct for the macros to
 work. Rather than having me lead you astray, I'd suggest asking the experts on this board to help with that (it's a regular topic of discussion on this forum).

            <blockquote><font color="#000000">This is a learning question, is there a way to do Sequential-Alpha other than via the lookup table?</font></blockquote>
<br />
Yes, you can look it up directly from the operational table.&nbsp; If we assume this is named Batches and the key column containing the values in the format 130725A etc is named BatchCode, the expression would be:<br />
<br />
Format(VBA.Date,"yymmdd") &amp; Chr(Nz(DMax("Asc(Right(BatchCode,1)),","Batches","Left(BatchCode,6) = """ &amp; Format(VBA.Date,"yymmdd") &amp; """"),64)+1)<br />
<br />
Usually when incrementing a value in a key column like this it is done in the BeforeInsert event procedure of the data entry form, assigning the value returned by the expression to the control bound to the BatchCode column in the form.<br />
<br />
In a multi-user environment there is the risk of the same value being obtained more than once before the row is saved to the table, so the key violation error should be trapped in the form's Error event procedure and in the event of the error the value should
 be assigned again to the control, using the same expression.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you are also including the date in another column in the table, you should not incorporate the date in the structured key as this introduces redundancy and the risk of update anomalies, but simply store the suffix letter in a column.&nbsp; The combination
 of the date column and the suffix letter column constitute a candidate key, so can either be made the composite primary key of the table, or if a separate surrogate key such as an autonumber is used, be included in a single unique index.<br />

            <p>First, you should use two fields in the table for that, one for the date and the other for the sequential numbering.&nbsp; It is much easier to manipulate (do what you want) things when they are separate than it is to take a combined value apart.&nbsp; OTOH, it is
 very easy to put the separate values together (concatenate) whenever you need to display them to users in a form or report.&nbsp; This way you so not need an extra table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than store letters in the sequential numbering field, I would make it an Integer field so calculating the next number is easy.&nbsp; It's also fairly simple to convert a number to a letter using the Chr function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you go this way, the VBA code in the form's BeforeUpdate event procedure to calculate the next number and put it in the sequential number field could look like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.<font color="#000000">BatchDate = Date</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.<font color="#000000">ModNum</font>= Nz(DMax("<font color="#000000">ModNum</font>", "BatchesTable", "<font color="#000000">BatchDate = Date()", 0) + 1</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">And the form/report text box expression that converts the ModNum field's integer value to&nbsp;one or two letters could look like:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; =Format(BatchDate, "yyyymmdd") &amp; IIf(ModNum &gt; 26, Chr(64 + (ModNum - 1) \ 26), "") &amp; Chr(65 + (ModNum - 1) MOD 26)</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">If I understood what you want, I think that should be all you need.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

<h2>            5800&#59; decreased free phone memory space after update maps via Ovi Suite</h2>
                    
<p>As previously (ovi maps 3.04), when I update Ovi maps via Ovi Suite instead of OTA, the phone memory will decrease about 10-15MB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, Ovi maps 3.06 update occur in Ovi Suite, but dont occur&nbsp;via OTA. I update via Ovi Suite and the phone memory decreased form 44MB to 29MB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is here any temporary folder in phone memory, that can be delete for regain the free space?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately not, although you must have a <strong>lot</strong> of applications installed on your 5800XM as have 44MB of free phone memory even though OVI Maps v3.06 installed.</p>

<div>My phone began to whine about lack of memory recently (while browsing in Opera Mobile), so I took a look at free space in C: and was taken aback, I had only about 10 megs of space!</div>
<div>I logged every move I made, do not follow it step by step, there are some minor mistakes I made (which hopefully you will be able to avoid) and the numbers are just for the reference, browsing around the phone fluctuated the free space +- 0.2 MB, so they
 are not 100% exact, but I wrote them down exactly as File Manager showed.</div>
<div>Anyway, here goes:</div>
<div>Start:</div>
<div>10.7 MB</div>
<div>After deleting SMS attachments:</div>
<div>11.4 MB</div>
<div>After deleting SMS from last year:</div>
<div>12.2 MB</div>
<div>After deleting direct downloads:</div>
<div>(could not find the folder)</div>
<div>After uninstalling unused apps:</div>
<div>12.8 MB</div>
<div>After deleting 'C:\system\cache':</div>
<div>18.4 MB</div>
<div>After deleting 'C:\system\temp':</div>
<div>18.4 MB</div>
<div>After deleting contents of 'C:\system\dmgr':</div>
<div>18.9 MB</div>
<div>After removing app AntiMosquito:</div>
<div>21.6 MB</div>
<div>After uninstalling QT and QT mobility:</div>
<div>29.3 MB</div>
<div>After some more uninstalling (incl. Ovi Store *NOT Ovi store client and NOT Ovi Store data), Nokia maps *NOT Ovi maps*, Mail for Exchange, ):</div>
<div>....</div>
<div>Dammit, Nokia maps *WAS* the new app, not the Ovi maps!? Everything else is working fine, including Ovi store.</div>
<div>After deleting everything maps related and reinstalling Ovi maps:</div>
<div>32.3 MB</div>
<div>Not all themes are shown in the Installed Applications app, where are they stored?</div>
<div>What is Check in?</div>
<div>There are:</div>
<div>Check in agent (1 MB)</div>
<div>Check in data (1 kB)</div>
<div>Check in (459 kB)</div>
<div>Check in widget (21 kB)</div>
<div>Do I need them? I have no idea.</div>
<div>Also Ovi Store appears to have reinstalled itself, same size and all, so it was pointless uninstalling it in the first place.</div>
<div>After uninstalling Adobe Reader LE:</div>
<div>35.7 MB</div>
<div>Hope this was of any help and if there is anyone out there who knows about this Check in stuff, it would be great if you could drop a line here.</div>
<div>Best of luck.</div>

            hi mate just to explain the check in stuff is for lettin friends no where you are in the world. Say you go to town well you open maps and check in but it can be attached to facebook etc so check privacy because if you checked in in say local town center
 well every one with shared access to maps would know you are not at home. So do be carefull with check in because you are advertisin to everyone your house is maybe empty and no one in and they no your exact position. It canbe kept private in settings

    <title>MS Access Crosstab Query Show All Rows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laymo84  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access Crosstab Query Show All Rows</h2>
                    <p>I have a crosstab query&nbsp;that reports student attendance at professional development workshops we hold.&nbsp; This will get emailed to instructors so that they know which of their students are attending which workshops.&nbsp; To use the query, users open a form that
 asks for input on semester (e.g. Spring 2012)&nbsp;and instructor name so that instructors are only sent information about their students.&nbsp; The query basically works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if a student has not attended any events, he or she is not included in the crosstab results.&nbsp; This is a problem because the instructors would like to confirm from this report that a student has not attended.&nbsp; Bottom line: the crosstab query needs
 to display all students in the instructor's course even if they have not been to any events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've read some posts online about left joins and basing the crosstab query on multiple queries but am confused on this concept and would appreciate any advice I can get.&nbsp; Here is my query:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PARAMETERS [Forms]![frmCourseLocator]![cboInstructor] Text ( 255 ), [Forms]![frmCourseLocator]![CboTerm] Text ( 255 );<br />
TRANSFORM Count([CSPD Events].EventDate) AS CountOfEventDate<br />
SELECT [Catapult Courses].CourseInstructor, [Catapult Courses].CourseSection, Students.StudentID, [LastName] &amp; ", " &amp; [FirstName] AS FullName, Count([CSPD Events].EventDate) AS TotalEvents<br />

 = Enrollment.StudentID<br />
WHERE ((([Catapult Courses].CourseInstructor)=[Forms]![frmCourseLocator]![cboInstructor]) AND (([Catapult Courses].CourseTerm)=[Forms]![frmCourseLocator]![CboTerm]))<br />
GROUP BY [Catapult Courses].CourseInstructor, [Catapult Courses].CourseSection, Students.StudentID, [LastName] &amp; ", " &amp; [FirstName]<br />

<h3> dima23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows desktop rearranges desktop icons in 15002-15007 preview build</h2>
                    Hello everyone. Recently I've updated to 15007 Insider preview build and caught nasty bug. Desktop icons are rearranged by itself after I log out or reboot my PC. How to handle this? Because of this error I tried to reset OS, but it got stuck on blue screen
 (NOT BSOD or GSOD) and the text on the middle "Almost done...". More than hour has passed and nothing changed, so I decided to download 15002 build from Microsoft site. Flashed it on usb and made a completely fresh/clean install. But OS still arranges icons
 by itself on 15002 build too... How to resolve the problem??

            This is not a solution, you just&nbsp;return to a build that has more bug and less features than the latest build. Being part of the insiders program implies testing newer builds , besides, desktop icons that change their location on the desktop can hardly
 be a serious issue.

<p>Referring to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Turbo_Boost" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Turbo_Boost</a>,</p>
<p><strong>Intel Turbo Boost</strong> is a technology implemented by 
Intel in certain versions of their 
Nehalem-based CPUs, including 
Core i5 and Core i7. Turbo Boost allows dynamically increasing CPU clock-speed on demand.&lt;sup id="cite_ref-intel_0-0" class="reference"&gt;<span><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span>&lt;/sup&gt;
 Turbo Boost activates when the 
operating system requests the highest performance state of the processor. Processor performance states are handled viaACPI which is supported
 by all major operating systems so no additional software or drivers are required to support this new technology.&lt;sup id="cite_ref-intel_0-1" class="reference"&gt;<span><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span>&lt;/sup&gt;Most
 refer to this concept as "dynamic 
overclocking".&lt;sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"&gt;<span><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span>&lt;/sup&gt;</p>
<p>When the processor has not reached its thermal and electrical limits and the user's workload demands additional performance, the processor clock frequency will dynamically increase in increments of 133&nbsp;MHz on short and regular intervals until a thermal or
 power limit is reached or the maximum speed for the number of active cores is reached. Conversely, when any of the limits are reached or exceeded, the processor frequency will automatically decrease in increments of 133&nbsp;MHz until the processor is again operating
 within its limits.&lt;sup id="cite_ref-intel_0-2" class="reference"&gt;<span><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span>&lt;/sup&gt;</p>
<p>That means it may use more than 1 processor within Intel i5 to perform calculation if workload is heavy, but does Office 2003 support calculations with multi-processors?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t upload photos on Windows Phone 8</h2>
                    So this problem started a couple of days ago. I have been trying to upload pictures from my Nokia Lumia 820 to both facebook and skydrive but I constantly get this error.... "We can't upload your Picture at the moment" I have tried this several times while
 on a wifi connection with full internet connection but it won't work. also I have notice that I can move the image from my phone to my PC easy enough but won't show in and image viewer or editor.
<br />
<br />
Anyone know what I can do about this? I never had this problem with my HTC Titan WP7.5 so I'm a bit confused.<br />

<h2>            My &#39;Type a new task&#39; box is gone from the top of my to-do bar in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    In Outlook 2016, I use my calendar and my to do bar, positioned to the right of my calendar, to centralise all my work into the one view.&nbsp; At the top of the to do bar, there is a 'type a new task' box.&nbsp; Normally in the morning I will click once in this
 box and start typing out the tasks I need to do for the day.&nbsp; As soon as you press Enter, the task gets added to your task list as a normal priority task for today.&nbsp; It is a very handy feature for doing a start of day brain dump.&nbsp; One day, the type a new task
 box disappeared and I have not been able to ever get it back.&nbsp; There is a tick box in View Settings &gt; Other Settings, but that does not add it back in again.&nbsp; Any help much appreciated.
