                    <div><b>Original Title:&nbsp;</b>"can't sync inbox"</div>
On a freshly installed MacBook Air (Mac OS X Lion), I installed Office 2011. When I set up the email account, Outlook will sync completely with the Exchange Server. After the first full sync is done, no new emails will be downloaded and error messages will
 appear:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The folder "Inbox" cannot be synced with the server.</div>
<div>and</div>
<div>The folder "Sent Items" cannot be synced with the server.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Error code is -19</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The suggested solution to empty the folder cache will not solve the problem. The folders will sync again with the server, but only for one full sync. After that, the same problem occurs again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On other machines with the same user account, this problem does not occur so far.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Removal and reinstallation of Office 2011 does not solve the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Removal and new setup of the user account does not solve the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm open to suggestions.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance,</div>
<div>Tobias</div>

            Did you install Lion over Snow Leopard or did you do a clean install of Lion? If you installed over, try installing Lion again. It will install without data loss like the old "Archive &amp; Install" method. Upgrade to 10.7.1 that was released yesterday.<br />
<br />
Errors that fall into the low negative numbers often are hardware related. You could have bad blocks. You can try booting from another volume and run Repair Disk in Disk Utility. If you have Disk Warrior or any disk repair utility run that to verify the health
 of your drive.<br />
<br />
<br />
How many items are in your Inbox? This folder syncs more frequently than any other and should be kept as clean as possible.<br />
<br />
Any folder with more than a few thousand messages is going to take some time to fully come down when you first sync your account. Due to the design of Outlook's sync engine (and how exchange works), you will see the 512 newest messages in a folder at the initial
 start of sync then the rest of the folder's contents will be back-filled before you see any mail that arrives after this point. This is why it will look like you are not getting new mail when a folder is still going through initial sync. This is also further
 exacerbated by an Exchange issue where it gets unnecessary change events before the newer mail arrives. If you carefully watch the progress during the sync of a folder with greater than a couple thousand messages, you will see "Updating local..." a lot before
 the newer mail starts arriving (newer than the initial 512 that come down).<br />
<br />
Outlook checks the server for updates every minute, any folder that has updates will subsequently be synced. Since Outlook has a limit on how many folders can be synced at a time, there can be a queue of folders waiting. The Inbox does get high priority so
 it will generally sync before other folders that also need to sync.<br />

            <div>Diane, thank you for the response.</div>
<div><br />
It happened on a brand new MacBook Air that came with Lion installed. I did all the security upgrades, 10.7.1 was also installed. I then used Migration Assistant to import the user's data from a TimeMachine backup. On the first start of Outlook, there was a
 message from Outlook that because of the import from a TimeMachine backup, it needs to redownload all the folders. After the full download (some 3 hours), the error messages started coming up.
<div><br />
<div>I already ran Disk Utility to scan for bad blocks and to repair permissions, that didn't help.
<div><br />
<div>I have also created a new account on the same MacBook Air and set up the same Exchange account. After all the folders had fully synced (no more activity in the progress window), the next time I tried syncing or sending a message, the same error message
 came up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Inbox has 30'000 messages, but that has not been a problem so far.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have now created a new account for the user on another Mac and will set up his exchange account there to see if it shows the same behaviour.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Could this problem be related to importing the data from a TimeMachine Backup? I don't think so because it didn't work in a new user account either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will reinstall Lion and see further. Any hints that save me from more hours of waiting while the folders sync yet again are well appreaciated.</div>

            I suspect that the Time Machine migration did you in. Some times it works and other times not.<br />
<br />
My philosophy is when you do a major upgrade, it might be quicker to import but why not take the time to do a clean install of everything so you don't bring over old baggage.<br />
<br />
Unless there was data in the "On My Computer" folders, you can create a new User and see if Outlook works in the new User. If that is successful, you can just bring over your documents, photo, music and movies via Shared folder. Result is you are back in a
 clean Lion User. Delete the old User when you are satisfied you have all the data.<br />
<br />
CREATE A NEW USER<br />
<br />
Go to System Preferences --&gt; Create a New User in Accounts. Switch to the New User by logging out/in or use Fast User Switching.
<br />
<br />
PS. 30K messages is asking for trouble. Exporting as .olm or .mbox file will most likely fail leaving you with no way to backup your data.<br />

            <p>Diana,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reinstalled the whole OS and all the applications, created the user account and set up the exchange account again in Outlook. This time, everything worked fine. For four days, then the same problem started showing up again. The problem now occurs
 also in Calendar, Contacts and other Folders I created to store the messages I removed from the Inbox.</p>
<p>Creating a new user has had&nbsp;no effect on the problem if it is done on the same machine, no matter if it is done before or after the reinstall of the OS.</p>
<p>I have cleaned out the Inbox and Sent Items to only a few hundred messages. Their first sync is quicker now, but the problem has spread to other folders. After a reboot of the machine, the problem still occurs.</p>
<p>Since the affected user is working on two macs (one on lion, one one snow leopard) we can't archive the messages to have less messages on the server. The user now wants to buy a new second mac, also with lion. So I would like to be certain that at least
 on one machine, Outlook will work fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea of creating a completely new user account and copying all the documents etc is fine, but what about all the settings in all the programs? The user is a medical doctor and professor, he will not want to spend his time recreating all his settings.
 So this is not an option this time. (Also, Outlook had the same problem with a clean user account in lion, so I suppose the problem has to be solved otherwise)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions anyway,</p>

<h2>            How to display query results in a subform and refresh as query data is entered&#63;</h2>
                    I have a database that is an index of scanned documents. I created a query form where&nbsp;query parameters&nbsp;can be entered in multiple fields with a button which will create a report&nbsp;in another tab based on the entered query parameters. What I would like to
 do is have a subform at the bottom of the page that updates with results as query parameters are entered instead of creating a separate report. Preferred format is a pivot table because I want one of the fields in the results to be a clickable link to the
 folder where the document is stored, unless there is a better way to do this. I tried dragging the query in as a subform, but this just gets me a static list. Can anyone point me in the right direction to do this? Fairly new to Access (Access 2007).

            <p>The query is below. Probably not the best way to implement it, but I was trying to check multiple fields for partial matches. The record source of the subform is this query. I am not sure how to get it to requery and update when data is entered in any of

            <p>Yes, not the best way to implement. On the other hand, since tis only using one table, it shoudl be editable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really not following what you are doing here. It looks like you have controls for entering multiple criteria (i.e 20 names) and that you want matching records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I'm going to suggest is that you try using datasheet filtering. With datasheet filtering you can build your criteria column by column in a logical manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see where this data fits into a pivot table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are you trying to get at, btw? Are you trying to filter down to a specific document so you can retrieve it?</p>

<p>
</p><p>You simply need to requery the subform control in the AfterUpdate event procedure of each of the unbound controls referenced by the query as parameters:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.[YourSubformControName].Requery<br />
<br />
where YourSubformControName is the name of the control in the parent form's Controls collection which houses the subform.<br />

            <p>Learning as I go, I will look into filtering. Yes, I am trying to find and retrieve documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The database is an index of&nbsp;documents, primarily scanned maps and CAD drawings. The index contains information on the scanned file including type of map, location (address#, street, nearby streets, lot, block, nearby lots),&nbsp;names of owners and folder location
 on the network. I made the query to search multiple fields for each search term (e.g. street will search all street fields) and return any matches meet all of the entered criteria. It seems to work, however inelegant it may be. Currently the search parameters
 are entered and the result form is created when the "create report" button is clicked. I am trying to get the report to show on the same page instead of opening up separately, and ideally update as the search is refined by entering more data. If possible,
 the folder field would be a hyperlink so that the file can be found easily.</p>

            <p>I took a closer look at your database and you have a major problem. I misread it before. I thought you had multiple controls named Name1, Name2 etc. but those are fields in your table and that is poor design. It is called a repeating group and should be
 in a subtable. Something like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblMapNames</p>
<p>MapNameID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>MapNumber (FK) &nbsp;(notice no space, you shouldn't have spaces in object names)</p>
<p>MapName</p>
<p>
</p><p>then you would have one record for each name associated with a map. Same thing for Lot and Block, though I would assume they would go in the same child record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as Ken and I said, you just need to requery the subform after entering each criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think you need to look at datasheet filtering as it gives you the same thing.&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you. Where would I put the requery command? Does it go in the AfterUpdate event on the subform to cause the subform to update? Or does it go in the properties for each of the input boxes on the main query form?

    <title>Word 2010&#58; Forced to Paste everything in &#39;Text Only&#39; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alfonsfutterer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010&#58; Forced to Paste everything in &#39;Text Only&#39; Format</h2>
                    Suddenly I cannot copy and paste formatted text. Since 2 days I can not copy &amp; paste (CTRL+V) text and tables with format. All methods to use the paste command will result into a text or tables which loose their formatting. It is not only possible to paste
 content in 'text only' format. Did not find any reference to such a problem in help. Changed all copy&amp;paste setting in Advanced Options and put them back to original setting. Restarted Word and PC multiple times. Also de-installed and installed Office 2010.
 Any other idea how to re-activate this function?&nbsp;<br />

            <p>For what it's worth, in Word 2010 (and 2007), you can access COM add-ins as follows: Click the File tab, and then click Options. In the Word Options dialog box, click the Add-Ins category. In the "Manage" list, choose "COM Add-Ins" and click OK. This opens
 a dialog box where you can remove add-ins.</p>
<p>Also/alternatively, you can see if Word runs properly in Safe mode. To start in Safe mode, hold the Ctrl key as you start Word normally. When asked about Safe mode, click yes.</p>

            Thanks for reply. Could solve the problem in Word 2010 by removing the "Acrobat PDFMaker Office COM Addin", as administrator. It was not enough to un-check the box. Last week I started to use Adobe Cloud, and the "PDFMOfficeAddin.dll" plugin might be the
 root cause. It is located at&nbsp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat 9.0\PDFMaker\Office.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Now I have the same problem "forced to paste everything in Text Only" in Excel and Outlook.&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
<div>I did rename the "PDFMOfficeAddin.dll" to ".old" to see whether this eliminates the problem in both programs. When I started Excel a box popped up indicating that Excel or Acrobat has to be reconfigured. decided to stop that process and rename the file
 to ".dll".<br />
<div><br />
<div>In Excel I can see the same "Acrobat PDFMaker Office COM Addin". In order to remove it I need to start the program as Administrator. Can you please advise how to start Excel as administrator.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Outlook: In the COM Add-in box I can only see PFDMOutlook as a potential suspect for this problem. If no objection from your side I like to remove this addin to see, if the problem goes away. How to run Outlook as administrator?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, when I deleted the addins in Word I deleted two addins related to OneNote. I am not using that program, but just in case, can you share with me how I can re-install the addins for this program.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.&nbsp;</div>

<br />If I click on "connected accounts" or "options" I just get a spinny circle that never goes away.  Like it's looking for something but is not there. 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />This is likely the problem. Try logging in using a different browser, a private browser session, or clear the browser cache.

<h2>            Music player</h2>
                    Why can't the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">default music player (the one with logo of white headphone on green background)</span> of windows phone 8.1 play music/songs from any folder other than the default "music" folder from my SD card ? I
 have a Lumia 630 in India. I had to download an unofficial app from the store to play music, and this app certainly can play all songs/music from all folders from whole of the SD card.

            <p>Thanks to you all for the replies. I do appreciate your suggestions. But the funny thing is my problem has been totally solved right after I got an update of the default music app on 5th March. Now I can play all the music from my SD card, be those in the
 default music folder or anywhere else. </p>

<p>Thank you for posting in the Forum. </p>
<p>Please ensure on the actual Facebook webapge&nbsp;(not the app)&nbsp;in your Settings, that all sharing options are set to "Friends". I tried to reproduce this, however I was not successfull.
</p>
<p>There must be a setting in your facebook account. Please do me the favor and double check.

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 520 - No on-screen voicemail notification - O2 UK</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On previous versions of the Nokia Lumia 520 OS, I was able to have on screen notifications of voicemail (a number would be visible next to the VM icon).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>however since upgrading to the latest OS version this function is no longer working. I've spoken others (approx 100 people) and everybody is having the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current OS: 8.0.10328.78</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you able to provide any advice on this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far what I've tried, which hasn't worked:</p>
<p><strong>1. Disable and enable voicemail</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Disable and enable on-screen notifications</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Check voicemail setup&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Try sim/handset swap</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Check the network is provicioned for voicemail correctly</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Any help you can offer is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the exactly the same problem using the 520 on the T-Mobile network. &nbsp;I started using the 520 in November 2013 and I am now on my third as all have the same issue. &nbsp;All worked until a software update was automatically downloaded and after that the
 voice mail notification stopped working. &nbsp;T-Mobile have been good in offering replacement phones, the benefit of being a business user, however until the software problem is resolved it is pointless getting a replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really like the phone and it's a shame that Nokia and the network providers cannot sort out the problem. Checking the forums this is not isolated; it’s the majority of providers in Europe and the USA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come on Nokia, get the problem fixed or face loosing sales.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried to install again the latest software for the phone? If not yet, try to update it first. You can also update the System Applications for the phone by following the procedure in this link:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Wiki/6643B883-3321-457A-82BD-0037485483B1">System
 Update</a>. After doing this, try accessing the voicemail on the phone and observe if this one solve your concerns. Let us know what would be the results with this.</p>

            I have had this problem since I got my phone in September and I am with Orange/EE. This is obviously not a network issue as it seems to be happening across all the networks. Can someone from Nokia please confirm what is being done about this! It is ludicrous
 that you are selling phones that do not function properly and do not respond to the hundreds of complaints on line about this!

            Sorry, just to add, I have had a replacement handset, had my voicemail rebuilt, 2 new SIM cards, carried out factory resets and software updates umpteen times! The folk at Orange technical are as useless as a chocolate teapot on this issue and whilst they
 are happy to sell you the phone on the basis that you want voicemail notifications they now say receiving them is an added bonus which many people do not want and I should not expect such a function from my phone! have never heard such rubbish!<br />

<h3> crystalc84  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Contacts keep disappearing&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I use Chrome and when I open my outlook.com email and go to compose a message, my contacts keep vanishing. For example, I used to type in a person's name (Joe Smith) on the To: line and their email would pop up. Now, I go to type in Joe Smith and the system
 doesn't recognize it. If I type in their email, or the beginning of their email address, it finds that and I can compose a letter to them that way, but I don't remember everyone's email. I re-added someone who was previously deleted and it worked for awhile,
 they showed up! Now, they're gone again. Their email is still there when I type it in, but trying to find them via name doesn't work. It seems like an odd virus or something because it started with just 1 contact, and now it's moving on to a few others...
 I'm not sure what is going on, but I NEED my contacts to show up!! I tried using the Help resource at the side and to talk with a person it told me to login using my outlook.com log-in, when I typed in my outlook.com login info it said I don't exist....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just need my contacts. This is very frustrating... Help please!!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Crystal,<br />
<br />
<br />
To isolate the issue about missing contacts when <strong>To</strong> field is clicked, provide the answers to the following:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried a different browser and found the same result?<br />
</li><li>Have you also tried using different devices such as a different computer, a laptop or a mobile phone and got the same result?<br />
</li><li>Can you make sure that you have enabled the Auto Complete suggestions in Outlook.com?<br />
</li></ul>
<p>While to address the error message you're receiving when logging in using your Outlook.com account, refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12401/microsoft-account-get-help-by-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>1/2 - I have tried using Firefox, IE, and my cell phone and all have the same results. The contact doesn't show up when I type in the person's name anymore for some people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 - I would love to check this, but I don't see how to do that. I checked my settings, I checked all over the site and in every setting section I could find and I was not able to see this as an option. I never changed my settings, so it's not something that
 I have done or a setting I changed, it just happened one day.</p>
<p>

            The contacts are still in People, but after I add them to a group the group name stays, but it is empty when I use it the first time.&nbsp; And, yes I save the group.&nbsp; I have some groups that I have used for a while and when I try to use that group, the group
 name appears but there is no one in the group or sometimes there is just one or two names.

            I just checked and yes, they are still listed in the people section. Yet, when I go to write an email to them, outlook acts as if it's never heard of them before until I type in their email address, and then it only pulls up their email not their name
 (as if I was writing a new email to a new email that I didn't have in my contacts).&nbsp;

            <p>I already answered this, but I'll clarify. Yes, the people are listed in the People section, Name with associated email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And before you ask, Yes, I have tried deleting them and re-adding them. Once the system registered the add (it took about a day for it to generate the email when I typed in the name) it worked... for a few days and then they disappeared again.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No, and no. I use outlook.com on my desktop computer at work only. I very RARELY will use it from my cell phone to check my mail if I'm working from home or I forgot to do something, but my phone is an android and I login using office365.com, not an app
 or anything. But the problem started before I used my cell phone to check my email, so that can't be linked to the cause either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to just get 1 response with a BUNCH of questions to better assist me versus waiting a day for a response that just asks 2 more questions? I posted my issue on October 4th, I got my first response a day later, and it is now the 12th and I feel
 like I am playing 20 questions because it takes a day to get a response and that response is always more questions to answer... I am pretty frustrated by this troubleshooting process</p>

<h3> jad11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 XL Dual Sim, random reboots after Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 950 XL Dual sim. There were no problems with the phone during July when I purchased the phone. Once the Anniversary edition came out my phone started randomly rebooting. It happened
 5 times last month and 2 times yesterday while working between Edge and Onenote. (Only two apps were launched at that time.) I'm running build 14915.1000 and have 18 GB of storage available. Typically, I close background apps as soon as I finish using them.
 I did not hard reset my phone after moving from the preview versions to the public release, but with some extra time on my hands I might during the Labor Day break.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a known issue and fix? I noticed that others have reported this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend to our users that they try to perform a hard reset on their phone when their devices kept on rebooting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just don't forget to save your files (create a back-up), as factory resets would delete any existing files saved on your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens as soon as you perform a hard reset on your phone.</p>

            <p>It is too early to know if the hard reset fixed&nbsp;my random restart problem, but my phone is more responsive. Toggling between apps is faster and double tap works with a lighter touch and two taps rather than more, as&nbsp;a couple of examples.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sept 7, 2016</p>
<p>Unfortunately the hard reset did not fix the problem. While my phone seems to operate a little better, my complaint about it randomly restarting is still there.&nbsp;Edge locked up as I toggled between Onenote and Edge, while entering information on Starbucks'
 Passport site. </p>

<p>
</p><p>I've searched and searched around, is there any word on Microsoft taking a look at this? This is probably the first time I've seen an official Microsoft reply to the matter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through hard resets and such. Only thing that keeps it happy is being connected to a power source, the reboots aren't near as bad then.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like I'll be reverting to back before the anniversary update then until they've tackled those bugs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly even the insider blog doesn't mention it as an issue. :(</p>

            <p>Another concern based on the wording of your message...</p>
<p>
</p><p>IIRC, if the Office 2001 installation software actually is an <em>upgrade</em> package you must have a qualifying prior version installed [or perhaps at least have that version's Product Key] in order for it to work. Also, I don't remember any Product/Activation
 Key being only 10 digits.</p>

<h2>            Virus and Redirect Malware</h2>
                    <p>I have been having this problem in my Nokia Lumia 920 mobile with 8.1 update for a week now. Every time I browse, webpage gets redirected randomly to mobile.plugrush.com or some ecommerce company like snapdeal etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is really irritating to the point where i have given up browsing on my mobile. I did try find solution myself, I deleted couple of apps like skype, 9gag which are known to cause these problems. Later I &nbsp;did a soft and hard reset but to no avail. I also
 tried downloading other browsers like opera just to check whether this was internet explorer oriented problem but the same happened in other browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in removal of this redirect malware will be appreciated.</p>

            There are <strong>no</strong> known malware that could infect windows phones so it is not your phone which is infected. If connected to a wifi make sure the Wifi routers firmware is
<strong>up-to-date.&nbsp;</strong>Also scan all PCs and Android devices connected to the Wifi and check that they all have an up-to-date anti-virus and and all security updates have been installed. Scan the devices for malware using your anti-virus software installed
 on your PCs and also use third party apps like Malwarebytes.

            <p>Don't think the problem is in your Lumia or the PCs F-secure and Malwarebytes both have super high detection ratio so it is very unlikely that those machines would be infected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do these redirections happen only when connected to a wifi? check that wifi modem's firmware is up-to-date because they can get "infected" also.</p>
<p>Check on your Lumia that there are no other browser tabs open when surfing the internet.</p>
<p>Is your device operator locked? Can this advertisements be caused by the operator by manipulating the internet traffic?</p>

            <p>Yep if it happens also on mobile data then wifi modem cannot be the culprit. I have never read about an operator redirecting mobile data to advertisement site but in theory that is plausible although ethically it has some issues.</p>
<p>In theory also if your operator has problems with malware (a lot of infected devices) on their network that can cause similar problems. If you google your operators name and use keywords like redirection, malware, advertisement, etc. do you get any hits
 regarding your problem?&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>So if you did a hard reset, IF there was a "virus", it would be gone. You do not have a virus; it is a virtual impossibility on Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say you did a hard reset, did you have to setup the device again by entering your Live ID again and set up all your email and reinstall programs again? Did you restore from a backup? If yes, do it again but do not restore from a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, possibly there is a cookie stored that might have some effect although I question that. Open IE/Settings then press delete history. That will delete all history, cookies and temporary internet files then give it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing (since I can't see it) then it is the web site(s) you are visiting. Try a couple like Bing, Microsoft.com, MSN just to see if it is working correctly.</p>

            <p>Yes Mr Cook, I setup my device again by entering my live email account and set up all my email accounts again along with re-installation of all apps.</p>
<p>I guess I sort of knew that I will get back same problem if I restore from backup therefore I chose factory settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted my Internet explorer's history couple of times and result was same. But after your suggestion I tried checking whether I faced the same problems on browsing other websites, I found out that I had problems only with couple of file sharing websites
 like slideshare, scribd and quora which i frequently visit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you Mr.Cook for pointing me in right direction but I still don't know how to remove this redirect cookie ( if not a cookie, then?) from these websites.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 - Blank Sign-in Screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have issues for some users in our organization in signing in to https://login.microsoftonline.com (blank sign-in screen to be exact) using IE, Edge, Google Chrome and Firefox. Already delete browsing history, add website on trusted sites and add website
 on compatibility settings but still blank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried InPrivate Browsing, Incognito Window and Private Window but still to no avail. Is there any solution for this one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Wilson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We haven't received any service incidents about the sign-in screen issue, let's do some troubleshooting first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that the issue happens with some users in your organization, are they in the same network environment? What are the differences between the affected users and the others?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, please ask them to change a network connection to see the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, please let them try signing in this link to see if it is also blank:

<p>Hi Gloria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The users are in the same network with same policies apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read some thread regarding the issue. Please see link for your reference.</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/office-365-blank-sign-in-screen/4c00c165-45fb-4bf5-a02b-5a8dc380b58e</p>
<br />
<p>The workaround for the issue is deleting browsing history in IE add microsoftonline.com on Compatibility View Settings and uncheck Display intranet sites in Compatibility view. Also addin login.microsoftonline.com on Trusted sites. Also use private browsing
 mode (IE and Chrome). The workaround worked on some user but on some users don't.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since you have checked the trusted sites in the thread and it works for only some users, please ask the users who cannot sign in on their own machines to sign in on the machines without issue to see if the issue is related with some settings or accounts.</p>

<p>Hi Wilson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update in private message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on our research, these two suggestions helped to resolve the problem for other customers with similar issue. So, can you please try them and let us know the result:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Uncheck the IPv6 from the Network Properties and make sure that IPv4 is enabled:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control Panel&gt; Network and Sharing Center&gt; Change adapter settings&gt; Right-click on the connection&gt; Properties&gt; Uncheck IPv6&gt; OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. Turn off the protected mode in Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Open the Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>b. </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on Tools menu and select Internet Options.</span></p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know the result after trying the both suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>I'm having an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to be able to use Lync and Configure Microsoft Apps is working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't really use it that much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lately, what has changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I added my email from work. It has a 'policy'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it affect 'Configure Microsoft Apps'?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on 'Configure Microsoft Apps', nothing happens. I think it crashes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I open Lync, I enter my sign in information. Click on Sign-In, nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a policy set by my administrator that has affected this and makes all my Microsoft Apps crash?</p>
<p><br />
Thanks</p>

<p>&nbsp;I am creating Word documents in&nbsp;Windows 7, Microsoft&nbsp;Word Starter 2010,and sometimes when I'm typing along,&nbsp;I guess my finger bumps some key, and the next thing you know, I've lost&nbsp;the entire text.&nbsp; Tonight I started two different documents, hadn't even
 gotten 1/3 of a page on either one, and they each had the same thing happen -- the&nbsp;text just suddenly disappeared....</p>
<p>So, my questions are:1) what am I doing that makes this happen? 2) where does the text disappear to, and 3 )how do I get&nbsp;the back?&nbsp; At least some of the time it has happened, I've been able to get the text back, but tonight, no such luck.</p>
<p>I <strong>way</strong> want to get this to stop, as I'm producing a lot of documents right now, I NEED HELP!&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks, you guys, hope someone can help me out....GS</p>

            The most likely thing is that you tried to type a capital A and inadvertently pressed Ctrl+A instead. This is the keyboard shortcut for Select All. All the text in your document is selected, so it is wiped out with the next character you type. Ctrl+Z (Undo)
 will bring it back.

<p>Birthday's are created in Outlook as a recurring event and you set the start date as the person's date of birth. If this is 1969 or less then OVI will not sync this item to your phone's calendar. Any age 1970 to present will be sync'd. Not sure when Nokia
 will fix this. :(</p>

<h2>            Importing an annotated PDF into OneNote</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been annotating my notes in Adobe Acrobat previously and recently got Office 365 for free through my school. &nbsp;However, the comments that I had made on the PDF just show up with a little comment icon in OneNote - but I can't click them to see what they
 say. &nbsp;Is there a way I can import my comments as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Why does outlook remind me of meetings which i have already joined.</h2>
                    I get meeting notifications on outlook, there are two options to snozze or dismiss, if i do not select any of these and directly join, then outlook should know that i have already joined the meeting and should not keep reminding me.

            You have to dismiss the reminders for them to stop. &nbsp;A piece of software has no way of knowing that you have attended the meeting.
