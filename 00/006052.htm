    <title>Using Office 365 for centralised team data storage - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using Office 365 for centralised team data storage</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p><br />
Wondering if anyone can give me some clarification on a requirement a client has. I'll try to detail the requirement as briefly as possible.</p>
<p><br />
Single office with 5 users with 1 additional home user. Client currently uses Office 365 purely for their email. Up until this point they utilised Trend Micro SafeSync for Business for their file storage - this entailed centralised cloud-based storage of all
 business documents with real-time synching to/from desktop client software on all PCs/Laptops so all users had up-to-date copies of all data at all times. SafeSync has unfortunately now been canned by Trend so we need to put an alternative solution in place.
 Total max storage the client currently has is 300GB although they currently only use just over 10GB over 30,000 files.</p>
<p>We need:</p>
<p>Centralised storage with real-time updating of changes made to documents</p>
<p>Needs to allow remote access for the home user</p>
<p>Ideally, users would have 'offline' copies of documents on their PCs/Laptops that they access and once updated the changes are synch'd to the cloud</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>Can the client achieve what they want using Office 365?</p>
<p>If so, are we right in thinking that they would need to go down the route of a Team Site in Sharepoint? If so, how would they achieve the goal of synching the data from the Team Site to each PC/Laptop?</p>
<p>Can certain files/folders in the Team Site be restricted to only be accessible to certain users?</p>
<p>Can the client selectively share files/folders to external partners securely? If so how? Can this be password-protected and/or time-limited?</p>
<p>Realise this is a little long-winded but hopefully you'll appreciate our goal is to migrate a to date happy client with the minimum of disruption and ideally if we can achieve this using a currently unused part of a solution they already employ, all the
 better.</p>
<p>Any and all feedback on this shall be gratefully received. My thanks in advance for all your help.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p><br />
David</p>

<p>hi david,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i would like to answer your questions one by one:</p>
<p>1. can the client achieve what they want using office 365?</p>
<p>yes, you can achieve that by storing files in your team site. in this way, users can access the files and coauthor the files. you can see this article to learn more:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/should-i-save-my-documents-to-onedrive-for-business-or-a-team-site-d18d21a0-1f9f-4f6c-ac45-d52afa0a4a2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
should i save my documents to onedrive for business or a team site?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;2. how would they achieve the goal of synching the data from the team site to each pc/laptop?</p>
<p>they can install onedrive for business sync app on their own computer then sync files from the team site library to their own local pc to manage them offline. any updates will be updated to the online once they are online.
 you can see this article about how to sync files using onedrive for business sync app:<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-site-libraries-to-your-computer-59b1de2b-519e-4d3a-8f45-51647cf291cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sync site libraries to your computer</a>. if
 you don't have the sync app, you can download it from the link provided by that article.</p>
<p>note: please make sure the users at least have edit permission for the library that files stored in. otherwise, the modifications that they made from offline synced files will not be updated to the cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3. can certain files/folders in the team site be restricted to only be accessible to certain users?</p>
<p>yes. we can use permission to restrict that. here is the demo steps, you can refer to them:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here is a <b>doctestiris</b> document library in my team site. by default, this library's permission inherits the team site's library. that's say, if the user has edit permission to the team site, then he has the edit permission
 for the library by default. since i need to let users cannot access the library to access files stored in it, i need to break the permission.</p>
<p>go to <b>librray-&gt; library settings-&gt;permissions</b> for this document library.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=5bec9b49-9334-46fc-adbd-a43adade72b1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d5bec9b49-9334-46fc-adbd-a43adade72b1" /></a></p>
<p>click <b>stop inheriting permissions</b>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=93905671-a3bf-4a45-916a-d8cba0e7ef7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d93905671-a3bf-4a45-916a-d8cba0e7ef7d" /></a></p>
<p>click <b>check permissions</b> to check the user's permission to find out which group he is in. then remove him from the group. or, you can remove all groups out then granting the permission to users that you want them access
 the library by clicking grant permissions.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=41430984-5166-46c1-ba4c-b3eadb0705e0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d41430984-5166-46c1-ba4c-b3eadb0705e0" /></a></p>
<p>4. can the client selectively share files/folders to external partners securely? if so how? can this be password-protected and/or time-limited?</p>
<p>as a global admin or sharepoint service administrator, you can disable the external sharing feature for the whole site collection. in this way, users will not be able to share files with external users from the site.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=94956e51-0b11-4f4e-b0d8-2698621dfa53" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d94956e51-0b11-4f4e-b0d8-2698621dfa53" /></a></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials Hijacked. Virus has taken over Essentials.</h2>
                    
<p>XP laptop; The security shield on my taskbar is red and when I click it, it says there are 24 viruses. The pop up is entitled Security Shield &amp; is colored red. When I click on scan I get another pop up that says I have to pay $80 for Security Essentials.
 As I try to work on the PC I get popups that say the PC is infected. I can't access anything on my Control Panel because I get the popups that say Security Shield. I finally got the real Microsoft Security Essentials to run &amp; ran a quick scan &amp; got no viruses.
 The I finally opened CCleaner &amp; cleaned the register. Still got popups &amp; the red shield on&nbsp;Taskbar.&nbsp; Now ran full scan - still no virus and still have popups saying I'm infected with 24 viruses. What is happening &amp; how&nbsp;do I fix my PC?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>They are free downloads:</p>

<p>If the malware interferes with your ability to download the files&nbsp;use another system&nbsp;and save the files&nbsp;to a thumb drive.</p>
<p>Copy and paste the Malwarebytes (and / or) SuperAntispyware executable files from the thumb drive&nbsp;to the desktop of the infected system and run the scans from there.</p>
<p>If the malware&nbsp;prevents&nbsp;the system from&nbsp;running the scan in Windows&nbsp;try running the scan&nbsp;in safe mode.</p>
<p>Since Malwarebytes and&nbsp;SuperAntispyware scan on command only they shouldn't conflict with MSE but once the system is cleaned you'll probably want to uninstall them just&nbsp;to avoid the possibility of the programs conflicting with MSE.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Lync online meeting keeps asking to install Silverlight</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to trouble shoot a user on Windows 7 image machine, when they have lync and are invited to join an online email, it keeps asking to install Silverlight 4.0 or higher, thing is the user has silverlight. I uninstalled and reinstalled and still
 the same. I even went to microsoft.com/getsilverlight which will detect the version on your computer, but it doesn't detect the install i currently did, just says install. I logged into the users machine under my profile and microsoft.com/getsilverlight detected
 silverlight as well as I could join an online machine on the users machine.&nbsp; So this tells me its the users profile. The same thing happens to the user if they sign into another machine. Any clue? I can't find anything online.&nbsp;&nbsp; IE 9, Windows 7 64.&nbsp;

            When you type 24/9 or 24 sep or 24sep, then excel assumes that user wants to appear date as d/mmm so by default it convert it in custom format.
<div>But in formula bar you will observe that its showing it as 24/9/2013 or 24/9/13 depend on what settings are in control panel.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So default is dd/mm/yyyy only, as you are typing half date, its taking in that way. For changing the format of dates in whole sheet/workbook you may do it by Ctrl+H (control and replace).</div>
<div><br />
<div>In Find, you may give the formatting d/mmm which you may also select from a cell and in replace you may give dd/mm/yyyy, this also can be selected from a cell.</div>
<div>Then replace all.</div>

<p>1. it's not a smart phone and not sold as such.</p>
<p>2. even if it were, Microsoft couldn't force WhatsApp to make an app for it. </p>

<p>I think it is good that&nbsp;Venkatraman complains at Microsoft as well. That way, they could learn from
<em>their</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/f1cd144e-4617-40e2-8d7a-bbb0c78142db">mistakes</a> (to buy Nokia Mobile Phone and not to correct that issue; or why Nokia Mobile Phones ditched Nokia Series 40 in
 favor of MediaTek). Feedback like this helps self-reflection and improving. Therefore, even such feedback is valuable and should not be&nbsp;depreciated. However,&nbsp;Venkatraman, Microsoft does

not</a> leverage Microsoft Answers as feedback channel. Why ever. Therefore here ‚Äì as you noted already ‚Äì such feedback drowns in the Internet swarm. Are you still able to return that phone at your point of sales?</p>

<p>whenever i create a support request for my client under their global admin account all i get is a web page that has a back arrow and "contact support"on it.</p>
<p>this happens for all support request categories (mail, billing, etc) and only for this client.</p>
<p>the only thing i can think of is that you must have a 365 license on the global admin account bu that would seem a bit silly.</p>
<p>i have tried on multiple pc's and different browsers and even used compatibility mode on ie.

<p>Hi Joshua,</p>
<p>By checking the escalated case, we notice that the issue is explained. We'd like to summarize below to benefit other community members who run into the same situation:</p>
<p>Issue Description:&nbsp;<br />
================&nbsp;<br />
Customer gets only a blank page when clicking into a support category in Service Request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assessment:&nbsp;<br />
================&nbsp;<br />
The tenant has services provided by partner will have the support page to show the partner‚Äôs information. But some partner information is not provided, so a blank page is displayed. Product team will deliver a more friendly message in the blank page in the
 near future to indicate that the support is provided by the partner and we can‚Äôt load the Partner information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for working with us on finding out the root cause. Feel free to contact back if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Well, I checked that. It is *not* in the start up folder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not here:</p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nor is it listed in the Startup Apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem started after the last OFFICE 365 update. I suspect the two problems are related: there are "hidden" instances of OUTLOOK running when I shut off the machine at night; if OUTLOOK sees it is "running", it remembers to startup where it left off
 on the next reboot. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Repeat .. didn't do this before the update; not in the startup folder; not scheduled in Startup Apps; happened right after the Office 365 update</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I shut the machine down (DEL XPS 27 desktop). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I'm going to have a look-see w/ Task Manager next time this happens. The auto start after boot started right after the update. The error message about another instance running just started recently and I should obviously have thought to check task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I noted before, I suspect the two issues are related. Somehow a widowed OUTLOOK process is running in the background so I don't see it when i shut the machine down at night (I have been careful to close OUTLOOK if it is running before shutting down).
 The next time it boot it goes "Oh, let's see if we can restore that process ..". That would explain why it doesn't auto start each and every time.

<p>
</p><p>An update, this bug is a pain in the butt. So as shown below in screen shots, Task Manager shows an OUTLOOK process running. On the task bar there is only ONE icon on which to click to open OUTLOOK, and when you do, you get the error message. If one is lucky
 you can wait for a bit and it will let you run OUTLOOK. If you are not lucky, it's a reboot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, in all my years of using OUTLOOK since the 80s, I've never had this problem; it started w/ the recent "upgrade" of Office. This is actually motivation for not using Office 365 rent as you go; like the Windows updates, each update seems to break something.
 I'm thinking it might be better to go w/ the old fashioned buy it and run it til the wheels fall off.</p>

<p>If you have multiple entries in task manager for the outlook.exe process, it means OL did not shutdown when you previously closed OL.</p>
<p>This problem is usually caused by com add-ins, so you would need to state what com add-ins are show in OL, whether enabled or not</p>

<p>Hi Donald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In accessing email messages, appointments, and contacts, there are several Outlook apps and services. Having said that, we would like to make sure that we are working on the correct version of Outlook.

            Since you have others that don't have issues, logic would tell me that it's either a system problem or a corrupt install and being Beta software I've seen issues that no matter what we try it doesn't correct it and doing a clean install get's things going
 again, the reason for Preview testing.

<h2>            Can&#39;t access OneNote Online</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to access OneNote online for months, this is the problem I get:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Something went wrong and we can't sign you in right now. Please try again later.</p>
The Microsoft account login server has detected too many repeated authentication attempts. Please wait a moment and try again."
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything I could:</p>
<p>Deleting cookies, trying different browsers on different operative systems (Windows 10, Linux 18.1) (Browsers used: Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera), I tried doing everything again with an Incognito window, and I ultimately tried changing my password to fix
 the issue. None of it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes me think there has to be a problem on the other side, and not on mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I please have some help?</p>

<br />A workaround can be to open OneDrive, go to Documents and open my notebook from there.
<br />

<p>the cog they are referring to is that round-ish design at the upper right of the screen next to your profile name.&nbsp; it looks like a edgy washer or something that would be in a clock.&nbsp; =-)&nbsp; it actually is your options button.&nbsp;

                    <p>I support users in an organisation that has a need to create some very complex documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example of this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently one of our users is working on a 16Mb Word document, which includes tables which have thousands of rows, 20+ images inserted and carefully formatted text. The document is already cumbersome to work with, freezing and taking minutes to open. The
 document has another 800 (eight hundred) images to be inserted. Most of the images are 1Mb to 1.5Mb. So the document will be hundreds of Mb in size by the end of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Working with documents like this is fairly commonplace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When adding the images to Word it often freezes and sometimes (without any pattern I can identify) the images appear white and need to have the alignment changed for them to appear. Those working on documents like this can take days / weeks to put them together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if there is any easier way to work with inserting a quantity of images like this? Any tools that we can use alongside Word to make the process easier?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had considered trying to convert all the images to PDF and inserting them into a PDF instead of Word, but they need to be in a Word document and have the page numbering, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried creating a Word document [Document A] with hundreds of the images inserted and then inserting [Document A] into [Document B] which had the tables and other content, but the images didn't appear to come across.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas or help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>Word does not like working with tables that extend over many pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>See the article "Maximising the performance of Word tables‚Äù at:</span></p>

</p><p><a href="http://wordmvp.com/FAQs/TblsFldsFms/FastTables.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://wordmvp.com/FAQs/TblsFldsFms/FastTables.htm</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing that can improve performance when editing a document is to go to file&gt;Options&gt;Advanced&gt;Show document content and (temporarily) check the box for "Show picture placeholders"&nbsp; Doing that will avoid Word having to refresh each image
 as you scroll through the document.</p>

<p>16Mb is not particularly large and I've used documents with thousands of rows before so I don't think you are pushing it yet....</p>
<p>But planning to put in 800 images of over a Mb each is definitely pushing the boundaries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I would say that you absolutely must be using styles and minimal direct formatting. The graphic resolution and colour depth needs to be minimised to get the file sizes down before putting them into Word. What format are the graphics in and do they
 really need to be as large as you say? If they are photos, 200dpi is plenty of resolution for most printers and screen. If they are bitmaps made from computer drawn art then you should be saving to PNG and using a resolution of around 300dpi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than embedding the graphics, link them in to the document so that the document doesn't actually store the graphic inside the doc. This will greatly speed file saves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Graphics direct to PDF is also still an option because you can use a PDF editing tool such as Adobe Acrobat to add headers/footers and incrementing page numbers.</p>

            Thank you for the input. The image files are maps (stored in JPG format). They do need to retain detail, but doing a bulk reduction in resolution before inserting them may be an option to look into. I just had a play around and we could probably halve
 the&nbsp;file size&nbsp;and still&nbsp;maintain a similar quality in Word.<br />
<br />
Converting the images to PDF is&nbsp;an option I had suggested, but they are required to be in Word and images need to be embedded as the documents are published.

            To add to Doug's suggestions, you can try working in Draft view as much as possible. In Word 2016, images are never displayed in Draft view, and you can concentrate on the text.

<p>1. If your emails were over 365 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity in account even before you renamed the account.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Due to inactivity in account:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
¬∑ If your emails were over 365 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity in account even before you renamed the account. If you had Self-recovery of emails turned on in your account before renamed, you can try to recover some of the deleted messages
 yourself (Link to recover deleted messages is under DELETED folder), refer:<br />

</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Deleted email messages</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>¬∑ If you were accessing your emails on a mail client such as Windows Live Mail or through your mobile device, but didn‚Äôt log into your web account for over 365 days, you may lose emails due to inactivity in web account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2. &nbsp; If your account was hacked and the hacker had already deleted emails in your account.<br />
<br />
3. &nbsp;If the feature Conversation Threading feature is turned on. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you use Sweep to schedule a cleanup.<br />

            <p>I have used Hotmail off and on for years and now I find that all my emails have disappeared. They are especially important to me because they have contacts for my writing career and I want them back.</p>
<p>Who deleted them and why? Fix this for me, please. Also some important messages went there when Yahoo!mail was having problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My yahoo account is: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</p>
<p>and my Hotmail account was (IS) *** Email address is removed for privacy ***

<h2>            Skype For Business - Transfer Failed Immediately</h2>
                    <p>I have a user who has office365 and uses skype for business.&nbsp; He cannot send files from his skype client on his windows 10 PC.&nbsp; Immediately after trying to send any file he gets an error saying transfer failed.&nbsp; He can send files from the online version
 of skype for business without issue.&nbsp; I know its a PC problem, but we have tried to uninstall and reinstall.&nbsp; The problem still continues.&nbsp; Is there any way to reset all of skype for business' settings to defaults?&nbsp; Or is there anything else I can look at
 to try to resolve this users issue.</p>

<p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read through the whole thread again. As I mentioned above, have you checked the ‚ÄúRecord conversations and meetings‚Äù option is
<strong>selected</strong> in the Skype for Business admin center? Please provide the screenshot of that page to better understand your situation. Here is an example screenshot from my side:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0781d96-58a9-431c-80bd-cb6792339d88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0781d96-58a9-431c-80bd-cb6792339d88" /></a></p>
<p>For more information, please refer to this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Let-people-record-their-audio-and-video-conferences-122cb43d-b57a-4b93-b902-a1a432e7de28?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Let-people-record-their-audio-and-video-conferences-122cb43d-b57a-4b93-b902-a1a432e7de28?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, one more thing I‚Äôd like to confirm, can the user always reproduce the issue? I mean whether all the receivers can‚Äôt see the file transition notification when the problematic user send files or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gary&nbsp;</p>
