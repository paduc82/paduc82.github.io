<h2>            X Y &#40;Scatter&#41; Chart Loses Points . . . </h2>
                    I am plotting times on both X and Y axis. <br />
<br />
Y axis is fine. <br />
<br />
Underlying data fills A 1 to C 7 only.<br />
<br />
Data in column B and C is formatted as Time 13:30:55. <br />
<br />
Y axis formats correctly as (from top to bottom):-<br />
<br />
14:00:00<br />
13:00:00<br />
12:00:00<br />
<br />
- and so on down to and including:-<br />
<br />
06:00:00<br />
<br />
I want exactly the same format on the X axis. <br />
<br />
To format X axis I take following actions:-<br />
<br />
- go to Format Axis pop up window<br />
<br />
- Number tab change this to Time 13:30:55 <br />
<br />
- Axis Options tab Minimum: Fixed 0.25<br />
- Axis Options tab Maximum: Fixed 0.58333 (As soon as I do this all the <br />
points disappear from chart)<br />
- Axis Options tab Major unit: Fixed 0.041666<br />
<br />
Close. <br />
<br />
Why have all the points disappeared from the chart?<br />
<br />
Times now read corrrectly&nbsp; (from 06:00:00 to and including 14:00:00 along <br />
the X axis). <br />
<br />
TIA for any replies. <br />
<br />

<p>I was able to find an answer for this graph by manually selecting the data for the&nbsp;XY chart.<br />
Select an blank cell&gt; insert &gt; chart&gt; now manually select the data for the chart.<br />
<br />
If the Column A is none other than Time, we dont get the same format as y axis.<br />
If the Column A is Time format data, then we shall be able to get the same format as Y axis.<br />
<br />
Over all one thing is of sure, if we have all data in Time format. Then also we have to manually select the data for the chart.<br />
Reply back for more help!<br />

    <title>Possible corrupt &#34;new workbook&#34; template - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ken278  say:</h3>
<h2>            Possible corrupt &#34;new workbook&#34; template</h2>
                    <div>Excel 2011 v. 14.1.2, OS X 10.6.8, 2010 iMac 27 inch 16 GB RAM.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I have the following problem:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In several different workbooks, as well as in a new blank workbook, I select the top row of a sheet and then click "Window:Freeze Panes".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I expect this to freeze the top row of the sheet so that I can scroll down through many rows without losing sight of the top row.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, what happens instead is that an area of the sheet consisting of columns A to F wide by approximately the top 8 centimeters of rows in height is frozen. (the height distance is always the same, the number of rows inside it can vary according to
 the height of the rows in a sheet)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried the unfreeze panes and then freeze panes again, repeatedly, but this does not change anything. Basically I cannot freeze the area (the top row) that I want to freeze. No matter what I do, the same area (described above) is always frozen by
 this command.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since this is occurring in a new workbook, I wonder if the "normal" workbook template is corrupt and needs to be deleted. Can anyone suggest how to do this? &nbsp;Unlike Word, there doesn't seem to be a "normal" template in Excel.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Alternately can anyone suggest what else might be causing this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            Excel doesn't have a "Normal" template.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>If you haven't created a default workbook and placed it in HD:Applications:Microsoft Office 2011:Office:Startup:Excel, then it's using the default workbook stored in application memory.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not sure why you're seeing what you're seeing - I can't reproduce it. I'd suggest doing some basic troubleshooting (outlined below).</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can test a completely fresh workbook (sans Preferences and add-ins) by starting XL with the Shift key down.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, your expectation regarding freezing panes is faulty.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To freeze the first row, you select a cell in the SECOND row, not the first, then choose Freeze Panes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Basic troubleshooting:</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>
<div>
<span>
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp;- &nbsp;Run the Disk Utility application to repair disk permissions. Restart your machine.</div>
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp;- &nbsp;Run the Font Book application to resolve corrupt and duplicate fonts (Office 2011 seems to be&nbsp;</div>
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more vulnerable to this than previous versions). See &nbsp;<a href="http://word.mvps.org/Mac/fontweeding.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/Mac/fontweeding.html</a>.&nbsp;Again
 restart.</div>
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp;- If not fixed, with ALL Office applications closed, delete (or rename) the following file</div>
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.excel.plist</div>
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and this folder</div>
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~/Library/Preferences/Microsoft</div>
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where ~ is your home directory. Note that in Lion, Library is a hidden folder.</div>
</span></div>
<div>
<span>&nbsp; - &nbsp;If that still doesn't fix the problem, try creating a new User Account and test in that account:</span></div>

    <title>NFC on Lumia 950XL stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chestnut67  say:</h3>
<h2>            NFC on Lumia 950XL stopped working</h2>
                    <p>NFC used to work OK on my Lumia 950XL. I could read tags and also use my payment-enabled SIM card.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, NFC just stopped reacting to proximity of NFC tags or devices. I cannot read tags and I cannot make my phone "known" to the NFC touch-payment terminal. Curiously, the NFC writer app still works (i.e. when the phone asks me to tap a tag to enable
 writing, it is detected). However, the phone fails to automatically notice that a tag is nearby.&nbsp;</p>

</strong>even with computers strictly running only MS products and apps with no third party software side loaded, and only approved from the MS store app. Including no google products. (I would also like to add that using defender the entire time that Win 10
 was released to me to my knowledge has never had a security breach where the security has been circumvented unlike other providers.)</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">The Full scan from MS <strong>defender always took longer than other scans
</strong>from other products&nbsp;from other companies/ providers such as Norton, web root, avast,&nbsp;etc..- also defender is not a trial or paid service, It will always be there without possible disruptions and&nbsp;when used with&nbsp;first party apps from the store &nbsp;.
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">(And I believe it does not rely on past scans, that once a file is&nbsp;checked it&nbsp;is then trusted and skipped on future scans, which over time speeds up the scanning process for those security structure&nbsp;models from other vendors/providers.--again
 I am only stating a personal theory from my observations, you would have to speak to a MS representative about that. I do not know for a fact regarding the way the security was designed with MS defender. In my opinion, security with no accountability is not
 security. Although its nice feeling safe and secure.)</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp;Defender on all OS that I can remember (If I recall correctly&nbsp;it was called essentials and was a security and services with several programs like Live,&nbsp;Messenger&nbsp;from MS as I recall&nbsp;on win7).<strong> As the moderator mentioned
 it matters how much data is being scanned, 500,000-1,500,000 files?</strong> Also, with the new build double check your settings for defender. I believe mine (Defender)&nbsp; was defaulted to minimal settings (once build Upgrade was complete) and noticed a few
 more options that had to be checked to get better service/ security&nbsp;(also regarding OneDrive cloud scans)&nbsp;without leaving out any new&nbsp;options that you might not be aware of with the new Win 10 build 1607, you will want to roam around in the "all settings"
 located/accessed from the "action center" located on the taskbar lower right hand corner.
</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">I would like to mention due to past hecklers, that I responded to&nbsp;this question that was asked in October of 2016 after the new build was released regarding MS Win 10 defender&nbsp;&nbsp;and am answering from my own experiments and on my
 own personal devices which are old and are becoming obsolete (I'm getting my moneys worth, LOL). So if you buy a brand new computer that has engineered for the new build with the latest greatest processors and graphics cards don't reply to me in a year&nbsp;heckling
 about how easy it all works now; and you don't need to do it that way; and a baby could successfully complete&nbsp;these obsolete&nbsp;issues. Please keep in mind the time era and circumstances surrounding event.

            You need to insert a Section Break. (Page Layout tab-breaks) Then change your page orientation, when you want to return to portrait, insert another section break.

<p>
</p><p>I was having this problem with Outlook 2010. &nbsp;I recently upgraded to Office 365 and uninstalled Office 2010, but the problem still continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran malware and also scanned for viruses, but found nothing. &nbsp; Any suggestions on how to fix this? Should I be worried?<br />

Thanks for the help.</p>

    <title>Hotmail&#58; How to turn off two step login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brief456  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail&#58; How to turn off two step login</h2>
                    <p>Somehow the 2 step login got enabled on my hotmail account.&nbsp; I hate this damn thing.&nbsp; I want to disable it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I've been playing this game where hotmail asks me if *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is my super secret unlock email.&nbsp; Then it tells me that I have to wait another 30 days to make any changes to my hotmail account.&nbsp; I did that dung 60 days ago.&nbsp; Then I did it again
 30 days ago.&nbsp; Now this lovely dung pile is telling me I need to wait another 30 days.</p>
<p>Maybe you have gotten the idea that I really don't like this lump of dung.&nbsp; (Good I'm glad I'm getting thru to you.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I log into my hotmail account.</p>
<p>I go to the "account settings" view.</p>
<p>I select "security &amp; password".</p>
<p>It asks me if *** Email address is removed for privacy *** started a process to change the password or security info for this Microsoft account.</p>
<p>I select yes.</p>
<p>It tells me: We'll send you an email on ?/?/2014 when you can replace the following security info.
</p>
<p>Yay,... I am so excited.</p>
<p>It is like the same dung,... over and over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It would be great if you could tell me how to turn it off,.. disable it,... kill it,... dismember it,... cause it to die.</p>
<p>Would you be so kind as to tell me how to disable the hotmail two-step login?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much</p>

I would&nbsp;recommend you to&nbsp;<strong>remove&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>add</strong>&nbsp;the email address of the sender to the Safe senders list of your account. To do this, follow the steps

<br />
I have followed these instructions to the letter, no effect - the messages still end up in the Junk Folder. I left the email address and domain off of my Safe Senders list for 7 - 9 days. After adding them back to the Safe Senders list there has been no change,
 the messages are still being routed to the Junk Folder. What configuration changes has Microsoft made in recent months that would have negative effect such as this on a person's email?<br />
<br />
This only started happening recently, these messages were going into my inbox because the sender's address &amp; domain had been added to the Safe Senders list. Now those messages are going to the Junk folder, why?<br />
<br />
What configuration changes have been made that have causes a known safe sender to all of a sudden be routed to the junk folder instead of the inbox? At the risk of repeating myself, t<span>hese messages
 were going into my inbox because the sender's address &amp; domain had been added to the Safe Senders list. This was done about 5 years ago, and I didn't start having problems until recently.</span><br />

            <p>Thank you!&nbsp; This method worked very well for me.&nbsp; I am running Windows 10 Build 10049 on an 8 year old laptop and for some reason Disk Cleanup on this machine was instantly going to "Scanning: System error mini dump files" and hanging forever at that point
 every time I tried to run it. (even though there were no dump files on this computer).<br />
<br />
I want to get the new&nbsp;Windows 10 system files compression working on this laptop, as it saved me over 4GB of space on my desktop SSD.&nbsp; I did not notice that specific compression&nbsp;option in the dialogue box that opened after running&nbsp;<strong>cleanmgr /sageset
</strong>from the Administrator Command Prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did not notice at first is that this method opens 2 progress boxes while it is running: One calculating the freeable space and the other actually proceeding with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am re-trying the normal Disk Cleanup launched from the Properties of the C: drive, but it is now immediately hanging at Scanning: System error memory dump files.</p>

<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; It finally finished loading!&nbsp; Below is the "Clean up system files" button that enables the Windows 10 System files compression:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e98a0b7-b0fe-4bec-9614-17a08c2473e8" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you choose that, the usual "calculating" dialogue box re-appears, even though I had just run Disk&nbsp;Cleanup and
<em>again </em>takes a long time:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a9e3967-7e97-4ce7-89a7-c83ca562dee2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not then see the option to compress system files that I had seen on my desktop PC.&nbsp; This makes me wonder if the system compression was already done automatically when I ran
<strong>cleanmgr /sagerun</strong> ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to test?&nbsp; I suppose some system files will display as blue text in File Explorer?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Protecting your computer from viruses and malware is a good step in maintaining its health.&nbsp; Using an anti-virus software that is capable of scanning for malicious or unwanted software, and uses real-time protection is best if you wanted to protect your
 device from hijackers. In this case, we recommend using the Windows Defender as it has the capability to scan everything you download or run on your PC. You may also, schedule a regular scan to help keep it safe. May we know which Windows version you are using
 so that we can provide you instructions to set it up?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Guessing the Name - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashleypearson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Guessing the Name</h2>
                    <p>So I liked the feature on the old Microsft Word (before 2013) that took the first line and used it automatically as the title when you went to save. I noticed that in Word 2013, or at least my edition, it no longer does that, instead taking the name of the
 last thing you saved or the last thing you opened as the default. Why is that? Is there some kind of switch that I have turned off? Or is it not on the new product? If so, I really hope they make an update to include that, as it was very helpful.</p>
<p>Has this happened to anyone else?</p>

            It probably won't help to tell you that Word 2013 behaves just the same as previous versions for me. Where are you saving the documents? There may well be a difference between saving locally and saving to OneDrive.

            <p>I hadn't noticed it before so I tried to recreate your problem (not that I use it that much).&nbsp; It did not happen to me. Word still used the first sentence to create a suggested file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I just noticed is that at the bottom of the dialog I have the "maintain compatibility with previous versions of Word".&nbsp; I have absolutely no idea if this has any impact. I am just about to try and find out about this option.</p>

    <title>How to factory reset Windows Phone 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jubjubird  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to factory reset Windows Phone 8</h2>
                    Hello, I gave my stepfather a Lumia 920 phone a when it was released few years ago. I was the one who purchased the phone but I don't know where the box for it is, so I have no way to look up the IMEI. My stepfather has since passed away, so I have the
 phone now. But he set up a numerical password to get into the phone, and I don't know what it is. It seems I need that password in order to access the Settings to do a hard reset. Is there a way to bypass that login screen to hard reset the phone? I have run
 out of patience at this point as far as searching through the forum and trying to contact a Microsoft support representative, so any help is much appreciated.

<h2>            Installing Visio&#47;Project 2016 on a computer with office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>At this moment the whole company uses Office 365 and we purchase&nbsp; individual applications like Project and Visio separately under a MPSA license.</p>
<p>Currently the set up is the MSI installation technology but it is incompatibly with office 365's click to run installation technology. The only work around was to uninstall 365 off the client and then install the MSI installations first. This is very time
 consuming and I am wondering if there are any solutions. </p>

<p>I tried the Visio first and I could not install 365. I then tried 365 first and I could not install Visio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. We are using Office 365 Business and the Visio License is a MPSA license. Is there a click to run version for this specific license type?</p>

<p>The feature you are thinking about, a "discount" price on an upgrade from an older or competitor version was discontinued in 2010.&nbsp; MS now assumes that it's customers are addicted, aka "locked in", and no longer will switch away without a discount.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You have to buy a full price license, either a one-time payment for one of the Office 2019 bundles, or "subscribe" / rent Office 365.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>There still are several ways to get discounted copies of Office, but that "upgrade" is no longer one of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will have to decide for yourself. You can to trade off long term cost and features If your needs are very simple, you won’t need to spend much or work with one of the free options. But if you are a more “advanced” user, using multiple
 Office applications and sharing documents/files with others you will have to pay for one of the Office 365/2016 bundles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I am trying to download office 2013 instead of 2016 through my outlook portal account through Ball State I have searched many forums but they all tell me to change a setting in language and install settings, which does not appear in portal. All that shows
 is download the latest version. I specifically need 2013 for my class and when I downloaded last summer for some reason it downloaded 2011, so that is what I have on my mac right now. Do you know where/how I can download 2013 instead of 2016 for free? Thank

this page</a> with your work/school account and capture a picture for it.<br />
2.The Software page in the portal. Access <a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Turn of push notice &#39;action required Wifi&#39; Lumia 950</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to turn off the 'push' noticed from the action center for Wifi. Or at the least turn of the sound. It is driving me crazy that when I am sitting somewhere close to a Wifi point all the time these notices pop up.

            <p>Hi, Kittyvan H.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn WiFi search off, when you don’t need it, by taping on <strong>WiFi quick action</strong> button or by managing your
<strong>WiFi notification</strong> by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Slide your finger downwards on the screen.</li><li>Press <strong>All settings.</strong></li><li>Press <strong>Network &amp; wireless.</strong></li><li>Press&nbsp;<strong>WiFi. </strong>and then select<strong> Wi-Fi Sense.</strong></li><li>Turn on/off<strong> "Connect to suggested open hotspots".</strong></li><li>Uncheck<strong> "Show a notification banner when action is needed from me".</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it works.</p>

    <title>Inviting gmail users to an external yammer network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inviting gmail users to an external yammer network</h2>
                    <p>Our company has Office 365 licenses&nbsp;and we use Yammer already for communications.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our hope is to create external networks with which to communicate with external stakeholders. However, some of these important stakeholders are consultants or otherwise have restrictions on how they are able to use their company email addresses and as a
 result have to use public email services for their communications with us (eg gmail and yahoo etc).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The advice that one of my colleagues has received is that if we had created our yammer network without Office 365 we would be able to invite users with such email addresses but because of our Office 365 licenses we are unable to do this. See post here: https://answers.microsoft.com/message/fe24769e-b2a1-4e27-aa36-673ba218b87d?threadId=f7a836a7-b0f5-44c1-a58d-82324ca72c30</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please provide me with a solution for getting these external users access to our external network.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time. </p>

            <p>Hello Tameka,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have informed that if you are using office 365 yammer enterprise network than you cannot add the user in home network with public email address.</p>
<p>You can invite the Gmail id via invite guest by navigating to the network portal in yammer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But however you can invite the users in external network with public email address like @hotmail or @gmail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would request you kindly navigate to the yammer network as a verified admin -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network Admin -&gt; Security Settings -&gt; check Exchange transport rule is enable or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
