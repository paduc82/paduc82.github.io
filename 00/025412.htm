            Hello My Phone user,<br />
<br />
If you are trying to restore contacts that you have archived&nbsp;to portal(i.e stored on portal but not on device)&nbsp;earlier, Select the conatcts to be restored, click on manage and then select restore from the dropdown. When you sync from the device the next time
 it will&nbsp;sync the contacts from the portal to&nbsp;device.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if this answers your question.<br />
<br />
Your suggestion regarding restricting the selection of data items on portal to one page&nbsp;will be taken into consideration in furture releases.<br />
Thanks for using My Phone Application.Meanwhile please feel free to share your comments and suggestions.<br />
<br />
Vandana Samala

    <title>PowerPoint 2013&#58; Images in presentation disappear - and are - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2013&#58; Images in presentation disappear - and are replaced with &#39;The image part with relationship ID rId2 was not found in the file&#39;</h2>
                    <p>I've seen several comments regarding PowerPoint issues related to lost images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company recently moved to Office 365 ProPlus/2016 (working on a Dell with Windows 7 Enterprise and on version 16.0.6001.1078) and I was working with several existing PowerPoint files; merging/copying existing slides into a new deck.&nbsp; As I worked, images
 started to disappear.&nbsp; Our IT group, suggested working on a local version of files in the future, but this doesn't help for the lost work/hours and I've read that this does not necessarily fix the problem and other posts suggest this isn't the 'fix'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I support a group of road warriors, I need to know if there is a 'best practice' we need to follow to ensure no lost images going forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our environment is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone has laptop (local drive), individual network drive ("X: NAME") and then we use a myriad of OneDrive, Dropbox, Box, jumpdrives (depending on where individuals are and what they have access to).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the answer is that you have to work on a local version and then upload, we can work with that.</p>
<p>If the answer is that you have to save all images locally (i.e. not screen grabs/copy image from Web page and insert into slide), we can work with that *but we also need to know if those local images need to be uploaded with the PowerPoint doc (if sharing
 via any one of the mentioned above) and then downloaded locally by each user.</p>
<p>if the Answer is you can't drag and drop existing slides into a new deck; please advise</p>
<p>If the answer is you need to 'save' every 5 minutes; we can implement that.</p>
<p>If the answer is that it is just random "fluke"...we need to know that too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be no message that I could find that gives a definitive "this is how to avoid this in the future".&nbsp; While I'm fairly quick with replicating lost work, that is not the case with all our team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A solid process going forward is requested if anyone knows.</p>

            <p>As you've noticed, once the images go bad, they're lost permanently. There's no repairing them at that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd start by making sure your users are up-to-date with any available service packs/patches for Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a general rule and especially if you're having problems with images going missing, it's best always to work with the presentation on the local hard drive.&nbsp; Copy from jump drive/cloud storage/etc to the local HDD, open it from there, save, then copy back
 to the cloud/jump drive when done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When copying PowerPoint files to the local HDD, put them in a folder that's not being "watched" by any file synchronization software (Dropbox, OneDrive, Carbonite or other backup apps).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another general rule:&nbsp; it's safer to save images to the local HDD and insert them into PPT from there.&nbsp; Once inserted into PPT, they become part of the presentation.&nbsp; You shouldn't thereafter need to keep them with the presentation (but if you continue to
 get occasional image corruption problems, it might be a good idea to keep the images and PPT file together).&nbsp; Copy/Pasting images can be problematic; I'd avoid it from the web. Screenshots made with e.g. the Windows snipping tool seem safe to paste into PPT
 though.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It shouldn't be necessary to save every five minutes, but a good habit to develop is:&nbsp; whenever you've done more work on a file than you would risk losing, save.&nbsp; Before making any drastic changes, save.&nbsp; And every so often, save to a new version of the
 file (numbered, dated, whatever suits you best). </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are add-ins that will automatically save to sequentially numbered files every so often.&nbsp;

    <title>Microsoft Word 2007 - Pauses of 15-20 seconds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marz_k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word 2007 - Pauses of 15-20 seconds</h2>
                    I am running Vista Home Premium on a Dell Inspiron 1501 laptop. It is 32 bit and has 2 GB of memory.<br />
<br />
When I am using Word, the application seems to pause when I am typing in the middle of writing. I will be working on a document (docx file) with only text and numbers. I use the "Normal" style. I will be typing away and suddenly, I have to wait about 15 to
 20 seconds. If I am still typing when this occurs, part of my text will not appear even though I am pressing the keys. Then, after the pause, the app will spit out what I typed in one flurry of letters/numbers.<br />
<br />
I have had the suggestion to have Task Manager Open. But, when one of these pauses occurs, nothing new shows up on the Task Manager List.<br />
<br />
Is there something running in the background that I don't know about?<br />
<br />
I am sure that I am not the speediest of typist. And, I save (CTRL - S) often.<br />
<br />
When this occurs I only have Word open - No other application. And, no application (like McAfee) is downloading an update. I can see the little icon on my taskbar when that occurs.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Mark<br />

</p><p>If you want to switch off the animations on the Live Tiles, the only way to do this is to make the tiles small. To do this, press and hold the tile, then press the

<p>Are you using instant search? That should limit searchs to the first letters - so you'd find pin and pine but not helping.</p>
<p>Instant search uses the same syntax as windows desktop search - see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/technicalresources/advquery.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/technicalresources/advquery.mspx</a>&nbsp;for ideas.</p>
<p>If you arent using instant search, outlook's old search engine will look for partial words (and is very slow).&nbsp; Did you try " pin " ?&nbsp;(include quotes)&nbsp;I thought that worked, but i could be misremembering as i haven't used that search engine in a long time.</p>

            All N or E series smartphones with wi-fi support VOIP.<br />

Fring is one of the best ways to use VOIP, check their site out for price details.

 the envelope was closed and if the email was read it showed an open envelop.&nbsp; The Outlook 2016 still has this column but no envelope is showing in this column it is blank.&nbsp; Does this still work in 2016?&nbsp; This is not the envelope that is received in the lower

</p><p>I found out that MSFT removed the read and unread envelope icon in Office 2013. They went to a compact view that shows a blue&nbsp;bar if your email is unread. The best thing you can do is add a column next to the icon column called "Read" that will bring back
 the envelope icons. Not ideal but works.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Thanks for contacting us. My name is Victor.
<br />
<br />There are a number of possible explanations for why verification codes don't always arrive. Read through the list of the most common causes, and see if any of them apply to you.
<br />
<br />Does your phone block calls or texts from unknown numbers?
<br />If so, change your phone settings then choose I don't have a code. We'll send another verification code.
<br />
<br />Did your email send your verification code to your junk folder? 
<br />Check your junk email folder for a message from a Microsoft account, and use the code sent to you. Valid verification codes come from an @accountprotection.microsoft.com email address.
<br />
<br />Mark @accountprotection.microsoft.com as a trusted sender to receive your verification code in your inbox. 
<br />
<br />Is your phone number or email address entered correctly?
<br />To keep your information safe when you're signing in, we only show you the last two digits of your phone number or the first two characters of your email address.
<br />
<br />To see if your security info is correct:
<br />
<br />Sign in to your Security basics page (See reference below) with your Microsoft account.
<br />
<br />Sign in using:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/security</a>
<br />
<br />Select Update info.
<br />
<br />Choose a method that you know works, or choose I don't have any of these to replace your security info.
<br />
<br />Does your alternate email address end in @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, @live.com, or @msn.com?
<br />
<br />If so, you're using one Microsoft account to verify another Microsoft account. This can make it tricky to keep track of which one you're signed in to. When you sign in to the second account (to get the code sent to that email), most browsers automatically sign you out of the first account (the one that's actually requesting the code).
<br />
<br />To get your verification code:
<br />
<br />Using a browser in privacy mode, sign in with the first account. This lets you stay signed in to both accounts at the same time.
<br />
<br />When you're prompted to enter the verification code that was sent to your alternate email address, don't close the browser window.
<br />Open a new window in privacy mode. Ctrl + Shift + P is the shortcut for InPrivate Browsing in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. If you're using a different browser, check that browser's help for info about privacy mode.
<br />
<br />In the new window, sign in to your alternate email account and look for the message from the Microsoft account team. Copy or write down the verification code from the message.
<br />
<br />Return to the window that is asking you for the verification code. Enter the code and follow the instructions.
<br />
<br />To read more and get all the details about all mentioned above, just review the following reference:
<br />
<br />Microsoft account security info &amp; verification codes

<br />
<br />In addition, take a look for Troubleshooting verification code issues.

<p>Hello Azzura_,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was brought to this link a couple of time and it seemed simple enough to use the search function that came with Visio. Unfortunately, whe you type Value Stream Map in the search field, nothing shows up (While connected to a network). So it seems that the
 search is forced to only look locally somehow. Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Shape search is only one way to locate the VSM shapes -- and it's probably not the best way. Because you have Visio Professional, the Value Stream Map template should be available via the Templates page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select <em>File&gt;New </em>then <em>Categories</em> (or <em>Templates</em> in Visio 2019). Select the
<em>Business</em> category thumbnail and you should see the <em>Value Stream Map</em> template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you've created a new diagram once or twice from the VSM template using the steps above, the template should appear near the top of the set of thumbnails on the
<em>File&gt;New&gt;Featured </em>page. (The Featured page shows templates Microsoft thinks you might be interested in but the templates that you use regularly float to the top.)</p>

A Skype Number is great option if you, or your friends and family live in different countries, or plan to travel abroad and want an affordable way to keep in touch.

<br />If you need to send SMS messages, you will need to purchase some credit:

    <title>Word tables keep breaking up weirdly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marqfja87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word tables keep breaking up weirdly</h2>
                    <p>I like to write profiles for fictional characters and setting elements that I use in my fanfiction stories. Writing such profiles involves using tables to create "infoboxes" that form a quick list of important information, like the character's birth/legal
 name (and how it's natively written, if it's not normally written with Roman letter for example), aliases, date and place of&nbsp;birth, height and weight, nationality, likes and dislikes, etc. You can get a good idea of what I'm doing if you look at Wikipedia's
 infobox templates, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_person#Blank_template_with_all_parameters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this one</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I've come across a strange problem as my table format grew in size. I typically write my profiles in Web Layout, with the table aligned at the right of the page and with the text-wrapping option turned on. At some point in the process of adding
 new rows to accomodate new fields of information, the table apparently becomes "too big" for Word to handle, and it sort of&nbsp;<em>breaks</em> such that there's a strange gap between the cells along the break, as well as the text that's supposed to be on the
 same vertical level as the beginning of the table being pushed down until it's below the table. Here is a
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/rMGDAlG.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sample screenshot</a>; the red line indicates the break, and you can clearly an empty gap above the "Introduction" heading. Said heading is supposed to be level with the the top of the table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell by comparing with Print Layout, the break and the attendant text-pushing seems to happen once the table becomes extended over three pages, even if it's only one row into the third page. If anyone has any idea how to fix this, I would
 deeply appreciate this; I've been plagued with this problem for a few years now.</p>

            As a general rule, a wrapped object cannot extend beyond one page. Word makes an exception for wrapped tables provided you don't have the Layout Options "Don't break wrapped tables across pages" enabled. But I think it's still pushing your luck to try
 to extend a wrapped table across multiple pages. Without being able to see more of the rest of the document, it's hard to say more. If you'd like to send a sample to ssbarnhill at gmail dot com, I'll have a look.

            <p>Yes I installed 64bit Office 2013 then 32bit 2003, 2007 and 2010 in that order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tend to use Parallels as I'm generally on a MacBook, or Virtualbox on my Linux laptop. I like being able to setup whatever combo of OS and Office I want to test.</p>

<p>Copy it from CD to a USB drive, then from USB to netbook HD. It will install faster if it is on the local HD than if you try to run it through the USB connection.</p>
<p>Your other alternative is to simply buy an external&nbsp;CD/DVD. I've see an external DVD Burner for USD$50.</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand you are not able to install the Office 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to ask few questions regarding the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Which account was used to purchase Office 365?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Have you used the same email account (which was used to purchase Office 365) to login to my account page?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 365 will be assigned to a particular account, if you login using other live account to My Account page then you won’t be able install or activate the Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Log-off from all the accounts, login to the My Accounts page by using the email address used to purchase Office 365 and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you are using an incorrect email address, then you may also refer to the following link and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-office_install/office-365-incorrect-email-id-used-while-setting/2942d650-1a6e-4a52-b30a-61c68cda541e">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-office_install/office-365-incorrect-email-id-used-while-setting/2942d650-1a6e-4a52-b30a-61c68cda541e</a></p>

    <title>Conditional Formatting Rule works for letters but not for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dantabla  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional Formatting Rule works for letters but not for numbers-edited as per JP Ronse advice</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I decided that would be&nbsp;helpful to automatically&nbsp;fill in the background&nbsp;cells of a&nbsp;column&nbsp;based on the first word&nbsp;contained&nbsp;in the cell itself.&nbsp;Since I would have to&nbsp;adapt this concept&nbsp;from a situation to another, therefore&nbsp;the words of the criteria&nbsp;will
 vary, I decided to have a editable reference&nbsp;legend that the criteria would pick up automatically. I place it&nbsp;outside of the table, on top of it so the user could change the word criteria values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The legend for&nbsp;Column A: </p>
<p>Cell A1:YES-Green </p>
<p>Cell A2:No-Red</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore if A4=YES then its background will color to GREEN </p>
<p>Therefore if A4=NO then its background will color to RED</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:</p>
<p>I&nbsp;built a Table with&nbsp;2 'Conditional Formatting Rule' for each color&nbsp;on 'Column A' to 'Format values where this formula is true'=LEFT($A4,LEN(A$2))=$A$2 that is working only for text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried&nbsp;replacing the criteria word with numbers&nbsp;and is not working even if I changed the cell format to Number. Any idea what to do to make it work for both: letters and numbers in Conditional Formatting?&nbsp;Same formula works for both letters and numbers
 in a&nbsp;regular cell.&nbsp;I would send you the Excel file I'd knew how to do it.</p>

            <p>Hi Thanks for your help but I'm on Windows 10 not Android.</p>
<p>But like you said "Core editing is available for free on Windows devices with screen sizes of 10.1 inches or less" for Windows 10 so I wonder why I don't have core editing ? I have a 10.1 inch tablet so I should have the core editing.</p>
<p>Should I need to activated something ? I don't want to pay for something that is free ..</p>

            <p>Hello. I've got the same problem as Vaka_tech and I still don't know how to enable editing options in Office Mobile apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I HAVEN'T GOT an Office 365 subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My device is ASUS T100ta - 10.1 inch tablet (2in1). The funny thing about this situation is that when Office Mobile apps launch for the first time, information about free editing on 10.1 inch or smaller devices is displayed.&nbsp;As I've said, my device&nbsp;meets
 that requirement. Help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>No. "Core editing is available for free on <strong>Windows 10 devices</strong> with screen sizes of 10.1 inches or less." (emphasis mine)</p>
<p>https://products.office.com/en-US/office-resources</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 10.1 inch&nbsp;ASUS T100 Chi&nbsp;that&nbsp;<strong>did</strong> have core editing at one point and has now lost it. Having core editing was a big part of why I bought it. I only ended up using it rarely but was happy to have the ability when needed. Losing core
 editing is frustrating. Where did it go?&nbsp;Can it come back? I wish I knew.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>On devices with a screen size of less than or equal to 10.1”, basic editing is free with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint Mobile for non-commercial use.&nbsp; Editing documents in business locations, such as SharePoint and OneDrive for Business, requires a qualifying
 Office 365 subscription regardless of device size.&nbsp; If you are on a device that is less than 10.1” and you are being prompted for an Office 365 subscription, you may need to update your license.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;Try signing out of your Mobile app and then signing back in:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Word, Excel, or PowerPoint Mobile</span></li><li><span>Open any document</span></li><li><span>Tap <strong>File</strong> and then <strong>Settings </strong>and then <strong>
Account</strong></span></li><li><span>Tap each account and tap <strong>Sign out</strong></span></li><li><span>Tab <strong>Close</strong></span></li><li><span>Close your app</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Now, sign back in to your app. Start your app and click <strong>Sign in</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you need to add an account back, follow steps 2 and 3 above and add back your Microsoft Account or organizational account.</span></p>

<p>Hello John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are few factors that can contribute to the issue you are facing. It might be caused by network connection or time and date are not correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you use the <strong>activation troubleshooter</strong> which can help you resolve errors for Office 365. Download it on this
<strong><a href="https://aka.ms/diag_officeact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and follow the on-screen steps to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try the following steps provided below to help resolve your concern:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to <strong>check</strong> and <strong>update the date and time</strong> on your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Connect to the Internet</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>While you don’t need to be online at all times to use Office, you do need to connect to the Internet intermittently so Office can verify that your Office 365 subscription is still active. If Office can’t check the status of your subscription for an
 extended period of time (usually around 30 days), you’ll see the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Couldn’t Verify Subscription</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>message, and Office will eventually go into reduced functionality mode. To fix this, reconnect to the Internet,
 and then choose<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Retry</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure that your Office 365 Home subscription is active.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Close all Office apps.</span></li><li>G<span>o to your&nbsp;</span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services?ref=officesupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Services &amp; subscriptions</a><span>&nbsp;page.</span></li><li><span>I</span><span>f prompted, choose</span><strong>&nbsp;Sign in&nbsp;</strong><span>and enter the Microsoft account email and password associated with your Office 365 subscription.</span></li><li><span>R</span><span>eview the details under the&nbsp;</span><strong>Subscriptions</strong><span>&nbsp;heading.<br />
<br />
</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/058e3afc-30ac-4dd9-a294-d16354bcf166" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/058e3afc-30ac-4dd9-a294-d16354bcf166" /></a></li></ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Deactivate your Office subscription</strong></span></p>
<p>I<span>f you've exceeded the number of installs that your Office 365 subscription supports, you can deactivate an Office install that you're no longer using so you can install Office on a different device.<br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>G</span><span>o to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/myaccount</a><span>&nbsp;and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted.</span></li><li><span>S</span><span>elect&nbsp;</span><strong>Install &gt;</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>U</span><span>nder&nbsp;</span><strong>Install information</strong><span>, select&nbsp;</span><strong>Deactivate Install</strong><span>&nbsp;to deactivate the Office installs that you no longer use.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>After you deactivate an Office install, you still can view and print documents from that device, but you won't be able to edit them or create new ones. Office lets you know that the install is deactivated by showing Unlicensed Product errors. If you
 want to use Office on the device, you'll need to reactivate Office by signing in to your Office 365 account when prompted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes and we'll give you further assistance if needed.</p>

            Mine was a different amount but I too had this issue. I called Customer service and they said they would send me an email again bc one was supposed to be sent. Well that never came. I called again just today and they sent me an email and gave me the code
 over the phone. What a pain in the butt it was! Now I have this code and have no idea where to enter it to redeem it! UGH!

            I also am having the same problem from a purchase on Black friday. I just made my third phone call today and I was still given the run around again. I wish they would have given me my code like they did you.

            So I went to try to use the code and it's only 9 digits. Anywhere you go online to redeem it asks for 25 digits. &nbsp;I called again and they sent me to Xbox tech support and they couldn't tell me anything. Its **** I should ha e bought the Xbox from a
 different store. Sad to say the actual manufacturer can't even take care of their customers. I'm baying frustrated now! 4 calls and no one knows anything.&nbsp;

            No need to tell me to contact customers service a 5th time! Pretty worthless. Waist of time. Never again. Amazon or Wal-Mart door online for now on.&nbsp;
