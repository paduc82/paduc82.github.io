<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately Mac compatibility probably doesn't figure very high in Nokia's priorities at the moment, but you might like to look at this link:<a href="http://zealouspost.com/tutorial-how-to-create-an-isync-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://zealouspost.com/tutorial-how-to-create-an-isync-plugin</a></p>

<p>I think it's unacceptable that Nokia released a phone and it's impossible to transfer your data from or to it!&nbsp; I have both Mac and Windows and I've been unsuccessful in putting the data from my E51 to the newer C2-01.&nbsp; Even a simple phone to phone transfer
 stops after 2000 numbers! Who is the genius at Nokia that put THAT limit in there?&nbsp; I love the Nokia one handed texting and simple software but for years they have neglected the Mac community despite the enormous growth in users.&nbsp; I'm afraid Nokia won't be
 around much longer if they keep this up. I've had no less that 10 Nokia phones and they're about to lose another loyal customer because of the lack of sync and backup options.&nbsp; Anyone that's lost a phone or have it broken without a backup knows what I'm talking
 about.</p>

<p>I agree. I just bought one of these phones and expected it to work straight off with isync on my mac. It didn't. Major boo.</p>
<p>All I wanted to do was sync my address book contacts with it but even this was too hard. I even tried exporting all address book contacts into a single vcard then uploading that to my phone over bluetooth. However the phone only recognised the first contact
 in the list !!</p>
<p>I think I have found a way round though.</p>
<p>Do a google search on "apple address book export multiple vcards". Really good post that shows how to export contacts as individual vcards. You can then use the bluetooth menu to send all the vcf files to your phone....I hope (about to try myself).</p>

<p>Add me to the list of angry people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only does iSnync not work with C2-01, but even Nokia's own "Nokia Multimedia Transfer" software, which I have used fine on my Mac with my previous cheap Nokia phone, does not support this mode!.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried using Plugin Maker but it wants to run 900 tests, each one takes a few seconds, it looks like it will take 12 hours or more to perform the whole batch, and already I see some odd failures which I have no idea how serious they are or how to remedy.
 The zealouspost guy is very nice to provide that template, and while the tinkerer in me was intrigued enough to get pretty far, I don't want to brick my phone by not doing it right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I could buy Nokia's mini USB cable thingie, assuming plugin maker goes a ton faster that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia, could you please make it clear when listing features of a phone if it is not going to work with Macs? &nbsp; I spent a long long time selecting this phone and now I have to send it back. I had no idea that if my 2-3 year old 3120 classic worked with Macs,
 as it did, that there could be such a thing as a brand new model of about the same price range that doesn't!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't care about iSync so much, but your own Multimeda Transfer Tool?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why don't you just make a mere hundred phones and support them well instead of a thousand phones which don't get the attention and support we deserve?? &nbsp;&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good thing Amazon has an easy return policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too bad, the phone itself seems decent and a very good price.</p>

<p>I'm another surprised and disappointed C2 customer. It looks like a great phone, but now it just collects dust because I can't add my contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the lovely&nbsp;asperperguy&nbsp;who supplied the plug-in template, and to rwelti for giving it a shot and stopping me from getting more frustrated with this basic problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mahayv - can we expect to use our phones soon or should we take them back?</p>

<p>iSync is produced by Apple, and therefore Nokia cannot control device compatibility. Nokia does, where possible, provide plugins to aid compatibility with some devices, though regrettably this is not currently possible with the C2-01 device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you seek to sync data from another Nokia device, the following options may be available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct transfer from device to device between some models. </li><li>Backup via a Windows PC. </li></ul>

                    <p>Running Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 365 for Business. Ever since the upgrade, I have some E-mail recipients that do not receive attachments properly. They are received as a &lt;winmail.dat&gt; attachment and cannot be opened. It only happens when i initiate
 a new email to the recipient. If I am 'Replying' to one of their previous emails and adding attachments they are received properly then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing the text format from Rich to Plain and to HTML but neither did the trick. Is there a way to resolve this?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jessica_V,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since itâ€™s fine when sending emails to your own iCloud and the issue occurs when sending emails to your clientâ€™s iCloud, the issue seems to be related to the recipientâ€™s side. To confirm whether that is the case, please confirm the following
 information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. How many recipients have the issue? </span></p>
<p><span>2. Do the recipients have something in common? For example, theyâ€™re using the same email client to configure their email account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, you can try the following:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a></span></p>
<p><span>2. Run the command: &nbsp;Replace </span><em><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</span></em><span>with the recipientâ€™s email address.</span></p>
<p><span>New-MailContact -Name "<em>contact name</em>" -ExternalEmailAddress "<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em>"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Run the commands:</span></p>
<p><span>Set-MailContact &lt;ExternalEmailAddress&gt; -UseMapiRichTextFormat Never</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Set-MailContact -Identity &lt;ExternalEmailAddress&gt; -UsePreferMessageFormat $True</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4.Run the following Windows PowerShell command to confirm that the message format was applied:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Get-MailContact | Select &lt;ExternalEmailAddress&gt; | Select UseMapiRichTextFormat</span></p>

    <title>Offline maps constantly loading in Windows 10 mobile &#40;Lumia - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tzon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Offline maps constantly loading in Windows 10 mobile &#40;Lumia 640&#41;</h2>
                    <p>During the past month when using Maps on Windows 10 mobile I get the message "map download paused", followed by something like "we will resume when you connect on Wi-Fi". This message comes up almost any time I launch the Map app for GPS navigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening Settings &gt; System &gt; Offline Maps, brings me to the list of downloaded maps and options. There, my downloaded map (Greece) appears to be constantly loading something. I cannot delete it, I cannot move it, I cannot download or even browse for other
 maps. Option, such as "automatically update maps" will turn to their default (on) if I turn them off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read somewhere that Microsoft decided to force saving of offline maps only in the internal memory of the phone. I had previously selected to save maps on the external SD card (D:). I believe the problem has to do with that. However, I cannot do anything
 about it, neither from Offline Map settings nor from Storage Space management. I have restarted my phone several times without luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>John</p>

            <p>With 8.1 versions of the phone there was no option to store maps in any other location except the phone memory. With 10 the option was added to select the storage location to the SD card.</p>
<p>Leave the phone alone and let it finish a download when downloading a new map.</p>
<p>Try a phone soft reset.</p>
<p><span><span>A soft reset does not lose data. it is like pulling the battery.

<p>

<h2>            Replicate a Calculated Field in DAX</h2>
                    <p>Hi -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a Calculated Fields in my Pivot Table(which I know was created properly) and I'm now looking to replicate those same formulas in DAX in Power Pivot since I want to load my data to the Data Model. I haven't used DAX for a while, but I tried searching
 the web for some answers. This was the best attempt I had. Thank you in advance for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm trying to do here is sum multiple fields together. So you'll notice I have 6 fields I'm trying to sum together. If you need the dataset I can provide it. Figured maybe by just looking at my formulas we'd be able to tell if I was on the right track
 or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is not totally true. The <strong>ESD Decrypter 4.7 is very old and no longer works with Win 10. You need the latest Decrypter.

Where is this ESD Decrypter 15 you speak of? &nbsp;The link you provided is broken. &nbsp;And searching the internet, I can only find the previously mentioned, and very old version 4, and a slightly newer version 6 (which is bent on requiring 4 images in the ESD, while
 the ESD I'm trying to convert only has 2).

<h2>            OneNote Insert Printout Settings</h2>
                    <p>I need to insert a printout with thin to no margins. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I do this now, OneNote will cut off the content outside of OneNote's Insert printout margins. &nbsp;I tried adjusting the print settings, but those are just for OneNote printouts. &nbsp;Shouldn't it accept the parameters from the document that is to be printed?
 &nbsp;I tried this with a pdf file and a Word file. &nbsp;It would be ideal if OneNote would inherit the margins from Word or any document it was displaying as a printout.</p>
<p>Is there a setting in OneNote that will change the margins for inserted printouts?</p>

<p>I want to stop sharing all my documents from the Users of my organization. Can it be done using OneDrive or SharePoint? If yes then how?</p>
<p>What i found is:</p>
<p>When i go to Site Settings in OneDrive, it will take me to SharePoint "Permissions" option where the following Warning is displayed.</p>
<p>"Some items of this list may have unique permissions which are not controlled from this page.&nbsp; Show these items.<br />
There are limited access users on this site. Users may have limited access if an item or document under the site has been shared with them. Show users.<br />
This library has unique permissions."</p>
<p>If i click on "Show Users" it will show most of the users in my organization (may be they are the people with whom i have shared the folders/documents or may be we have common documents shared by others)</p>
<p>I have option to delete Unique Permissions and inherit Parent and by selecting Users i have option to "Remove User Permission".</p>
<p>If i select all users and remove user permissions will i be able to stop sharing all my documents and folders from those users?</p>

<p>Hi Arman,</p>
<p>Yes, we can check the permission at the document library level or the site level. As you mentioned, if we click on
<strong>Show Users</strong> at the library level, we can remove the unique permission of the users who we donâ€™t want to shared our folders with via clicking
<strong>Remove User Permission</strong>. And then, they have no permission on the OneDrive for Business library.</p>
<p>If the user still can access the folders, please check the userâ€™s permission at the library level via clicking
<strong>Library &gt; Library settings &gt; Permissions and Management &gt; Permissions for this document library &gt; Check Permissions</strong>. Then, type the user account to the User/Group box and click<strong> Check Now</strong>. Then, remove his permission according
 to the result. We can also check the userâ€™s permission at the site level via <strong>
Site Setting &gt; Site Permissions &gt; Check permissions &gt;</strong> type the user account<strong> &gt; Check now</strong>. Then remove his permission in the site.</p>
<p>If anything is misunderstood or unclear, please let us know and we will continue to discuss the situation based on the update.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Shirley</p>

<p>Hi Arman,</p>
<p>To do that, we&nbsp;may&nbsp;delete unique permissions in all items of library using some PowerShell script. We canâ€™t bulk remove all usersâ€™ permissions on all items in the user interface. To get further assistance about the PowerShell script, we would suggest you
 post a new thread on our <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=scripting&amp;forum=dpmpowershell%2CITCG&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;searchTerm=PowerShell+to+delete+unique+permissions+in+all+items" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Shirley</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>So there is an option called <strong>Show Users&nbsp;</strong>about which we discussed earlier. So there are two groups available called
<strong>Everyone</strong> and <strong>Everyone except Domain User.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>So my question is what if i select all those Users and Groups and click
<strong>Remove User Permissions</strong> and <strong>Delete Unique Permissions. </strong>
Will it remove access of all users from my document library?</p>

<p>hi arman,</p>
<p>thanks for your update.</p>
<p>about the method we discussed above, i would like to explain that after clicking
<strong>show users &gt; remove user permissions</strong> and <strong>delete unique permission</strong> at the library level, we will remove all usersâ€™ permissions for this library. however, some items/files in this library doesnâ€™t&nbsp; inherit the permission from
 the library and still have unique permissions. therefore, the behaviors we performed above make no difference to these items/files and some users still have unique permissions on these items.</p>
<p>to delete unique permissions on these items, we can click <strong>show these items</strong> as you description in the second post. then, we need to remove usersâ€™ permissions on these items one by one via clicking
<strong>manage permissions</strong> as below and we canâ€™t bulk remove unique permissions on these items once.<br />

<p>therefore, to delete unique permissions in all items of library once, some powershell scripts may be needed according to the threads i provided above. for further assistance, we would suggest you post a new thread on our

<strong>Remove User Permissions</strong> and also <strong>Deleted Unique Permissions</strong>. I also tried an option called
<strong>Stop inheriting Permissions</strong>. I don't actually know what difference did that option make. But as you said there can be PowerShell script that will delete all the user permissions from all documents in my library. So in the Script Forum shall
 i generate a script request? Will the support team generate the script or they'll guide me to write the script on my own?</p>

<p>Hi Arman,</p>
<p>Since the steps are clear and detailed, you can try the script first by following the steps in the article.
<br />
If you encounter any issue when running scripts, you can post a thread in <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=scripting&amp;forum=dpmpowershell%2CITCG&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;searchTerm=PowerShell+to+delete+unique+permissions+in+all+items" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
that Scripting forum</a> with the error message there so engineers can assist to complete the task.</p>
<p>For your convenience:<br />

<p>Hi Ryan</p>
<p>This script worked. Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>Any script available to delete all user permissions for all users from all documents i.e. whole OneDrive library?</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer Downloads &#38; View Downloads &#40;CTRL&#43;J&#41;</h2>
                    I am using Internet Explorer 9 64 bit with windows 7. &nbsp;I recently had a problem with the dowload folder. Using chrome, downloaded files were giving NSIS error on executing &amp; IE10 crashed upon opening. I solved the problem for chrome by creating new user
 and downloads were ok; but IE10 still crashed on opening. Uninstalled IE10 back to IE9 and now find in both users whilst IE works, I cannot neither download files nor view downloads (CTRL+J). I have also decided to set up a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;Downloads folder on C drive
 to which I have pointed chrome BUT because of IE9 problem with CTRL+J, i cannot do anything with IE. &nbsp;Please can someone advise how to fix this problem. &nbsp;Clearly the pointer to the download folder in IE has got corrupted and needs to be reset BUT HOW. All
 searches do not help as in all cases that I can find, downloads are working OK but not CTRL+J. In my case neither work. &nbsp;I have cleared all download history etc. &amp; run&nbsp;MicrosoftFixit.IEPe

<h2>            HowTo&#63; Delete word from dictionary&#63;</h2>
                    <p>LiveMail (also applies to browser)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Win7</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I often "Add" words to my LiveMail account, but there have been times I'd like to delete an added item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, I might "Add" LiveMail above, by right-clicking on it and selecting "Add". Suppose later I decided that LiveMail was an error, and I should be using "Live Mail".&nbsp; I'd like to be alerted when I use LiveMail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can this be done? Is there a way to edit the dictionary? I did try "Open spelling dialog", but that didn't seem to apply.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community,&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mention the complete error message which you get while downloading Office 365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to check and find out if the issue is with hardware, network or ID, hence I would suggest you to try the below steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Letâ€™s try to install the Office on any of your friends iPad who as a same update, if that works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to install Office on your IPad again, but ensure you will try to use different apple Id and also different Microsoft account for Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try with different Internet network. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Calendar on windows phone 8.0 - all events disappeared</h2>
                    Two days ago, all the events in my calendar just disappeared. &nbsp;This happened once before but only lasted a few hours. &nbsp;All events, reminders, etc, past, present and future are just gone. &nbsp;I've tried adding a new reminder, that didn't work. &nbsp;I've tried
 logging in and checking for anything on calendar.live.com, but there are no events there either. &nbsp;I tried changing sync settings on the website as well as on my phone to no avail. &nbsp;I haven't had any updates or installed any new apps in the recent past, so
 I don't know what brought this on. &nbsp;I don't really use outlook - I have the calendar app synced to my google calendar, which is working fine on other devices. &nbsp;But usually when I have a new event, I only add it to my phone and I have no idea what happened
 to all those events.

            Okay, for anyone out there having the same problem, what finally worked for me was opening my gmail account on my phone, going into settings and then unchecking sync for email, calendar, and contacts. &nbsp;Then I went back into general phone settings, email
 accounts, and checked the sync box for email, calendar and contacts. &nbsp;My calendar entries reappeared, yea!

            I don't know unless you had previously been in the insiders' program and got an incomplete opt out. I think to totally opt our you need to do a clean install of the last release to market version for which an iso is available. Lots of references in this
 forum on how to do that. &nbsp;

            <p>If you want to create a form where users should only add pieces of text, there is a number of options for that in Word. For example, you can make use of form fields (these are backward compatible with older Word versions) or you can use the newer content
 controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I already mentioned, it is possible to restrict the use of formatting, so that users/editors can focus on content. Click Review | Restrict Editing; in the task pane, select "Limit formatting to a selection of styles" and then click "Settings" to specify
 which styles can be used in the document. When you are done, click the Yes, Start Enforcing Protection button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these options would require "locking" Word itself.</p>

            <p>Hum... you could attempt to do a 3D doodle with the freeform one that you could enlarge to make a shark.
</p>
<p>you could also hit the 3people button(community) and download the shark and edit it.</p>
<p>If you want you could submit a feedback in the insider hub for a cookie cutter type thing.</p>
<p>Hope that helps:)</p>

<h2>            Automatic attachment downloads in Outlook</h2>
                    Is there a way to control whether Outlook automatically downloads attachments when emails are received? If I am on a metered internet connection, such as tethered to my cell phone, I would like to be able to manually download attachments when I choose,
 rather than Outlook automatically downloading all attachments. This would save me significant mobile bandwidth while I am working out of office.

            Microsoft telephone support stated otherwise. They said there was a way to do it in Exchange settings, however that category of help requires professional support which comes with a fee. This seems a bit ridiculous to me.

<h2>            Microsoft Band - Screen turned black -&#62; after reset the displayes picture is fell apart, not responding&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My band was working fine until tomorrow morning. After Reset the display is still black, and when i wait a bit then the clock appears but the picture is fell apart :( like picture shows</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/61781612-54cf-402c-a8fc-347d6719df81?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/61781612-54cf-402c-a8fc-347d6719df81?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If i wait until the battery is fully drained and i place the band onto charger (1,5AmpH or 2AmpH or Laptop, or Tablet, or Desktop PC or ani USB source) then the issue is the same:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd52e9de-de78-4f98-807d-ebc87ada562d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd52e9de-de78-4f98-807d-ebc87ada562d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The band is working, syncing all the datas are visible in the phone, but only in the phone, the band is totally unresponsible. Cortana is working, if i pust the button long but the display is not changeing the picture on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can i try now? Is there any Repair software or relashing tool to try a software reflash or i must throw it away?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel fre to comment.</p>

<p>Hello Mark. Thank you for the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try several times to reset but only this picture comes in and it's not matters what kind of source i chose to power up the band. (Laptop USB port, Desktop USB port, 1,5A Charger, 2A Charger, Car head unit) Those sources i have tried out to boot or wake
 up after reset (Hold down each button for 30sec.) I'm outside the US, and as i will call them. I have in the past this Black screen issue, but in that case if i let the band drain fully and after this i put it on a 5V 2A Charger then it comes alive again.
 This have i tried in this case too but it wont help :( i have make this 5-8 times :( but nothing.</p>

            Hi. As i wrote before, in mi homeland, in mi Country there is no Microsoft Band support (Hungary) The nearest is in Austria, but then the travel/postage const will be bigger then the cost of the product :(
