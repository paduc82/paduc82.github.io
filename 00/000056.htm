    <title>Email Auth Certificate Not Recognized on WP10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Email Auth Certificate Not Recognized on WP10</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to utilize certificates to authenticate to our mail servers but am unable to do so. I've confirmed that the certificates are delivered successfully to my device and that they are selected in the mail account. All other properties of the mail account
 are entered correctly. However when I try to sync mail I receive an error "Something went wrong. You'll need a personal certificate to connect to &lt;my server hostname&gt;. Error code: 0x85030027." The phone doesn't appear to be reaching out to Exchange at all
 as I see no mention of the device in OWA and our proxy server that mediates the communication also shows no record of the device's attempt to communicate with Exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've verified via the Microsoft Certificates application that the certificate I've manually selected under Account config is valid. I've un-checked the "Automatically select a certificate..." option under the mail account's configuration, then selected the
 correct cert. However every time I go back into Account configuration that option is checked again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something is obviously amiss here as the certificate is clearly installed and clearly selected yet the mail client refuses to acknowledge it. Furthermore as I've verified via Microsoft's own Certificates application that the certificate is present and valid
 I have to conclude there's some sort of bug present with the mail application. I'm running WP10 10.0.10586.0 (I would love to update to .29 but my device is affected by the known issue of the device failing to recognize the update is available). Device is
 a 950 XL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I've tried a soft reset. No I have not done a hard reset, nor do I wish to; I'd like to actually solve the problem, not avoid it. I have also tried removing and re-loading the mail account as well as the certificates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes our mail system is configured properly for certificate authentication. We have just over 1800 other devices - iOS, Android, and WP8.1 - all synchronizing just fine with Exchange via the same route and using the same PKI to deliver and manage certificates.
 This is our first WP10 device that we're trying to get working so my assumption is the issue has to do with the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>

            Could you do me a favour and use a Wi-Fi access point which captures the data traffic, or a Wi-Fi-access point attached to an Ethernet switch with port mirroring capabilities. Then, you are able to feed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Wireshark</a>&nbsp;and
 monitor the TLS connection. Sounds like your issue happens on the TLS layer, rather than on the EAS layer. Furthermore, did you ask the&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/bb291006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet Community</a>&nbsp;as well already?
 Just to increase the visibility of this issue to experts in that field.

            <p>Thanks Abi for the reply. I hadn't yet inquired of TechNet. As it so happens after updating to the .29 build of Windows 10 Phone the issue seems to have subsided. I also noted that I had to deliver all of the certificates in the trust chain for our CA in
 order for the certificate itself to be recognized as valid. I'd discovered that fact regarding the trust chain prior to updating to .29 so I don't think that was the ultimate solution.</p>

<h2>            Where is the SDK&#63;  Where&#39;s the dev team&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A lot of good ideas for applications have been posted here, especially HMAC TOTP and media control tiles for the band.&nbsp; I'd also like to see about finding/building a capacitive heart rate monitor chest strap that works with the band and/or phone app, to
 work around the craptastic heart rate monitor on the band.&nbsp; It would be a lot easier to do all that with an SDK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I wouldn't mind some channel where we could get a dev platform model of the band so we can do stuff like adding batteries and adding a standard USB port so we don't have to pay the $20 proprietary device connector tax and have to carry ANOTHER cable
 around when I travel.</p>

</p><p>I've seen several review sites say that they were told an SDK should be out in January, but I can't find it documented that MS ever said or committed to that - can't hold anyone to rumors about them from someone else.&nbsp; I have found people claiming to be
 in Health say they're working "day and night" to deliver an SDK... since November (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/healthblog/archive/2014/10/28/microsoft-health-microsoft-band-new-insights-on-health-and-wellness.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/healthblog/archive/2014/10/28/microsoft-health-microsoft-band-new-insights-on-health-and-wellness.aspx</a>).</p>

<p>I hate to necro a 30 day old post, but that couldn't be further from the truth. &nbsp;Heart rate monitoring accuracy suffers, and a store employee tried their best to explain to me why:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, to preserve battery life, the device checks for Heart Rate over a set interval and averages the reading. &nbsp;This, coupled with the inaccuracies of light based Heart Rate monitoring in the first place, means that it was never going to be 100% accurate.</p>

    <title>Problem installing DivX codec on Nokia 500 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem installing DivX codec on Nokia 500</h2>
                    
<p>I have a nokia 500. I'm trying to install DivX codec to play HD Video files. But when I install DivX player, I can't go to main menu. The main menu turns down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have anyone tried installing DivX codec or any other codec on nokia 500 to play HD Videos? Please help me. Please tell me which codec or player is fully supported by Nokia 500. I've searched a lot about players and codecs on nokia 500. But nothing found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to play High Quality AVI, MP4, MPG and FLV files. Please suggest me any player that supported by nokia 500.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm using the latest Belle Refresh(111.021.0028) on my nokia 500.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Is there any video player available for nokia 500 that can play HD video formats without converting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see galaxy y also doesn't have any gpu. It can play HD videos directly with RealPlayer. Is there any player for our symbian belle which can be supported in nokia 500?</p>

<h2>            Fill series using formula that has external reference to another workbook</h2>
                    <p>I have a workbook that has a function that references another workbook cell value.&nbsp; when I try to use the fill function it only copies the same formula down instead of doing it in a series.&nbsp; I've confirmed that automatic is selected in the formula section
 of the options menu.&nbsp; I've tried using the first 2 or 3 cells so excel can see the pattern to fill but it still just copies the those same formulas.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the formula I am currently using </p>
<p>='[Boston.xls]Jan ''16'!$B$6</p>
<p>if I was to fill down the next cell should have this </p>
<p>='[Boston.xls]Jan ''16'!$B$7</p>
<p>if I was to fill to the right the next cell should have this</p>
<p>='[Boston.xls]Jan ''16'!$C$6</p>

            <p>There was a loophole in the past.</p>
<p>But since the release of the A.U branche to the public (14393 builds) Microsoft changed the program</p>
<p>So the unsupported phones cannot get any insider or public windows 10 mobile builds.</p>

            <p>Access is a database development platform. It has several components. There is a form and report generator, 2 programming platforms and a database engine. If you have a vb.Net application the ONLY thing that concerns you is the database engine. As long as
 you keep the files in the same MDB format there is nothing you need to change. If you convert the back end to accdb, then you may have issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are loads of differences between 2000 and 2013, you are talking at least 5 versions changes in between. But the main difference that appears to concern you is there have been changes in datatypes. This site might help you:</p>

<h2>            Could someone steal my fingerprint if I used Windows Hello&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to use Windows Hello with a fingerprint reader, but I have some concerns?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to steal my fingerprint if I used Windows Hello?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I have read, my fingerprint will just be a bunch of 1's and 0's on&nbsp;the computer&nbsp;that a hacker could steal.</p>

            <span>Hi Gage,</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on your information, be informed&nbsp;you can use Windows Hello,&nbsp;it is not possible to steal one another’s fingerprint. The Windows operating system is very secure, but the Windows Defender definitions tend to be out of date, so I recommend you to
 update Windows defender. Windows 10 is subject recent vulnerabilities that were found in commercial versions of Windows currently on the market, so make sure you install all the latest Windows Updates (which Windows 10 automatically does).</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Account Settings states &#34; Invalid Date of Birth &#34; when updating Timezone and State, even though DOB is prepopulated as the correct DOB</h2>
                    <p>I have not found a damn answer for this and Microsoft Support are hopeless. This is a website issue that is occurring and not something that I think can be fixed, or a "USER ERROR"</p>
<p>
</p><p>DOES anyone have a suggestion or something that could shed some light on this matter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the original transcript to show how Microsoft Support did not in anyway address my concerns correctly and understand that this is most likely a site error rather than a user error.

<p>You can reset the ExecutionPolicy to Default afterwards:</p>

</p><p>Based on RogerW2's link, check that you are still in Fast Ring after running the script. You also have to restart after running the reset script.</p>

            Are you saying they disappear from your device or from Outlook on your PC?<br />
<br />
Do you have a SIM card in your device?&nbsp; If so, are contacts stored on the SIM card or in Contacts on your device?

    <title>Setting up Office 365 for student accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brent - bcps  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting up Office 365 for student accounts</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I work for a K-12 school system and manage the Office 365 and local on premises Active Directory.&nbsp; We started using Office 365 two years ago for faculty and staff only.&nbsp; However, I am currently looking into expanding it to student accounts also.&nbsp; I am trying
 to come up with a best way of adding student accounts but also keep them so they are a little separate from the employee accounts.&nbsp; To give a little background of how we are currently setup.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<ul>
<li>We currently do not create student accounts in our on-prem AD, only employee accounts are created.&nbsp; All students use a generic account such as “student” to log into the schools computers at this time</li><li>We run a local on premises Active Directory on the schools network so all accounts are created locally in the on-prem AD and synced with Office 365 using the Azure AD Connect sync tool</li><li>We have a public domain such as “school.org”.&nbsp;</li><li>Our on-prem AD domain is “ad.school.org”.&nbsp; The AD domain “ad.schoold.org” is not accessible outside of our network.&nbsp;</li><li>Our AD user accounts are the last name and first letter of first name, such as John Smith’s username is “smithj” and the email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</li><li>Our computers join to the local on-prem AD and have accounts like “Computer1.ad.school.org”</li><li>So our “ad.school.org” on-prem AD syncs to the cloud via Azure AD Connect to our “school.org” 
<div>
<p>
</p><p>We want to be able to distinguish student accounts and so student accounts do not take possible employee usernames.&nbsp; For example if there was an employee John Smith and a student John Smith, we want the employee to have the username smithj but want the students
 to be different so you can tell it is a student and not an employee.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have thought about adding .stu or .student at the end of the user name of the students so the student John Smith would be smithj.stu (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) or smithj.student (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***).</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I wanted to get an idea of what other education organizations are possibly doing.&nbsp; Do you have any suggestions or links to resources about this?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Thanks,<br />
Brent</div>

<p>Hello Leo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information and I figured there was no defined rule on how it was to be setup and it was dependent on each organization but was just seeing if I could get an idea of how other organizations may have handled this to see if it was an easier
 way to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another question I have is if it is possible to auto assign Outlook Web App Policies to user accounts?&nbsp; For example if I create a security group in our local on-prem Active Directory and assign the students to it and when the accounts are synced via Azure
 AD Connect and I active their account in Office 365 can a certain Outlook Web App Policy be assigned to them based on if they are a member of a certain security group?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brent</p>

            <p>I just got it to successfully install.&nbsp; In my case, it was Malwarebytes, which I understand is a known issue with the Preview Edition.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventhough I had it disabled/not run automatically, it still wouldn't install 14946. I uninstalled it completely this morning before heading to church.&nbsp; When I got back, I saw the upgrade to 14946 was completed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I tried to reinstall Malwarebytes (it is a paid subscription), it BSOD's the system in mwac.sys, which is what I have read is the issue (something to do with their rootkit feature).&nbsp; MWB isn't going to address it yet, since as they said, "you
 decided to beta test/preview software so you shouldn't be surprise when issues pop-up - that is the purpose of the preview release" and I can't blame them.&nbsp; Another software package I use also had conflicts with one of the earlier preview releases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I feel naked.&nbsp; When I do torrents, MWB is frequently popping-up saying it blocked malicious sites.&nbsp; Trying to decide if I should go back to non-Preview or wait to see if MS or MWB address the problem.</p>

<h2>            MS Office Home &#38; student 2007 product key not working</h2>
                    <p><span>After running system recovery on my Compaq CQ61 laptop, bought in Dec 2009, I was prompted to enter my MS Office Home &amp; student 2007&nbsp;product key which is on a sticker on the underside.
 I entered the p/key and it told me the number was incorrect so I checked it and double-checked it and it still told me it was incorrect. The number on the sticker is very clear and the number was entered accurately on the screen.
</span></p>
<p><span>Please tell me what I am doing wrong and what I should do to get my product key to work.&nbsp; Kind regards.&nbsp; David Barcham. United Kingdom.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Palcouk.</p>
<p>Thanks for your response to my enquiry about product key for Office2007.</p>
<p>You were absolutely right.</p>
<p>I was using the wrong key. I found the correct one on the inside of the CD case of the Office2007 CD.</p>
<p>The software installed and the problem is solved.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>Kind regards.</p>

            <p>The sticker on the underside of the laptop is the win key, not the Office key. (Unless the label specifically states its the Office Key - which would be unusual)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Office 2007, a full version, was supplied preinstalled by Compaq, then that maker would have provided the Key, usually on separate paperwork supplied with the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only Compaq can provide that Key, and not MS support</p>

<p>I have Onenote installed on my desktop and surface book and I've been having this issue for a while and I'm not sure how to fix it. A page syncs with everything I have ever written inside of it no matter how long ago it was. Hopefully I can clearly explain
 this. The letters that are thicker was a list I made (using the onenote app on the surface) of the things I need to do at work. When I finished, I
<strong>deleted</strong> them and made a second list using a thinner stroke. When I went home and opened the OneNote desktop app I saw that they were overlapped. I went back and opened the OneNote on my surface book and saw that the page had synced the same
 way. Not the first time this has happened. Please help. The picture is of the Onenote app on my surface.</p>
