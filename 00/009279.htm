    <title>Hotmail account got hacked, hacker changed password and even changed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hotmail account got hacked, hacker changed password and even changed the security question to another language. Pls help</h2>
                    Hello all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a 10 year old Hotmail account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** which got hacked back in mid 2008. The hacker changed my password, and when I wanted to reset it by answering the secret question, I noticed that they even changed the secret question from 'The name of your
 first pet' into a turkish phrase which I translated into "Your mother's maiden name". The recovery procedure requested me to produce the contents of the latest email, but it failed too.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently I went to&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/password/reset</a>&nbsp;to reset the password for that email account, but this is the answer I received:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"<span style="color: rgba(200, 83, 5, 1)">The Microsoft account is incorrect. Please try again."</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had my Paypal details and resume related emails back on that account, who knows what shenanigans those hackers can do with my information.</div>
                </div>

    <title>Conditional format problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcus coates  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional format problem</h2>
                    Hi I am trying to use the greater than or equal to function to highlight a cell when it's value is greater than another cell. However when I perform this operation the cells I apply the rule to all highlight. Even empty cells. Only when a value is present
 that is less than the conditional format value does the cell become in highlighted. I have already successfully applied less than or equal to formatting to other cells without a problem so why won't it work?

            Hi, If you have applied conditional formatting by creating a New Rule, then, it should work normally. And avoid creating conflicts, like creating a rule with &gt;= and also by creating &lt;=, where " = " will have to follow only one of the rule applied.<br />
<br />
Check out for the existing rules under "Manage Rules" dialog box.<br />

            Assuming your data is present in range B2:B10, and has to be conditionally formatted based on the cell value in C1, then,
<br />
While applying First rule(Greater than condition)<br />
<br />
1. Select Range B2:B10, choose Conditional Formatting(Alt+H+L+N) New Rule dialog box launches<br />
2. Choose Format only cells that contain "Cell value &gt; C1", Apply the Format.<br />
<br />
Note: While applying Second rule(Less than or Equal to)<br />
<br />
If you have blank cells in the selected range(ex:B2:B10) then it would treat as 0, and would be formatted with the respected, so use a Formula based conditional formatting, by checking the cell value along with blank cell checks.<br />
<br />
=IF(NOT(B2=""),IF(B2&lt;=$C$1,TRUE(),FALSE()),FALSE())<br />
<br />
Check formula based conditional formatting.<br />

            Hi Shotgun365<br />
<br />
Try this ...<br />
<br />
=--(A1&gt;=$B$1)<br />
<br />
Select the range on which you want to apply conditional formatting and enter the above formula as condition.<br />
<br />
An empty cell is validated as "0" and the unity operator "--" converts false/true to 0/1<br />

            <p>With respect, there is no need to use IF in most CF formulas; you just need a formula that evaluated to True or False.
</p>
<p>Your =IF(NOT(B2=""),IF(B2&lt;=$C$1,TRUE(),FALSE()),FALSE())<br />
could be coded as =AND(NOT(ISBLANK(B2)), B2&lt;=$C$1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW: TRUE and FALSE need no parameters unless you want Lotus-123 compatibility</p>
<p>Sorry for being such a smarty-pants today!</p>

<blockquote>Why would you need a CF formula to evaluate to 0/1 when FALSE/TRUE is what is expected?</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good question!!! I don't know. The OPS said that the empty cells were also marked and my trial showed this also. I could resolve it by using the "--" but I cannot reproduce it anymore. :)</p>

            Hello BRUCE
<br />
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft community.
<br />
<br />My name is Soraya F. and I am an independent consultant to help you solve this problem!
<br />
<br />There are other ways to try to fix this error in Outlook Search, follow the steps below:
<br />
<br />Step 1. If the Outlook Search tool is not working, the indexing records may be unconfigured or disconnected. To check and correct, click the "File" tab of the webmail program in the upper right corner;
<br />
<br />Step 2. The open menu will display information about the email accounts configured in the application. Select "Options" on the left side to open the Outlook settings;
<br />
<br />Step 3. The open window displays several configuration options for webmail. Select "Search" and then choose "Indexing Options" to access the parameters of the software search tool;
<br />
<br />Step 4. A window called "Indexing Options" will open. Select the Outlook program from the list of applications displayed and hit the "Modify" button to access the configured indexing parameters.
<br />
<br />Step 5. A window called "Locations Indexed" will open, displaying the locations where the search processes are performed. Make sure that the "Microsoft Outlook" checkbox is checked and confirm the setting under "Ok";
<br />
<br />Step 6. If your Outlook search is still not working, you have to rebuild the search indexing process. To do this, in the "Indexing Options" window, select the "Advanced" option.
<br />
<br />Step 7. In the "Advanced Options" window, press the "Recreate" button to start the index restoration of the program's search system;
<br />
<br />Step 8. Confirm the operation by clicking on "Ok" in the notification window that will appear and wait for the process of restoring the search indexes of Outlook;
<br />
<br />Step 9. If the search tool remains inoperative, click on the "File" tab and select the "Office Account" option. If you see the "Account Error" option, click on "Correct me". If the problem persists, select "Office Update";
<br />
<br />Step 10. Make sure your PC is connected to the Internet and force an Outlook update by selecting the "Update Now" option from the menu on the right;
<br />
<br />Outlook Updates and Repairs
<br />
<br />Step 1. If the internal Outlook settings options have not solved the problem with the search system, you will need to repair the program or the Microsoft Office suite. Open the Windows Control Panel and select "Programs and Features" in the lower right corner;
<br />
<br />Step 2. Click the "Microsoft Office" checkbox, click "Change" at the top of the screen. You can also access this setting by right-clicking on "Microsoft Office" and then choosing "Change" from the menu that appears to access the suite's repair menu;
<br />
<br />Step 3. A window with two Microsoft Office restore options will be displayed. Select "Quick Repair" to do a quick reconfiguration of the programs and correct errors by rearranging the search indexes in the original form. Start the operation by clicking "Repair";
<br />
<br />Step 4. If Outlook Search is still defective, return to the Microsoft Office restore options and select "Online Repair." This option will initiate the correction of all the problems and disambiguation of the programs, downloading the original settings in the internet. Start the restore by pressing "Repair";
<br />
<br />Step 5. If the problem with the Outlook search feature continues, return to "Programs and Features" in the Control Panel, and then right-click "Microsoft Office." Then select "Uninstall";
<br />
<br />Step 6. Be sure to save all documents and quit all program operations in the Microsoft Office package before you confirm the uninstallation. Then, reinstall the suite to restore all the original applications registry settings;
<br />
<br />I hope I have been useful!
<br />
<br />It would be very important for our community to know if the answer was helpful to solve your problem!
<br />
<br />Soraya F.

    <title>Outlook 2016 missing emails in Subfolder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 missing emails in Subfolder</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This were a few posts regarding this however nothing that explains why this keeps happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I move emails from Outlook 2016 Desktop Version to a 'Subfolder', the email does not show - disappears, although a search in that folder would reveal the email. But once you click off the side, it disappears again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if I go to Outlook Web Access Mail, the email is there - I'm subscribed to Outlook Exchange Server Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does it not show in Outlook 2016 Desktop Version? And what is a permeant fix. Currently I have to recreate a new folder and drag them from the original folder - then it shows in both Webmail and Outlook Desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to anyone</p>

</p><p>Live Photo Gallery is part of Microsoft's free Windows Essentials. My version is Windows Photo Gallery 2012 Build 16.4.3528.331. I like it for simple editing - cropping, brightening shadows, and straightening images. Dragging and dropping into a Word 2013
 docx file is very convenient, as opposed to using Word's "Insert Picture."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just can't understand why drag &amp; drop no longer works. I believe it DOES work in Word 2016, so maybe Microsoft wants me to upgrade?</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 &#38; Excel 2016 refuse to start</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know if a Windows update has broken core libraries?</p>
<p>Both Word 2016 &amp; Excel 2016 refuse to start. &nbsp;I have also tried starting them in safe mode but to no avail.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled using the how tos to completely remove etc. and have also uninstalled other items such as Evernote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed LibreOffice and that doesn't start either. &nbsp;That leads me to suspect that a dll or something has been updated in a Windows update process and is corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent the last 5 hours trying to fix this and so am wondering if anyone else has had such an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't reply recommending reinstallation or restarting Windows - I have tried it all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for sensible suggestions,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neil.</p>

            <p>Hi .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am withdrawing my previous 'answer'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that it was not Evernote at fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Evernote completely and still ended up losing the ability to start Word and LibreOffice writer. &nbsp;Wordpad wouldn't work either and in MS Office, especially Excel, hitting the File tab resulted in the application hanging.</p>
<p>So, how did I fix this?</p>
<p>Well, I uninstalled all of the printer software for the Canon. This included the driver and management software - the Quickmenu and so on.</p>
<p>I then ran Word, Excel and LO Writer to make sure they were ok. &nbsp;Word wanted to run in a 'repair' state, which didn't take more than a couple of seconds. &nbsp;I ran it again to make sure it still worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to the Canon UK/Ireland web site and downloaded the XPS and standard drivers - no management software this time.</p>
<p>I installed those - they need the printer to be attached by USB to do so.</p>
<p>Once installed, I printed &nbsp;test page and then spun up Word, Excel and LO Writer.</p>
<p>They all worked, and still do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately though, I still do not know the actual cause of the issue I was having. Maybe the driver provided by the Windows printer installer, or maybe a component of the Canon-provided management software? Possibilities, but no certainties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a good weekend,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neil.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As an aside, there is a problem, which I am coming to believe is Microshaft's scheme to force an upgrade to their intrusive Windows 10.&nbsp; When I say intrusive, I mean tracking all the activities of a user by attributing it to a Microshaft account, all the
 while eating up more computer resources for Microshaft's sole benefit.&nbsp; It is in the same vein as Microshaft's current Office product... You do not receive full functionality unless you are signed-in to a Microshaft account.&nbsp;

<p>I have completed all the above tasks, with no positive result.&nbsp; I still have the same problem.&nbsp; Further, I do not see any errors being generated by Internet Exploder 11.&nbsp; It solely displays a blank window for about 1 minute, then terminates, closing a blank
 window.&nbsp; Personally, I could care less about Internet Exploder 11, but this is for someone else and their needs.&nbsp; Thus, I am grinding my time away attempting to remedy Microshaft's issues.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>1. In Cortana/Search Box, type <strong>Font</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>2. Download the font file and simply <strong>drag and drop</strong> the file to the Fonts folder, or you may simply
<strong>copy and paste</strong> the font file in the<strong> Fonts folder</strong> to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a7f935f-0c34-48cb-9274-6ee14fdcdf11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a7f935f-0c34-48cb-9274-6ee14fdcdf11" /></a></p>

    <title>E90 on 3&#58; Sim Card Registration Failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> helenst---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            E90 on 3&#58; Sim Card Registration Failed</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using my Nokia E90 Communicator with a 3 sim for over a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of weeks back I noticed the phone hadn't been getting any signal for a couple of days. I restarted it and got the message "Sim Registration Failed". I tried restarting the phone a few more times and got the same message every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried swapping sims with my partner, who has a Nokia E51. My sim worked fine in his phone, and his sim worked fine in mine. We stayed swapped for about a week, then swapped back. It seemed OK again for a couple of days but then reverted to the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried cleaning the phone and sim contacts, pushing a piece of paper behind the sim (to ensure proper contact), and have just upgraded to the latest firmware version. It still doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody know why my phone and sim would suddenly start doing this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Helen</p>

<p>is the e90 a 3 phone i doubt it very much</p>
<p>was the phone bought from a genuine retailer or of a 3rd party site</p>
<p>is the other phone a 3 phone</p>
<p>this could mean a few things one is the the phone depending on the purchase it could have been reported stolen</p>
<p>the other matter is 3 themselves they have some rule in place where you can only use there sims in there own branded phones did you meet there terms and conditions on whichever plan your on also you could call them it may be just a network issue or the actuall
 sim card could be faulty</p>

<p>No, neither phone is a 3 phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that 3 were willing to sell me a sim (no phone) I don't see that they should have a problem with me using the phone of my choice. In fact their terms say it can be used in an "unlocked 3G handset capable of accepting a 3 SIM." (I'm on PAYG)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the phone were reported stolen, I don't know why it would still work with Vodafone? Surely all networks would block it. I'm also not sure that the sim card is faulty, given that it worked in another phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm starting to think this might be a 3 problem, not Nokia... have spent a lot of time in 2G areas lately so maybe 3 have decided I'm using a 2G handset and blocked me. Maybe I'll try 3 forums instead... cheers.</p>

            Go to 3 and replace your sim card, sounds like a faulty sim. This problem is pretty common with SIM cards when they get a little old.

<h3> martin75  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen&#58; Bitlocker Recovery on Lumia 640 Lte with latest &#40;27.09.16&#41; Windows 10 Preview</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just did a restart after updating my Windows Phone. &nbsp;When it boots up, I get a blue screen telling me to insert an USB drive with my Bitlocker Recovery Key. &nbsp;After I do this, I should hit "Escape" or "Enter", both of which are impossible to do on this
 phone. &nbsp;It seems like the phone is rebooting in an endless loop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anything be done about this? Or is my phone ready for a factory reset? &nbsp;Or is it bricked?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Outlook Sharedbox - conversation settings</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a sharedbox (outlook) that I use with others. I have chosen in my settings "Show as Conversations" but it still does not show full conversations. It only shows the messages that are in the inbox and it does not show my (or others') sent messages in
 these same conversations. Is it possible to change these setting in order to be able to see all related messages in the inbox? How can I do that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Hi Kristina11233,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for my carelessness, I’ve just noticed that you means the Shared mailbox. I have taken a test, create a new shared mailbox, and wait for it taking into effective. For Shared mailbox, unlike the normal mailbox, there’s not option “show messages from
 other folders”:</p>

<h2>            ads.pubmatic.com weirdness</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I've got a doozy for you. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I've become pretty familiar with the "ads.pubmatic.com" malware, after what seems to be a persistent infection, but I've never seen anyone talking about what I'm experiencing with it, either. I'm not suffering any deleterious effects from it, it's just
 that periodically I'll get an unrequested pop-up window for a failed download of "pug from image2.pubmatic.com." It's always a failed download, but I can't find the download location to figure out what's up, and obviously I'm a little concerned about what,
 exactly, this means. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the thing though: all the usual virus scanning options are coming up all clear. Malwarebytes gives me zero infection, Avast initially found something but after deleting and rescanning (all clear now) I'm still getting the message. Hitmanpro doesn't
 find anything but tracking cookies, adwarecleaner and Junkware Removal Tool find nothing, nor does tdsskiller, and all of thse are newly updated. Even resetting my browser doesn't fix it! From what I can see, there's nothing infecting my computer, and yet
 I still get these occasional error messages- that don't disrupt any programs, they just come and then go- that make me wonder what's up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the heck do I do now?</p>

<p>Check the startup menu – see if there’s anything running in it that might be causing the popup.&nbsp; If so, disable it.</p>

<h3> davetqm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Follow button in ribbon is greyed out</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the "follow" button greyed out for documents that are "shared with me" in onedrive ribbon?
</p>
<p>It is strange, as I believe you can search for a document in 'search for everything' and THEN follow it. So there is a work around, but it takes a while longer as you need to search and then follow...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why cant we follow directly from the ribbon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note this applies to "old experience" view. There is no ribbon OR follow option in "new experience"</p>

<h3> sean in mi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Un-hide rows if cell value changes</h2>
                    <p>I have a range of rows (28:219). I want to hide Blank value rows until the value changes in column C. Column C cells are linked to another worksheet for value using a formula (='FCO Recap'!B38 &amp; so on). If user changes the value from a blank cell to any
 value on the second sheet "FCO Recap", it appears on the 1st sheet "Billing Worksheet"&nbsp;&amp; i need that row to un-hide.
</p>
<p>Here is what i have so far but it only works if i run it manually:</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_Calculate()<br />
Dim LastRow As Long, c As Range<br />
<br />
ActiveSheet.Unprotect PassWord:="password"<br />
<br />
Application.EnableEvents = False<br />
LastRow = Cells(Cells.Rows.Count, "c").End(xlUp).Row<br />

            <p>Hello Sean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the code below. I&nbsp;have assumed&nbsp;that you have the code in module for Worksheet "Billing Worksheet" and that is the sheet where rows are hidden and unhidden and that you are changing values in Worksheet "FCO Recap". If this is not correct then please get
 back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of points to note. If you are changing the values on FCO Recap then that is the active sheet. The code is making changes to Billing Worksheet. Me is the generic object for the worksheet to which the code module belongs and I have included it in
 the code otherwise Excel can be referencing the incorrect worksheet. I have also included code to provide a message if the code fails otherwise the user will never know that an error has occurred with the use of On Error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed your line of code "c.Activate". Apart from the code being incorrect because the worksheet is not the ActiveSheet and therefore the cell cannot be&nbsp;activated, there is no reason to select every cell in the loop. If you want the code to select
 the appropriate cell in Billing worksheet that matches the one that was changed on FCO Recap then a different approach is required and capture the worksheet change on FCO Recap instead of the Calculate event on Billing worksheet. If you want this then please
 get back to me.</p>

            <p>Hi Sean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that what Gord has said is probably the problem. However, note that I have edited a line of code in my answer (would not have stopped the code working but you were finding the last used cell and I also did this but then didn't use it in the example
 code).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't get it working, if you upload a copy of the workbook to OneDrive then I will have a look at it for you. If you have sensitive data that you do not wish to share then make a copy of the workbook and replace the sensitive data with dummy data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guidelines to upload a workbook on OneDrive. (If you already use OneDrive and your process for saving to it is different then you can probably start at step 8 to get the link but please zip the file before uploading)</p>
<ol>
<li>Zip your workbooks. Do not just save to OneDrive because the workbooks open with On-Line Excel and the limited functionality with the On-Line version causes problems.
</li><li>To Zip a file: In Windows Explorer Right click on the selected file and select Send to -&gt; Compressed (zipped) folder.)
</li><li>Do not use 3rd party compression applications because I cannot unzip them. I do not clog up my computer with 3rd party apps when there are perfectly good apps supplied with windows.</li><li>Go to this link.&nbsp; https://onedrive.live.com</li><li>Use the same login Id and Password that you use for this forum.</li><li>Select Upload in the blue bar across the top and browse to the zipped folder to be uploaded.</li><li>Select Open (or just double click). (Be patient and give it time to display the file after initially seeing the popup indicating it is done.)</li><li>Right click the file on OneDrive and select Share.</li><li>Do NOT fill in the form; Select "Get a Link" on the left side.</li><li>Click the button "Create a Link"</li><li>Click in the box where the link is created and it will highlight.</li><li>Copy the link and paste into your reply on this forum.</li></ol>

<p>Thank you for the article, however none of the user actions make any difference. Everytime I send an email from non outlook.com address OUTLOOK.COM responds with the 550 error, mailbox not available. Sometimes the email appears then appears in my friends
 mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no problem if the email is sent from my outlook.com account</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand it Microsoft are the Admins for outlook.com, canyou please look into the real problem, i.e. outlook.com generating error messages, and not mapping a hotmail.com email address correctly to an outlook.com mailbox when the email is sent from
 a non outlook.com address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not keep telling me to refer this to mail admins etc, because that is Microsoft not us.</p>

</p><p>Microsoft already provided an article on how you can sort things out. Have you even tried contacting your email provider and ask them if they can do something about this?? cause there were no issues in receiving email with the outlook server. this must be
 an issue with your email server since your the only one sending email to an Outlook.com/Hotmail.com server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also check this link: ht<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-didn-t-receive-an-email-someone-sent-to-my-Outlook-com-account-d39e3341-8d79-4bf1-b3c7-ded602233642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">tps://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-didn-t-receive-an-email-someone-sent-to-my-Outlook-com-account-d39e3341-8d79-4bf1-b3c7-ded602233642</a>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>There is nothing wrong with my email service provider with respect to Hotmail, nor with google-mail with respect to sending emails hotmail, nor any other email service I have tried. All work fine except with one email address. My friend who looks after the
 group emails also has a problem sending to this email address from both group email address and her private email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried by using reply, using the entry from my contacts list, re-typing the email address exactly as it should be and guess what it makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked by Hover.com and Google Mail, they do not report any errors with email, nor are they reporting any problems with Hotmail addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent an email to another Hotmail address without any problem, I can send to Outlook.com email addresses no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only one that has a problem is this "one email address".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message is different to the one you receive if the mailbox does not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does outlook.com put outlook in front of the mailbox name i.e. outlook&lt;emailaddress&gt;, that suggests either either the mail box exist in the mapping but the email cannot be delivered for whatever reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I send to an invalid mailbox I get a very simple message back not the detailed as below:<br />
</p>
<p><span><span>COL004-MC3F33.hotmail.com gave this error:<br />
Remote server returned unknown recipient or mailbox unavailable -&gt; 550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>or</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>SNT004-MC10F19.hotmail.com gave this error:<br />

<p><strong><span>BAY004-MC1F57.hotmail.com gave this error:<br />
Remote server returned unknown recipient or mailbox unavailable -&gt; 550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>refers to&nbsp;outlook&lt;emailaddress&gt; i.e. *** Email address is removed for privacy *** ;for email address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - where is this generated, it's not from my mail server or my email application, and appears when ever I send an email to this mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com does not recognise the email address, even when it is correct, then after sending the error message it may (sometimes it sometimes not) actually deliver the email, the suggestion the fault must be my mail server seems not to add up here. If it
 was my mail server then the email could not somehow appear in the web-mail outlook.com window could it?<br />
</p>
<p>I have check in the community and there does seem to be a problem with receiving Hotmail.com emails, telling me the problem is with my service provider is not true.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem cannot be solved then I will recommend deleting the the Hotmail account and creating a new account with an alternative email supplier as the problem is associated with outlook.com NOT external mail services as you seem to claim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I should just give up and tell my friend to find an alternative email provider.</p>

    <title>Excel V15.39 Text Upside Down - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel V15.39 Text Upside Down</h2>
                    <p>Since updating Microsoft Excel for Mac to version 15.39 (170919), when I open any excel file the text is upside down. It automatically corrects it self upon scrolling the current data out of view. I have a MacBookPro13,3 running MacOS 10.13 (17A362a).</p>
