<h2>            How to add custom ringtone without connecting to PC</h2>
                    Is there a way to add custom ringtones without connecting to PC?&nbsp;
<div>If not (wich is most likely) then windows has screwed up big time with the OS. This is so silly that I can not make a song as my ringtone on the fly.

    <title>How can I get rid of the 100 recipients per mail and 300 mails a day - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get rid of the 100 recipients per mail and 300 mails a day limitation&#63; How to send more than 300 emails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm a content user of Microsoft Office 365 Home on Windows 8.1, but everytimes when I try to send emails to almost every contact, I get big troubles losing one whole working day.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I was told that i cannot send one mail to more than 100 receipients and not more than 300 mails a day. Most of the time this is sufficient for me, but sometimes I need more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of giving me thousands of Error message boxes. I suggest Microsoft the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>My favorite: Giving me more freedom and confidence. It would be worth some money for me. Consider me inviting all my contacts to my marriage or a burial or provide them with important and sometimes urgent information.</li><li>My computer can count to 100 and even 300 :-). Please test my sendmail order before Outlook begins to send and warn me only once and ask me for affirmation before this "abnormal and suspicious acrivity" on my account is being processed instead of breaking
 the job at an undefined position and warning me a thousand times and blocking my account. Microsoft could introduce a security question in these cases before starting the job instead of afterwards.<br />
</li><li>Outlook does the job, for example a merge mail in cooperation with Word, until its limit is reached, but instead of making further work very difficult keeping the surplus mails in the outbox or another folder for sending them the next day(s).</li><li>You recommend me another solution.</li></ol>

            <p>Ok, friends, this solution is rather simple.&nbsp; The phrase for this issue or "feature", if you will, is:</p>
<p>"Show Windows Version on The Desktop".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, we are desiring the opposite of this function.</p>
<p>Here are 2 possible locations where this can be modified (currently).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since part of being in the Windows Insider&nbsp;Preview program is acknowledging you are familiar with Windows, I'm not going to hold any hands on common Windows terms or usage.&nbsp; That said, shall we?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Location 1]</p>
<p>Open Regedit</p>
<p>Navigate to: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop</p>
<p>Double click on <strong>PaintDesktopVersion</strong></p>
<p>Change the value&nbsp;from 1 to 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Location 2]</p>
<p>Open Regedit</p>
<p>Navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows</p>
<p>Double click on <strong>DisplayVersion</strong></p>
<p>Change the value&nbsp;from 1 to 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Reboot for this to take effect</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>*Update 15025 - </strong>Both locations have been nix'd</p>

I want to update it with the latest version which is 5.0706.4.0.1.<br />
Please tell me whether the softwares that had come originally with the phone but stored in the Memory card(ex. Opera, PTT, Symantec etc.), will also come with the new version of firmware or i will lose them?<br />
Also, can i update the firmware having the memory card inserted?<br />
<br />

            If you want to upadate your N72, first of all do a backup using PCSuite and/or the backup function in the Memory Card menu.<br />
<br />
Then preform the upate.<br />
Then restore your contacts/settings from the backup you made.<br />
<br />
I have done that and every app that I had installed was working just fine!

<h3> dc-kronos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio 2013 &#47; 2016 Slow Zoom Blur &#47; Rendering Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love Visio. I have used it since before microsoft purchased it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, there is a MAJOR PROBLEM with Visio 2013 and 2016. That problem is the zoom in/zoom out "blur."</p>
<p>When zooming in and out - the drawing temporarily goes blurry and then refocuses what seems like a few seconds later. It appears there is now a "variable zoom in" instead of 20-30 "fixed" zoom perspectives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem does NOT exist in 2010, which I've been using for 5-6 years now. I own 2010 and 2013, and I stopped using 2013 because Microsoft will not acknowledge / fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is now present in 2016. &nbsp;This is absolutely horrible. I would like to use alot of the new features from 2016, and even 2013 but I cannot because once you really get into a drawing - having a few thousand lines / text objects / etc on the drawing
 - you can't zoom in and out without waiting at least 3-7 seconds while the graphics of the ENTIRE page are "re-rendered"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why will you not address that this is a serious issue Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When will you fix this problem and enable any of us who use Visio in a business method to purchase your new product versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please please please fix this. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-Kronos</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. My machine is a gen5 intel 3.4, 24gigs of ram, SSD drives, and very very top of the line nVidia graphics cards.</p>
<p>This problem has also been posted at least 30 other times all over the web and existence.</p>

            <p>Could not Agree More!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded from 2013 Visio to 2016 Pro at MS Tech Support &nbsp;Suggestion as he told me 2016 addressed the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well it has not!&nbsp; Now MS wants $499.99 to trouble shoot which I will&nbsp; not pay.&nbsp; Customer Support is rude and Arrogant in regards to this mater and will not allow to get support unless I fork over the $499.99.&nbsp; I was actually told if I did not want to pay
 for support I should&nbsp;NOT have purchased the Pro Addition which I have owned every version of since the programs inception and acquisition by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always believed MS to be better than this, but they could care less!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is being monitored by MS, I respectfully urge you to correct this issue, you have been paid good money for it and the others I have licensed as well and all you want is more money and my time to find a solution,&nbsp;<strong> THIS IS UNFAIR and UNPROFESSIONAL
 and BORDERS CRIMINAL!</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been using Visio since 1998,&nbsp; I know the work and software gets more complex, over the years of experience. I should be able to improve my drawing performance. I'm not because I wait for the rendering to responses every time I draw a line, between
 5 to 7 seconds. Even with a newer machine with the 64 bit&nbsp; version the rendering is improved just a bit but is still slow and annoying when working with thousands of lines. I agree with you; we did not have this issue in the 2010 version. I though with the
 newer computer, the rendering would have been instantaneous, forget it. I think with this computer configuration that has two six cores Xeon processor, total of 12 cores,&nbsp; of 2.4ghz-3.2ghz with two ECC 2400Mhz DDR4 chip memory for a total of 64 gigs with two
 Samsung SSD drive of 1T each, working with the Windows 10 Pros 64 bits OS, and the installed Visio version is the 2013 64 bits.&nbsp; I think with this computer configuration. It should be instantaneous; I should not have to address this issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the development teems should work on the basic part of the program, PERFORMANCE. Instead&nbsp; on&nbsp; adding new features that we will not be using because we spend our time waiting for the rendering to respond on each line we draw or each time we zoom in
 or out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping Microsoft will solve this issue soon.</p>

<p>Hello! In fact, the command line parameters are supported in the new Skype, but they are different from the old version (<a href="http://www.skaip.org/command-line-parameters-for-the-new-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">more info</a>).<br />
<br />
To start multiple accounts, use the following path for your shortcut:</p>
<p>"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft\Skype for Desktop\Skype.exe" --secondary --datapath="D:\Skype\your_login"</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for "auto-logon", specify different folders for "--datapath" and you will sign in automatically after first authorization (this works until you use "Sign Out" option).</p>

I have an Access query with Date/Time field that I export daily to Excel. The Date/Time has Date - time&nbsp;&nbsp;in millisecond. I tried to export with/without formatting and it is not working. Every custom format in Excel is also not working. I have to delete the

<h2>            Problem opening documents from Office 365 in Office 2013 applications</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a problem which is really starting to annoy me. I use SharePoint Team Sites in Office 365 to store documents. However, whenever I try to open&nbsp;Word or Excel documents&nbsp;from my desktop computer which runs Office 2013 I get multiple login prompts
 from Word/Excel. I enter my Office 365 credentials but am finally faced with an error message stating that the document can't be opened. I'm having no problem at all opening the very same documents using my laptop which runs Office 2010. Also, I get a message
 in Word/Excel 2013 under Account / Connected Services that there is a server problem so the online services cannot be displayed. My Office&nbsp;version is 15.0.4535.1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted this problem on the Office 365 support web but&nbsp;was referred here as&nbsp;they said it's most likely an Office problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone&nbsp;else experienced this problem and maybe found a solution for it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

<p>Hi EleFle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office Professional Plus 2019 is an Office suite for the Windows OS. This error occurs because you are trying to install a Windows application on your Mac. You would need an Office for Mac installer to install Office on MacOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office Professional Plus 2019 is a one-time purchase for Windows OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use Office apps on both Windows and Mac, you may consider using Office 365 instead of a one-time purchase on a specific OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference:</p>

<p>However when she checks in Outlook 2007 it is there in the sent items folder.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;think&nbsp;this matters since the issue is in OWA but 'Save copies in Sent items' in Outlook is selected.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2010 is not responding, even in safe mode</h2>
                    <p>I am running Office Professional 2010 on Windows 7. Excel is not responding. I suspect it's a recent add in. However, I cannot remove the add in, because even starting in safe mode, as soon as I do anything it stops responding. I do not know what to do next.</p>
<p>I tried to Fixit program, and got a message that it did not work on this operating system. I found an article saying to go to the control panel install section, and select "repair", but that is not shown as an option. What next?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community. As per your description you are having tough time with accessing Excel 2010. Let me help you with the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have stated that you are unable to find the repair option, you need to right click on Office Professional 2010 in the control panel and click on
<strong>change</strong>, now you would see the option for <strong>repair</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to troubleshoot the issue related to Excel, try the steps in the link below and check it helps:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2671569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2671569</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However if you are not able to find the repair option even after clicking on change then I would suspect that the Office installation might be corrupt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run the fix it from the link below to remove Office 2010:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301</font></a></p>
<p><font><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font>Ensure you have the installation media/product key before uninstalling Office 2010.
</font></li><li><font>If you have issues in running the<span style="font-weight: bold"> fix it</span></font> directly, you may save the file to the desktop and then run the fix it tool.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart the computer and reinstall Office 2010. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above link helps. If you need further assistance on this particular issue or any other Office related issues let us know and we will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            This is great thank you so much!!! do you know how I could modify it so it will extract the link if it is text? for example have it look for the text string "jama" and extract the whole hyperlink disguised as text?

            In the code above place a break point at the line
<br /><pre><code>If InStr(1, This.Hyperlinks(1).Address, "jama", vbTextCompare) &gt; 0 Then</code></pre>
<br />means place the cursor in that line and press F9. Then run the macro.
<br />
<br />If the code stops hover the mouse over "This.Hyperlinks(1).Address" and you'll see a tool tip that shows the address.
<br />You can also highlight "This.Hyperlinks(1)" in the code, then press Shift-F9 and click Ok to see the variable insight the Watch window. Explore the properties.
<br />
<br />Now you can press F8 and run the code line by line and see what happens. That's called debugging. A tutorial for beginners is here:

<br />This.Hyperlinks(1).Address contains the link, that is already a string, you can e.g. write it into column B same row:

<br /><pre><code>JamaCount = JamaCount + 1
This.Offset(,1).Value = This.Hyperlinks(1).Address</code></pre>

<h2>            Microsoft Office 365 error 30175-13</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS - X205T which is loaded with Office 365.&nbsp; After a recent Office update, I am now forced to restart my system then run the on-line repair from the Control Panel, which initiates a reinstall, every time I need to use the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand from other posts that the problem might be a registry error problem.&nbsp; It appears that Microsoft is aware of the problem.&nbsp; Will a "fix" update be issued soon?</p>

            Hi, KatieP22
<br />
<br />Try uninstalling and installing the new version of Skype, if this does not work, you can try to reinstall the classic version, which was extended until a new warning, I hope you can solve the problem.

<h2>            Is Mac OS X 10.7.5 compatible with Microsoft Project Professional</h2>
                    I downloaded Project Pro, when I try to open it I get a code that says "This program can not be run in DOS mode." Any ideas?

<p>Where I found to change the SD card to a USB Card reader drive, it is only a temporary fix. &nbsp;Everytime I need to look at my SD card, I have to go through all the steps again to be able to read it as a (g) USB drive. &nbsp;Once I pull the SD card or switch to
 another card, I have to repeat the steps all over again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a pain. &nbsp;Do I need to take off the Windows 10 and revert back to Windows 8? &nbsp;I have gotten use to Windows 10 and I think with all the genius in Windows and Microsoft, &nbsp;they should be able to fix this stupid problem.</p>

<h2>            Convert to PDF includes removed hyperlinks</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I frequently post a page to our Church website in PDF format.</p>
<p>I receive the page as a word document and remove all hyperlinks for email addresses, however after saving as PDF and posting to&nbsp;the website the hyperlinks have returned. I have overcome this by changing @ to at.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can maintain the format but not the link?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
<strong>This seems to be inherent in the conversion process, both using Save As and Microsoft Print to PDF.
</strong><br />
</p>
<p>I assume that the reason for this is the unsightly lines and color.&nbsp;<em>Instead, consider changing the Hyperlink and Followed Hyperlink styles to have automatic color and no underline.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>I'm afraid that does not solve the problem, changing style then saving as PDF still results in a link being active. I can only assume that the format of a email address is automatically turned into a hyperlink by conversion regardless of formatting. I know
 that Acrobat can remove hyperlinks but this is not available in reader. I am going to investigate using Nuance Power PDF can do what I require.</p>
<p>Thank you for your input.</p>

            Unfortunately, Outlook.com users have no control over the retention policy - its controlled by the email administrator.   If you think you need to keep mail longer, use the backspace key to archive instead of deleting.

<p>
</p><p>Since you mentioned you are using Live account, rather than Office 365 for Business account, I suggest you to contact outlook.com support to check if there is any way to achieve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>There isn't a subscription on the outlook.com side that supports changing it. </p>

<h2>            Save &#38; send as pdf not working normally</h2>
                    I use Excel 2010 and have been using it to send my documents as pdf.&nbsp; I select my print area and then save &amp; send&nbsp; as pdf and it would create the pdf document based on my print settings.&nbsp; And now it creates the pdf but does not take the print settings,
 so my pdf will be three pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not carry over the print changes to fit to one page.&nbsp; Why did this change and how do I get to work again?

    <title>I forgot my password but I dont want to change it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waleedel-safty  say:</h3>
<h2>            I forgot my password     but I dont want to change it</h2>
                    <p>why does Microsoft&nbsp; punish us&nbsp; if&nbsp; we&nbsp; forgot our passwords&nbsp; by forcing us to&nbsp; reset the password instead of just send us a reminder of the password to either&nbsp; our alternate email address or phone number ?<br />
everyone&nbsp; in the ENTIRE world&nbsp; have his /her own logic of passwords .&nbsp; for example&nbsp; one would like to&nbsp; have his password like this :</p>
<p>first letter of my dogs name + first letter of my cats favorite toy+the application name+my favorite ports club+ the year I voted for an idiot
</p>
<p>so my password for outlook&nbsp; would&nbsp; be&nbsp; "SBHotMailChicagoBalls2001" ,,,&nbsp; this&nbsp;&nbsp; password&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; good enough&nbsp;&nbsp; not to be cracked or guessed by anyone&nbsp; unless I&nbsp; am stupid enough to tell everyone my secret of&nbsp; how I remember&nbsp; my passwords &lt; it cannot be even
 hacked by social engineering , </p>
<p>and it&nbsp; is very very VEEERY normal&nbsp;&nbsp; in this day and age&nbsp; when every one on this planet have&nbsp;&nbsp; at least&nbsp; 150 different&nbsp; electronic password to remember,&nbsp; Hotmail.com, yahoo.com, gmail.com, xboxlive, live.com , my work email, my&nbsp; Facebook password , twitter
 , and GodKnowsWhat.Com site that I may&nbsp; want also to remember a password for ,&nbsp;&nbsp; so any person with an iota of brain would iether&nbsp; create his own logic of how to remember&nbsp; all those passwords&nbsp; based&nbsp; on what site he is using , or be dumb enough to have&nbsp; all
 the 150= password of all those services&nbsp; to be identical which is more stupid than stupid itself and with all those different password to remember it is&nbsp; very possible to forget one of those passwords ,
</p>
<p>when this happens in Microsoft&nbsp; then&nbsp; you have&nbsp;&nbsp; started&nbsp; your&nbsp; punishment treatment&nbsp; where&nbsp; Microsoft&nbsp; must&nbsp; make your life a living ****
</p>
<p>where&nbsp;&nbsp; everything&nbsp;&nbsp; you have on Microsoft&nbsp; could be&nbsp; created&nbsp; with any&nbsp; email address&nbsp;&nbsp; , but&nbsp; they must all&nbsp; be the same one ( and you can never consolidate them into one email&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; log in to all your Microsoft services to name a few, hotmail, outlook&nbsp;
 xboxlive.com xbox.com live.com myspace.com microsoft.com visualstudio.com microsoftstore.com where everyone of those sites reqires you to sineup with your&nbsp; email of choice ,&nbsp; not with your preexisting email account with microzeft&nbsp;&nbsp; so&nbsp; you may&nbsp;&nbsp; be dumb enough
 to decide to use&nbsp; your gmail account&nbsp; as&nbsp; username , then&nbsp; realize&nbsp; that you can never linked it back to your other Microsoft accounts&nbsp; that used different emails , and after couple years&nbsp;&nbsp; strugling with this stupedness&nbsp; you find&nbsp; out&nbsp; that you manage to&nbsp;&nbsp;
 recreate&nbsp; new accounts&nbsp; on microsoft services&nbsp;&nbsp; and you ebnd up&nbsp; having&nbsp; 5 or 6 different logins&nbsp;&nbsp; to the same service just to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work with other accounts&nbsp;&nbsp; you get the problem of remember&nbsp; all the different passwords, and god forbids&nbsp; if&nbsp; you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 accidentally forgot&nbsp; your password when you are trying to access your email and you&nbsp; find out that Microsoft is so keen to protect you from your own stupidity and forces&nbsp; you to change the password&nbsp; on Hotmail &nbsp;&nbsp; then a month later&nbsp; you&nbsp; decide to log in to
 your xbox&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; you&nbsp;&nbsp; try to use&nbsp; the&nbsp; password&nbsp; you have in your mind&nbsp; for&nbsp; your gaming&nbsp; consul and&nbsp; find microsoft&nbsp;&nbsp; solving the problem with you once again&nbsp; by asking to&nbsp; create a new password &lt;&nbsp;&nbsp; but&nbsp;&nbsp; you cann never&nbsp; use a password&nbsp; you have used before
 &lt; just because microsoft&nbsp;&nbsp; insists of protecting you&nbsp; from your own stupidity)&nbsp; and you end up&nbsp;&nbsp; in a circle of trying to remember&nbsp; what the&nbsp; ****&nbsp; was&nbsp; the last&nbsp; new logic&nbsp; you used&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; **** access&nbsp; your account &lt; and instead of&nbsp; just&nbsp;&nbsp; remember the
 simple logic&nbsp; you have in your&nbsp; stupid brain for&nbsp; your&nbsp; password management you have to wast&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 hours and make sure&nbsp; you have your alternative email account available handy and your phone&nbsp; and&nbsp; be ready to change the password every time you&nbsp; want to freaking
 access any Microsoft service <br />
<br />
&nbsp; so please Microsoft, STOP protecting me&nbsp; from my own stupidity of insisting to&nbsp; recreate a password that is easy for me to remember without&nbsp; the need to carry&nbsp; a note in my pocket &nbsp; with all my passwords&nbsp; written down handy to any thief to read whenever my
 wallet is snatched in the subway </p>
