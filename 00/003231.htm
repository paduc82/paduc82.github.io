<h2>            Hotmail contacts not visible in Outlook app after conversion</h2>
                    Today I was forced to upgrade from Hotmail to Outlook on my Android phone. In the earlier Hotmail app I had all contacts but they are completely lost in the Outlook app. I can still see my contacts in the&nbsp;Outlook web on my computer but in the Outlook app
 on my phone they are lost. Why do Outlook web / app versions show different contact lists? Have I missed something? The only contacts I see in my Outlook app are two persons from my phone book but I am not interested in the contacts on my phone book. I want
 my old Hotmail contact list. Please help!

            I found the solution myself even if I am not 100% pleased with the side effects. I just used the function to synchronize the contacts that is available in the app. Then I got my old Hotmail contacts visible in the Outlook app. But at the same time&nbsp;these
 Hotmail contacts were also added to the&nbsp;contacts on my phone which is not what I&nbsp;wanted.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>The easiest way is to do a

<br />
</span></span><span><span>Alternatively you can copy and paste your text into

<br />
</span></span><span><span>Both of these methods will strip the text of&nbsp;all formatting (such as&nbsp;bullets, bold, underlining, etc.)&nbsp;to its raw format which is basically
 what ASCII is.<br />

<h2>            MS365 to Gmail Spam Issues</h2>
                    
<p>When I send individual, or a small number of email messages to Gmail accounts, they go through fine.&nbsp; But if I am sending to a group of users (somewhere between 10-50) the messages go into GMail spam.&nbsp; Any suggestion on what I need to do to correct this?&nbsp;
 All the message says in GMail is that this is similar to other mails they receive that they classify as spam with no specific cause.&nbsp; I do embed a small graphic image, and also need to sometimes include a hyperlink.&nbsp; the emails are sent as bcc (with my own
 addrss as the "to").Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>I’d like to confirm some more information to better understand the situation:</p>
<p>1. Did this issue happen only to you in your organization? That is to say, if other users in your organization send emails to a group of users in Gmail with their Office 365 account, did they encounter the same issue?</p>
<p>2. Can you send emails to a group of users in other kinds of email accounts such as Hotmail, yahoo, etc. successfully? Did these emails go to these email accounts’ junk email folder?</p>
<p>3. As you said, the message you’ve sent to these Gmail accounts includes a small graphic image and sometimes a hyperlink. How about emails that don’t include an image or a hyperlink? Do they go to the junk email folder of the Gmail accounts also?</p>
<p>4. Can these Gmail users receive emails from other kinds of email accounts such as Hotmail, yahoo, etc. normally?</p>
<p>I appreciate your time and efforts.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mouran</p>

<p>sorry. &nbsp;I replied to the email but apparently that goes nowhere.</p>
<p>1. I am the only one in my organization that uses MS365;</p>
<p>2. The other email accounts in the Group, other than Gmail, seemed to receive the same email fine. Some gmail users receive the email and others don't. &nbsp;All are personal gmail accounts they access from home.</p>
<p>3. The last email did not have a hyperlink and only one small image. &nbsp;I must be able to use the image and hyperlink to conduct business. &nbsp;</p>
<p>4. I have no idea what these other users receive as they are normal individuals using gmail. &nbsp;If they had significant issues they would not be using gmail. &nbsp;This issue has to do with how MS365 group emails (also happened if a list is long and not from a
 group) get treated by gmail. &nbsp;Gmail has guidance on how to not have emails filtered as spam but that is beyond my knowledge to implement without guidance from MS.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>Since the email goes into Gmail spam while you send it to a group of Gmail accounts, have you received any Non-Delivery Report (NDR)? If so, please send us the full NDR for analysis.</p>
<p>If there is no NDR, according to your description, you can send the email to one or a few Gmail accounts successfully with your Office 365 account. It implies the mail flow between your Office 365 account and the Gmail accounts has no problem.</p>
<p>When sending the same email to a bunch of Gmail accounts and the email will go into Gmail spam, the issue is related to the settings of Gmail’s spam filter. Office 365 can do nothing for it.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

<p>That does not seem appropriate. &nbsp;Somehow when MS365 is sending out a group of emails, something else must be happening that Gmail is recognizing (or not recognizing) &nbsp;that it treats as Spam. &nbsp;It can not be that I am the only person experiencing this. &nbsp;Isn't
 there someone at GMail that MS can reach out to in order to better understand this situation? &nbsp;It is affecting my ability to conduct business. &nbsp;thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>To fix the issue, we need to know the detailed reason why Gmail treat the emails as spams. However, different email services have their own anti-spam mechanism. So, to find the root cause of the spam reason, please contact the recipient support (here is
 Gmail support) for the assistance.</p>
<p>If the Gmail support confirms that something can be done on the Office 365 side, please feel free to post back.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer, however, it didn't work. I changed my personal info but it made no difference.</p>
<p>I did a screenshot of the pop-up message.</p>
<p>Also, when I then click on Ya (which I assume is yes - nothing happens further, no update is installed. When I open an Office program again, same message displays at the top than an update is ready to be installed).&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you for the update. We'd like to clarify, did the issue occur after the Office update? At this point, we suggest that you uninstall/re-install Office 365. This is for us to determine if the problem is with the app itself. Simply follow the steps

<p>I am a long time Firefox user and I just don't have any issues.&nbsp; I just typed in"hotmail.com" and I was immediately taken to Outlook for a sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What browser are you using and what Browser would you prefer to use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not even have Google Chrome on my PC.&nbsp; It is quite common that you are asked to close all sessions of a Browser before you delete.&nbsp; If in doubt, you could do a new start and then try your delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>W10 is now sort of making you choose your default browser.&nbsp; If you go to Settings and then under Default apps, you should see the choice of Browser.&nbsp; I select Firefox.&nbsp; I often have to re-set this default app when a major update of W10 takes place.&nbsp; It is
 apparent that Microsoft wants you to use their offering.</p>

            <p>Open the Mail App and add your hotmail acct. You have it set up for Yahoo now, but you can have more than one acct. Outlook.com is the new name for Hotmail and you still use that as your email, but you need to set it up for Mail App.</p>

 my nokia 6300. Please help.

            I think it is a common problem because at one time or another it has happened on nearly every nokia i've had.<br />
<br />
It hasn't happened to my N96 yet but I expect it to one day.

            Funnily enough, the N96 is the only Nokia phone on which that has happened to me. However, psycho is right. It
<i>is</i> a common problem, apparently. Hopefully V12 firmware (should be released fairly soon - fingers crossed) will correct this.

<h3> jeffreyliang  say:</h3>
<h2>            NOKIA LUMIA 530 - Full storage, can&#39;t access most apps&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So my storage in my Nokia Lumia 530 is now full, and I have inserted a Samsung micro-SD card to also help. Either way, I can't access apps like Photos, or Storage Sense in Settings, Messages, Music, Store etc. Thing is though, to delete storage, I have to
 access these apps, but whenever I click on them, it instantly reverts back to the home screen. I have uninstalled other apps but this hasn't helped. When I actually could access Store, it gave me the error&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">805a8011.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Can I fix this any way? I can't backup unless I free up my storage space, so I'm afraid to fully reset my phone to factory settings. Is
 that the only way?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Thanks!</span></p>

<h2>            ActiveSync 4.5.0&#58; &#34;replace item on device&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>When I make a change in an existing Outlook Calendar item on my device (IPAQ 1955), the change sometimes/often doesn't get made on the item on my PC. On my previous IPAQ, which used an earlier version of ActiveSync,
 there was a setting that allowed you to choose between the device and the PC version of an item when there was a conflict. This alerted you to the conflict and allowed you to at least manually incorporate changes made on the device on the PC version of the
 item. Now you aren't aware the changes on the device haven't been made on the permanent PC version. And here's the weird thing: The changes made on the device sometimes don't get made on the PC
even (I don't think) when I have made no changes on the PC version after disconnecting my device from the PC. It's scary to make a change in an item on the device and not realize that it hasn't been made on the PC. Am I doing something wrong here? Thanks.

            you are right when you say that you'll get a message in case of conflict. But you don't to have a conflict. It's just that changes on your device are not synchronizing. What items are you changing on your device? Are they Calendar items?

<p>Phemp,</p>
<p>When a change is made to an item, I believe a flag is set with the time of the change.&nbsp; When Active Sync looks for changes, it verifies the "flags" and will adjust the item&nbsp;accordingly.&nbsp; I would verify that both your computer and device reflect
 the same time and time zone to eliminate the possibility that the error is not being caused by time errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem you described indicating that it "sometimes" does not make the change is troubling because of its intermittent nature.&nbsp; It would be helpful if there was someway to narrow down if there were specific changes that are being made that
 were not being updated</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First of all, let me say how appreciative I am that you responded to my message.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I'm talking Calendar items. Here's what happens (I was just able to replicate the phenomenon):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario 1: My handheld is synchronized with my PC. While it is still connected, I make a small change on a Calendar item on my handheld and, after I open ActiveSync on my handheld and hit Sync, the change is made on my PC. (The change isn't
 made immediately and automatically -- that is, I have to open ActiveSync on my handheld and hit Sync. Any idea why that might be?)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario 2: My handheld is synchronized with my PC. I disconnect the handheld, make a small change in a Calendar item, then reconnect and let ActiveSync automatically synch the PC and the handheld. The change I've made on the handheld isn't
 made on the PC and is erased on the handheld. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This seems like a job for you that is limited in what you can do unless you can get directly inside of the workings of one's account. Almost every attachment I attempt to upload goes through the entire process and then at the last minute a notice comes
 up saying that the attachment is over the 25MB limit. Well, if any attachment is too large, that notice comes up immediately. Therefore a smaller one is seen as being smaller, but then when it is at the 100% level of the upload, it refuses to accept it. This
 has been constant for me for weeks. This started when I was using straight Hotmail and now that I have been changed over to Outlook, nothing has changed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then trying to send anything with an attachment on it is a chore. Sometimes it takes maybe 10 attempts to send it off. Trying later to maybe forward that same attachment to someone else or someone else's e-mail with an attachment is a chore also since
 it could take as many as ten attempts also.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All your suggestions are for people who maybe have had problems once or so. This has been constant with me as I have said and since I send out e-mails with attachments everyday, I know how to do it and how to double check. Therefore I believe I am on a
 bad server and must be changed to a good one since not everyone else is complaining about these persistent problems. Please do what you can for me and others who might be having the same problem. Thnx.<br />

Marco_Mi,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tnx for responding to me first off. Next, I would like to let you know that I have discovered a forum where within about a week, there are already over 160 complaints about attachment problems. Most are about problems opening them, but some also have
 mentioned the same problems I am having using a variety of browsers and operating systems. So it seems that my situation is internal more than what you might be able to suggest to me at this point.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, I have Internet Explorer 8 because I am using XP. I also have tried Firefox and of course have its most updated version. In addition, Firefox easily lets one know about what plugins you have and how to update them. It seems that my Silverlight
 needed updating, as suggested from reading many other complaints, but that did not help me. I then uninstalled it entirely which did not help. I now it back.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To assure you, since this has been going on for weeks with me, I have cleared out both manually and through different programs not only my cookies and cache, but my registry just incase something has been setting off my uploading, forwarding, and sending
 problems. Sending something without an attachment works fine and reasonably quickly. If nothing else, when an attachment is over 25MB, you are told immediately that it is too big, but if smaller, it will spend many minutes uploading it. In my case, as soon
 as it is fully uploaded, it says that I have gone over the 25MB limit. There is not one thing on one's computer that can make that error. That is internal.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in the summertime I had a similar problem, but worse, with Hotmail. I constantly asked to be transferred to another server since others I knew with Hotmail were not having any trouble at all. One day after maybe two months, everything started working
 just fine just like I might have been moved to another server. Presently I am asking the same thing. Whatever is wrong with this server I am sure Microsoft is going to work on, but in the meantime being transferred sure will make life more pleasant for me.
 Tnx for your effort.<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />

Mark,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for responding to me. I know how much you, as a forum moderator, can do. Regrettably there are so many people being affected by whatever Microsoft has done internally, that there really is little you can do except acknowledge it and offer something.
 Even getting involved in a private correspondence by either a forum or community moderator has its limits beyond once it is internally forwarded over to someone who is suppose to have access to the workings beyond what you guys can do. By limits I mean whether
 or not that next level person will respond at all. Past experience has shown me that responses even with a reference given the responses are limited and the complaints I am reading around the forum bulletins show it also.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I will take youir suggestion and go from there. With all the people who are complaining, we know there has to be a hundred fold more who are not on the forums many of whom do not even know how to get to them. So the problem internally is very bad. Good
 luck in appeasing others out here.<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My situation came to an end but not immediatly as it did when I had another major problem maybe 9 months earlier. This account just started to work and then it would not for long periods of time. Then it just gradually started getting better and better.
 If I were put onto a different server, the correction most likely would have been immediate. I was able to receive from other Hotmail users during my period of trouble and they had no problem at all. So again, that indicates to me that it was a bad server
 I was on.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing I can suggest is that you keep on complaining in different areas out here. Maybe someone who is able to get into your account or at least its server will see your complaints and respond with some capability of actually being able to do something
 internally since sadly these moderators are not given that power. Therefore if they attempt to help you and nothing works, I recommend that you do not take it out on them.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, the most recent problem I had a few weeks ago that did not last long was that when I sent something out, it would take forever but somehow it seemed to reset itself and send again without ever showing it to me. The only way I found that out was when
 the people I was sending to told me that they were receiving what I sent twice. It did not matter if I had an attachment on it or not. The other way I was given links to see what the status was, which always said it was working fine and from that page I was
 able to go to another page and report my trouble hoping that it was seen and then acted upon. So make sure you do that if you can.<br />

            Appreciate all the feedback, my fault for keeping all my eggs in one basket, maybe its time to export all my mails from hotmail once my access is back and then move across to gmail.......frustrating thing is the lack of responses apart from those by disgruntled
 hotmailers who share my grief....after over 13years of use this starts to happen with my email box, and like you say it is either the server I am on or my mailbox, as issue happens on 4 different browsers and on different pcs and on 2 different o.s.....IE
 10 9.0 CHROME firefox, win xp win 7.....either way is there any good way to export&nbsp; all my mails and folder structure? do i setup pop3 and download to outlook 2003 and setup a pst file locally?<br />

            Demetri,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are welcome. If you have been with MSN/Microsoft/Outlook that long and yet never had a problem, then you will not remember the personal service back then that we were given from a real insider who was able to actually get into your account and see
 what the problem was and be able to actually do internal things. Sadly the company stopped that who knows when and apparently appealed to the good natured knowledgable people out here to become volunteers to help ones like us. When I first started having problems
 over a year ago, I was disheartened to discover that we were not given personal service anymore and it took me days to find this community setup and then had to realize that there are some people called moderators who are not just sitting in the background
 and deleting unwanted posts as what moderators generally do in most public places. To me that was a big no-no because to this day I have yet to find anything out here that tells us account holders where to go, how to get there, and what to expect, if we have
 a problem. That is about the most knowledge I have to work with and to really offer you.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your POP question or consideration is something that I have wanted to do myself but have not yet tried it because I lack the knowledge and skill even with pages that can be found as to how to do it. I have even seen a moderator or two give such instructions
 to others but have no real comprehension as to how to go about doing it and what else I might have to get working to get that far. So I can only suggest that you go around this community or just start searching wherever and see if you can find something you
 can comprehend to get what you want.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also G-mail. Many out here have said they were going to go there because of the lack of at good feedback to get away from this. They are not aware that the moderators are given limited power to correct anything really much beyond just sending into Microsoft
 themselves that there really is a problem. I know one account holder who had her Hotmail account at least as long as you and is also quite computer savy. Regrettably she was using her account for business and she was not able to get anything back from Hotmail
 at all so she switched to G-mail. After almost a year she is happy with it, but tired of not being able to get into her account here to be able to export anything she had on file and that has her to this day quite down on Hotmail. What makes it worse is that
 she says she was paying for her service and was treated this way. I do not know what else might have transpired because of lack of communication between us.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally I have my gripes with G-mail and now Google's Chrome because I get a newsletter of sorts that tells what they do with our information and then to us. Of course Microsoft does the same thing, just not as brazonly so where to go is a questionable.
 So for me, I remain here for now. I just suggest that you keep as far away from Facebook since supposedly they have some sort of e-mail, although I have not confirmed that. All I know is that G-mail and Facebook take all of your contact information that you
 put into your account and cross referenece those names to see if they are somewhere inside of their service already and start to make a dozier on all of you to track you and to put it into some sort of data base that obviously is to be used against you at
 a later time. Microsoft might be doing that also, but so far if they are, they are not using it in virtually any way because if they were, there is no way they can really hide it. Therefore you have to do your own investigation as to what is best for you.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, this is becoming long. Only the boys looking for such attention from a female like such lengthy communication out in places like this. Apparently they are too used to the short 140 character life Twitter has been training them to accept and
 at times look for a "breast" to lean on. So I apologize for going over the now "nornal" 140 characters but hope you might have gotten something out of this if you have gotten this far. The best to you.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Jakob_di,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick reply. According to your description, you need to do Hard Match.
</p>
<p>Here are the broad level steps that we do to implement Dirsync between on-premises and cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get ObjectGuid from the on-premises for the user.</li><li>Rearrange ObjectGuid.</li><li>Convert ObjectGuid to an ImmutableID.</li><li>Update the cloud user with the Immutable ID.</li><li>Run Dirsync.</li></ul>
<p>For more detailed information, please refer to the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/praveenkumar/2014/04/11/how-to-do-hard-match-in-dirsync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/praveenkumar/2014/04/11/how-to-do-hard-match-in-dirsync/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding “<strong>anyway to matchin without changing immutableID</strong>”, the answer is no. We need to change the Cloud users’ immutableID . Meanwhile, it wouldn’t affect any services of Office 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gary&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            E63 Quick Office question</h2>
                    
<p>I am seriously considering purchasing a (sim free) E63 to replace my PDA &amp; mobile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate I will be able to view Word &amp; Excel docs but can I create and edit them using the software already installed (I am in the UK in case there are different versions of the phone). I have read one review that suggests this is possible others that
 are vague.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>I want to be able to be able to transfer the docs back to my PC were I use Office 2000 versions of Word &amp; Excel (not Office 2007).</em>&nbsp;Thanks<br />

            The version of Quickoffice that comes free with the phone is only a reader, to edit documents you need to bu the full version from the company that produces the software -
<a href="http://www.quickoffice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.quickoffice.com</a>. Current price is $39, so it's not an expensive thing.

<p>My E63 arrived last Wednesday and I can confirm that (with the UK version at least) that Quick Office allows you to create&amp; edit word/excel &amp; powerpoint docs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's an excellent mobile I wanted it to replace my PDA &amp; old phone and it fits the bill very nicely. I am also impressed with the internet radio feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It didn't come with a cable to connect to a PC, as most other users have confirmed, an official Nokia one cost £19.99 others are widely available for around £8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My E63 is now back with Nokia for repair as a software update went wrong... see my other post.</p>

            Dependent on your accounts reputation these are the limits.<br />
<br />
The sending limit for outgoing email messages is 300 (three hundred) messages per day. Maximum 100 per email.<br />
<br />
The limit is lower for new accounts and when Outlook.com has spotted what it deems suspicious activity<br />
(a large and sudden increase in outgoing messages may indicate your account has been taken over, for example)<br />
<br />
You can add up to 100 (one hundred) recipients per message in Outlook.com<br />
Again, suspicious activity can lead to a temporarily lower limit (as low as 10 recipients).<br />
<br />
If you’ve been notified that you have hit some limit on a Microsoft product, it’s almost certainly part of an effort to reduce spam.<br />
You can also increase your limit simply by continuing to use your email normally<br />
It only takes a few days of normal activity to increase the limits—that gives us enough time to detect automated spam machines and accounts that have been hacked.<br />
We’re constantly working to make things worse for spammers and better for real people.<br />
<br />
The send mail limit depends on your reputation within Outlook.com<br />
The system needs a few days to build your reputation.<br />
So, there are stricter limitations on new accounts or accounts that have engaged in activity that is representative of abusers sending spam.<br />
<br />
If you are a new user, a low sending quota is a temporary restriction and is upgraded to the maximum limit as soon as the user establishes credibility in the system.<br />
<br />
You may be able to raise the limits by getting a one-time verification code sent to your mobile phone.<br />
<br />
SMS validation site.<br />
<br />
If for some reason, you’re unwilling to subscribe to Ad-Free Outlook, I suggest that you build your reputation by using it regularly and responsibly.<br />
<br />
Once you have built a reputation, the system should allow you to send emails to multiple recipients without problems.

            <p>The process in Word 2016 has NOT CHANGED from that in Word 2007!&nbsp; If you are only getting one card to print, it is because you have not used the Update Labels facility to replicate the set up of the merge fields from the first "card" on the document to the
 other "cards".</p>

<h2>            Network Connection under PC Settings&#40;Windows 10 Tech Preview Build 9879&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I find that the Connection tab under Network in PC Settings to display only "Ethernet", and I am using none, so it says "Limited". It would be best to include all connections including those of dial up there so that it becomes easy to connect to the internet.
 Since the network icon in the status bar points to PC Settings, it has become a long winded process to establish a connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the icon -&gt; Click Manage -&gt; Click Open Network Flyout -&gt; Then Click on the required connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either the Status Icon should Open the network Flyout or a easier method must be found.</p>

<div>Hi Thuê văn phòng quận cầu giấy,</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the syncing is not working, we suggest you back up all the content that not synced successfully to prevent data loss:</div>
<div>1. On the toolbar in OneNote for Mac, click Notebooks &gt; Notebooks &gt; Copy Link to Notebook.</div>
<div>2. In your Web browser, click inside the Address box, and press Command + V to paste the copied URL.</div>
<div>3. Check the pages recently edited, see which content hasn't synced to OneDrive</div>
<div>4. Create a new notebook in OneDrive Online and open it in OneNote Online</div>
<div>5. Copy the content in the pages that didn't sync and paste them to the new notebook in the browser.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After the content was backed up, you could delete the pages in the Problematic notebook. Then open the notebook in OneNote client.&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e20cc4e8-0c26-45b1-95ce-2482eae7fb46?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e20cc4e8-0c26-45b1-95ce-2482eae7fb46?upload=true" /></a><br />
<div>Before you open it in OneNote, you could close the problematic Notebook in OneNote client first. If you cannot close it, you could try signing off.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;If you the notebook still won't sync when you open it in OneNote client, we suggest you move all the sections to a new notebook and use the new one instead.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For further troubleshooting, could you confirm the following information with us?</div>
<div>1. Could you share your OneNote version(if you are not using 16.19) and MacOS version with us?</div>
<div>2. Where is your notebook stored?</div>
<div>3. When did this start to happen? Like after adding some content to a page or after a system update?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Alex</div>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b86fa486-4c53-4a08-b59d-850929233449" title="Lloyd Bulagao">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the urgency of this concern however&nbsp;it is not possible to&nbsp;bypass the 30-day wait time when updating security info on&nbsp;your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I recommend is that your friend&nbsp;must try to recover her email first. That way, he or she would be able to get the verification code from Microsoft which will allow him/her to change the Skype password immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Microsoft has achieved is Feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have been showing the Insiders many different configurations, options, settings, etc, etc, and collecting all of the Feedback for those different possibilities. None of these changes are discarded, they are simply set aside and saved for a future build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once they have determined which features received the best feedback, then those features will be considered&nbsp;and added back to a future build, maybe in a slightly different format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been many examples of this process, such as the resizeable Start Menu, and many of the menu formats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>Hello, srshkmr106.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting and welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you tell us the exact name of the application? Is that a built in application or you download it from the Store? What connection are you using, Cellular data or Wifi? What seems to be the exact error message that you are getting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, try to un-install and re-install the application. To do this,
<strong>Tap and hold the app</strong> &nbsp;and <strong>tap the delete button (X icon)</strong>. You may also consider rebooting the phone, then try again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding on your next concern, can you please elaborate it for us to assist you further? Let us know the outcome.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            What he means is the AppNow application that comes pre-installed in Nokia Asha 501 keeps crashing with a message 'Sorry, something went wrong with running this app'.<br />
I'm facing with the same issue for a while now and as such am unable to install apps from my memory card. Reboot does not help. If you suggest I should reset my phone, would I lose my apps that I installed from the store ? What about the recent software update
 that I did on this phone ? Will I lose it, too?

            Hi, nembangz. Not only will you lose the apps you installed from the Store, you will also lose the personal information and media files you have installed on your phone. This is why it is always advisable to create a backup copy of the files by going to
 Settings &gt; Backup before performing this action.<br />
<br />
For the apps that you have installed before, you can always re-install them from the Store after you have performed the reset. This is provided that you are signed in with your Nokia account in the Store.
