<h2>            The right click Synonyms option has gone missing in Word 2010 - how can I get it back&#63;</h2>
                    This option definitely existed a few months before, but this morning I could no longer find it.<br />
<br />
I have two laptops - both are Windows 7 Ultimate with Office Pro 2010.&nbsp; One is 32 bit and it shows the option.&nbsp; The other is 64 bit and did show the option, but it has now disappeared...!!!<br />
<br />
I have tried the following things:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checked language settings for document - set to Canadian English</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checked Styles - set to Normal and this entry has language set to Canadian English</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Used the Repair option</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proofing tools is installed</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uninstalled and re-installed Office 2010 - note the installer did not delete any of the O2010 settings which is interesting...!!!</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checked the Registry for HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Proofing Tools\1.0\Office - but could not find the Override key to delete.
</li></ol>
<br />
None of the above have worked.<br />
<br />
If any one has any ideas - please share. <br />
<br />
Note that I am aware of the Research pane ... and I'm not interested in that.&nbsp; What I really would like to have back is the Context menu Synonyms option back again.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...!!!<br />

            OK, I narrowed down the problem to the Normal.dotm template file. For those who don't know, this template file is opened invisibly in the background each time Word is run.&nbsp; It's a container for some global settings such as styles and in my case, also macros
 that I had written or recorded over the years to make my work easier.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If anyone has a problem with the context driven Synonyms function going missing again there are two options.<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<ol>
<li>close Word; </li><li>delete Normal.dotm from C:\Users\<span style="font-style: italic">&lt;YourUserName&gt;\</span>AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates</li><li>start using Word as normal.&nbsp; You should have the Synonyms function back.</li></ol>
<br />
<ol>
<li>moved Normal.dotm from C:\Users\<span style="font-style: italic">&lt;YourUserName&gt;\</span>AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates to another folder.</li><li>rename the moved file to NormalFB.dotm<br />
</li><li>restarted word, create a new file write some blah blah and save the file.&nbsp; These actions will force Word to create a new blank Normal.dotm in C:\Users\<span style="font-style: italic">&lt;YourUserName&gt;\</span>AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates.</li><li>Close and reopen Word.&nbsp; If you try to access any of your old macros... you should not be able to.</li><li>Open NormalFB.dotm</li><li>Go into the Developer tab and then click Visual Basic.&nbsp;</li><li>This will open the VBA editor and here you can create a new Module in your new Normal.dotm and copy paste the old macros from NormalFB.dotm into Normal.dotm and save the new template file.</li><li>Exit the VBA editor and Word 2010.</li><li>You should now have all your macros and the Synonyms function back.&nbsp; If not then check your VBA code for any thing that might be upsetting language settings etc<br />
</li><li>Lastly... make a backup of the new Normal.dotm......!!!!</li></ol>
Good luck...!!<br />

<div>My salute to a Brit - you have an excellent memory as your advice worked. &nbsp;Oh yes- I did recognize that I was in the wrong forum AFTER I posted. &nbsp;(still glad I did):)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Like you - I had not worked in Word 2003 for five or six years. However, that was where my manuscript originated. &nbsp;I have two computers - one Windows XP and an almost new laptop. I could not even open the document on my laptop.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think I am just getting too darned old to do this kind of stuff. (82)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway -I am very grateful for your help.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Can&#39;t eject removable USB hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pgoelz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t eject removable USB hard drive</h2>
                    <p>If I insert my USB backup hard drive and read it, Windows 10 will not let me eject it even after I close Windows Explorer.&nbsp; There are no other programs holding it open that I know of.&nbsp; I suspect a background system app, but I have no way of knowing which
 one.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This DID NOT happen in Windows 7.&nbsp; It is a major issue because if I remove it anyway, it often gets flagged as dirty.&nbsp; Since it is the drive where I store all my system images and backups, this is unnerving to say the least.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has even happened when I hibernated and then removed it.&nbsp; It got flagged as dirty the next time I inserted it and tried to read from it.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing this on all of my machines since Win 8...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win 8, I found that having Taskmanager open was causing this, in addition to a Temp. monitoring program called Speedfan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After closing both programs, the Safely Remove function worked properly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the case in Win 10... I have found nothing to enable the function other than rebooting the machine with the drive attached... And then Safely Remove before opening it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After opening it, the problem returns...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a workaround though... If you do the Safely Remove you will see the disk activity light flash... This appears to be clearing the drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After hitting OK on the error message I then remove the drive. I have had no issues doing this....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might note that if you unhook the drive after shutting down the computer, it will be "Dirty" the next time you use it. This is due to Fast Startup. If you routinely like to remove your drive after shutdown it would be a good idea to turn it off...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>This feature only works when you do a SHUTDOWN and then Boot.</p>
<p>It doesn't effect a RESTART.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn it off or on...</p>
<p>Go to Control panel...Power Options, and select Choose What the Power Buttons Do on the left.</p>
<p>Then select Change Settings That Are Currently Unavailable near the top center of screen...</p>
<p>Lower down on the window, uncheck Fast Startup.</p>
<p />

            <blockquote>Did you use the little up triangle and the USB plug on the Task Bar?<br />
</blockquote>
<p>I use the safely eject icon in the notification area..... I think it is what you are talking about. &nbsp;After thinking about if for a while, it pops up an error message saying that the drive is in use and can't be ejected, but it refuses to tell me WHAT program
 is using it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is one of my pet peaves about computer OSs these days..... when you tell me I you can't do something I asked you to do, TELL ME WHY AND HOW TO FIX IT. &nbsp;Don't just say I'M SORRY I CAN'T DO THAT DAVE, HAVE A NICE DAY. &nbsp;That's a hold over from the inscrutable
 DOS days. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, something in W10 grabs my USB drives and won't let go when asked nicely. &nbsp;I suspect the same issue may surface in a multiple HD dual boot installation. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>As a workaround, you can select that column and use Find &amp; Replace to delete the # in Excel. As for Visio, you may try to import the data from the exported workbook rather than SharePoint list directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do understand it is not convenient as we should use Find &amp; Replace every time after refresh the data.

            It's not possible to do that. You can't set a file to open by default in a 3rd party program.

            The only way would be to copy the file onto the device then play locally with DIVX player, CorePlayer or Smartmovie.<br />
<br />
To my knowledge there's no way to add file MIME types or associate files with programs in Symbian. At least not easily as no software is able to do it yet.

<h2>            Citations in footnotes and table of authorities</h2>
                    The first time a citation that has been marked appears in a document is in a footnote it is given a long citation until you mark the same citation later in the text of the brief, then it changes the first citation (in footnote) to a short cite and the
 second instance (in the text) to a long cite.&nbsp; The citation in the footnote does not appear in the table of authorities.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I believe in the past you marked citations in the order they appeared in the document, and they appeared in the table of authorities.

            <p>I reported this "bug"&nbsp;to Microsoft in early March,the technician I spoke with knew immediately what the problem was and said&nbsp;they had just released a hot fix for this issue.&nbsp; He helped me get the hotfix installed and tested with me -- it resolved the issue.&nbsp;
 Since we are in a mixed environment, we got the hotfix for both Office 2007 and 2010.&nbsp;Here is a link to the knowledge base article for the hotfix for Office 2010:</p>

</p><p>It just takes it as another command and it doesn't have capabilities of building upon a conversation at least for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can just start anew conversation where it forgets the previous one. You don't have to answer the riddle.</p>

<br />
I have a nokia 6300 and I'm not sure what the deal is but when I lock the phone and it goes to sleep mode, the blue LED lights on the side are faintly/half on<br />
<br />
Why is this?

            the blue lights flash when you have a missed call, message, voice message that you have missed or not opened. they will continue to flash until you have seen your missed call or read your message etc

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Not entirely sure about this but I think it is similar to N81/N96/5610 light function - does the blue led breathe?(That's the term). It is normal for the led to breathe since it is mainly used as an indicator and for notifications - perhaps something used to
 beautify the phone?<br />
<br />
:)<br />

            I dunno it just tends to stay half/barely lit all the time when the phones locked...<br />
<br />
The thing is my friend has the exact same phone and his doesn't do this so I think it's a software fault...<br />
<br />
What are my options

            Is it possible that the plastic cover over the blue leds is phosphorescent? Is it "dimmer" if the phone has been in a dark room without the leds flashing? Just a guess...

<h3> newmar corp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 9860 Graphics got super buggy</h2>
                    <p>Whatever happened in the latest update with the windows closing in on itself animation when the attention goes away is the most annoying thing ever. Visually and for performance. It feels so childish and unnecessary, and is VERY laggy and I have a pretty
 BA workstation. Xeon 1660v2 @3.7 w/16gb ram, Quadro K2000 vid card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when I took a full screen app and tried to pull it down, both monitors went black for 5 seconds, kind of like explorer crashed a bit and then it came back. After this now all my FireFox open tabs are transparent when FF is full screen, and when it is
 in windowed mode the FF tabs are all completely black and I can't see anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a fan of the new window animation.</p>
<p>Also - as I'm sure you're still aware the Windows Feedback is still broke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new notifications thing is not my taste, feels like if I had more than 10 new e-mails it would be just more clutter that I need to sift through to get to the information instead of just using my application.<br />

 If it felt like "hello I'm a new window here to help you in your computing experience" I could deal with that as it is right now it feels like "WHATCHU-WANT??!?!"</span></p>

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft Communities. From the problem description I understand that you getting script error on the WebPages. Provide the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Is the issue confined to any particular website?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most cases, you can ignore them. Script error messages are displayed by Internet Explorer when there is a problem with the JavaScript or VBScript code on the website you are viewing. Occasionally a script error can be caused by an error in downloading
 a webpage, but more often it is an error in the webpage itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be sure it isn't an error in downloading, click the <b>Refresh</b> button, or press
<b>F5</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the error persists, you should click <b>No</b> to ignore the error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Clear cached data in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Open <b>Internet Explorer </b>in the desktop view.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <b>tools</b>, <b>internet options</b> and
<b>general</b> tab.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Under <b>Browsing History</b> area, click Delete.</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Delete the <b>cookies</b>, <b>history</b> and
<b>temporary internet files</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click apply and ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: </b>Disable add-ons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Open <b>Internet Explorer </b>in the desktop view.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <b>tools</b>, <b>internet options</b> and
<b>programs</b> tab.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <b>Manage add-ons</b> and disable them. Click ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3: </b>Clear SLL state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Open <b>Internet Explorer </b>in the desktop view.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <b>tools</b>, <b>internet options</b> and
<b>content</b> tab.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <b>clear SLL state</b>. Click ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 4:</b> Reset Internet Explorer's settings. Follow the steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Open <b>Internet Explorer</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <b>tools</b>,<b> Internet Options</b>.</p>

<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click <b>Reset</b> and click apply and ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend
 that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</p>

            Hi. Many thanks for a comprehensive reply. The only changes I have made, after which this problem occurred, is that I downloaded Windows 8 and at the same time changed my default browser from Google Chrome to Bing. The problem is not confined to one particular
 web site. Cheers. Brian

<p>I am constantly getting this script error message (</p>

<p>&nbsp;It&nbsp;seems to be stopping my emails from automatically downloading and also causing my connection to disconnect.&nbsp; I have tried all the possible solutions and reloaded all my software but this is still appearing.&nbsp; Please can I have some help as I should not
 be getting these problems with both a new PC and new software.</p>

            I'm also with PlusNet (as a customer) and can confirm that this is an issue with the PlusNet Assist software, which runs in the background to resolve issues with your internet connection. &nbsp;If you actually open PlusNet Assist, it redirects you to&nbsp;https://pbttbcpn.bt.motive.com/portal/start.do
 and explicitly provides the following error:
<div><br />
<div>
<div><i>"Minimum specification &nbsp;</i></div>
<div><i>&nbsp;</i></div>
<div><i>Operating system not supported</i></div>
<div><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></div>
<div><i>We have detected that you are using an operating system not currently supported by Plusnet Assist The supported operating systems are :</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>•Windows XP SP1 or higher (32-bit)</i></div>
<div><i>•Windows Vista</i></div>
<div><i>•Windows 7"</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>So I'd have to agree that this is slightly sloppy app development (or at least a lack of timely updates) on the part of BT/ PlusNet. &nbsp;Even if they can't yet formally support Win8, the app should at least provide clearer error messages to end users!</div>

<h2>            suddenly whole number always a decimal format</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to enter whole numbers (e.g., 10, 20, 46) into Excel 2011 cells but instead what gets entered is 0.10, 0.20. 0.46. The cell can be set to be General or Number (with 2 decimal places) and I still get the decimal format as a result as soon as I
 hit enter. This is a new behavior for Excel to me. I've tried setting the cell format to be Number with zero decimal spaces, but then a 46 appears as a 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some setting that I've triggered that caused this activity? Is there any way I can make it go away?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even tried setting the format for the cell to text, entering the 46, and then changing the format back to number. All was OK until I re-entered a number into the same cell. As soon as I hit return or enter, the number converted to 0.46.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Excel 2011 14.4.8 (150116) under Mac OS X 10.10.2.</p>

    <title>How to find email account used when activating software - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jnmpop  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to find email account used when activating software</h2>
                    Last year, I purchased Office Home &amp; Student 2013 for my son's new computer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When I installed the software, I can not recall which email account was used to activate the software.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
How can I find that email address; I've tried his and mine to no avail - could be another?&nbsp; I've logged in with all the email accounts I could have used, but I always get the message "office isn't associated with this account."<br />
<br />
I have the Product Key ... but can't load the software since his upgrade to Windows 8.1<br />
<br />
Thank you!

            Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
However, I tried twice to resolve the problem via the web chats with no success.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Installing Windows 8.1 wiped out the software loaded ... all I have is the product key.<br />
Would it be any help to visit a Microsoft store?<br />

            <p>Girish M,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I was able to order a DVD copy of Microsoft Office so that I can reinstall the software.</p>
<p>I used the product key to do so ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question ...</p>
<p>Can I change the email associated with the software purchase?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My son was logged on I believe when the software was installed earlier this year but I'm not sure</p>
<p>...<span>&nbsp; </span>I would prefer to have my email account used since I purchased the software and will install it was well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>I am using Windows 10 and can't get a notebook stored on a Sharepoint to sync. My OneNote does not have a FILE menu to check version, so I went to Settings/Apps. I have OneNote 16001.11629.20028.0. I have closed the notebook, reopened
 it. I tried to resync it multiple times. I CAN open in from OneOne online. I went to settings and clicked TERMINATE, then clicked REPAIR. Nothing is working on my Windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>

            I have a similar problem with the same error code. Main difference is I am having it on Android. In the link to the problem fixes, there is no information about the android solutions. PLEASE HELP! I can definitely not loose parts of my notes again. The
 app is not usable at this point, and since sync through LTE (i.e. without wifi) does not work at all (no matter what I choose in the settings), I will also not have any way to solve the problem in the next two weeks... This is really a pain in the a**.

<h2>            Can I filter for items that have a &#34;Strikethrough&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a spreadsheet with a few thousand rows of data that I need to filter by a column "Equipment Number".</p>
<p>A few hundred&nbsp;of the Equipment Numbers have a Strikethrough to indicate that they are no longer required. I would like to remove these from my spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Can I filter for items that have the Font Effect "Strikethrough"? If so, How?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>you can use the old Excel4 macro function: GET.CELL</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the dialogbox<strong> Define Name</strong> (Ctrl+F3). </li><li>Insert a name like:<strong> IsStrikeThrough.</strong> </li><li>Refers to: =GET.CELL(<strong><span>23</span> </strong>,OFFSET(INDIRECT("RC",FALSE),0,<strong>-1</strong> ))<strong><span>+0*NOW()</span></strong></li><li>Close the dialog. </li></ul>
<p>The above formula assumes the column "Equipment Number" on its left hand side. If your column "Equipment Number" is in column D than insert in column E the formula:</p>
<p><strong>=IsStrikeThrough</strong></p>
<p>and copy it down. Now you can sort column E descending and delete the rows which holds the number 1 in column E.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explanation to the formula:</p>
<p>1)<br />
The <strong><span>23</span> </strong>is used to return information about a cell. In this case it returns TRUE if all characters or only the first character in the cell are struck through, otherweise FALSE (see<a href="http://www.mrexcel.com/forum/showthread.php?t=20611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mrexcel.com/forum/showthread.php?t=20611</a>
 )</p>
<p>2)<br />
You can change the<strong> -1</strong> to any other distance of your entered formula: If your column "Equipment Number" is in column D and you change -1 to 4 enter the formula<strong>&nbsp;=IsStrikeThrough</strong> &nbsp;in column H.</p>
<p>3)<br />
With the red marked part of the named formula the formula gets volatile and immediatly returns the correct value if you change the formatting<strong> Strikethrough</strong> . It's not a must to use this part of the formula.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Frank</p>

<p>Don't use a command button in the document. Instead, put a button on your Quick Access Toolbar to run the command or macro that your command button called.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either through File &gt; Options or by the Customize choice on the right-click menu of the toolbar itself, open the "Customize the Quick Access Toolbar" page. If a copy of the form document is open, you can use the top right dropdown to store the toolbar button
 in the template that the form is based on, so the button will appear only when the form is open.</p>

                    I am being told by the action center that my anti virus and firewall are offline, however Norton 360 says everything is fine, which do I believe? Im using Windows 8 Pro and this is the first time ive had any issues. I havnt provided any hardware specs
 as I dont believe this to be a hardware issue.

            <p>I can't tell you if the procedures below will work with Windows 8, but they should.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I'd consider contacting Norton as the issue appears to be a miscommunication between Norton 360 (assuming that it is compatible with Windows 8!) and Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When running this in Vista7, you must run the procedures as an administrator, elevated.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
Start&gt;Run&gt;services.msc [enter]</p>
<p>
Scroll down to Windows Management Instrumentation and double-click it.</p>
<p>
Now click on the "Pause" button. Leave that window open and double-click</p>
<p>
My Computer. Navigate to %systemroot%\Windows\System32\wbem (where</p>
<p>
%systemroot% is the drive where XP is installed). Delete the Repository</p>
<p>
folder and *only* the Repository folder. Now go back to the WMI service</p>
<p>
window you left open and restart the service.</p>
<p>
This will rebuild the Repository and hopefully straighten out the</p>
<p>
incorrect entries for all your duplicates.</p>
<p>
In order to see the Windows files, you may need to unhide them:</p>
<p>
Make sure you are able to see all hidden files and extensions (View tab</p>
<p>
in Folder Options).</p>
<p>
Check "Display the contents of system folders".</p>
<p>
Check "Show hidden files and folders".</p>
<p>
Uncheck "Hide protected operating system files" and click "OK" to the</p>
<p>
dialog box.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
Open a command window (Start/Run --&gt; cmd.exe) and run the following commands:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
net stop winmgmt</p>
<p>
cd /d %windir%\system32\wbem</p>
<p>
ren repository repository.old&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
net start winmgmt</p>
<p>
It may take a minute or so to complete while WMI rebuilds the database.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Problem clicking on the worksheet tabs closest to the left of the screen</h2>
                    
<p>Using Win7 and Excel 2007.</p>
<p>I can't click on the first or second tab in a workbook - when I right click nothing happens (I expect to se the Insert/Delete/Rename sheet context menu)</p>
<p>When I left click I get the windows menu to move or resize a window.</p>
<p>It only happens for tabs positioned toward the left of the screen and it's an intermittent but a very regular annoyance.</p>
<p>Anyone else experience this? Is there a cure?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

</p><p>You need uninstall the Microsoft Patch KB3114409</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's Patch Tuesday update KB 3114409, intended to help admins keep Outlook 2010 from starting in safe mode, has in fact done the opposite. Many Outlook 2010 customers report that installing KB 3114409
<em>forces</em> Outlook to start in safe mode.</p>
<p>As of early Wednesday morning, the patch has been pulled, but if you're experiencing odd problems with Outlook 2010 --&nbsp;it opens in safe mode only (always opens maximized and has no sounds, no reading pane, or other view settings that stick), has broken templates,
 and much more -- you should look at the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3114409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>This was taken from a Website, I Pasted so you cab see the how to...</p>
<p>Hope this helps, it worked for me.</p>

<h2>            Sending file to PC via bluetooth.</h2>
                    
<p>OK I managed to send a file the other way from PC to &nbsp;phone pretty easily&nbsp;:smileyhappy:</p>
<p>(it had a &nbsp;file&nbsp;transfer&nbsp;wizard and &nbsp;it basically did it all for me, I just selected the file, it found the phone and send it.), it appeared in my mail box where text message appear.</p>
<p>All very nice and easy!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However sending a file the other way is a different kettle of fish, I am not sure how to do it, what do I do, is there some application to &nbsp; do it?</p>
<p>I tried sending a text, but it it prompts for 'to:' what would I put there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help, it would be appreciated, my phone is a nokia 5230, but the principle of sending should be comon to all phones?</p>

            OK I then tried to send a photo, I select to send 'via bluetooth' but it says unable to connect, Also now I can't even send a file to the phone, it just hangs and times out. It's a bit of a pig. Maybe a reboot of PC will help, USB is a swine sometimes.
