<h2>            Samsung jack mobile web link not working for months tried to fix and i need help desperately&#33;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;Please</h2>
                    I followed an entry someone posted about removing security from the windows jack thinking that might help solve the mobile web link. I can access the internet thru the explorer key. I installed clearsecurity and mobile registry as told but I must have
 messed up somehow. I can not get any programs to open on&nbsp; my device that say access denied. the program cannot start because it is not digitally signed with a trusted certificate! I can not get the dword to change to 1 in the registry editor to change from
 2 to 1 to allow this . Please help me!!!!!!!!!

            If you made changes to the registry (and you did not back up the registry), you might consider performing a hard reset to bring the device back to factory condition.

    <title>Can&#39;t load Visual Basic for Applications - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vito di l.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t load Visual Basic for Applications</h2>
                    I've read all the other threads on this subject, and none of them report problems that are exactly like what I'm experiencing. I'm hoping to avoid a complete remove/reinstall of Office 2011 for Mac. but we'll see.
<br />
<br />
The problem started yesterday when I tried to open Outlook and got a prompt telling me to upgrade or enter my product key. I entered the product key and it was "invalid". I used custom installation to reinstall Outlook
<b>only</b> and nothing else from the original DVD. The installer reported "Installation successful", but Outlook still wouldn't accept the product key. Then I learned why: Outlook isn't part of the Home Student Edition, even though the installer installs the
 application. OK...so I need to buy an upgrade. I'll do that later. I only needed to check the way Outlook displays some HTML in an email.
<br />
<br />
The problem is that now none of my Excel macros work. When I try to open VBA, Excel displays a prompt that says, "<b>Can't load Visual Basic for Applications</b> - Visual Basic for Applications is not installed on this machine." Doesn't seem likely that VBA
 is missing, but I went ahead and used the DVD to do a custom reinstall of VBA <b>
only</b>, and then rebooted my Mac. No good; I'm still getting the "Can't load Visual Basic for Applications" error.
<br />
<br />
Something is hammered in Excel 2011. I can save and close documents, but when I try to quit Excel, the app displays a prompt that says the following:
<br />
<br />
<b>The file could not be accessed.</b> <br />
Try one of the following: <br />
<ul>
<li>Make sure the specified folder exists. <br />
</li><li>Make sure the folder that contains the file is not read-only. <br />
</li><li>Make sure the file name does not contain any of the following characters: [ ] or :
<br />
</li><li>Make sure the file/path name doesn't contain more than 218 characters. <br />
</li></ul>
<br />
Huh? No documents are open when that prompt appears; I'm just trying to quit the application. It was such a pain to set up my custom toolbars (Doom upon the ribbon!) in Office 2011 that I'd prefer not to start from scratch, but it's beginning to look like that's
 the only way. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

            Hi Jim:<br />
<br />
You wrote:<br />
<br />
"Thanks for sticking through this whole process...Advising to start with a complete remove and install would have saved you time, but seemed like overkill at first."<br />
<br />
I agree. The same is true of my efforts to figure out how to save the "Excel toolbars" file, which turns out to be non-existent in Excel 2011. I knew up front that the effort to save time might actually cost more time than just doing the remove and reinstall
 would have taken had I done it in the first place. But you don't know what you don't know until you know it, and hindsight is often clearer than foresight.<br />
<br />
But going through the process <i>itself</i> has value. Part of that value is learning something about the structure of the application's various directories and components. It's always a good idea to have a better working knowledge of one's tools. That becomes
 increasingly important as the software changes, especially when those changes don't always end up making the tools easier to use.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help.

            OK...I've removed and reinstalled Office 2011 and all relevant updates. <br />
<br />
To restore my toolbars, I simply opened a file to which I had attached all the toolbars in the previous (broken) installation of Office 2011, and...<b>ZAH!</b> -- all the toolbars reappeared.<br />
<br />
So, there's no question that Excel is saving the toolbars in the individual files, as long as they've been attached to the files using the
<b>Attach</b> feature in the <b>Customize Toolbars and Menus</b> dialog.<br />
<br />
But Excel is also remembering the toolbar configuration that was in effect from the last file that was open
<i><b>before</b></i> quitting the application. If I just open the application (but not a file), Excel opens a blank new workbook and remembers the last toolbar configuration I used. If I close one of the toolbars and then open a file to which it was attached
 (and in which the toolbar was open the last time I used the file), Excel doesn't automatically open that toolbar, even though it was displayed the last time I used that tile. Nevertheless, that toolbar is still listed in the
<b>View:Toolbars</b> menu, so it's still available. But there's no "Excel Toolbars" file anywhere, as there was in Excel 2004.<br />
<br />
Alas, the toolbars in Word 2011 were gone when I reopened the newly installed Word. I had taken a screen shot of my toolbars before I removed/reinstalled Office, so it wasn't that big a pain to rebuild them from scratch using the screen shot as a guide. But
 I sure wish Microsoft still used explicit toolbar configuration files for Word and Excel. That would make doing a reinstall a whole lot easier.<br />
<br />
Oh...and VBA is working fine now. It seems pretty clear that something in the application was corrupted, and reinstalling Office 2011 fixed it. But in case anyone didn't read the earlier posts in this thread, just reinstalling the VBA component from the Office:Mac
 2011 installation DVD did <i><b>not</b></i> fix it. It was necessary to completely remove and reinstall Office to solve the VBA problem, which is the primary subject of this thread.<br />

<h2>            All contacts don&#39;t move from Outlook 2007 to HTC phone</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had Nokia phone and I transferred my contact list and phone numbers to outlook 2007. I tried to active syn with my new HTC phones P3400 with WM 5 and later with S710 with WM 6 but while all names get tranferred only a few phone numbers move. Hence there
 are a lot of names with no numbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried copying contacts on sim and moving them to P3400 and it works reasonably. But it is too long a task for doing with multiple phones</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The point is that why are names moving from MS outlook 2007 running on Windows XP SP2 but not the numbers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the problem is that when the Outlook 2007 reads contacts from Nokia phone it puts the numbers in the name field itself rather than in number / phone number fields. So when the numbers are transferred by active
 sync to htc phone these names get transferred leaving the numbers behind. I wonder how to tackle it?</p>

            Starting with Office 2000 Access is using Unicode under the covers, so it should save your French accents. I used the Northwind application and was able to use
<font>é (e + acute) just fine.</font>

            <p>I can confirm Tom's affirmation since I do a lot of work in French and have never had any issues and have my client's installation using default settings (so it works fine out of the box).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compact and repair</li><li>Ensure MS Access is up-to-date (SP)</li><li>Create a new blank database and import everything and see if it works and better</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also,&nbsp; if you make an entry directly in the table, does it work?&nbsp; (Basically, is it a form or table issue?)</p>

            Thank You for the response. I tried using a new database and as you have indicated it works just fine.
<br />
<br />
My mistake in not providing the correct and/or complete detail. I am using Access to retrieve data from a Production database (Oracle) via ODBC and that's where I don't see (e + acute). However, when I query the Production database using RazorSQL tool the data
 does contain the (e + acute). I am guessing it may be the ODBC, but have no idea.<br />

    <title>How to Reset Outlook view defaults &#40;reading pane, preview, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shouldbeasy  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Reset Outlook view defaults &#40;reading pane, preview, etc&#41; in MS Office 365 on MacBook ProOS 10.12.6</h2>
                    <p><strong>System: </strong>Using MS Office 365 on MacBook Pro (early 2015) running OS 10.12.6.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Situation: </strong>Outlook was working fine until I "agreed" to MS Office pop-up to integrate Google to sync gmail, gcal, etc, and set that up. Immediately after doing so, Outlook seems to have entered a reset loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, every time I open Outlook I have to go through an initial set up process of pop-up boxes:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Welcome to Outlook, a better way to manage your email" with a "Get started" button. I click that.</li><li>"Use Intelligent Services?" with copy and 2 buttons "Not Now" and "Turn on". I click "Not Now."</li><li>"Help us improve" about MS collecting data with "No" and "Yes" buttons. I click "No."</li><li>"You're All Set, you're now ready to use all of the benefits included with your Office 365 subscription" with a "Start Using Outlook" button. I click "Start Using Outlook" and it finally opens Outlook.</li></ol>
<p>If I try to close any of those boxes without clicking on the buttons (by clicking red X button at top of window), Outlook closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>QUESTION 1: Why is Outlook stuck in this resetting loop, and how can I make it stop?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When Outlook finally opens, it's not in the view I've been using. It's some default view reorganized in a manner i hate and have tried to reset. The default view organizes my email by conversations, with previews, in groups by date, and with reading pane
 open. I've tried at least a dozen times to change the settings (reading pane off, conversations off, no grouping, no preview, by date received) and clicking "make this the new default view," it doesn't work. As soon as I switch to another folder and back,
 it's reset again back to the view I don't want.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>QUESTION 2: How do I change the email view settings to the following for all folders?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>turn off conversations</li><li>turn off preview</li><li>turn off arranging by groups</li><li>hide reading pane</li><li>organize folders by date received (most recent first)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I revoked the permissions for Outlook to access my Google accounts (to prevent it from screwing up those up too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help you can provide!</p>

<p>You could always use application such as Picsel Smart Office:<a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/44983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.ovi.com/content/44983</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There seems to be some confusion here as application as .sisx could be presented compressed into a .zip file and you could use a mobile version of WinRAR to decompress it upon your 500.</p>

            StuartE_552, Have you tried clearing your browser cache/cookies for the online version? Your issue came right in time where we deployed a big update where we switched flash for a full html5 player. The issue could be due to an inconsistent state in your
 local browser cache.

    <title>Office 2016 list of updates location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nightstream  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 list of updates location</h2>
                    <p>We're testing one computer for Office 2016 so we can decide whether to upgrade all machines to subscriptions-based product or switch to LibreOffice. Last night this machine received a major update and I
<em>think </em>it was from Office. Windows 7 is set to check but let me choose what to download. Office Click-2-run is blocked twice by the firewall, so I'm having trouble figuring what this update was. The update took 10 minutes to install and it said "Configuring
 Windows Features" as it was installing. No other major software is installed on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it happened the first time, I thought it was hacked so I re-imaged the machine but then it happened again.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure it's Office, although I don't know how it got the update with click-2-run being blocked. Where does Office list the history,
 date &amp; time, build versions of installed updates? The view update history is wrongly labeled; it should say update information because it doesn't show any information on what's been updated on a computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I uninstall an update if needed? I also need to control when it goes out to get the update and when it actually installs it. This is a little creepy for something to just go out and install without your knowledge. If feels like your being hacked and
 it's unacceptable practice. </p>

            <p>I know Office updates within itself, that's why Click-to-run is blocked by the firewall twice. The whole idea of blocking was to prevent updates and it was able to update anyway. So this means it's using something else instead. It's probably using bits which
 I should re-image the system and disable it to find out. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, all firewalls (except built-in windows) have the ability to block anything in a OS. If yours is unable to do this most simplest task, you might want to consider switching to a more capable one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still need to find out where Office list the history, date &amp; time, build versions of installed updates and how to uninstall if needed.</p>

            <p>Why would I want to block an Office update? - since office97 I've never had any need to block an Office update, and no update has resulted in anything untoward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To uninstall an Office click to run version update, you have to do so via a cmd.</p>
<p>Installed Updates (not office) are available in control Panel (There is no similar list of Office updates)</p>
<p>To revert to an earlier released version of Office 2013 or Office 2016 as an Office 365 installation, you must use a command line and specify the build number you would like to revert to.</p>
<p>In broad terms an Office click to run update is a full install of a new office version, as per the version/build#</p>

            <p>I only mentioned the firewall because you said, "<em>It would be unusual for a standard main stream Firewall utility to block an office update</em>".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blocking a component whether it's part of the operating system or other software is not unusual at all, it's the very basic behavior of a firewall. I was only suggesting, if your firewall was not able to accomplish this simple task then you might want to
 get a more capable one. I was not suggesting to block Office updates. <br />
</p>
<p>Why are you suggesting to revert Office? How does this answer my question? I was asking -&nbsp; where does Office list its history, date &amp; time, build versions of installed updates and how to uninstall if needed?

            <p>You fail to understand, a standard firewall will not block office update, unless the user chooses to modify the firewall settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click to run Office 365 does not list Office updates, history </p>
<p>I stated what you would need to do to revert to an earlier build, but apparently the instructions were not clear to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, a 365 Office update is effectively a full installation of the new Office build version# - it is not an incremental update, as a win update is, or many msi updates are
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can, via any 365 component switch off auto update, no need to resort to the firewall

            <p>I guess I did fail to understand because in my original post I stated, Office updates were blocked - we intentionally blocked it but Office updated anyway.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't realize an update is actually a complete full installation. I thought it was bug fixes and security patches, only. That explains the 10 minute installation.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for the feedback, I should have guessed it would be a lot like Win 10. I guess we need to dump Office after all, when the subscription runs out. It's not acceptable behavior for MS to assume that it's OK to install at their whim without giving detailed
 information and the ability to uninstall. On the bright side, MS just saved the company thousands of dollars by alienating us.
<em>LibreOffice </em>is a fine FREE replacement to Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now hopefully there is a solution for the OS in 2020, we won't use Windows 10.</p>

</p><p>I am having the same problem with OneNote version 16.10 (180210) running on MacOS 10.13.3. The problem started occurring directly after the last OneNote update in early Feb. 2018.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding only one single notebook has the problem, I would suggest you check the followings to try to clarify the issue:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Try to create a new notebook and copy your notes in the problematic notebook to it. Check if the new notebook has sync problem.</p>
<p>If the new notebook does not have sync problem, I suggest using the new notebook instead of the older one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; If the new notebook has sync problem, you can try to create a test notebook, copy contents to it by section to see if you can determine which section or page that may cause the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please also try to update your OneNote and Mac OS to the latest version to see if there is sync issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please help provide the following information for investigation:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Your OneNote version (OneNote menu&gt;About OneNote) and your Mac OS version (Apple menu&gt;About this Mac).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The reproduce video via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">private message</a>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The problematic notebook via

                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I want to run updates to windows mobile 6.1, however the update gives me an error message "unable to connect to update server, check date and time and data settings".<br />
<br />
I try to access updates through windows mobile device center on my pc with my device connected via a usb cable, and it take me to microsoft windows phone website. I tried to follow instructions and download zune, which doesnt recognize my device as being there
 therefore not allowing me to complete an update.<br />
<br />
Multiple glitches in the wifi connectivity and programs being shut down/ wont re open without a hard reboot are the reason i want to do a live update, hopeing that just maybe microsoft would resolve these issues.<br />
<br />
Ive read multiple blogs where everyone is having the same problem as me and have been since early 2009.<br />
<br />
Support? Work around? What is the fix here???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far i keep being told to go here or post it again here....i just want to resolve these issues....can microsoft confuse me anymore...we shall see</p>

            Hello. Windows Mobile is only updated through the device manufacturer or in some cases, if it is a phone, the wireless carrier. So you need to go to Getac webpage and look for any updates. They should give specific instructions on how to upgrade if any
 are available. If the glitches you are experiencing have developed over time, you can do a hard reset to bring the device back to factory new. You need to perform a backup of the device as you will lose any data that you have added to the device. Issues can
 arise usually through negative program interactions or memory limitations. If the hard reset doesn't fix the problem(s), like&nbsp; WIFI, it can be a hardware problem.

<h2>            Outlook.com account with &#64;gmail.com login on Windows Phone</h2>
                    I'm trying to switch from Gmail to Outlook.com, and a big part of that process (and a big part of the reason for it) is getting it set up on my Windows Phone. When I try to set up my Outlook.com account in email+accounts on WP8, I get "We couldn't find
 your settings." I'm guessing this because I sign into Outlook.com with the same login as my Microsoft account, which happens to be my @gmail.com address. I don't want to factory reset my phone and hunt down all of the Microsoft account logins across all of
 my devices to change to an @outlook.com login. Is it possible to use this setup, or am I stuck changing my Microsoft account login?

            The short answer to your question is yes - though you should give some serious thought to changing over to Expression Web, if only for the additional security it provides now that most service hosts are abandoning FrontPage extensions as they upgrade their
 platforms. FP does not offer secure FTP.<br />
<br />
It appears your copy is part of an Office upgrade. In order to install that you will need the installation disc from one of the associated products. Temporarily insert the disc at the prompt to allow it to be read and validated by the FrontPage installer, and
 then continue with the installation.<br />

<h2>            MS Office asks for product key after every reboot.</h2>
                    Hello Microsoft community,<br />
<br />
I recently purchased a Microsoft Office Home and Student Product Key, and installed it according to the instructions on the box (Downloaded the trial suite and activated the trial suite)<br />
<br />
However, when I reboot my PC, it asks for the product key every single time. Its frustrating having to enter it in, especially if I don't have internet access and can't activate it.<br />
<br />
What should I do?<br />

            <p>There are a couple of causes for this problem. One is insufficient access rights. Using Run As Admin is one way around the problem</p>
<p><span>Win7 &amp; Vista – in Start menu, single click to select item to select it, then use &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;SHF&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; to start it in “Run As Admin” mode</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other is if you are trying to use the Trial apps like Outlook or Publisher.&nbsp;The trial may have expired or there was a trial version&nbsp;already on computer. Uninstall the trial in this instance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/11841-run-administrator.html?ltr=R" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/11841-run-administrator.html?ltr=R</a>

</i></p>
<p>FYI: for this situation, you can consider Vista and Win7 to be essentially interchangeable with only minor differences between the user interface in the 2 versions.</p>
<p>In Win7, even when you are logged in as administrator, UAC no longer gives you “Full” administrator rights. To get all of the access you now also have “run as administrator”
</p>
<p>It appears there is an error where your userid is not being allowed to update the activation information in the registry.</p>
<p>The general process is :</p>
<p>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Close all of the office apps</p>
<p>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Start one of the Office apps using any one of the following “run as admin” techniques</p>
<p>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Activate office</p>
<p>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Close the app</p>
<p>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Start it normally, confirm the message has “gone away”</p>
<p>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the message is gone, reboot the computer</p>
<p>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Start the office app again to confirm that the message really is gone for good (was saved in the registry)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why does my phone &#40;omnia 7&#41; not have internet sharing&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I have an omnia 7 which I have recently updated to 7.10.8107.79 (Firmware ver: 2424.10.12.3 Radio software ver: 2424.11.9.1 Bootloader ver: 5.9.0.6) . I understand that most UK network(3, o2 and t-mobile) have internet sharing enabled. I do understand it is
 a feature that carriers have to enable but why can't it be enabled for unbranded devices.
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Ok, then I'm not sure what&nbsp;the ROM&nbsp;is for that handset.</p>
<p>The reason I'm asking is because even thought the handset is 'unbranded' it will have been manufactured for a particular country and this is reflected in the ROM that is installed on the phone.</p>
<p>Maybe&nbsp;a Europe ROM I'd imagine, at any rate this will determine if you will receive the Internet Tethering firmware updates, not your local carrier.</p>
<p>Even if you receive the necessary firmware updates, the carrier that you are using may not have implemented tethering anyway.</p>
<p>Double check the firmware revision number in Settings--About--&gt;More Information.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Hi Guillaume,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could I understand when you create new files in the sync folder, but the OneDrive sync client doesn't sync to

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try following steps to reset OneDrive.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Quit OneDrive. (Select the cloud icon in the top tray, then select
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Settings</span><span>
 &gt; </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Quit OneDrive</span><span>.)</span></li><li><span>Find

 (or </span><span style="font-weight: bold">ResetOneDriveAppStandalone</span><span>.</span><span style="font-weight: bold">command</span><span>,
 if you're using the standalone app).</span></li><li><span>Start OneDrive and finish the setup process.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Make sure you are using latest client, you can click
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/onedrive-release-notes-845dcf18-f921-435e-bf28-4e24b95e5fc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>HERE</span></a><span> for details.
</span><span>If you originally installed OneDrive from the Mac App Store, open the OneDrive app and check if there is an Update button showing in the app itself.</span></p>

<p>I didi it, and it doesn't changed anything.</p>
<p>Better, the onedrive client was telling me that sync is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way to do reproduce the problem is simply copy/paste a file already synced in onedrive folder (APFS container).</p>
<p>the "copy" file won't sync.</p>

<p>Hi Guillaume,</p>

<p>OK, so what you mean is, on a system hosted on a SSD where One container incudes :</p>
<p>- MacOS on a APFS case sensitive partition</p>
<p>- OneDrive sync folder on a APFS case insensitive partition</p>
<p>It won't work.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In that configuration, specifying to Onedrive app the OneDrive partition as target for synchronisation:</p>
<p>- Is authorized by the OneDrive App </p>
<p>- will start copying all docs from cloud to the partition</p>
<p>But when creating a new file on the partition:</p>
<p>- the file is not synced&nbsp;</p>
<p>- the status icon in the Finder is still the sync icon</p>
<p>- the app tells that all files are synchronized with no error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I clearly understand that Onedrive is not supported on APFS case sensitive, but if in the configuration I've put in place, the app is OK and start synchronizing, I think my issue is a bug, not extra feature support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to bother you with this issue, but I'm paying for a service I cannot use but with respecting the installation requirements...</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a solution workaround. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;Go to disk utility . Disk Utility menu-&gt; EDIT-&gt;Add APFS volume. Select the APFS as format
<strong>not</strong> the <em>APFS case sensitive</em>. <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This will create a second volume without deleting the current volume</span></strong>. I<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">nternally it creates a MOUNT
 which does not consume the HD capacity</span>. Then setup onedrive in the new volume....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is exactly what I did.</p>
<p>By doing so, the onedrive app will launch, download files from the cloud to your APFS only volume, but, when creating a new document or copying an existing document, Onedrive won't syncup the file and upload it to the cloud.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to answer in public to your email, but I have no other way to answer.</p>
<p>No this issue is not solved as it is clearly mentioned on OneDrive requirements that APFS filesystem case insensitive is supported.</p>
<p>Even my system volume is APFS, case sensitive, crypted, my OneDrive Volume is APFS case insensitive and follow the requirements.</p>
<p>This is not a limitation but a bug, and I would more than appreciate that you escalate this issue instead of trying to close it.</p>
<p>By the way, as I mentioned, I pay for a service which is not provided and I would appreciate a commercial offer from Microsoft for this issue !!!</p>
<p>

    <title>Publisher inserts text as Calibri or changes to Calibri - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielhollaz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher inserts text as Calibri or changes to Calibri</h2>
                    <p>Can someone tell me how to stop Publisher 365 from changing the font to Calibri?? I use Times New Roman generally, or Book Antiqua.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often times I paste text into an open publication in Times NR, but the program inserts it as Calibri.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other times, it will insert it as Times New Roman, but when I start typing after the inserted text Publisher will have switched to Calibri font for some reason.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I have to stop what I'm doing, highlight the Calibri characters, then change them to Times NR or whatever. Lots of wasted time!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many of the templates in Publisher have Calibri as the default font. If you want the pasted text to keep the original or source font then there are several ways. Publisher has a wealth of pasting options. You just have to invest some time learning them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Home tab &gt; Paste and click the down arrow &gt; Paste Special and opt for <em>formatted text</em> to retain the font. Opt for
<em>unformatted text</em> to take on the default font of the text box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click &gt; mouseover the different paste options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and paste and look for the clipboard icon with (ctrl) beside it on the border of the text box &gt; click the down arrow &gt;
<em>Keep source formatting</em> to keep the font of the text unchanged, or <em>keep text only</em> to take on the default font of the text box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also just Ctrl+A to select all in the text box and then change the default font so that when you start typing again it will be your preferred font.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also save a text box that is formatted with the font you prefer and then in the future insert it into any new publication. Right click the formatted text box &gt; Save as a building block. Then to insert that text box go to Insert &gt; Page Parts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are even more options but play with these and you will find a best way for your work flow.</p>

<h3> geobuff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Version Numbers</h2>
                    <p>I have a Mac. &nbsp;I had Office 2015 on my Mac and the WORD version was 15.8. &nbsp; &nbsp;I just upgraded to Office 365 Home for the Mac, which is Office 2016, and the WORD version is 15.4. &nbsp; I cannot understand this?????? &nbsp; &nbsp;Am I getting an older product or does Microsoft
 not understand that newer version numbers should increase?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in this post, I am required to select "System and Device" for Windows10, even though I purchased Office for Mac. &nbsp;Go figure? &nbsp;They are beginning to warm up to Mac, and now sell Mac versions, but still cannot get there website right. &nbsp;Sounds so simple,
 but ......</p>

            <p>The latest Office 2016 for Mac version is 15.14. Are you sure you didn't misread the version number? If you really do see 15.4, can you send a screenshot please?</p>
