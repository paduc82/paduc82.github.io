            Hi Barb
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />
<br />How do you do that?
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, it will then your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />
<br />You might be asked to sign in with your Microsoft Account or Local Account password. 
<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />
<br />If the update is not installing or making your system unstable, I would heed that as a sign not to try and force the installation.
<br />
<br />Due to the millions of configurations out there, some might not be fully compatible with a particular cumulative update.
<br />
<br />What I recommend you do is block the update for the time being and report it in the Feedback Hub so the Windows engineers are aware of the issue. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-submit-a-suggestion-or-bug-report-in-windows-10-using-feedback-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-su...</a>
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

            Hi Barb.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start or function: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  The bootable media is also the only method that doesn't require the password if you're stuck on that.
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1809 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />Good news, Microsoft is changing Update policies soon as announced recently here:  <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/04/04/improving-the-windows-10-update-experience-with-control-quality-and-transparency/#25qbCuAVA5Vkx6mC.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/201...</a>

            I was recently having the exact same problem with the same speakers. &nbsp;Your Boston Digital BA735's have two inputs on the back of the subwoofer: digital and analog. &nbsp;Which one you use depends on what the output is on your sound card. &nbsp;I bought a new HP
 Pavillion, and it has both a digital and analog sound output. &nbsp;The cable that comes with your speakers has a 3.5 mini jack on one end and a digital coaxial output on the other. &nbsp;I had to use another cable with RCA on both ends.

            SPDIF is not a 3.5mm jack. It is probably an RCA output. Use an appropriate cable.<br />

            Just discovered that the "sort" command has been replaced by "Sort-Object". The "sort" command is now an alias for "Sort-Object" which does pretty much the same thing but with a different command line structure.<br />

<h2>            file history save copies of files &#34;daily&#34; option</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am new to file history and&nbsp;have the following questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) I&nbsp;would like to know at what the time&nbsp;which the daily file history backup will be executed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) If I select "daily" as an option, am I right to assume that my files will not be backup immediately when any changes are made until the daily process kicks in? Is there a way to make an instantaneous tigger to backup on the file which I have made changes
 immediately?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) If I select "one hour" option, if I have two files (A and B)&nbsp;in my document folder, If I make changes to A but not B, will the backup at the hour includes another similar copy of B i.e. two copies of the same file B (one the previous hour and at the hour).
 Or does file history knows that only A has been changed and do a backup of A and make a reference to file B since it has not been changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Justin</p>

            <p>1: The Exact time of the working of File history cannot be determined. </p>
<p>2: File History automatically backs up files that are in your libraries, contacts, favorites,
<span>Microsoft SkyDrive</span> and on your desktop. If the originals are lost, damaged, or deleted, you can restore all of them. You can also find different versions of your files from a specific point in time.</p>
<p>3. After the change only One B document will be present. </p>

    <title>File Explorer will not open with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick_cu  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Explorer will not open with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I can not get my file explorer to open after upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; I have searched the internet and tried many things, and nothing has helped.&nbsp; When I click on file explorer, I just get nothing, then the desktop refreshes..&nbsp; Even that takes quite some
 time.&nbsp; Also, my hard drive is spinning like crazy during that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to empty the trash.&nbsp; I can even do that.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Other issues I have are I can not even open Word 2013, Excel 2013, or Power Point 2013.&nbsp; I get the respective logo for which I try to open, then it closes.&nbsp; I even have a Excel file on my desktop that I tried opening.&nbsp; It does the same.&nbsp; The Excel logo shows
 up like it will open then it shuts down.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this is very frustrating.&nbsp; Now I know why I put off upgrading.&nbsp; Now that Microsoft wants to charge us for Windows 10, I figured it was time.&nbsp; The compatibility program that runs for&nbsp;Windows 10 even came back saying I have no compatibility issues.&nbsp;
 Well, that was a lie...&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Extremely frustrated now!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused and&nbsp;will assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the steps provided below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>:&nbsp;Start your computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists.
<span>Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. For example, if the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, you'll know default settings and basic device
 drivers aren't causing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10</strong></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not persist in Safe Mode,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 2</strong>: Perform Clean Boot. </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.
 This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem
 by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on all the research I did while waiting and seeing all the problems people are having, Windows 10 needs to get better before I upgrade to it.&nbsp; Just all the other software Microsoft puts out, they need to get a stable version that works before it is
 released.</p>

                    <p>I am having a Windows Server 2003 R2 server having active directory.&nbsp;Users have different OS on their respective client machines (Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7). Out of them one user having Windows 7 tried to change the password, but according to him he
 failed to do so due to the complex password requirements. So he canceled and&nbsp;turned off his system. When he came back and tried to login in to the administrator account on his system, he was unable to do so. Following message was displayed:&nbsp;"You cannot log
 on because the logon method you are using is not allowed on this computer. Please see your network administrator for more information." Please note that the default administrator account is disabled on this laptop by default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other users having Windows 7 client machine are not facing any problem.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10-Surface Pro 3-Screen Brightness Settings &#38; Persistent Backlight</h2>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Issues:</strong></span></p>
<p>1. Cannot adjust screen brightness.</p>
<p>2. The backlight remains on when SP3 is in sleep mode (black screen but display is not off).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Details:</span></strong></p>
<p>I backed up all my files on an external hard drive. I upgraded to Windows 10. I then reformatted my Surface to factory settings (believing Windows 10 would be the default OS), but it restored Windows 8.1. I re-upgraded to Windows 10. While beginning to personalize
 settings and myself with the OS, I discovered that adjusting any of the brightness settings did not work. I tried the keyboard (Fn + Del/Backspace), all possible adjustment settings known, and updated/uninstalled/reinstalled the Display and Monitor drivers
 in Device Manager. Nothing works. Any other suggestions? Otherwise, I have no choice but to go back to 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when in sleep mode (pressing power button, time-out, manually instilling), the backlight remains on and drains the hell out of my battery. I have also tried to manipulate the power settings (yes, even all the advanced ones) and it&nbsp;hasn't caused&nbsp;an
 effect. Ideas?<br />

<p>Hi Samantha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Run error Program: C:\Program files (x86)\HP\Digital Imaging\bin\HPQKYGRP.exe is referring to the printer driver that you're trying to install. This error occurs due to software conflict, and this could mean that the printer software is incompatible
 with Windows 10. Now, in order for you to successfully install the printer, we suggest that go to the manufacturer's website, download and install the latest printer driver that is compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persist, you may contact the printer manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you're able to successfully install the printer. We'll wait for your response.</p>

<h2>            Xbox crashes and makes horrible noise.</h2>
                    <p>Recently wanted to get back into playing my Xbox One (S model) and after updating I started a game. About 5-10 minutes into it, the console turned off and the power button flashed 2-3 times while I heard a grinding noise, and it slowly got more high pitched until it went away. Games on disc seem to be having this problem as I tried out a digital game and it worked fine. It also seems games on disc are loading a lot longer and will sometimes crash to the home screen without turning off the console and having the grinding noise.</p><p><br /></p><p>Here is a video of the noise:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCRyvOdsXbw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCRyvOdsXbw</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/eCRyvOdsXbw?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sa

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The process known as<strong> MSTMON_Q.EXE</strong> belongs to software Konica Minolta. Usually you will get this error message on startup if the Konica Minolta printer is not turned on and ready.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to disable the
<strong>MSTMON_Q.EXE </strong>from the startup items list and check if it fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the steps to disable the startup items:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right click on <strong>taskbar</strong> and click on
<strong>Task Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Startup</strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Right click on <strong>MSTMON_Q.EXE </strong>and click on<strong> Disable.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue persists,
</span><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">place the computer in a clean boot state and check if there are any software conflicts.

<h2>            After upgrading to SSD, computer works, but now stuck in restart loop</h2>
                    I have just upgraded by HDD to an SSD. I cloned the drive directly to the ssd, and it booted up just fine. However, when I recently restarted my machine, it wouldn't restart completely, just giving the error saying windows has encountered a problem and
 must restart. I have tried to use my recovery USB Drive for Win 8, however, my USB mouse and keyboard do not work so I cannot even choose a keyboard layout. I have tried a PS2 keyboard as well, and that didn't work either. Is there a way to fix this problem
 so I can recover my desktop?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty much the same way as your USB Flash.....</p>
<p>When you boot from it select REPAIR....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps to do a Boot Repair... You probably won't be able you use it for a RESET or REFRESH though... About anything else should work...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>1. Put the Windows installation disc in the disc drive, and then start the computer.
</p>
<p>2. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …". appears.</p>
<p>3. Select a language, a time, a currency, and a keyboard or another input method, and then click Next.
</p>
<p>4. Click Repair your computer. </p>
<p>5. Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next. </p>
<p>6. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click Command Prompt. </p>
<p>7. Type BOOTREC /FIXMBR, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>8. Type BOOTREC /FIXBOOT, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>9. Type BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be able to get it to do a RESET or REFRESH from your Flash drive, but I've never attempted anything like that.</p>

            Are you signed into the right account for Skype? &nbsp;Often people active their minutes on the wrong account. &nbsp; So the Microsoft account they use for Skype is not the same they use for Office 365. &nbsp; &nbsp;Your minutes may be attached to a Microsoft account that
 is not the same as your Skype account. &nbsp;You should be able to sign into your account on&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype.com</a>. &nbsp;The subscription should be displayed there. &nbsp;If not, sign in with any
 other Microsoft account you own and see if it is present there.

<p>i've been on chat support the last hour or so about my account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI - chat support doesn't work in Chrome.. I had to use IE - use this link (maybe)- &nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/support_selection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/support_selection</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, apparently the help doc about activating a separate Skype account is no longer valid and no longer possible..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's broken.. and the supposed fix is to cancel/refund your O365 subscription and re-enable it on your old Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there's no guarantee that any OneDrive (or other) data will transfer across.. &nbsp;and if you're using API Keys to talk to OneDrive from other apps, there's no answer as to what will happen to those.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I cannot switch.. I have 180Gb+ of data in my OneDrive account...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks Microsoft!</p>

<p><span>Hi icuviper,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question.</span></p>
<p><span>Try these steps for resolution.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open control panel (in classic mode) and choose Add new hardware.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click Next, then "Yes, I've already attached the new hardware", then Next again.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Scroll down to the bottom, click "Add new hardware" (or something similar), then click Next.
</span></p>
<p><span>4. "Choose manually from a list", then click Next.
</span></p>
<p><span>5. Choose Ports (COM &amp; LPT), click Next.
</span></p>
<p><span>6. In the left part, choose (Standard port types), in the right part, choose Communications port. Click Next and then Next again.
</span></p>
<p><span>7. You'll get a message saying the device is installed but may not be working. (Obviously since we really didn't add any hardware.) Click Finish.
</span></p>
<p><span>8. Open the device manager by holding down the Windows logo key and pressing the Break button on your keyboard. Select the Hardware (or is it Devices?) tab
 and then click the button Device manager. </span></p>
<p><span>9. Scroll down to Ports (COM &amp; LPT) and expand it. You should now see a Communications port with a yellow and black ! on it. In parenthesis it should say the
 number this Com-port now has in your system. For me it is (COM4). </span></p>
<p><span>10. Open up notepad (or your favorite text editor). And paste in the following:
</span></p>
<p><span>Code:
</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
</span></p>
<p><span>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DEVICEMAP\SERIALCOMM]
<br />
"\\Device\\Serial0"="COM4" </span></p>
<p><span>Then replace the COM4 at the end with your Com-ports number like "COM1" if it should differ.
</span></p>
<p><span>11. Save the file as fms_com_port_fix.reg on your desktop (or wherever you like).
</span></p>
<p><span>12. Go to your desktop and double-click the file. Approve any security warnings your system may give you.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That should be it; FMS should now start for you.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>DISCLAIMER</span></span></strong><span><span><span>:
<span>Before you edit the registry, export the keys in the registry that you plan to edit, or back up the whole registry. If a problem occurs, you can then follow the steps in the "Restore the registry" section to restore the registry to
 its previous state. To back up the whole registry, use the Backup utility to back up the system state. The system state includes the registry, the COM+ Class Registration Database, and your boot files.</span><br />

    <title>Dw20.exe process using 60&#37; to 100&#37; of the CPU. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rondimarucot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dw20.exe process using 60&#37; to 100&#37; of the CPU.</h2>
                    <p><strong><u>Original title: Dw20.exe</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's about this thing called Dw20.exe. The problem is that every time I log in to my laptop my gadget in my side bar shows me that my CPU usage is going to 60% to max 100% and that makes other task like browsing the internet move super slow. I have found
 that you could stop this dw20 by right clicking on your task bar and clicking on the Task Manager. On Task Manager under the tab Processes shows a list of things and below that list you click on the option to "Show processes from all users" by clicking on
 that you should be able to find the dw20.exe and see the amount of CPU usage it takes. You can then right click on it and click on End Process. It will end the problem of the CPU usage, but it's only temporary. When i start the computer again the high CPU
 usage is back and so is the Dw20.exe. In my case I don't like doing this whole steps every time I log in my computer. Is there a permanent way to solve this dw20.exe problem?</p>

            Hi Eli, 
<br />
<br />What version of Win 10 are you running?
<br />
<br />Click start, type “cmd” - right click and run as admin - type “winver” and hit enter. IT should tell us 1709, 1803, etc. 
<br />
<br />And also what version of Groove Music? 
<br />
<br />I’m sure we can figure out the way to get your iTunes playlist over there. 
<br />
<br />Thanks!
<br />- C

This article is dated a bit, but it has a solution I think may help - <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/musicandvideo/forum/xboxmusic/groove-music-cant-find-itunes-playlist/2003cdfc-fbb9-4f97-b387-6422b2ae4ae7">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/musicandvid...</a> <br /><br />Check out Jesper-NL’s response about adding the iTunes folder as well as the playlist. <br /><br />So add your iTunes folder to Groove and it will work : (C:\Users\username\My Music\iTunes\)<br /><br />Let me know if this helps, and we’ll continue to troubleshoot if not!<br />- C

<h2>            Microsoft Digital Image Suite on Win 10</h2>
                    I have&nbsp;been using&nbsp;Microsoft Digital Image Suite Anniversary Edition&nbsp;on my computer running Win. 10. However a factory reset removed it. In trying to reinstall, I get the message the IE6 is needed to run it.&nbsp; Is there anyway I can continue to use this software
 with my Win10 64 bit platform? This program has been phenomenal&nbsp; for the past 12 years and I want to continue with it rather than switch to another photo editing program.

<p>Hi Joan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to make an older program work in Windows 10, it is unlikely that it will work as expected unless you upgraded to Windows 10 with the program already installed on your PC. The only workaround that I can suggest is to install the program. and then
 try to run it in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the program, and then select <strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Go to the <strong>Compatibility </strong>tab.</li><li>Check the box for <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>.</li><li>Click the drop-down menu, and then select older versions of Windows. Whichever works.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, and then <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I suggest that you run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Go to <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>&gt; <strong>Programs</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Programs</strong>, click on<strong> Program Compatibility Troubleshooter</strong>, and then go through the troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>I tried to do what you suggested but since it won't even install the program at all I cannot try what you said.&nbsp; It starts, gets half way and then 12 hours later is not finished installing and I have to cancel the installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just tried again and got this error: "The Windows Update: Internet Explorer and Internet Tools cannot be installed on this computer.&nbsp; This product does not install on 64-bit platform."</p>
<p>So I have not been successful.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I did find the program listed on my pc under program files (x86) and right clicked it and tried to "restore previous versions" but no luck there either since my computer was reset to factory specs.</p>
<p>Guess I'm out of luck in using that program!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Joan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try emulating to IE6 by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Internet </strong><strong>Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Hit <strong>F12 </strong>key</li><li>Go to <strong>Emulation</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>User </strong><strong>agent </strong><strong>string</strong>, choose
<strong>Internet </strong><strong>Explorer </strong><strong>6</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Once again right click on your installer and hen run it in compatibility with Windows XP as we suggest, that is where IE 6 is compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's see if that works out. However if you want to download IE 6, unfortunately, there's no downloadable file available on any of our official websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. If you have any other concern, don't hesitate to come back to us.</p>

<p>The only way I got around the IE6 issue was to use a Virtual Machine windows XP version and installed it that way.</p>
<p>I then transferred the file after installation to a usb and placed in my programs x86 since its a 32 bit application.</p>
<p>I tried to set up compatibility mode to an early version and to no avail nothing pops up&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does work on my VM Windows XP so i know the file is not corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if there is a workaround for this now but anything I haven't tried let me know</p>

<p>Your first sentence is incorrect.</p>
<p>I had the following programs installed in my PC for some years until the Win 10 update of recent months removed them:</p>
<p>Adobe Acrobat</p>
<p>Combatibility Pack for 2007 Office system</p>
<p>Dropbox</p>
<p>DuckCapture</p>
<p>Epson Scan</p>
<p>Epson Scan OCR</p>
<p>Epson Scan PDF extn.</p>
<p>Google Chrome</p>
<p>MS Digital Image Library</p>
<p>MS Digital Image Pro9</p>
<p>MZ Off Home &amp; Student 2007</p>
<p>MyHeritage Family Tree Builder</p>
<p>Plus 26 others that I no longer use but that is my business NOT Microsoft's, I will uninstall them at my leisure.</p>
<p>I too have tried numerous work-arounds with no success. This appears to me to be MS way of dumping our older but still fine programs, which we paid retail prices for at the time, then they will re-introduce them on a lease-hold basis.</p>
<p>That may be OK for big business but many of us are hobby users and we will walk if pushed too far.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Hola, robertMCConnell2, estoy tratando de resolver el mismo problema y de acuerdo a lo que indica JanAntal el 8 de julio, puedo entender que se puede instalar el programa en una máquina Virtual,
 por ejemplo "Oracle VM VirtualBox", .. después de instalarla y verla funcionar, instalas Total Uninstall y respaldas o haces una copia de seguridad, ...</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Después de volver a instalar MDI 2006 en win10, y repite la instalación, se supone que así funciona.
</span><span>Hay que probar ... Saludos ..</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Actualización ... no me convenció usarlo en el emulador y seguimos intentando instalarlo, después de varios intentos para lograrlo ...</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ------------------------</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Instale Microsoft Digital Image Suite en Windows 10</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>* Primero cierre todos los programas en ejecución y abra documentos.</span></span><br />
<span><span>* Haga doble clic en el archivo de configuración de Imagen Digital Suite de su disco original.</span></span><br />
<span><span>* Si el control de cuentas de usuario le solicita que autorice, solo autorícelo.</span></span><br />
<span><span><span>* Seleccione algunas opciones disponibles.
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Cuando dice "La actualización de Windows: Internet Explorer y las herramientas de Internet no se puede instalar en esta computadora. Este mensaje no se instala en las plataformas de 64 bits".
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Haga clic en el botón Aceptar para continuar.</span></span></span><br />
<span><span>* Recibirá el segundo error habitual "El programa de instalación detectó que no se completó la instalación de Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0. Es posible que la instalación se haya cancelado o no haya tenido suficiente espacio
 libre en su disco". </span><span>No haga clic en él.</span></span><br />
<span><span>Vuelva a su escritorio, presione Win + X desde su teclado, haga clic en Apagar o cerrar sesión&gt; Cerrar sesión.</span></span><br />
<span><span><span>* La ventana 10 espera la intervención y no puede llevar a cabo la operación.
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Espere unos segundos para iniciar sesión nuevamente, haga clic en el botón Cancelar&gt; Aceptar.
</span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Ahora la instalación funciona bien.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; Gracias por los consejos &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>I'm one of the lucky ones. MS Digital Image Suite was on my machine when I upgraded and it still works well. I have Corel Paintshop, Gimp and Photoshop Elements but still find myself going back to Digital Image Suite because it is in most respects very easy
 to use. But I do have one problem and I wonder if anyone can help me with it. When I use the selection tools, such as edge finder, I can see no way to save the selected image I have created with that (and the other selection tools.) I realise that the fault
 must be mine and the solution must be simple but I can't find it with the help within the program or the hard copy manual I have to go with the software. Please help someone - please.</p>

<p><span>Hi saeed_sp,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What happens when you attempt to install the printer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may download the printer driver from the Toshiba link below</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://www.copiers.toshiba.com/support/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.copiers.toshiba.com/support/index.jsp</a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>(</strong>To&nbsp;look&nbsp;for your device drivers-From the search options<strong> “</strong>select your product” –<strong>Color Copier</strong> and then “Select your model number” –<strong>E-Studio2500C)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you have received a driver’s&nbsp;disc along with your printer, you may want to use it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Scroll bar problem in sony vaio laptop with Windows 7- 64bit</h2>
                    In my sony vaio laptop with Windows 7 64bit, when trying to scroll down a list(ex. uninstall programs) the scroll bar moves by itself to the top on the programs list; it also moves up when trying to lower the volume; when installing a program, and selecting
 english(from drop down list) as default language, the list moves to the top of available languages(ex.Arabic ). Need advise.
