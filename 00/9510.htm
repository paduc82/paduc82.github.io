<h2>            E71 connection to Jaguar S-Type</h2>
                    Can any gurus our there tell me how I connect an E71 to a 2006 Jaguar S-Type. All my old phones connect to the car just fine and the E71 happily connects to my laptop. Apparently all devices working then. I'm thinking there's a setting in the E71 I haven't
 found or perhaps an update I need. Any information most welcome.

<p>Have you tried deleting existing pairing and starting again by inputing v21.0.062 under software and then click "Pairing help"? I have only used this as a similar specification phone to obtain instructions to proceed.<a href="http://www.jaguar.co.uk/uk/en/owners/owner_information/bluetooth.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.jaguar.co.uk/uk/en/owners/owner_information/bluetooth.htm</a></p>

<p>HI I am having problems with keeping&nbsp; a connection between the E71 to the handfree on the Jag XF.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The connection keeps dropping every few minutes. I have to reboot the E71 thereafter, since it still thinks that it is connected to the handsfree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same problem with the Land Rover Freelander.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>I've now established a connection and managed to download the address book from the phone to the car. The problem was that I couldn't find the pairing option in the phone menu. I accidentally pressed the centre key to left and discovered another dimension
 to the menu, e.g. you have to scroll left/right as well as up/down, although this is not mentioned in the handbook. Ho hum. However, I cannot make a call by using entries in the downloaded list via the car's touchscreen. I just get "unknown error" on the car's
 touchscreen. The car allows numbers to be manually stored with added voicetags in a seperate memory. I can use these stored numbers with voicetags to make calls so the connection is kind of working. This is okay for commonly used numbers but not much help
 if need to call someone you haven't stored a number and voicetag in the car's memory. I can also receive calls okay. There is something about remote SIM operation in the handbook, this apparently requires a 16 digit code and car has prescribed four digit code
 so I guess this feature is going to be dead. Whether this is what is preventing me using the downloaded address book to make calls I don't know.</p>

<p>Hi howzy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you go to Menu &gt; Connectivity &gt; Bluetooth &gt; and scroll down past the three entries on screen, you come to "Remote SIM mode" and presumably you have set this to "On" which usually triggers 16 digit code response in vehicle?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Curious where did those 16 digits arrive from. Anyway, none of the recent, and moreovere pre-2008,&nbsp;car kits supports more than 4. You simply start the pairing by advising the electric lady&nbsp;of the actual 4 digits pairing code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as I said the 16 digits and the Remote SIM Operation&nbsp;<u>are not the must</u> (/discussions/board/message?message.uid=469477#U469477)&nbsp;&nbsp;for the correct intercommunication
 between the car kit and recent phone sets like E71, 5800 etc loaded with the most recent software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually not the only bug discovered in it.</p>

            remote sim on or off - it seems to make no difference. the car has a prescribed four digit code (printed in the manual) and the remote sim feature on the phone appears to require (according to the manual) a sixteen digit code. not sure a) if this is making
 any difference or b) whether the code prescribed code lengths cause incompatibility?

<p>Bluetooth.org mentions the maximum of 6 digits in V2.1. Meaning that Nokia R&amp;D team being pushed for extra security in the devices implemented proprietary security mechanism. But had no resources to test it for compatibility. The mechanism seems to be inactive
 when the car kit does not support V2.x.</p>

            I don't yet know what version of Bluetooth the car has or supports. The Jag dealer already told me the Bluetooth module is the same as what goes into new cars. It seems strange that I can make and receive calls, but can't initiate a call by selecting an
 entry in the stored phonebook via the car's touchscreen. I'd be interested to hear from any owners that can (or can't) do this. I had no problems before when using a Blackberry 8820.

<h2>            Cortana speech recognition and dragon naturally speaking 13</h2>
                    <p>First of all Microsoft, you are doing a marvelous with Windows 10, seriously. &nbsp;I love the new start menu, and it runs pretty smoothly. &nbsp;Great job! &nbsp;Unfortunately, I had to go back to 8.1 for a while. &nbsp;Cortana and the built in speech recognition software
 just do not get along at all. In fact, the speech recognition engine in the control panel will not even start. &nbsp;I did try shutting down Cortana and then starting the speech recognition in the control panel, and that seemed to work a little better, at least
 it started. &nbsp;In addition, I tried to install and run the latest version of dragon naturally speaking 13, and that just does not work at all. &nbsp;I am not trying to bash Microsoft at all. I decided to write this more for a heads up that some things related to
 the speech recognition needs to be looked at. &nbsp; I do realize that dragon is designed for 8.1, and probably will get patched to work with 10. I look forward to 10s release!</p>

            Hi Marty, thanks for replying. &nbsp;I thought of that and I did try it, to no avail. &nbsp;I ended up reinstalling 8.1, until 10 releases. &nbsp;Jon

            <p>Marty did not address the problem of Cortana blocking WSR. Microsoft's silence about that is a bad sign, as I suspect they are planning to simply drop WSR in Windows 10. If WSR has not appealed to the majority of users, Microsoft people can blame only themelves,
 as they have been trying to conceal it as much as possible. It was partly visible in Vista, quite concealed in Windows 7, hardly to be found in Windows 8/8.1, and almost untraceable in W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlike Jon, BTW, I am not pleased at all with the new START. The reason: it is not configurable. You get a long endless list of apps&nbsp; but cannot organize them in groups (not to speak of the color mixtures, whatever ypou do, that make the text hard to read.)
 The Start Menu is no longer editable!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that even DNS 13 cannot run on W10 is more than alarming. Why upgrade to a version of Windows that blocks SR for the sake of some ridiculous voice assitant? It's not even a toy.</p>

            I´m not sure that I understood what you mean, but you can´t tell where phones are made. And even if you could, all Nokia factories comply with the same high standard. You don´t have to worry about your phone not being genuine if look closely you´ll be
 able to tell. And if not ask us! :)

            Nokia has factories all over the world, including China.<br />
<br />
The quality of models made in China is no different to those made in Finland.<br />
<br />
What you have to be careful of is dodgy retailers that advertise phones as "China Models" these are usually fakes.

            To answer the question. It comes down to costs.<br />
<br />
Currently China is a good place to manufacture so a lot of manufacturing is being moved to China.<br />
<br />
But there are some models that are manufactured all over the world, while some are only manufactured in 1-2 factories, I guess it depends on many things.<br />
<br />
THe key is what Psychomania said.

            We have to consider the labor cost. And it is lower in china,than Europe. I think, that is one reason why nokia produce more units of nokia phones in china and distribute it worldwide,,, bedides the quality is the same,, and the parts is cheaper. Here
 in the Philippines, we use nokia made in china,, and the price is much lower than those made in finland,,, and i am using my n73 for almost 2 years now. i havent encountered any major problem about my phone,, i just updated the software version to be able
 to comply with new applications,,, and its just like brand new again,,except the cover,, of course,, i'm using it for almost two years. Thats it.

            There is also logistics to consider, the benefit of making phones around the world is that you can cut transport costs between manufacturer and retail by producing closer to the markets where things will be sold.<br />
<br />
Most Nokia phones sold here in Europe are made in Finland, Hungary or (until recently) Germany; it is likely that Asian and middle-eastern markets will be equally served by the Asian factories.

            here in the Philippines,, the nokia care line service centers dont repair nokia phones made in finland,,, even if you will pay for the repair,,, because only nokia phones made in china are sold here,, so it means that nokia phones made in finland have
 is no warranty here,,,so its non-warranty,, you have to pay ,,, and nokia said they only have available parts for replacements from china,,, you have no choice here but to use nokia phones made in china. my 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th nokia phones were made in
 finland,,,and this is the first time that i'm using nokia phone made in china. we have no choice here.

            There is something strange going on here.<br />
<br />
Regardless of where the phone is made, whether it's Finland, China or elsewhere, it is made from identical parts to identical specifications using identical processes. So, if a Nokia-mandated repairs centre is saying that they only have the parts for repairing
 China-made phones, I'm sure Nokia HQ would like to hear about this.

<h2>            what happens when you snooze&#47;dismiss reminders on one Outlook client - what&#39;s the sync rule for dismissals&#63;</h2>
                    I can't figure out the behavior of calendar reminders when they are snoozed/dismissed on one client - do they become snoozed/dismissed on all? I've got a desktop and several laptops that all connect (using Outlook 2011) to an Exchange 2010 server.&nbsp; Sometimes,
 when I dismiss a reminder on one of them, it disappears on all. For example if I dismiss a reminder and then open a laptop that's been off for a while that reminder disappears once it syncs. However, this doesn't always happen, and sometimes I see reminders
 on my laptop that I know I dismissed on the desktop. What is the rule - how does the synchronization of reminder dismissal work among clients??

<p>Not really sure of the answer. But off the top of my head,&nbsp;I know that my laptop usually needs the reminders cleared as well when using it. I will look a little more into this and see if I can find any Microsoft articles about this.</p>

            I'm also frustrated by this. I use Outlook 2011 on two separate Macs at work and another at home. If I dismiss all my events at work throughout the day as they come up, I always come home to all the same event reminders showing as "Overdue". And if I don't
 use my home Mac for a few days, well then there's a whole bunch of events to dismiss.
<div><br />
<div>Either the MS Office Reminder app is throwing the alerts before it has a chance to sync with Exchange, or it just doesn't sync dismissals at all. I think it's the latter, because if I ignore it, it doesn't just dismiss itself. In fact, I suspect that all
 Outlook does is push new events and event cancellations to the Reminder app, but not dismissals or snoozes. Isn't that the whole point of Exchange? You know...to be in
<b>sync</b>?</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Reminder app is just junky anyway. I'm on a brand new MBP with max everything and each time a new alert comes up, the clock icon bounces for 15 seconds before the alert even shows.</div>

<p>There is still no need&nbsp;for an AV app on a phone running windows OS.</p>
<p>This quote still is saying it all:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The Windows Phone operating system of your Lumia can only be changed by over-the-air updates from Mircrosoft which come from secure servers direct to your phone or during a repair process. There is no way that code from any other source can get into
 the phone's core operating system. Furthermore, any app that you install has it's own secure area of memory where it and its data are stored. This "sandboxed" memory cannot be accessed by any other apps, and apps also cannot make changes to the OS, so your
 Lumia device is well protected against the threat of viruses</em></p>

            Office 2016 Home &amp; Student? or Home &amp; Business? If you're using either of the two, then the only way to deactivate it is to uninstall the Office, or you may also change the password of the Microsoft account that is associated with your Office license.<br />

<p>2016 Home and Business ... well I can't uninstall because the unit was stolen. So I'm thinking I should find an old laptop and try to download the license and when prompted that the license is used, then select the option (I believe there's an option) to
 void the other unit .... </p>

                    Sheet1 has a value(59) in E1 cell. Sheet2-Y1 is referencing Sheet1-E1 value. Now, if i click on cell R1 under Sheet3 then i should see only cell value(59) in both cell R1 and "Formula bar" under Sheet3. How to do that?

<p>If you have set up a link to another cell then to retain the link then the formula must be visible in the formula bar. There is no provision to display the result instead of the formula in the formula bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you select the cell containing the link formula and then click in the formula bar and then press F9 then the formula will evaluate and be replaced with the value. The downside is that the formula is&nbsp;then gone and replaced with the value. (Much
 the same as Copy -&gt; Paste Special -&gt; Values).</p>

            <p>Hi, Arnold Fra,</p>
<p>I performed a clean boot and the message still remains upon start up. &nbsp;I did this step before which resulted in the same outcome as this time. &nbsp;I have gone through the task manager and disabled/restarted each of the 15 items listed separately. &nbsp;The background
 container message is only visible when the Windows host process is enabled. &nbsp;If that is disabled, the message goes away. &nbsp;What do you suggest I do next? &nbsp;I appreciate you taking time to help. &nbsp;If I have to live with the message, will this affect my computer
 anytime in the future?</p>

<p>I did the reset option (clean boot) and that eliminated the startup message.&nbsp; The bad news was that I lost many programs including microsoft office where I was using outlook 2010.&nbsp; I can still send and receive email, but this was a pretty drastic action
 that had severe consequences.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The background container message is only visible when the Windows host process is enabled.
</p>
<p>&lt;/quote</p>
<p>
</p><p>... that means you have disabled some other process from the process list that requires the windows host process...</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Tasksmanager&gt;Start up tab, </p>
<p>
</p><p>disable any non-Microsoft processes/services in the Startup list... (all MS services list Microsoft Corporation as the vendor/publisher) and
<strong>ENABLE </strong>all of the <strong>Microsoft services</strong>....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Restart you Computer for the Startup list to run again during the computers' boot up. Do not Stop any processes listed in the Startup tab, as that only affects the current machine state, not the state that it attains when it is booted and loads the list
 of processes and services in the Tasksmanagers' startup list.</p>

<p>Sorry for the confusion, please go to this <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're using IE10, click IE9, their methods how to delete browser's cache are the same.</p>

            <p>Thank you Jeffrey and I have managed to clear the browser cache and Windows Live Mail is registered as the Default email program. This seems to have cleared up the problem of 'Send Page by Email' and that is functioning correctly.</p>
<p>However the biggest problem is that I cannot open any links in these messages no matter how often I try. I even followed some advice on another thread and reverted back to IE 9 but with the same results.</p>
<p>I really would like to fix this and hope you can help.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Chris Grayson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you've mentioned that you were able to open links using your laptop, it is possible that your desktop computer is causing this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order for us to ensure that your browser is not causing this issue, <span>
<font color="#000000">I recommend that you clear your browser's cache and temporary internet files. This is often caused by a corrupted file in the browser. Please clear your browser's cookies by following the instructions on the link below:<br />

            <p>Try this. Create a new Publisher publication from a blank page of the size you want for the final publication. &gt; Draw a text box on that page. &gt; Insert tab &gt; Insert File and browse to where you have stored your Word file and select it. Publisher will convert
 the Word file and create as many additional pages and link text boxes as needed for the Word file. Publisher will add the same size pages as the default blank page size you started with in Publisher.</p>

<h3> jellebellies  say:</h3>
<h2>            picture messaging problem with t-mobile and lumia 635 and 640</h2>
                    <p>I cannot send or receive picture messages with t-mobile on lumia 640! &nbsp;it's driving me crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a lumia 635 and the picture message issue was fixed by adding the MMS APN and setting it to IPv4 instead of IPv4v6.</p>
<p>The lumia 635 took a swim in the river, so I upgraded to a lumia 640 which has the same problem but not the same solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been without any kind of picture messaging for 5 days now since I received the lumia 640. &nbsp;After many (empty) promises from t-mobile, it's still not fixed. &nbsp;any ideas? &nbsp;We added an MMS APN with the following settings:</p>
<p>APN: fast.t-mobile.com</p>
<p>MMSC (URL) http://mms.msg.eng.t-mobile.com/mms/wapen</p>
<p>MMSC port:80</p>
<p>IP type: IPv4</p>
<p>
</p><p>No luck. &nbsp;Any ideas? &nbsp;the messages won't send regardless of whether I use wi-fi. Either with or without wi-fi, it doesn't work. &nbsp;thanks</p>

            Because you do not have your Lumia 635 to double-check anymore (or?), are you sure about
<em>fast.t-mobile.com</em>? For MMS, I would use&nbsp;<em>epc.tmobile.com</em> even today. Furthermore, a ‘c’ is missing at the end of the MMSC-URL. However, I cannot double-check because I do not have a T-Mobile US handy right now. By the way, why do you have to
 add a custom MMS at all: What happens when you delete that APN completely? Windows Phone should have the right settings on board nowadays. Anyway,

            <p>Well, whatever it was, now t-mobile magically fixed it. &nbsp;I gave them a deadline of 10am this morning and it started working at about 10:15am. &nbsp;I had to remove the custom MMS APN and then everything worked, before that I could receive emoticons &amp; pictures,
 send emoticons but not pictures. &nbsp;After I removed the MMS APN they told me to add, then the last piece of the puzzle fell into place and I could send photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I say, if you have this problem, insist they send a ticket to engineering. &nbsp;Don't waste hours on the phones with the techs because settings are not the issue on the 640. &nbsp;The issue was something at t-mobile.</p>

            I Think that is not a a problem from T-Mobile, because you said that when you had a Nokia Lumia 635 the mms worked but when you change to the 640 they stop working, it should be something with the device and not the phone company.

            I had the exact same issue with a Lumia 640 on T-Mobile. The Internet APN setting that T-Mobile tech support gave me seemed to work but the MMS APN did not work, nor did it work when I tried deleting it. Updating my phone SW also didn't help. WHAT DID
 WORK was resetting my phone. This blows away all personal info but I was able to send group texts and send / receive photos after doing this. Go to Settings -&gt; About -&gt; Reset if you have already tried everything else.

    <title>Change Microsoft ID email address &#40;Office 365, Windows 10&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billphillipsnc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Microsoft ID email address &#40;Office 365, Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello friends,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’m new here. Trying to get started with Office 365 and Outlook.com. So, be tolerant of my ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ll take it one bite at a time. First of all, I am unhappy with the way I signed up for my Microsoft ID. One’s Microsoft ID, as I’m understanding it, is the door to the entire Microsoft world, and
 I want to go in the door the right way. Don’t ask why, (there’s a reason) but my Microsoft ID is a Gmail address.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I want to keep Google and Microsoft entirely separate (I don’t like my peas and my carrots to touch on my plate.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Question is:</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Can I change my Microsoft ID from the gmail address to my new Outlook.com address???</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Can I do this without endangering my entire connection with Microsoft. Everything is so tied together now, I fear that changing one thing will have a domino effect and screw up everything else from my desktop to my
 laptop, and from my monthly billing with Office 365 to my Microsoft Edge settings and bookmarks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If I can change only the NAME (email) on my Microsoft ID, will Microsoft still know who I am?</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Will nothing else change with my subscription, profile, billing, payments, Office settings, etc?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What I fear is that the answer is, “close my Microsoft account completely and start a new one with a new ID.” Hope that isn’t the case. I can’t imagine what that would do to my Office 365 subscription.
 And, while I am closing it, I realize I would not even be able to create a Word document.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If changing just the ID name and keeping the same account is possible, the next question is “how do I do it?”</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If there’s a discussion that already answers this specific question, just send me a link to that discussion.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I have looked and could not find one.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,</span></p>

            <p><span>Hello Bill,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve the issue we need some information. Let us know the following.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How did you create or use your Gmail ID to create your Microsoft Account? What were the steps you followed?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you have registered your Gmail account ID as your Microsoft Account and want to change it, you may try creating an alias to your Primary account ID which is a Gmail ID. You
 may use an alias for the same account. You may follow these steps to create a new alias:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/add-alias-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/add-alias-account</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Create an alias follow the steps shown in the above mentioned article and check if it helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.

            <p>Thanks Mohan and Palcouk for your replies. I hope you will help me resolve this Microsoft ID question. Let me try to respond to your comments as clearly as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To Mohan:</p>
<p>Sorry, I did not make it clear that I do already have an "alias" on Outlook.com.</p>
<p>Primary:&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Alias: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that I understand that I could sign in with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, but I want to also make *** Email address is removed for privacy *** my primary and actually delete any reference to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; Is that possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Mohan, can you respond to my concern that changing my primary ID will adversely effect my sign-in and payments for Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Palcouk, I have signed in to my Microsoft Office 365 account. clicked on "manage account."&nbsp; There is nothing on that page that allows me to change "contact details" as you suggest.&nbsp; The only "change" option on that page is "change payment method."</p>

            Thanks very much for that link, Palcouk. That is exactly what I was looking for. That gets me to my 2nd task of learning how to sync Outlook across three devices, desktop, laptop, and Android phone.

    <title>problem installing microsoft office - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bajc56  say:</h3>
<h2>            problem installing microsoft office</h2>
                    I recently had to reinstall windows and then had to download ms office again - home and student version.&nbsp; I have tried unsuccessfully on at least 3 occasions to install the program.&nbsp; The program 'appears' to be there as it shows up in the 'all programs'
 menu and the documents have word icons BUT when i try to open a file I get messages such as:
<br />
<br />
1 MS office cannot verify the license for this application. A repair attempt failed, etc
<br />
2 the setup controller has encountered a problem during installation.&nbsp; Please review the log files for further information on the error.<br />
<br />
I also saw something somewhere, but cant recall where, which said that the program was for windows 7 not 8.&nbsp; (the computer was running windows 7 initially but was upgraded to windows 8 after re installation.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions please.<br />

            <p>What was the initial reason for reinstalling Win7, and was this a clean install using an actual MS dvd or an install using your PC makers recovery disks?</p>
<p>And if the latter was this a destructive reinstall (All previous data/programs destroyed) or a repair reinstall whereby all data/programs were retained?</p>
<p>And did this recovery reinstall also include an Office trial version, that you then failed to uninstall first?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The pic you posted seems to suggest that your win registry is compromised.</p>

<div>Screen saying no connection</div>
<div>Having to switch off manually</div>

<h2>            Office Home and Student 2016 won&#39;t Install&#47;Activate</h2>
                    <p>I've been fighting with this for two weeks now and I've exhausted everything I can think of and every question, discussion, and How-To I can find on the internet and on the Microsoft website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased Office Home &amp; Student 2016 from Best Buy, I have the physical card with a Product Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In attempting to open Microsoft Word, it tells me I still need to Activate. I click the 'Activate' button which pulls up a small screen that asks for my email (associated with my Microsoft&nbsp;Account). In entering my email, nothing happens. It just says I still
 need to Activate. So I click 'Activate' again. This time I click the little link that says 'Enter Product Key'. I do, and it asks me to 'Redeem Online'. Clicking this pulls up an internet window which asks me to log in (which I do) and there is a small button
 saying 'Install' to the right of the screen. After clicking this, a bar pops up along the bottom of the screen asking me to 'Run'. Click that. Nothing happened for a while. So I pulled up my Download Folder manually and find 'Setup.X86.en-US_HomeStudentRetail....etc'
 Clicking this prompts the window asking for Microsoft to have permission to make changes to my computer. I click 'Yes'. The screen closes and nothing happens. I've told it multiple times 'yes' but no cigar.</p>
<p>Now, going back to the original word document window, I can now click the button 'Finish Activation'. So I do, and up pops the very first screen asking me to Activate Office by entering my email address. I do (for what feels like billionth **** time),
 the little window goes white with a blue loading bar for a little while, and then disappears. Now I have a blank word document in front of me that is still titled (Unlicensed Product), with the red bar at the top telling me it still hasn't been Activated with
 the 'Activate' button again.</p>
<p>And then it starts all over. AGAIN. I'm just going in circles over and over, and in the end NOTHING HAPPENS, and I STILL CAN'T USE THE OVERPRICED PRODUCT I PAID FOR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I truly hope someone has the answer to my problem because I can't afford to drop another 100+ on Geek Squad to have them figure it out.</p>

            <p>Hi Ashley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are multiple reasons behind this concern. Let's see if doing some troubleshooting steps will work for you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Depending on the browser that you are using, <em><strong>clear </strong></em><strong><em>cache and cookies</em></strong>.
</p>
<p>- Try activating your product again after clearing the cache and cookies. (this usually does the trick)</p>
<p>- If it didn't work, run <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer Tool 2.2.</a></strong></p>
<p>- If it didn't rectify the concern, uninstall it properly and reinstall your MS Office product.</p>
<p>- Reboot and activate again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't hesitate to update us if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
<p />

</p><p>DO NOT under any circumstances waste money with any computer guru to fix your activation/license problem with Office. &nbsp;The only one likely to be able to fix it is Microsoft. &nbsp;Lots of us have been waiting almost a month for a fix.</p>

<h2>            Email window moves into background when using a network printer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>we have the following problem:</p>
<p>Whenever a user has an email opend in a seperate window and tries to print via File -&gt; Print, the window moves behind the main outlook window and has to be brought back to the front manually.</p>
<p>- Thís seems to be an issue with network printers only (we have no local printers to test on, but pdf creators etc... work fine)</p>
<p>- The issue affects all users</p>
<p>- Starting Outlook in safe mode didn't help</p>
<p>- Disabling all Outlook&nbsp;plugins didn't help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aynone got an idea what might be the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards </p>

<h2>            HDMI and Bluetooth Drivers</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an Asus Eee PC 1215N with 250GB HDD, 2GB RAM, Intel Atom CPU D525 1.80GHz with a 32-bit OS. I have had Windows 10 Technical Preview for a while now. Yesterday, I wanted to connect it to the TV using a HDMI cable. However it seems like the drivers
 are missing. I went to the Asus website and tried installing the drivers but they wouldn't. I was wondering if anyone has a way to make the HDMI connection work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also relating to the drivers, I am pretty sure this laptop has a inbuilt bluetooth device, however, I could not install the drivers from the Asus site because they are all Win7 specific.Please let me know if there is a way to resolve these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you! -Vish</p>

            Sorry for the late reply, but I got the bluetooth drivers installed by running it in compatibility mode for WinXP
