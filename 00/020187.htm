I was using desktop alerts until two weeks ago with Rules and they worked fine. Then they stopped. Can you explain that?</p>

<p>Hi Tanarg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the Desktop Alert for Outlook new message, meeting request or a task request. By default, Desktop Alerts are turned on and we can only receive the Desktop Alert when a notification in your

</p><p>About Desktop Alert don’t appear, there are maybe some condition, please check following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>During the initial synchronization of an email account or when you request a manual Send/Receive.</span></li><li><span>If you're using message rules and a new message is moved out of the default account Inbox</span></li></ol>

<li><span>Did all new messages, meeting requests or a task requests don't have Desktop Alert?</span></li><li><span>May I know the detailed version information for your Outlook (File &gt; Office account &gt; Product information).</span></li></ol>

<p>As I mentioned in an earlier message, I am now again getting desktop alerts --- FOR MESSAGES THAT ARE SENT TO OTHER FOLDERS by a Rule. So the statement that desktop alerts do not work for messages that are sent by Rules to other folders is incorrect. It's
 working now here. Somehow, I think, the Windows notification system was doing something. I don't know how I tweaked it but now I am getting desktop notifications for messages that I have made a rule for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I have a rule for Apex to send messages from Apex to the Apex folder and show a desktop alert.&nbsp;<br />
It works now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why Microsoft has two different things with the same name, I do not know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Office 365 and Windows 10. Both are the latest versions, as they were installed three days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And somewhere Microsoft says desktop alerts won't work with IMAP, but I have IMAP and they are working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very difficult to get reliable information online, probably because of the many versions of the applications that exist and the fact that the software is continually being changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just glad to have the desktop alerts back, but I don't know how I did it, which is a bit annoying because if it happens again, I don't know how I restored them. When all the information online says it can be done but I have proved that it CAN be done,
 it's a lonely road to hoe.</p>

<p><span>Hi Tanarg,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the misunderstanding. About you can receive the Desktop Alert for the other folders (not default inbox folder), you still can see these emails from their own folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For you mentioned, you see the desktop alerts did not work with IMAP from&nbsp; various websites you found. During my test, we still can receive the desktop alerts in the IMAP account. So whether you can
 receive the&nbsp; desktop alerts or not is not based on the type of the email account.
</p>

<p>Yes, I can get desktop alerts now for messages I move via a Rule from the Inbox to another folder. Apparently I needed to turn something on in the "action center," which I didn't even know existed until now. (Outlook 2016 was already ON, so I don't know
 what I did, but I'm happy now).</p>

<p><span>Hi Tanarg,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you set up a Inbox rule for some messages and move these message to other folders (not defaule inbox folder), you can choose "display Desktop Alert" , then these message met the filter will go to the
</span>specific folder and show desktop alert.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, what you have posted is how I did it FOR TWO YEARS ----&nbsp; until they stopped working a few weeks ago. I think a Windows Update must have changed something because the desktop alerts stopped. I couldn't get them to work for two weeks, and everyplace online
 said they couldn't be done. Somehow, when I was poking around the action center, they came back. They look slightly different, but at least they are desktop alerts for selected folders only, not every single piece of mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing Microsoft really should do is differentiate between the New Mail Desktop Alert, which is for ALL messages (via File / Options / Mail / Message arrival, and the Desktop Alert one gets via a Rule. They are two different things. Now I am getting what
 I had before, sort of. I tweaked something in the action center, and the alerts started to work.</p>

<p>Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have stated several times that I do not know what I did in the action center. I may have turned Outlook off and then back on. I really don't know. Then this morning, I started getting a number where the icon is in the status bar. I didn't do anything.
 The GUI for Windows and Office programs seems to be getting less and less user-friendly as the years go by, I am sad to say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a minimum of things you CAN do in the action center on a PC. I assume those tiles are for other devices, but I can't use them for anything except opening Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I could help you, but I can't explain it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe just opening the action center for the first time was the thing that triggered it---I don't know. I didn't change any settings, because receiving notifications from Outlook was already ON.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe if people are having problems, they should just open the action center by that icon in the status bar and check that notifications from Outlook is ON. Then they should check that their Rules are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cfaf6e85-7f41-4605-9526-b9afa7d73a36" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cfaf6e85-7f41-4605-9526-b9afa7d73a36" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The above is what a Rule using desktop alerts should look like if the message is being moved to another folder after arriving in the Inbox.</p>

<h2>            Multi-language writing and proofing tools don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I have installed the 64bit proofing tools for <strong>German</strong>, <strong>
Italian </strong>and <strong>French </strong>onto my 64bit system (in Windows 10). The programmes are clearly installed.&nbsp; I am able to change the language I write in and the language I choose is thusly detected to be the correct language, but a message appears
 (in <em>Word </em>and in <em>Outlook</em>, for instance), stating that there are proofing tools available - that as they are not downloaded, the programme is unable to proof my text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and re-installed, and cannot move past this hurdle.&nbsp; I am sure that there is a really simple and clear box to un/tick, but obviously I'm missing it.&nbsp; I can't afford to buy language packs and don't need to change the base language for my
 whole computer, but I do regularly need to be able to write in other languages on a computer that can check spelling and grammar as I work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems odd to me that I have no difficulty selecting <strong>Australian </strong>
<strong>English </strong>and the system claims to proof check for that variation (although my education and my AOD suggest that Microsoft doesn't care/know that there are differences between American and Australian preferred spelling/grammar that extend beyond
 some words using double consonants in Australian usage).</p>

    <title>How to refresh a pivot chart on worksheet activate&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muhammad ah  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to refresh a pivot chart on worksheet activate&#63;</h2>
                    I have a pivot chart in a worksheet. I would like it to automatically update or refresh when the worksheet is activated. I have tried recording a macro but it doesn't work the second time.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way I can overcome this problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any Help is appreciated :)</div>

            <p>Did you put this code into the Worksheet object that actually has the pivot table on it?&nbsp; In other words "ActiveSheet" is the Worksheet that holds the pivot table?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, are you sure about the name "PivotChartTable2"?&nbsp; When I created a pivot chart on a worksheet, the underlying table was named "PivotTable1" and the chart was named "Chart1".&nbsp; The code that recorded was:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.PivotTables("PivotTable1").PivotCache.Refresh</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when I put the update code into my Worksheet's Activate event, it worked as expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you get any kind of error message, or does not happen at all?</p>

<h2>            Office unstable and freeze up for no reason</h2>
                    <p>Word and Excel constantly locks up during actions such as scrolling up and down, opening up new document. some times click on document but cannot open as the software is stuck in previous document's 'enable editing' option. Other times just freeze and die
 for no reason. Feels like two factors is causing it: previous document locked in 'enable editing', and when internet connection is not stable or connect environment changes. Enable editing is a function that only add annoyance and have never done anything
 good to me. People send me word and excel for editing. If they dont want me to edit, they send PDF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also another problem, I cannot continue subscription of office 365, I have to go to a store, purchase a card and reactivate via code. Very annoying!</p>

            Hi HengLi,
<br />
<br />I'd suggest trying a couple of steps to see if that corrects the problem for you.
<br />
<br />1) First, an add-in or extension may be causing the problem. Start the application in Office Safe Mode. 
<br />
<br />The instructions to start Office in safe mode are here:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-O...</a>
<br />
<br />2) If that doesn't correct the problem, try repairing the installation.
<br />
<br />The instructions to follow to do this are here:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />3) Create a new user profile in Windows and see if it works correctly for the new profile

            Hello,<br />
<br />
Thank you for making us aware of the issue. As I understood your concern, you haven't been able to receive any e-mails, you checked the Junk filter settings but no luck.&nbsp;You even tried sending an e-mail to the account in question but still got the same problem.<br />
<br />
Let me see what I can do to help you sort this out. The following steps may help you check to make sure that none of these settings is causing the problem:<br />
<br />
</font></span>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<font>1. Sign in to your account.<br />
2. Click <strong>Options</strong> and then <strong>More options</strong>.<br />
3. Under <strong>Managing your account</strong>, click <strong>Email forwarding</strong><br />
4. On the <strong>Forwarding</strong> page, click <strong>Don't forward.</strong></font><b><br />
</b><font>5. Click <strong>
Save</strong>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<font><strong>Note:</strong> If the radio button is on the
<strong>Forward your mail to another email account</strong> and there's another address inside the box, we can conclude that there's another account receiving the messages that should be sent to you. However, the steps above will set your email address as the
 default receiver of your emails.<br />
<br />
You might want to check the Blocked Senders, to see if those contacts are in the list, remove them and add to the Safe senders. Please refer to the following steps:<br />
<br />
<strong>Check your Blocked sender list</strong></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>1. Sign in to your account. Go to inbox.<br />
2. Click <strong>Options </strong>located at the upper-right side of the page.<br />
3. Select <strong>More Options</strong>. <br />
4. Under <strong>Preventing junk email</strong>, click <strong>Safe and blocked senders</strong>.<br />
5. Click <strong>Blocked senders</strong>.<br />
6. In the Blocked senders list, select the name or domain (the part of an e-mail address that follows the @ sign, such as hotmail.com) that you now want to receive mail from, and then click<strong>&lt;&lt; Remove from list.</strong></font><b><br />
<font><br />
<strong>Add the email address to your Safe senders list</strong></font></b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>1. Sign in to your account. Go to inbox.<br />
2. Click <strong>Options </strong>located at the upper-right side of the page.<br />
3. Select <strong>More Options</strong>. <br />
4. Under <strong>Preventing junk email</strong>, click <strong>Safe and blocked senders</strong>.<br />
5. Click <strong>Safe Senders</strong>. <br />
6. In the text box, type in the email address or domain you’d like to always receive email from, and then click</font><font><strong> Add to list &gt;&gt;.<br />
<br />
Check E-mail rules<br />
<br />
</strong>1. Sign in to your account</font></span></p>
<p><font><span>2. Click the gear icon at the top right portion</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>3. Select <strong>More mail settings</strong></span></font></p>
<p><font><span>4. Under <strong>Customizing Outlook</strong>, click
<strong>Rules for sorting new me</strong>ssages</span></font></p>
<p><span><font>5. Check to see if there’s a rule set-up to forward e-mails to another account(<i>you can delete it by ticking the check box and selecting</i> Delete)</font><br />
<font><br />
<br />
</font></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If none of the above suggestions helped, please refer to my private message. You have to sign in to this forum and click the red texts saying you have a private reply.
 This will take you to the private message area.<br />
</font><b><font><br />
</font></b></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Thanks!</font></span></p>

 get permission to the office12 folder and it said the file was corrupt. I then tried to uninstall all instances of office, of which the add/remove programs wouldn't let me do. I ran checkdisk thinking it might help with the corrupted folder and afterwards
 tried to reinstall office 2010. It stopped due to permissions but now on the office14 folder. I've tried many ways to change permissions on these folders, but I have not been succseful. Also, when I've tried to uninstall the half installed version of office
 through the installer it says I don't have permission to uninstall office 2010. Please help!! I need office!!</p>

<p>Thank you both for replying. So I did try the microsoft fix it which also had an error, it said it could not create a temporary folder. As for setting permissions on the office14 folder, when I hit ok after making all the changes it says access denied for
 that folder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is simply yet-another example of arithmetic anomalies that commonly arise because Excel uses 64-bit binary floating-point to represent numeric values internal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, IF(10.1 - 10 = 0.1, TRUE) returns FALSE(!) because 10.1 - 10 is 0.0999999999999996.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The work-around is:&nbsp; whenever you expect a calculation to be accurate to some number of decimal places (2, in your example), explicitly round to
<p>
</p><p>Your sum should be =ROUND(SUM(A1:A11),2) .</p>
<p>
</p><p>These "anomalies" are not considered to be bugs per se, but a limitation of the internal representation of numeric values.&nbsp; Most computer applications have the same limitations.&nbsp; (Although some do not because they use a different internal representation.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, the problem is:&nbsp; most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly in 64-bit binary floating-point.&nbsp; And the approximation of a particular decimal fraction depends on the magnitude of the value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, notice the different approximation of 0.1 in the following numbers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.0999999999999,996447286321199499070644378662109375</p>
<p>0.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.100000000000000,0055511151231257827021181583404541015625</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use period for the decimal point and comma to demarcate the first 15 significant digits, which is the most that Excel formats, rounded.</p>

            Hi, joeu2004,<br />
Thank you for sharing your experience. The example with the 'IF' statement is exactly how the issue was discovered. We were getting the error from the 3rd party software claiming that the Excel sum '-5087.25' is different from the correct sum '-5087.25', resulting
 in mission-critical interfaces to fail. I completely side with Eric that this should be treated as bug rather than 'anomaly' or 'limitation'. We finance users have millions of rows and thousands of columns, but never more that 2 decimals. The very idea that
 we cannot trust the result we get when clicking the 'sigma' button is unacceptable. The workaround you suggested is something that Excel folks at MS should implement internally to make the sum work correctly. Should not be too difficult to determine the max
 number of decimals in the range and substitute it to the ROUND.

<p>There are no additional resources Eric can engage. This is a fundamental limit of computer technology. Computers count in Powers of 2, people count in Powers of 10, aka Binary vs Decimal. You simply cannot exactly represent some decimal numbers in binary,
 ie 1/3 or even 0.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem normally shows up when values are calculated.</p>
<br />
<p>If you are dealing with currency that uses 2 decimal places, you should use explicit rounding to that 2 decimal places to get rid of those unwanted tiny fractions several decimal places down.

</span><span>Computers use a base-2 number system.&nbsp; So guess what?&nbsp; Our friendly little base-10 fractions like 0.1 very often don’t “fit” into computer accurately.&nbsp; They get stored as approximate values, but the difference between the value we
 expect to see and the value that is truly stored is cleverly hidden in digits that you never see.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There isn’t anything all that special about 10 other than that it matches our finger count.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here’s the punchline:&nbsp; in most cartoons, animators have discovered that characters still look ok if you only draw four fingers on a hand. So cartoon characters would use a Base-8 number system in their daily lives, not base-10.&nbsp; And because 8 is really
 just 2*2*2, ALL fractions expressed in base-8 could be expressed 100% accurately in a base-2, binary computer.<br />

            On my laptop after the update to 14942 (and a couple intentional&nbsp;restarts) I had an issue where it did not go completely asleep and the Fan remained running at full speed for 8+ hours until I noticed it. By that time the laptop was VERY hot as was the
 object it was resting on. Also the Wifi was still engaged though not connected. I had to force stop the laptop. I had one other problem attempting to wake from sleep where it did not properly wake and I had to do a manual restart. No system generated restarts
 though.

                    <p>Dears</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask why Microsoft does not add feature to copyboard to copy more than one thing</p>
<p>like &nbsp;Ctrl&nbsp; + C and another copy will be &nbsp;Ctrl&nbsp; +C +1 and same thing for multi- copying&nbsp;</p>
<p>we need to copy more than one thing as separated .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this feature will be more useful for people like writing article or programming .</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you think guys ?</p>
<p>

<p>If you need to change some settings in Outlook, you need to click the

<h2>            How to convert a 1994 Word File to the 2010 Word&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a large number of 3.5 discs that I last used in about 1990 and as I could not open them with my new computer I bought a device that I could by plugging it into the new computer with a USB.&nbsp; Some actually opened and I was able to save the content in
 the 2010 Word software but other would not.&nbsp; I then tried them on an old Laptop and the discs did open but I am unable to open the files.</p>
<p>Is there&nbsp;any software that will convert the old Word into the newer Word?&nbsp;</p>

            If the files were created in any version of Word, you should still be able to open them, but by default, files that use the format used by Word versions before Word 97 will be blocked by Word 2010. In order to change this, you need to go to
<strong>File | Options | Trust Center | Trust Center Settings | File Block Settings
</strong>and change the settings to allow you to open files in these formats. Note that, if you want completely unrestricted access to these files, you need to clear the check boxes for them so that whichever of the radio buttons is selected at the bottom does
 not apply to them. Alternatively, you can leave them checked and opt to allow opening them in Protected View, with or without allowing editing.

<p>I recently changed my email account to IMAP. In trying to consolidate folders on Outlook 2007, I then made changes to the data files in the Outlook email accounts, pointing to a folder that is generated externally, and removing the default f.pst.&nbsp; When I
 restart Outlook, the splash screen appears briefly and disappears, leaving a message that "Outlook cannot find the folder set.&nbsp; Unknown error."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I restore the local folder (.pst ?) with this new IMAP account?</p>

</p><p>I had a week's worth of work on a Word doc on my android tablet which had not synced for some reason, despite me working on the wifi several times over this time. When I opened the document again last night, onedrive synced over the top of this and I've

<p>Hello Aishwarya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, it looks like that Sway no longer exists.&nbsp; After a Sway's owner leaves a company and their account is removed, that user's Sways go into a holding pattern for 30 days where they act as if they're deleted.&nbsp; After that 30 days, they get permanently
 deleted.&nbsp; However, the organization admin can transfer Sways in a deleted user's account to another account during the 30 day holding period.&nbsp; I suggest contacting your organization admin and inquiring about this.&nbsp; Here is the help article on how to do the
 transfer:&nbsp; <a href="https://support.office.com/article/Reassign-Sways-from-a-deleted-user-account-Admin-Help-9580E618-3C3E-4D28-A6EF-74C00A997248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Resource not levelling problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping someone can help with this problem, as im stumped trying to work out the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any predecessors in this example as am using level by ID only (Just part of my current learning process), but for some reason my project plan wont level the resource as I expected. &nbsp; I have a 7 hr working day set, and would expect leveling to
 simply delay the over-allocated task(s) sequentially by pushing the work back to Tuesday for Task 5 but for some reason its just not doing anything (apart from flagging the over allocation).<br />
</p>
<p>These tasks don't really have any specific order in which they need to be done in, hence relying on Levelling by ID only and no predecessors being set. &nbsp;Is there a different way i should be treating tasks like this perhaps??&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just wanted to post back on this thread with the resolution incase its of use to another user (as John helped me get this resolved offline.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically after much trial and error and advice I uninstalled MSP 2016 and reinstalled my old license of msp 2010. This seemed to do the trick and the issue was resolved.&nbsp; I assume it was some kind of problem with the original installation and that a reinstall
 of msp 2016 would have had the same successful result, but can only confirm that downgrading back to 2010 worked for me this time around.</p>
