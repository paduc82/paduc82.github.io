<h2>            Ms Word delete items in the Table of Contents to delete the context</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that in Ms Word it is easy to delete the context then I could easily update the Table of Contents. I am just wondering if there is a other way around and if I could delete the items in the Table of Contents to delete the context. Cheers.</p>

            <p>No, the Table of Contents does not work in reverse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in 2010 and later versions, if you display the Navigation Pane, it contains something similar to the table of contents and if you select and delete a heading, that heading and all of the sub-headings and text under it will be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there is nothing really similar in Word 2007</p>

<h2>            An encrypted connection to your mail server is not available.</h2>
                    <p>I've seen various people that have experienced the issue of having the following message appear when setting up an email account in Outlook 2013 "An encrypted connection to your mail server is not available" however none of the solutions i've came across
 have helped me so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 7 laptop I was installing office 2013 on previously ran office 2007 and the email worked fine on it (it's a Microsoft 365 email account). I had a spare license for office 2013 so I uninstalled office 2007 and installed office 2013. But when I
 tried to set up the email got the message "An encrypted connection to your mail server is not available".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the same email address in outlook web app and it works fine. I've tried setting it up on a Windows 8 pc and also another Windows 7 laptop both with Outlook 2013 and it works fine, so I knew it wasn't the email settings server side etc. that was causing
 the problem, so I therefore thought it was a computer issue. I also tried manually setting the email up instead of using auto-discover but that didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and re-installed office again to see if that worked but experienced the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today on a whim I tried another email on the affected laptop (it's a colleagues and also same domain email and also a Microsoft 365 account) and it worked ok. I'm now thinking that there must be some file somewhere or something in the registry blocking the
 email being set up again as it was previously used on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with any suggestion I've been stuck on this for a couple of weeks now and it's really bugging me?</p>

<h2>            Open documents through Office desktop applications on the OneDrive Web</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my company we want employees to use OneDrive for personal documents, but we will only work via web, not with local synchronization on the PC.</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>My question is: how can I configure that when opening a document from OneDrive via the web, it is opened directly with the corresponding Office desktop application (Word, Excel, Powerpoint), instead of Word/Excel/Power Point Online, without having to choose
 how to open it each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Sharepoint it's possible, but I don't know how to configure it in One Drive</p>
</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thank you!</div>

<p>Hi JaumeGT ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your message in this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you want to open the documents in client applications by default on OneDrive Online? If so, it’s not available to achieve that.
 is meant for documents in a Document Library</span>. So you cannot find the setting of
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open Documents in Client Applications
</span></strong>from OneDrive Online. As you mentioned, you may need to choose how to open the file.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We understand the situation and you make a great point.
 this is the best way to make our products and services better for you and others.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, if you want to open the files stored in Document libraries in OneDrive, you can go to Library Settings &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; select
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open in the client application</span>,
</strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">then you can</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">go
 to OneDrive Online &gt; Shared libraries</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&gt;
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">open the documents stored in SharePoint libraries with client application. As shown below:<br />

<p><br />
The settings you changed are what get the scheduled scans to run -- but the PC can't be sleeping or off. You need to change the power settings to prevent the PC from going to sleep. For some strange reason, MSE's scan will not prevent the PC from entering sleep
 state -- even while it is running.</p>

            <p>Hi Anne,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may seem long, but the key parts are in the first two paragraphs.&nbsp; If they work for you, you can skip the rest.&nbsp; They are either for enhanced or improved methods of doing it that allow for more automation and options, or cover troubleshooting if these
 options still don't work (which I don't expect to be the case and thus won't be needed).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here's a couple of things about scheduled scans. To run, the PC must be on and connected to the internet (it cannot be shutdown, in sleep mode, in hybrid sleep mode, or in hibernation). The power saving settings must be such that the PC does not shut
 down or go asleep during the scan (or it will be as if it never happened). <b>Scans do not begin precisely when scheduled - some can start an hour or so earlier or later than the officially set time (depending on Microsoft's servers and the loads at that time)</b>.&nbsp;
 Given your post, I suspect that the power settings are the problem.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I know some people who create their own Power Saver Setting called "Scanning" (though it can be called anything not otherwise already used) and have it set merely to bypass auto shutdowns when on AC power for the parts that need to run without all
 the other features that aren't needed (to honor the concept of "Power Saving" which doesn't bother me) and then before running a full scan or an hour or two before one is scheduled to start (since they don't start exactly on time and can start an hour or even
 more earlier or later than the defined time based on Microsoft's ability to handle the scan due to available resources and the number of people doing it at the same time - and I believe early happens because they anticipate it coming, have the resources now,
 and try to get it in before they otherwise get overwhelmed) will open Power Options manually change the setting to "Scanning" and thus accomplish the same thing as long as they remember to do it and then change it back after the scan is done - LOL!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Another somewhat more complicated but perhaps ultimately more effective solution is to create your own task in Task Scheduler and control all the aspects necessary to get it to run properly (do NOT adjust the current one for MSE, but create a totally
 separate one).&nbsp; Details about this can be found here <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/scheduled-scans-not-working/fd769043-f67e-4990-8805-a02427f22dff">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/scheduled-scans-not-working/fd769043-f67e-4990-8805-a02427f22dff</a>&nbsp;under the post by GreginMich.&nbsp; This is probably more complex than&nbsp;you need, but I present it since if you can get past the setup
 effort (which is considerable), the end result may be more to your liking (more automated) than the other approaches.&nbsp; Though sleep is not an issue for me because I always run scans during the day in the background and only use sleep at night (two nights sleep,
 one shutdown), I still do have a separate task for scans because MSE permits only one which I use for the daily quick scan but created another task for the bi-monthly full scan - but the complexities of sleep did not need to be addressed so I haven't actually
 done it precisely as Gregin has documented but it still should work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also, go to settings and check scheduled scans and uncheck the box that prevents them from starting unless the system is on and idle (if you're using the system when it's scheduled or it otherwise isn't idle - perhaps downloading Windows Updates or
 doing something else - then the scan will not start and will be missed). If a scan is missed it does not start at the next available time, but waits for the next scheduled scan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Services / scroll to Task Scheduler and make sure it is started and automatic. If not set it to automatic and restart it. If it won't start, click on the dependencies tab and do the same thing for
 each of the ones listed. If any of those won't start, continue with it's dependencies and do the same thing. When you get to the end, reverse course and Start the ones you couldn't because of the dependencies as you go until you get to Task Scheduler and hopefully
 it will now go to automatic and start. If you changed nothing read on. If you changed anything, reboot and see if that helps.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This could also be caused by an infection that got past MSE. If you suspect that (or want to rule it out), please proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><span>
 and SuperAntiSpyware:</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and then run a full Safety Scan from Microsoft:</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx</span></a><span>.
 These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations
 that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you
 can ignore the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</span></p>

            Hi, did what you said But that didn't make any difference. I then went to the social network and signed out and closed the page. Then went back and signed back in. But there still is not a list of online friends, and there is not a chat icon. Any ideas?

            Based on what we have observed on the mentioned social networking website, the online contacts will only show if you are accessing it via a computer browser. Since you are using your phone, it will automatically show you the mobile version.<br />
<br />
The mobile version of the said website's interface is limited compared to its desktop browser counterpart and setting it up to show you the desktop version will show compatibility issues.<br />
<br />
It is also possible that your chat setting availability is disabled on your profile which is why you are unable to view who's online. We recommend that you visit the appropriate support page regarding this.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Hi MuraliBANERJEE,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several factors why you cannot send an email to someone such as insufficient permission or a policy that blocked your message to receive it from the recipient's end. For to better isolate the issue, we would like to know the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When had the issue first occurred?</li><li>Have you received an email from the email address that you preferred to send a message?</li><li>Does the issue occur to other email addresses?</li><li>Are you using a personal or company email account?</li><li>What is the exact version of an email app that you are trying to use (Outlook desktop app, Outlook.com, or email client app)?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we would suggest that you check this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

 let you find some workarounds that might help to further isolate and resolve the issue.</p>

    <title>How to export all emails from a PST file as MSG files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to export all emails from a PST file as MSG files</h2>
                    <p>Good evening</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a PST file which contains some 14,000 emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to export all of the emails in the PST file to a local folder (perhaps on my hard drive) so they can be worked with directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried importing them all into my inbox, selecting all emails and then dragging them into the folder, but as some of the underlying emails have the same subject there are a number of conflicts (normally when there are naming conflicts I can just "copy
 and keep both files" but in this case, bizarrely, I only have the option to replace or not copy).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can achieve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ben</p>

            Excel crashing is mostly caused by hardware failure like overheated mainboard or memory errors. Sometimes it is worth cleaning dust out of case fan for better cooling.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I am a independent advisor wiling to help.
<br />
<br />I would recommend to disable add-ins.
<br />
<br />1- Try to open outlook in safe mode:
<br />Close the office app
<br />Press the windows key + R and write 
<br /> 
<br />For Excel: Type excel /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Outlook: Type outlook /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Word: Type winword /safe, and click OK.
<br />For PowerPoint: Type powerpnt /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Publisher: Type mspub /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Visio: Type visio /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />2- Disable the add-ins:
<br />Go to file &gt; options &gt; add-ins select COM and uncheck the first add-in checked, close outlook and make your test. If the issue persist repeat this step until disable all add-ins.
<br />
<br />I hope this work for you, if you have a further question Kent me know.
<br />

    <title>Sync To Do List and OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wmsrandy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync To Do List and OneNote</h2>
                    Microsoft has a very good "how to" explanation for syncing contacts and calendars from Outlook from my PC to WP8.&nbsp; Oddly enough, this explanation does not cover "Tasks" or "OneNote".&nbsp; Here's the mentioned weblink:<br />
<br />
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/people/sync-contacts-and-calendars-from-outlook-on-my-pc-to-my-phone<br />
<br />
I work from my own PC and do not use Exchange with Outlook, and thus suppose that I will use the Outlook Hotmail Connector.&nbsp; Does the Outlook Hotmail Connector also sync Tasks and OneNote?&nbsp; Does MS have a related "how to" explanation?<br />

            More about tasks......<br />
<br />
If you upgrade to Outlook 2013, that version of Outlook syncs directly to windows live and there is no need to use the Outlook Hotmail Connector.&nbsp; Outlook 2013 syncs Contacts, Calendar, AND Tasks to Windows Live.<br />
<br />
When I got my first windows phone 2 years ago and discovered that I could not sync tasks to my phone (there wasn't even a task component of the calendar in windows phone at the time), I searched around and found a way to sync tasks to my phone via
<a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Remember The Milk</a>.&nbsp; I upgraded from the free Remember the Milk account (which was web based only) to a
<a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">pro Remember the Milk account</a>, which allows me to sync my tasks from Outlook to my Remember the Milk account via the
<a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/milksync/outlook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MilkSync addin to Outlook</a>.&nbsp; Then I use a 3rd party Windows Phone app to sync my Tasks from my Remember the Milk account to my phone.&nbsp; I used the
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/winmilk-task-manager/2571dafd-7ee7-df11-a844-00237de2db9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WinMilk windows phone app</a> (which was the 1st and only RTM app for a long time), but in the last few months I've started using the
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/milkman/2d14a2ea-9445-4d46-b385-8b2e45f7f6d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Milkman windows phone app.</a><br />
<br />
When I first upgraded to a pro Remember the Milk account, I thought I would only use the pro account for a year....I knew my employer was transitioning over to Microsoft Exchange and I thought I would revert back to the free account after a year since I'd be
 able to sync my tasks to my phone via Microsoft Exchange.&nbsp; However, when it was time to renew my pro Remember the Milk account, I decided to renew it anyway simply because the WinMilk and Milkman apps allow me to sort my tasks by "categories" and tags (which
 is just another type of category and the apps allow me more flexibility over my tasks than the now native Tasks component of Calendar that is now a part of the Windows Phone OS.<br />
<br />
Lately, I've really started exploring what my pro Remember the Milk account gives me and I'm expanding my use of it.&nbsp; I've created my grocery list with it, which syncs to my phone but not to my Outlook tasks, and I'm using it for more lists (like annual house
 maintenance list, auto car maintenance, and such).&nbsp; So I think I'll be using Remember the Milk for quite a while and don't mind paying $25 a year for it.<br />

    <title>upgrade to internet explorer 11 and cannot open messages in outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> southessex  say:</h3>
<h2>            upgrade to internet explorer 11 and cannot open messages in outlook</h2>
                    <p>I have just installed internet explorer 11 and use outlook.com for my e mail.&nbsp; I was using Hotmail and have retained the Hotmail.co.uk e mail suffix.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This morning I could open my outlook account and click on any message to open it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I then downloaded internet explorer 11 and installed it then shut down my computer.&nbsp; Later I log onto my computer and opened my outlook account.&nbsp; I could see all of my message but which ever one I clicked on none of them would open.&nbsp; In addition the outlook
 menu did not appear at the top of the outlook screen.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I reset my internet explorer and re-started my computer.&nbsp; No change I still cannot open any message.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Both before resetting and afterwards I used another browser.&nbsp; In this browser I can open any outlook message.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What has Internet Explorer 11 down to outlook to stop me opening messages?</p>

<p>Add-ons are apps that <span>Internet Explorer</span> uses to interact with web content like videos and games. Some common add-ons are Adobe Flash, Quicktime, and Silverlight. Several add-ons come pre-installed in<span>Internet Explorer</span>, but many have

            1. I go no messages at all when I tried to open an e mail nothing happens. &nbsp;By that I mean that nothing changes on the screen and there is no other indication as to what, if anything, is happening.
<div><br />
<div>2. I have not problem opening any e-mail when using an alternative browser.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. I have disabled ALL add-ons. &nbsp;This has not changed anything.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. There is obviously a problem with Internet Explorer 11, if not why did installing it create such a problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. I cannot use Internet Explorer 10 as when I installed it I did not save a copy before installation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. I do have a copy of Internet Explorer 9 and may have to delete 11 and install 9 however this will mean that I will not have the protection of version 10.</div>
<div><br />
<div>7. How can I go back to version 10 without having a copy held on my computer from which to run the installation.</div>

            Nice to know that it is not just me.<br />
<br />
I am getting more than a little concerned that Microsoft expect users to download and instal updates to programs and that the very update creates more problems than any solutions that it is supposed to resolve.<br />
<br />
I tried to uninstall version 11 but it is not listed under Control Panel &gt; uninstall programs.&nbsp; If I go to the directory where the application is held Windows 7 prevents me from either deleting it or renaming the file.&nbsp; If I try to download version 10 I am
 told that I have already downloaded it but I cannot install it as the system always defaults to version 11.<br />
<br />
If an update has problems we need to be able to revert to a previous version.<br />
<br />
Microsoft - when can we have a fix for this problem?<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can now open my e mails.</p>

<p>I have removed version 11 by using system restore and managed to get back to internet explorer version 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Ideally, you would never, <em>EVER</em> use System Restore to "undo" an update, Service Pack, or IE upgrade (which often leaves the system in a "confused" or "torn" state)! Instead, uninstall the update, Service Pack, and/or IE upgrade &amp; reboot. If that doesn't
 correct the problem, <em>then</em> try System Restore.</p>

<p>Why didn't you uninstall <strong>Windows Internet Explorer 11 </strong>via the
<strong>Installed Updates</strong> window?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it the same computer as in this previous thread of yours and if so, is a Norton application still installed? =&gt;

            <p>This is the same computer that had problems with the last Windows Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I carried out the upgrade to version 11 by following a message from Microsoft that an upgrade was available and that I should download it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer is set to download upgrades from Microsoft automatically however the one to IE version 11 specifically asked for a positive response before it would download the upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not an IT professional so when I run an upgrade I do not expect that I will have to carry out a lot of "systems" work in order to get that upgrade to work.&nbsp; If there are issues with any Microsoft upgrade, and by that I mean and problems interacting
 with other programmes e.g. Norton Internet Security, then Microsoft should make non-IT professionals aware of those problems and to advise the appropriate action to take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for using system restore to go back to version 10, I did look in control panel &gt;programmes and carried out a search for IE 11 but could not find it.&nbsp; From your message I now know that it is located within the service pack lists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This still does not get over the issue of why IE 11 prevents me from opening my messages sent to my Hotmail address when I use the web version of outlook.&nbsp; This needs a simple fix not one that requires a major investigation.</p>

            <p>Norton Internet Security (NIS) v21.x is NIS 2014. It was released in September. If you first installed NIS in late March 2010, it would have been NIS v17.x (AKA NIS 2010). That being said...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fact: Norton and McAfee applications are notorious for not upgrading or&nbsp;uninstalling cleanly. The "leftovers" may be causing problems for
<em>years!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Did you (a) uninstall the McAfee free-trialware AND THEN (b) download/run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool &amp; reboot (c) BEFORE you installed NIS back in March 2010?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Have you ever done a clean install of NIS (vs. upgrading your current version)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Do you have backups of ALL the changes&nbsp;the Norton Utilities&nbsp;(or any other "registry cleaner")&nbsp;has EVER made to the computer? [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: Save my tired, old eyes &amp; skip the colored text, OK? Thanks!</p>

<p>I have never installed either one. There was an Microsoft Word 2007 that was on my computer before it had to be put in the shop. My computer had to be wiped/rebooted...etc in which everything was erased. So how is it that this program is in/on my computer?
 I cannot find it anywhere.</p>

            Hi JMac3339,
<br />
<br />I'm an independent advisor here to help.
<br />
<br />I'd suggest doing an online repair of the installation. That should fix it.

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />Try working with the Word Safe mode and check if it helps.
<br />Hold the windows key + Letter ‘R’ on the keyboard to launch the Run command &gt; Copy and paste the following command line in the open box and click Ok.
<br />
<br />For Excel: Type excel /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Outlook: Type outlook /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Word: Type winword /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For PowerPoint: Type powerpnt /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Publisher: Type mspub /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Visio: Type visio /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />If, word works properly do you need to disable add-ins:
<br />Go into Word / Excel/ PW:
<br />Click on File menu.
<br />Click Options.
<br />Click Add-ins.
<br />Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-Add-in.
<br />Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.
<br />Close the Word and restart it.
<br />
<br />In the link below explain how disable add-in:
<br />

<br />
<br />If, the procedures above didn't work, I refer to repair Office in the following link for more information:
<br />
<br />Go to Control Panel &gt;&gt; Add and Remove Programs and highlight Microsoft Office. Click on Remove. A menu will pop up allowing you to choose repair or reinstall. Try a Repair Online and verified after repair it fix.

<h2>            Word 2013 won&#39;t display any inserted PDF files</h2>

<p>
</p><p>"Display as icon" is not checked, but all that ever shows up in my document is an icon for the file. I've tried with several different PDF files, and always get the same result.</p>

            Do you have Adobe Reader (or Acrobat) installed? If you have either configured as the default PDF application, then Insert &gt; Object &gt; Object &gt; Create from File &gt; Browse to and pick the PDF. The first page of the PDF (an Adobe object) should be inserted
 . Note as objects cannot cross page boundaries, only the first page can be inserted.<br />

            <p>In your original post, you had a link illustrating your preferred technique. On that page it says:</p>
<p>"Double-click the PDF object in your document to open and view it in your default PDF reader." So you're getting all the functionality you're going to from that route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get a normal display of a PDF page by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Reader, set your page you want ti to appear in your document. The whole page does
<em>not</em> have to be visible on-screen.</li><li>Choose Edit&gt;<strong>Take a snapshot</strong>.</li><li>Click and drag on the PDF page, drawing a box selecting the area you want to appear. If the page is larger than you screen, keep holding the mouse button while dragging. The window will scroll and eventually include the entire page.</li><li>Let go of the mouse button. The Reader screen will flash, indicating that it has captured the page to the clipboard.</li><li>Open Windows <strong>Paint</strong>.</li><li>Paste the page image in.</li><li>Save as a <strong>jpg</strong> or <strong>png</strong> format image.</li><li>Insert the image in Word.</li></ol>

            <p>Is the check box shown below unchecked? That being the case it should insert the PDF first page as an object ... and certainly does here. I can't think of any reason (other than the use of an old version of Adobe Reader) why this would not work.</p>

<p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office seems to be unable to recognize your subscription. To address this correctly, please answer some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this the first time for you to setup Office on the computer with your monthly subscription?</li><li>Did this start after installing updates or applying changes on your computer?</li><li>What Office product are you opening when you encounter the error upon signing in?</li><li>Does the same error come up when launching other Office programs?</li><li>Have you verified that the service is added on your account?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to check if you have an active Office subscription for your Microsoft account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <a href="https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=13&amp;ct=1494989458&amp;rver=6.7.6643.0&amp;wp=MBI_SSL&amp;wreply=https:%2f%2faccount.microsoft.com%2fauth%2fcomplete-signin%3fru%3dhttps%253a%252f%252faccount.microsoft.com%252f%253flang%253den-US%2526refd%253daccount.live.com%2526refp%253dlanding&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=292666&amp;lw=1&amp;fl=easi2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a> and sign in with your Microsoft account.<br />
</li><li>Go to the <strong>Services &amp; subscriptions</strong> tab and check if the subscription to Office 365 is active.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You can also open <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/A-subscription-notice-appears-when-I-open-an-Office-365-application-4CABE32C-F594-4C0E-9191-3D3ADE10CCEB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Please accept the product key of my Office 365 Personal subscription. This product was bought at the same time as the Surface Pro 4 that I am using.<br />
Since I bought the Surface Pro, I have been using the free trial version of Office 365 first. This trial version had not been associated with my account as far as I know, though my account details were given at the time of purchase.&nbsp;<br />
Now the trial version has expired and I want to renew.<br />
You have taken my credit card details, the details are in my Microsoft account subscription status, and yet when I want to open an Office module, I am asked to activate and subsequently get the message that "the acount is not associated with this Office product"
 and if I use the product key, this key is not accepted.<br />
I restarted Windows but my Office product key is still invalid.</p>
<p>Do I need to reinstall?<br />
Another annoying thing was that I could not select any other language than German.</p>

    <title>Cannot play wma files with windows media player or convert these wma - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeteitelman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot play wma files with windows media player or convert these wma files to mp3s to play with my Ipod</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Microsoft's Groove application; and all of the songs I've downloaded using Groove are in the form of wma&nbsp;files. &nbsp;My primary goal is to convert these files into mp3s so that I can play my music using an Ipod. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I am only able to play these wma&nbsp;(Groove downloads) with the Microsoft Groove app. &nbsp;When trying to play these wma files using Windows Media Player, I receive an error message. &nbsp;In addition, I'm unable to play these downloaded files using Itunes.
 &nbsp;In short, I'm only able to play these wma files using the MS Groove application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to remove the DRM protections using various software applications but have had no success. &nbsp; Based upon my Internet research there are two issues. &nbsp;The first is that the files are DRMs. &nbsp;Next, and more importantly, I learned that in order to play
 these files using Windows Media Player, Itunes, or using my Ipod, &nbsp;I need to have "playback licenses" for each wma&nbsp;that I downloaded using MS Groove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, at this time I can only play the Groove downloads using the Groove app. &nbsp;I cannot convert these files to Mp3 format, since I don't have "playback licenses" for each of the downloaded wma&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In sum, the primary problem is not that these files are DRMs; rather the primary problem is that I don't have a "playback license" for each of these wma&nbsp;files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I don't know what "playback licenses" are. &nbsp;Yet I do know that in order for me to play these files using Windows Media Player, Itunes or my Ipod, I need to have playback licenses for each of these songs. &nbsp;At this point I'm only able to play these
 songs with the MS Groove app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joe&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your response. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I have an IPod&nbsp;Mp3 player, not an IPod&nbsp;Touch. &nbsp; Let me make sure that I understand your answer. &nbsp; It's my understanding that the reason I cannot play the wma files on Windows Media Player is not because the files
 are DRMs; rather it's because I don't have "playback licenses" for each of these audio files. &nbsp;So my question, more specifically, is not how I can circumvent the DRM protections, but rather how I can obtain &nbsp;"playback licenses for each of these audio files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, I would have assumed that I'd be able to play these wma&nbsp;files using Windows Media Player, since Windows Media Player does play wma files, and that the mere act of playing these files (which I acquired from Groove, should still be playable using
 Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I know that with respect to certain other music subscription services, I am not limited to playing audio files (which I've acquired legally via said services), only via a particular music playing app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, let me raise two additional matters. &nbsp;First, I've paid MS Groove in order to download these files. &nbsp;As such, I clearly have the right to play any such files using my Ipod Mp3 player. &nbsp;And second, I believe that you are confusing the following issues:
 &nbsp;(a) the act of circumventing the DRMs and (b) the act of obtaining "playback licenses" for these wma files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could address my questions in more detail, I'd greatly appreciate it. &nbsp;And by the way, if the only issue of importance is that the files are DRM protected, then I'd easily be able to remove the DRM protections and be able to convert these files from
 wmas&nbsp;to Mp3s. &nbsp;I would we able to accomplish such simply by downloading one of the numerous free and/or paid DMR removal software programs. &nbsp;So, if you could perhaps address more specifically the issues I raised in my original post and in this follow-up response,
 I'd very much appreciate such.</p>

</p><p><span>I have only one more question. &nbsp;When it comes to DVDs (movies), you can easily decrypt the movies using commercially available software. &nbsp;I would have thought that the same would be the case with respect to DRM
 audio files. &nbsp;Yet, this is not the case. &nbsp;So, if you don't mind informing me, then my question is why is it so easy to find software which can easily decrypt video files -- i.e. movies on DVDS; yet, and at the same time, I cannot find any software capable
 of removing the DRMs from audio files? &nbsp;Just curious. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And one last question. &nbsp;in your response, you stated that once my subscription ends, I won't be able to play any of the acquired music even with MS Groove -- i.e. unless I purchased the mp3 files. &nbsp;I wasn't aware
 of the fact that I could purchase mp3 versions of my wma files. &nbsp;Could you let me know how I can purchase the mp3s. &nbsp;Thanks?&nbsp;</span><br />

            What part of "don't discuss drm removal" did you not understand? It is illegal. Video and audio (and ebooks). All current subscription services with the possible exception... For now....of Rhapsody use newer DRM with buried license authentication which
 requires online validation. This is why old non-internet mp3 players that can't use the new software do not work with subscription content. &nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I never discussed the "TECHNICAL PROCESS" of removing DRM protections from the wma&nbsp;music files I legally purchased/acquired from Microsoft Groove. &nbsp;Instead, I simply asked why it's so difficult to remove DRM protections from audio files, while it's extremely
 easy to decrypt movies on DVDs. &nbsp; Anyone can purchase legally&nbsp;available software capable of decrypting DVDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for the record, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is currently considering a lawsuit in which one of the parties has asserted that it's legal to decrypt DVDs under certain circumstances. &nbsp;So, your statement that removing DRM protections is unequivocally
 illegal is probably incorrect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, DON'T accuse me of discussing the removal of DRM protections in such a manner as to provide others with the technical knowledge necessary to overcome DRM protections. &nbsp; If I knew how to remove the DRM protections with respect to music I legally purchased
 from Microsoft Groove, I never would have posted my original question via this forum.</p>

<h2>            Web interface needs a little work.</h2>
                    1. Many of my contacts don't have First, Last Name so they display blank in the browser page. I found the web interface really usefull for weeding out a bunch of junk but my the first 20 pages have no display information, just the phone number. Adding
 the Company column would be great.<br />
<br />
2. Adding a link to MyPhone from my Windows Live profile, the same as Spaces, Photos, Office Live, etc. Would be nice for single sign on.<br />
<br />
3. Being able to select photos uploaded to MyPhone and send them to my Windows Live Photo album(s) would be nice.<br />
<br />
4. Live Contacts &amp;&nbsp;Skydrive are loosly coupled, it would be nice to see MyPhone converged as well so there's only one contact list and the bakcup data from my phone appeared as a Skydrive folder. Afterall, this is a great replacement for using desktop Outlook
 and ActiveSync. If the Documents on MyPhone could me converged with Office Live that would really tie all the pieces together. I'd finally have a single web portal to all my data. BTW... they need to work on that Office Live link issue. Once you leave Windows
 Live to Office Live, there's no going back to Home on Windows Live. <br />
<br />
Just a suggestion overall someone at MS might be interested in (don't spam me because it's the wrong forum). With a little work, Spaces could become the perfect dashboard with the use of Silverlight and some creative modules. Right now the Skydrive module isn't
 very useful until the icons are dropped down to the size simialr to the desktop so it doesn't take up so much space. But if you think about it. If it was re-designed as Explorer, MyPhone, Photos, etc. could be looked at (for navigation purposes) just like
 a desktop computer. We get 25GB of storage. It's Windows away from home.

Hi Iam really glad that windows has come up with my phne service. Till now, i have been using dashwire and vufone online backup service. I completely agree that compared to others my phone web interface needs to made more user friendly. I have synced only contacts
 to check the service and found that you cannot look for contacts easily in it. to lookup for contacts you have to jumppages everytime. I am sure you all brainy people will do something about it.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Windows 10 Technical Preview Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you are facing could be caused due to corrupt system files or software conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For better understanding of the issue, I want to know:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp;Which build&nbsp;of Windows 10&nbsp;have you installed?</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;What&nbsp;happens when you try to launch start menu?</p>
<p>3) What is the make and model of your computer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To fix the issue, I suggest you to follow the methods below and check the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Run SFC scan.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can refer to the following Microsoft article to repair corrupt files using SFC tool.
</span></p>
<p><span>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After running SFC scan check if the issue is fixed, if not please proceed with method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Perform a Clean Boot.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Place the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. You may follow the article mentioned to perform a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot allows the Windows operating system to launch without any additional programs or services running when you turn the computer on. This allows you to determine if computer issues are caused by a program or service that starts up when you
 boot the machine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Refer:</span></strong><span> <span style="color: rgba(46, 117, 182, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(46, 117, 182, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After performing the troubleshooting steps, check the section
<strong><span>“how to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the above suggestions and let us know the results.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi Keely
<br />
<br />If you are referring to your Skype Name that begins with live: . . . I am sorry that cannot be changed, that is a unique identifier generated by the Skype system
<br />
<br />This is the most requested feature in Skype, so hopefully Microsoft is looking into a way to allow us to change that Skype Name for a future update . . .
<br />
<br />The other name in Skype is your Display Name, you can change that on this page, by clicking 'Edit Profile' . . .

<p>Thanks, I believe it happened after Microsoft updated Windows 7.&nbsp; The computer had to do a restart and the next time I attempted to open Frontpage. I got that message.</p>
<p>I've decided that since FrontPage is no longer being supported and Microsoft no longer checks to see if up dates to Windows 7 &nbsp;affects non supported programs that I would switch to Microsoft Expressions.&nbsp; I understand it is the replacement for FrontPage.</p>
<p>I'm able to use FrontPage on my wife's computer running Windows XP.</p>

<p>There is a free trial for Expression Web from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/expression" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/expression</a><br />
Better to try the trial before laying out funds for something that may not work.&nbsp; The trial is the complete Expression Web, but time limited to 60 days (get it today, and I believe the trial will expire on February 28).</p>
<p>I am currently running FrontPage 2003 without any problems on 2 fully updated Windows 7 installations&nbsp; - 1 32 bit, the other 64 bit, so I do not think your problem is caused by a Windows 7 update, but I have no clues as to what did cause the problem.</p>

<p>I was told that the 2003 version, would work. &nbsp;However, I have the 2002 version.<br />
I was also told the Microsoft does not check to see if updates to its windows 7, will effect out dated, non supported versions of its older software.<br />
That is what I believe happened the night after I last used FrontPage on my computer with windows7.&nbsp; The next morning I had a message on the computer the computer had been shut down for updates.&nbsp; It was after that when I attempted to use FrontPage that the
 problem occured.</p>
<p>I figured I would buy the Expressions over an order 2003 version.</p>
<p>I sure hope the new software fixes the problem.&nbsp; If it doesn't I should have some support from Microsoft on the newly purchased software, I would guess.</p>

    <title>Word and Powerpoint 2007 won&#39;t close - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vermontlaura  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word and Powerpoint 2007 won&#39;t close</h2>
                    I have asked this question before but got no answers that solved my problem. I recently replaced my hard drive and did a new install of Windows 7 and Office 2007. Sometimes (most of the time, actually) when I tell both Word and Powerpoint to close, they
 continue to run in the background. The only way I know this is when I try to remove my flashdrive, it's locked by either Word or Powerpoint. When I open the Task Manager, they are still there and the only way I can get them to close is to get Task Manager
 to "end" the process. First, having these programs run in the background wastes computer resources, but it also tells me that something somewhere is corrupted. So, I'm hoping someone can tell me what to do to fix this and how these program files got corrupted
 so soon after a complete reinstall. I have tried Microsft's "fix-it" tool but nothing has improved.&nbsp;
