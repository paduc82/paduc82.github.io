<h2>            when i&#39;m talking on skype i&#39;m hearing too much noise while i talk but my microphone is working correctly and there is no problem from the server</h2>
                    when i'm talking on skype i hear too much noise with the time i talk, but when my contact talks to me i don't hear any thing which is noisy, except when any sound around me is recorded by the microphone, i mean that if my contact is talking and i muted
 my microphone while he is talking to me i hear his voice very clearly, and the same when he mute his microphone and i talk i don't hear any noise, but when we unmute both our microphones and i start talking or any sound is going out from any where beside me
 and the microphone got that sound then i hear it but like a very noisy sound, ane while my contact is talking with me and i'm breathing then i hear my breathing in my headphones also but in a disturbing way and very noisy voice, and the most weird thing is
 that there is no problem from the server, and there is no problem in my laptop except the problem about shortcuts which are not opening which i've mentioned recently, but i tried skype on my nokia phone and i got the same noisy saounds in my headphones or
 earphones<br />
so i hope you can find me a solution<br />
thank you all

            Did changing the boost setting reduce the noise volume at all?<br />
<br />
Ensure the "listen" option is disabled: open the devices properties again and on the Listen tab ensure "Listen to this device" is unchecked.<br />
In addition, if there is an enhancement or custom tab, ensure that any options are disabled.<br />
<br />
What sound device do you have installed?<br />
You can check by opening the Recording Devices again and there should be the name such as Intel, SoundMAX or RealTek - let us know the full name that is shown.
<br />
You may also go to start and type the manufacturer name in the search box to see if a special configuration program is installed - I know SoundMAX and RealTek have them and I believe Intel may as well.<br />
If one is installed, try opening it and check the options for any enhancement options and disable them.<br />

<p>I am afflicted with Windows 10. The latest problem is that I can't turn off my Canon Pixma printer. It starts and works OK, but it simply will not shut down.</p>

            <p>Canon isn't Microsoft. This is just a user Community forum. This got posted to "Windows Insider Preview" section, which is for pre-release Windows testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But maybe holding the power button down for 5+ seconds will work. &nbsp;I think that is how I turn off my Canon printer. Normally it just stays on, because it is on my wireless network so that anyone can use it.</p>

<h2>            Trying to upgrade pirated windows 7 to Windows 10</h2>
                    I bought my friends computer and he had a illegal copy of Windows 7 Home Premium downloaded on it and I dont know how to activate it. I just bought a copy of Windows 10 Home (legal) on Amazon. How do I upgrade? I can't find the Activate Windows anywhere.
 If i have a legitimate key for windows 10 do I need to activate windows 7 first? Also I do not have a CD-ROM.

            <p>You don't necessarily need to format the hard disk. Since your Windows 10 Home is a full version license, you can perform a direct upgrade from the non-genuine Windows 7 Home Premium install.</p>

            Not only it would not play, it sorta disappears, I turned on software rendering instead of GPU, and now video plays, but scrolling is very glitchy. And its on SP4 i7 +&nbsp;16GB ram. Edge performance on Tumblr website is appalling.

<h2>            How do I check my balance after I redeemed a digital gift card&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to buy an Xbox live game for my PC, but it does not give me the option to buy with the money I have on my account. Recently I redeemed an digital gift card from Cyberpower, and I have not made any purchases at all on the windows store, but I
 cannot check my balance either way. I might be looking at the wrong place, but I still don't know where to check my balance and my 90 day expiration for my gift card has not expired. I already looked at the window's support pages but I still am not able to
 find it. Can any one help me? I need to know where I can check my account balance, and why I cannot buy games from my account balance even though I still should have around 100 dollars in it.&nbsp;

<h2>            Im stuck in Reavers Mansion on the Wheel of Misfortune quest - GLITCH Fable 3</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Hey, need serious help. Went to Reavers Mansion to do the Wheel of Misfortune and as soon as I held down "A" at the wheel to begin, the doors shut but the then nothing happened. Iv been stuck there even after turning my xbox off and back on, un-installing
 and re-installing the game to my hard drive, even removing my saved "Hero 1" onto a pen drive and then back again, I noticed that the wheel was in a different position, but I'm still stuck. Specially as I can't even do a different quest or fast travel to anywhere
 else until I finish the quest. I don't want to freaking start again <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-12.gif" /> . Any ideas? thanks</p>

<p>I encountered this same glitch. Its a glitch that STILL has not been addressed. (Or its stumped Lionhead studios.)</p>
<p>I wish they would just make it so you can leave the area via fast travel. I wish Lionhead would fix this- I want to get the rest of the stuff! We all deserve something for our frustration and ruined main characters!</p>
<p>To my knowledge:</p>
<p>-Clearing your cache does nothing.</p>
<p>-un-installing the quest packs does nothing.</p>
<p>-playing couch co-op on someone else's name does nothing. (Even if you finish that damn quest. Btw if you get a really high score Reaver makes a joke about your social Life. Lol!)</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro Upgrade key transfer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> designergreetings  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Upgrade key transfer</h2>
                    I have a few tablets which came with Windows 10 Home which I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro via the built-in Microsoft Store. All of these tablets have broken and will no longer charge... Is there anyway to move these upgrade licenses to new machines? I have
 spent roughly $1000 on upgrades and need to buy approx 10 more tablets but they all come with Win10Home and I need these to be Pro, but don't want to spend another $1000 or $100 per device to upgrade these new ones.

<h2>            Realtek Speakers One Louder Than the Other</h2>
                    <div>I have a Lenovo Y510P laptop running on Windows 10, and after some use I realized that my speaker sounds are no longer balanced, meaning my left speaker is louder than my right speaker. I have
 tried troubleshooting the sound driver, disabling and enabling the sound drivers, and uninstalling the realtek high definition audio driver and reinstalling&nbsp;<br />
</div>
<div>, or technically updating, to the newest driver from their website. None of those has fixed the unbalanced sound. The only way for me to get balanced sound is by going to the sound driver properties
 and balancing it from there. Is there a way for me to fix the sound so that I do not have to use the balance to get the two speakers to sound at the same volume? I mean, when I got this laptop both speakers operated at same volume without the need of balancing
 in the properties menu...&nbsp;</div>

<p>The no audio problem is not a Windows 7 problem.&nbsp; It is a Skype latest version upgrade problem.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what is causing this and how to rectify it.&nbsp; Skype to mobole has been working perfectly but as soon as I upgraded to Skype 8.25.0.5 the audio no longer works but all the audio tests pass.&nbsp; It seems no connection is made to the mobile.&nbsp; The
 mobile rigs and answers but no comms is possible..</p>

                    I have just downloaded the new Skype software update and it now does not recognise/enable use of my laptop's in-built camera.&nbsp; So whilst I can see the person that I have called they cannot see me.&nbsp; The Skype info suggests that this is too bad &amp; my laptop
 must be too old (which it is not!).&nbsp; Can this situation be fixed?

            <p>There's a few dozen vendors I know of that provide face-recognition and finger-print recognition login services, but if you haven't installed any that's probably not it.&nbsp; In fact if you made no intentional changes, it even raises the possibility of something
 malicious like a virus.</p>

    <title>I can&#39;t use my console - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noname973  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t use my console</h2>
                    
<p>because Microsoft sold me a *** defective piece of hardware, that is no longer under warranty. Then they have the nerve to charge ME to repair it. Even though EVERYONE knows that it is a broken, poorly engineered, and rushed product. Then YEARS LATER they
 put out the same console and final fix it, and everyone pretends that nothing was ever wrong with the xbox in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what im going to do and what it means financially for microsoft:</p>
<p>Windows, Office, not using those anymore -$300</p>
<p>Not renewing my xbox live subscription (already expired, thought about renewing it) -$50</p>
<p>Buying a ps3 -$400</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congrats you've lost around $750 dollars because you have the NERVE to charge ME $100 for YOUR mistake. If this gets removed for any reason it'll just show how avoiding the problem is so much easier than actually confronting it and fixing it, and how little
 microsoft cares about individual customers. Show some customers some respect if they invest so much money into your product.</p>

            <p>So let me get this straight. &nbsp;You are no longer going to use items that you already paid for because an old piece of equipment that you've had for years has finally died and you don't want to pay for repairs. &nbsp;Also, instead of paying $100 for repairs, you have decided to pay $400 for a different console (not including replacing games you already own). &nbsp;Have I got that about right? &nbsp;Doesn't really seem financially smart but who am I to judge.</p>
<p>Have fun with your new system and all the woes and problems it comes with.</p>

<p>yep when the ps3 breaks due to wear and tear like the xbox and you didn't bother to buy warranty you will be paying 150-200dollars for repairs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>every device does have wear and tear this is why you must buy warranty if you do not want to pay repair costs</p>

    <title>Hibernation error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flightgeek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hibernation error</h2>
                    Hey all,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>&nbsp;Here's my question background</b>,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I initially planned to format my USB key into two separate partitions, but never managed to do it. However in the process, I installed paragons partition manager. After the installation I believe my hibernation ability stopped. I clicked hibernate, screen
 turns off, led lights still on, 5 seconds later, the login screen returns.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Being a DIY kinda person, I read and attempted to use the cmd line and enter powercfg.exe hibernation on (there's a slash in there somewhere) to no avail. Then I attempted to assign my system reserved partition a drive letter. That brought back a hibernation.
 However I don't think that is the solution. I have made a system repair disk in case of anything.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Question: </b><br />
how do I safely return the system to have a functional hibernate mode, have the system reserved partition hidden , and the hidden system reserved partition preserved without doing &nbsp;a complete system restore.
<br />
</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>System info:</b></div>
<div>Laptop&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hdd has three partitions, os (140gb), system reserved (100mb), &nbsp;and pqservice (12gb)</div>
<div>W7 sp1<br />
<br />
I was thinking of removing the drive letter thru disk management, but am unfamiliar with whether or not, I would encounter a problem afterwards if I did that (in regards to recovery from the hdd in the future). So I am gonna put that off.
<br />
<br />
In addition, I did uninstall the partition manager from paragon, restarted the system, hibernation had the same issue.
<br />

Thanks for the response, I appreciate it!<br />

1) The only changes I have done so far, were installing Partition manager, then changing active system reserved partition (100mb) to inactive and making the OS (140Gb) to active. This in turn led me to have a bootmgr.exe error. I booted with a Mini bootable
 partition manager, and changed the active to the system reserved partition, thereby restoring the active flags before my tinkering, and made the the OS (140gb) partition to inactive.
<br />
<br />
I didnt test the hibernate function after i had made the mistake of changing the active status. I did however check after i changed back the active flag to the system reserved partition. This is where I first encountered the hibernate problem. I did find a
 solution, where i assigned the system reserved partition (100mb) a drive letter. This solved the hibernate function problem (i could hibernate by assigning a drive letter). However I could now see my system reserved partition, which I did not before.
<br />
<br />
However, I went ahead and remove the drive letter, and again I am back to no hibernate function. I was wondering what else I could do to restore the hibernate function.
<br />
<br />
<b>Outcomes to your solutions</b><br />
Method1: Found and fixed all issues. Hibernate functioning properly: no<br />
Method 2: Clean boot did. Hibernate functioning properly: no<br />
Method 3:<b> </b>graphics software is upto date after trying to find an update. Hibernate functioning properly: no

<h2>            Sleep Mode Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    After the upgrade from Win 7 Pro to Win 10 Pro there is no sleep option. Other computers have upgraded to Win 10 Home they have sleep mode option. Where is sleep mode in Win 10 Pro?

                    Windows Media Player used to add a picture of the album cover when I ripped a cd to the library. It now only added a picture of a music note like it was a unknown album.

            <p>No problem - first have a look at the library and privacy tabs (in WMP - Organize - Options) and set these much as I have mine here (below) - this ensures you get full available information (usually!) when you insert a disc without any subsequent unwanted
 input. The 'update' box (arrowed) in 'privacy' definitely needs to be unchecked (but leave&nbsp;'Display' checked). If these are already OK it's probably down to the database</p>
<p>Because there are numerous versions of some discs in circulation, the db may link to an 'import' version or something unexpected (sometimes they come up in Oriental characters!) in which case (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">before ripping</span>)
 click on 'Find Album Information' on the artwork icon. You may well find another version that includes artwork/correct titles etc. by doing a manual search.
</p>
<p>Frankly, in my opinion&nbsp;FAI has never been the greatest of databases and I'm not sure how well it is being maintained these days, so there may be occasions when you do&nbsp;need to make corrections yourself. Preferably do these

<p>Hi Regile,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I tried running my PC in safe mode but I do get the same problem. However I found the culprit. It's my Viewsonic LCD monitor which runs on Windows XP and Vista. I tried running the PC using my ASUS LCD plug and play monitor and the problem gone. &nbsp;So
 I do the "Run programs made for previous versions of Windows" test and totally resolve the problem.</p>

<p>Trying to Play Titanfall digital copy that came WITH the console, we bought the Titanfall edition one.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>When we try and play the game it comes up the "Press A to play screen", after seeming like it's going to load, it times out after a few seconds and just re-displays "Press A to play"<br />
<br />
We have tried</p>
<p>1.) Uninstall, delete, re-downloaded and re-installed</p>
<p>2.) Rebooting xbox by holding down on main xbox logo on front of console for ten seconds after power down, and then rebooting it</p>
<p>Any help would be great. It has not been working for about a week and a half.</p>

            <p>Strange. &nbsp;I have looked online for others with the same issue and they found the following solution helpful:</p>
<p>Press and hold the prower button on the xbox till it turns off. Then unplug all the cords from the back for 2 mins and plug it back in then power the console back on. Once it is powered up go to the settings then go to disc and blu-ray. In the second colum click on persistent storage then select the option to clear persostent data. Wait while it clears, after it is done you should be able to launch the game.</p>
<p>I know you did most of that already but try following that to the letter and see if it helps.</p>

<p>Sorry this took so long. I was out of the office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your issue, if it's a different model, most probably, your phone doesn't support it. If the phone you are comparing to is the same brand and model, you should contact your device manufacturer because they will have to
<em>facilitate </em>the update. Although based on your first post, they already said that they are not working on an update. It probably means that there will be no updates since Windows 10 Mobile itself is no longer under development.</p>

            The Windows 7 compatibility website says about the Samsung&nbsp; <strong>YP-T9JAB:
</strong><span>This product installs automatically without extra software. My</span> Samsung&nbsp;
<strong>YP-T9JB</strong><span> does NOT.<br />

Samsung's website mentions firmware updates, software and manuals for the player but no mention of a driver for the product. So thanks for the suggestions but I am still searching.<br />

            <span>Samsung's website mentions firmware updates, software and manuals for the player but no mention of a driver for the product. Microsoft's site was no more helpful. So thanks for the suggestions but I am still searching.</span>

<h2>            CBS MUM Corrupt 0x00000000 on Win 7 Pro</h2>
                    <p>On a laptop running Win 7 Pro, I've been trying to run Windows updates and tried multiple solutions listed on the Microsoft site but nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran SFC/Scannow which found corruption and could not fox the problems and displayed this messge: Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth but it errorred out with the message DISM but it said it could not run in this context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted in safe move and ran sfc/scannow and it found two files it could not repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a SFC Details report and extracted these errors. Any suggestions on how to resolve them?</p>

            <p>Hi Maria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed an in place upgrade using the Windows 7 SPI ISO that matches the O/S I'm using. The upgrade ran properly and now IE is back to IE8. I tried running Windows update and it never comes back with any updates to install. I rebooted multiple tiles,
 set the GPO in Windows administrative templete to allow the local admin to run Windows Update. That didn't make any change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I install WSUS and ran it two days in a row. It installed 63 Windows updates and&nbsp; number of Office 2007 updates but IE8 is still installed. Unfortunately with IE8, I can't browse properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the Win7 Windows Update FixIT app from Microsoft using Firefox. That doag file would not run and just provided a vague error in the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you assist is getting WSUS to update or getting Windows update to run properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Tony</p>
