    <title>N8 Camera - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            N8 Camera</h2>
                    
<p>I am now the "proud" owner of an N8, after having used the X6 for 12 months. I bought the new phone mainly because of the supposed improved camera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On first look, this would appear so, but then I took photos with both light and shadow - and noticed just how much noise there was in the shadows. In all cases, the ISO was around 120, so this could not have contributed to the noise. In all photos, it was
 daytime and the setting was on Automatic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, played around with the settings, but this does not improve the results. I also checked some dark photos taken with the X6 and found no evidence of bad noise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The noise in the shadows is so bad, when trying to lighten it in PS, one can see vertical bands in large areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else noticed this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sounds like the camera in your N8 may be defective. As I've said in another thread, I'm extremely happy with N8's camera. In auto mode my N8 performs better than my Canon PowerShot S90 also in auto mode.</p>

<p>It is a shame, as everything else works perfectly. However, I bought the N8 just for the reason that the camera was supposed to be superior to other models. I had read lots of reports before, all praising the camera. I also saw sample photos&nbsp;taken under&nbsp;varying
 conditions by 'The Media Guru" and a few others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, one expects some noise under low lighting conditions, but not worse than my very old Sony with 3 MP&nbsp;</p>

<p>The S90 is a top camera. You shouldn't compare it with the N8. I've had 3 N8 an compared them to the S95. Even the N8 without any blurry spots couldn't reach the S95 quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it's the best camera phone and maybe better than many entry level cameras. But S90/95 is another class of camera. I strongly disagree with you.</p>

<p>You may disagree with me, but in my experience when shooting in <strong>full auto mode, in-doors</strong>, the N8 produces photos with less noise and better exposed. In manual mode on the other hand, the S90 makes the N8 look like a VGA camera.</p>

<p>OK the Auto mode on S90/95 is really **bleep** :) But who cares, a small turn of the wheel &nbsp;to the P-mode and everything is nearly perfect :) (maybe a bit less exposure)</p>

<p>I have taken a lot of photos with the N8 camera, and I am convinced that the shiny angled metallic bezel around the lens casts unwanted light under certain lighting conditions - I noticed it today especially taking photos inside where the main daylight was
 from above, coming through skylights. &nbsp;The view looks hazed out, even before you take the shot, and it is the same when exposed. &nbsp;Moving the camera position removes this, but I find that limiting, as if I get the haze having framed the shot as I wish, there
 is no other position that gives the same shot. &nbsp;So, I either put up with the haze to get the shot I want, or move to a different angle, lose the haze, and get a less than ideal shot. &nbsp;I am fairly certain this is a design fault related to the camera.</p>

            <p>I use three providers for email Cogeco web mail through my cable provider set up to download into Outlook.</p>
<p>I set up an account with Microsoft for Windows Live mail and I also have a gmail account.</p>
<p>I can't&nbsp;log onto any of&nbsp;the Microsoft sites, games, Outlook, or Web page log in link.</p>
<p>I was unable to use any of the log in short cuts on Internet Explorer web page.</p>
<p>I did not explore to far as I was frustrated and just rolled my computer back to a time prior to the update and had no problems.</p>
<p>I do not get an error message as I can not even enter password, the password area will not accept any typed letter or number, cursor just keeps flashing dots for the password do not register.</p>
<p>I did down load Explorer 11 from the web page as that is were the update took me on the link. I had not requested to use explorer 11, it was a automatic upgrade fro 10 to 11.</p>

    <title>N8 Ovi Social - &#38;quot&#59;Unable to connect gateway. Please try - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mckee---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N8 Ovi Social - &#38;quot&#59;Unable to connect gateway. Please try again.&#38;quot&#59; on 3G&#47;EDGE&#47;GSM</h2>
                    
<p>Hi support,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an updated Ovi Social installed in my N8 and works perfectly if i am in a WLAN. However, when I am mobile (driving/walking) i use 3G/EDGE/GSM to connect to the internet. Browsing, Nimbuzz, Mail exchange, Opera works perfectly without any difficulty
 of anything. But when I open Ovi Social, it just allows me to log on using my Nokia Account. Whenever I select Facebook/Twitter it gives out a message "Unable to connect gateway. Please try again.". I used the Connectivity Analyzer and start the diagnostics,
 i&nbsp;found out that there is no gateway assigned in the IP configuration. Anyway, it still displays Ping Internet Passed. I don't know if this has something to do with the error. Still I am having this problem. Any idea if this is related and if included in the
 fix coming this January 2011?</p>

<p>I suspect that Nokia's server is not up to scratch. I have tried numerous times to update my Ovi suite software, and the server either bombs out whilst downloading, or just gives an "unable to connec" error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From spending some time on Google, this seems to be a long-term problem, as the same problem has been reported back in June...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps Nokia cannot afford to buy a larger server...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you tried connecting on a different Wifi connection? See if you experience the same problem on a different network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Try installing Connectivity Analyzer. It helps you understand the basics of network connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Have you tried setting the priority of your internet connection? I always put my WLAN connection on the top priority and on the last is my 3G/EDGE/GSM connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Have you tried setting Internet as default in your connection?</p>

<p><em>"Mine's 2.2.1.23, how about yours?"</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed the version which was included in a mini-CD that came with the phone. It is version 2.2.0.241, and THAT's why I have been trying to update it!.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that the update server appears to be unable to handle the traffic volume, as it is VERY SLOW and then stops working after about 50% of the file hes been downloaded. I know that the problem is not on my side, as I can download quite fast from
 other international sites...</p>

<p>Have you tried enabling "platform-applications" in the facebook security menu? I.e. Account-&gt;security settings-&gt;applications and websites-&gt;enable platform applications. I´ve had the same problem and it was solved by this.</p>

<p>I did come right, eventually, by downloading the 3.0 beta version from their website. as a rule I don't normally fiddle with beta software, but in this case I was quite desperate, and it turned out to be working pretty well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This still does not absolve Nokia from not having enough capacity on their update server, though - or from shipping their phones with untested, poorly written software included in the setup disk...</p>

<h2>            Embedding PDF documets in Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello, having some trouble. I'm trying to embed a PDF document and Display as Icon; however, I'm getting an error.&nbsp; My steps are as follows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From an open excel document I go to Insert--&gt;Object--&gt;Create from File then browse to the PDF and select the checkbox for "Display as Icon." After doing this I get an error message that says "The program used to create this
 object is AcroExch. That program is not installed on your computer. To edit this object, you must install a program that can open the object".</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This only occurs in Excel and only on the 64-bit version, all other office products such as Word and PowerPoint embed the PDF files without an error.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>has &nbsp;anyone else seen this particular error for Excel 2016 64-bit and is there a fix for, thank you.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Blank space appearing before Contact full name in list view &#40;using Connector&#41;</h2>
                    I installed Connector to sync my pc to my Lumia 900 with Microsoft Phone OS. Syncing worked fine. Now in the last week, each new Contact that is added to the PC in Outlook (using the Connector address book) appears first in the List view because the "Full
 Name" field has a blank space before the first name. When I open the individual Contact, no space shows. If I edit and re-enter the Full Name, it gets sorted correctly without the blank space, until the next time I open Contacts and the blank space is back
 for all the newly added contacts in the list view. Have tried to fix by deleting the blank space after the comma in the "File As" field and the same - the name sorts correctly after the edit, but the blank space appears the next time I open Contacts. This
 only happens with new Contacts sine the problem appeared. Previous Contacts are not affected by the "blank space bug".<br />

    <title>Shared regular mailbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alex31e5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shared regular mailbox</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have the following setup:</p>
<p>Each user has their own personal mailbox: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Incoming email to each user is copied to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Outgoing email is copied to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>So everybody can follow what the other users are doing, cover them and it is good for training purposes. However, the problem is that users sometime reply from office forgetting to change the FROM field and choose ther personal mailbox. Any ideas how to
 fix this? The Office mailbox is a regular one and not a shared mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes this is possible to achieve. What you need to do is, perform following tasks from Exchange Admin Center (EAC).</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Recipients -&gt; Mailboxes</li><li>Search the common mailbox</li><li>Edit by clicking on the pencil icon</li><li>Select mailbox delegation</li><li>Add users to Full Access section.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5ada7ca-2262-48c3-a01f-c3e9a5a7d06a" /></li></ol>
<p>Users who have Full Access will only be able to access the mailbox to read and manipulate items in it. Any attempt to send from this mailbox will fail if they are not in either Send As or Send on Behalf permissions boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once this is done, make sure to remove the existing mail account from Outlook. (I assume you used the regular user name and password to add it.) Then follow below steps to add the mailbox to Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Account Settings<br />

            <p>Hi Muditha,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the set-up is a little different: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is a regular mailbox that can be accessed from OWA and it could be added separately to Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should we consider converting it to a shared one? Our Microsoft rep informed us that there is a size limit for the shared mailbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I understood the setup. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is as same as you would delegate a shared mailbox. When you delegate either a shared mailbox or a regular mailbox, the delegate doesn't have to enter user name and password combinations. Even to OWA. When a user logs in to OWA using the user name and
 password of his personal mailbox, he can then go ahead and chose to open another mailbox which the user is a&nbsp;delegate.&nbsp;Exchange Online is smart enough to open it without requesting additional user name or password inputs.</p>
<p>

<p>Yes, there's a limit with shared mailboxes and that is 50GB. However, since you're using user mailboxes for these common accounts, you can go ahead and set-up unlimited online archiving if the Exchange Online&nbsp;license is Exchange Online Plan 2 or by using
 Exchange Online Archiving license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> need to convert it to a shared mailbox.</p>

            <span>Hi Alex,<br />
<br />
I understand that you have used a regular mailbox to collect emails and have this regular mailboxes shared with the users in your organization. However, if a user just reply those emails in his personal mailbox, it is an expected behavior that his personal
 email address will be the default ‘From’ address. Only in the shared regular mailbox will the default ‘From’ address be the shared regular mailbox email address.<br />
<br />
Since all the emails are copied to the shared regular mailbox, as Muditha said above, an admin can assign the users permission and then let the users manually add the regular mailbox into their Outlook client. Then they can directly reply emails in this regular
 mailbox instead of their personal mailboxes. This manually setting up additional mailbox works not only for shared mailboxes, but also for regular mailboxes.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</span>

            <p>Hi Yang,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the user replies to an email in the shared (Office@xxx) mailbox the default FROM is office@xxx. They have to change manually to FROM user@xxx.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is how to force the users to reply from their personal mailboxes instead from the shared one :) I think it is the opposite of what you are suggesting.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is by design. Whenever you reply or forward from an additional mailbox in your Outlook, it picks that mailbox's email address for the From address field. User will have to manually change the From address before sending the mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;you delegate a mailbox, and a user won't change the from address manually, it will not deliver the email and the user will receive an NDR.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>SETTINGS / email + accounts</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest solution is to delete Yahoo mail and start&nbsp; again (you stated you have already synced&nbsp; Yahoo mail and email adress is displayed correctedly so e.g a bug has been picked up betweeen phone and Yahoo</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To DELETE: long press on Yahoo Mail options sync/ DELETE</strong></p>
<p>all email on the phone will be removed but returns when you re-set up</p>
<p>
</p><p>But before that re-set up</p>
<p>First:</p>
<p><em>I would suggest you do a Soft reset; pressing and holding volume down + power buttons until the phone restarts.</em></p>
<p><br />
Second:<br />
<em>Are</em><em> the date and time are correct?</em><br />
<em>Settings / Date + Time / Turn Automatically to Off / Set up current date, Time and zone manually.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this will resolve the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if it remains&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> MORE&nbsp; specific details of any response&nbsp; displayed on the phone are needed, when the message is displayed and your last action before that</span></p>

    <title>Phone memory on Nokia Lumia 640 Suddenly All Used up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alan93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phone memory on Nokia Lumia 640 Suddenly All Used up</h2>
                    <p>For the longest time time my phone memory was only 5 of 8 gb used up.</p>
<p>Now , I get a message saying the phone memory is all used up in spite of me having the settings set to only saving new apps to the phone memory and everything else to the installed SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded only a few apps and deleted them recently but nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at storage usage,it shows 3.24gb for System &amp; Reserved and 3.71gb for apps &amp; games.</p>
<p>I see iHeart radio app takes up 2gb which is a lot but why 3.24gb for system? Half of the phones memory should not be used up by system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this?</p>

<p>3.24gb for system includes the recovery partition that is used when you reset the phone. I would look at the radio app and consider moving it to the card.</p>
<p>When you have an 8GB phone and you choose to install apps in phone memory you have to use discretion in the apps you install.</p>

<h2>            Compatibility with Mercedes SAP system</h2>
                    I have been surfing the web quite a lot to get a feel on how useable the Merc SAP system is with all bluetooth phones.<br />
<br />
It appears that there are a lot of phones now which will link via the SAP system. ( Remote SIM mode) and a lot of them will transfer the main contact in the phone book to the Merc COMMAND address book.<br />
<br />
There are however a few rumours that some of the newer Nokia phones will transfer ALL of the address book....<br />
<br />
The question is, which ones ?<br />
<br />
I would dearly love to have this funtionality but will not invest in a new phone unless I know it is going to work.<br />
<br />
Any ideas ?<br />
<br />
cheers<br />
Guy

            I equally await with interest as my dealer realy did not wish to supply the sap phone knowing I had a n95-2, much as I would like to have the contents of the contact list uploaded. I am told the cclass has better connectivity than some others.<br />
<br />
Personally i went with the blue tooth hf? unit, so it would link to all the phones in the house hold rather than the only one we have with sap. (new clk with comand)

            Hi warlove<br />
<br />
You don't say whether vehicle fitted with Comand as slightly different.<br />
<br />
Holding down the MB logo on the BT module for 2 seconds put the BT module into active mode (rapid LED blink)<br />
<br />
ANSWER / DIAL / PICK UP: Gives you a list of phones that are nearby.<br />
<br />
CLICKING ON THE PHONE: Gives you the pairing code (16 digits)

            I tried it it did not work ;(<br />
<br />
Here are some more information.<br />
<br />
I need some help. I have bought a Mercedes Benz Cradle adapter with Bluetooth® wireless technology and i am trying to connect my N95 with it. This cradle can work either with the Sim card or with the bluetooth. I have try it with the Sim and its working fine.
 Now i am trying to connect it with blutooth to my phone. In order to do that first of all i must pair the devices. I know how to do that. Search the new pair device with my n95 and connect it. When i do that i need a pairing password to put in my phone. Unfortunately
 when they have provide me with the cradle they did not give me the specific password so i can not pair it. Can any one tell me how can i find that ? Please help me ;(

            Hi warlove<br />
<br />
Which firmware version is your N95 running, key in *#0000# on standby screen?<br />
<br />
The important settings on the phone are:<br />
Bluetooth must be "On","My phone's visibility as "Shown to all", Remote SIM mode must be "On".<br />
<br />
If you now go to the car, press the BT SAP device button a few seconds to make the light blink fast and follow your
<b>car specific guidance</b> to make the car attempt to connect and pair with the phone, you would get the 16 digit code shown at the car head unit and soon the phone display showing a request to enter this 16 digit code. Once you enter the 16 digit code (quickly
 enough within the given time) and press OK, pairing is done. You should not get any further requests to enter this 16 digit code. You may however get a request to enter your SIM card pin code, you might switch (temporarily) the SIM PIN code off so that you
 don't need to bother about that.<br />
<br />
Once you have paired the phone, you should go to the phone Bluetooth menu and select the list of paired devices, select the MB telephone and set it as
<b>authorised</b>.<br />
<br />
You don't say whether this is SAP v1 or v2 but seems a phone bluetooth issue, have you
<b>deleted</b> all existing pairings?

            My friend thank you very much for all the info but it did not worked. when i follow the procedure my phone does not connect with the cradle. The only way to do that is to manually pair the device with my phone and then i get the request for the pairing
 code, When it ask for the pairing code i put the 16 digit that i have found on my car screen and it did not work. The second time i tried i press the CALL key in my car and it was trying to call the 16 digit number on the screen and it did not do anything.<br />
Third attempt, i did the same as before at the same time i manually tried to connect the phone with its pairing procedure where it requested me to add a password and i ve put the 16 digit code that it was on my car screen and it did not work :(<br />
I ask some one and he told me that when i try too connect it i should put 5 digit code number which it should be only for the specific item i have. Please help me ;(

            Hi warlove<br />
<br />
Sorry that you aren't getting anywhere with this issue. Can you confirm whether your Mercedes has a "headunit" ICE or Comand system here.<br />
<br />
The only <b>5 digit</b> codes that I know of for Mercedes Benz audio is when battery has been disconnected unfortunately.

<p><font>Based on your advice, I tried to&nbsp;</font><font><font><font color="#000000">reset the views as you mentioned above and&nbsp;finally
</font></font></font><font>went to&nbsp;</font><font><b>Automatic Formatting</b> and&nbsp;open the Automatic Formatting dialog box. But, pls advise what should I further do in order to show the fonts in the originally selected colors. For example,
 I need a sentence on a mail (new/&nbsp;reply&nbsp;mail)&nbsp;to be displayed in red, instead of the default color black.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, my Excel 2007, like Outlook 2007,&nbsp;also have font color display problem, but Word 2007 doesn't have such problem. I think&nbsp;these&nbsp;font&nbsp;color problems, together with IE8&nbsp;incomplete website display problems&nbsp;might be caused by some recent Window updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I would like to let you know, that method 1 is incorrect for me. There is no "Options" under "File". There is one under "Edit" but when I click it and go to the right pane, go to "Advanced" and look for "Display", "Disable Hardware Graphics Acceleration"
 isn't even there... And for Method 2, the "Change Settings" in the "Advanced" tab is grayed out.</p>

<p>I'll add to the above: Nokia Step Counter (the simpler version of Sports Tracker, I think).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also Resco Bubbles.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.resco.net/games/symbian/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.resco.net/games/symbian/download.aspx</a></p>
<p>There's also a Resco Defender, not sure if this is another game that uses the accelerometer since I haven't tried it yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the downside with Resco Bubbles (it says time-limited version, but I find it hard to play because of 2 things: it seems to be very senstive, and also it's oriented perpendicularly for the E72.&nbsp; (ie. when you tilt the phone so that it's suppose to be
 up/down, the bubble moves left/right instead.&nbsp; And when you title the phone left/right, the bubble moves up/down instead.&nbsp; Incorrect orientation.)</p>

<p>Not compatible with the E72 however, even though it's in Ovi Store for E72. The display isn't suited for landscape and the keys don't work if I remember correctly when I last tried it. Also it's now coming up as a pay app when I try to reinstall it.</p>

            <p>You can only sync using the desktop app.</p>
<p>Win8 has a metro style app and a desktop app. The desktop is better.</p>

    <title>outlook 2013 is restarting every 10 minutes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            outlook 2013 is restarting every 10 minutes</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm using Office 2013 Pro version. It worked fine for the last month or so, but suddenly Outlook began to automatically restart itself every 10 min.
<br />
I've tried all the solutions that appear in MS communities, but non solved the problem:<br />
<br />
1. the problem persists in safe mode. <br />
2. the problem persists after disabling all add-ins.<br />
3. the problem persist after changing the SRS file name.<br />
4. the problem persist after applying the PST repair tool. <br />
5. the problem persists after I set a new profile. <br />
5. the problem persists after I tried repairing the program using MS installation.
<br />
6. the problem persists after nu-installing and re-installing Office. <br />
<br />
What can I do? <br />
<br />
Would appreciate your help. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
Yossi

<p>You could install this MS app <a href="http://www.dependencywalker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dependencywalker.com/</a>&nbsp;then start Outlook within the app and see if that is able to identify the cause/failing module</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the videos on Internet explorer are flash videoes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to stop HTML, GIF, and other such videos, only website developers may need to make some changes in the website content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I would also suggest you posting your question on MSDN forum for better assistance from developers.</p>

<p>Hi Tom, </p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community. As per the description you are trying to install Office 2010 on the second computer Let me assist you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue I need some information:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Which edition of Office 2010 did you purchase? (Home &amp; Student/Home &amp; Business/Professional)</span>
</li><li><span>Is it a retail copy or a PKC (product key card)?</span> </li></ol>
<p>In order to troubleshoot the issue related to Office, you may try the steps below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>If it’s a PKC, then it can only be associated with a particular computer, and you cannot transfer the license to another computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have the product key check the link below to download the Office 2010 setup file and use the product key to install the Office 2010 suite:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-office-2010-backup-FX101853122.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-office-2010-backup-FX101853122.aspx</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer the information given in the link below to know more about the Office 2010 licensing terms;</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-software-license-terms-for-microsoft-office-2010-HA101817777.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-software-license-terms-for-microsoft-office-2010-HA101817777.aspx</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above suggestions helps. If you need further assistance on this particular issue or any other Office related issues let us know and we will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Test User 2018,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know which app you’re using on your phone, the phone native mail app or the Outlook for mobile app? Besides, what’s the system of your mobile phone, iOS or Android?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my tests on my iPhone, after adding my Office 365 account to Outlook for iOS, then touch the account icon of the top left corner, I can see the group folder of the folders list, expand the group folder and touch the group, I
 can see the emails that sent to this group. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try the steps above and check if you can see the emails. If you still cannot receive the emails sent to the group, for Outlook for mobile issues, we have a dedicated in-app support channel. You can contact them to get targeted
 help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the link for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-in-app-help-for-outlook-for-ios-and-android-218a22d1-9fa5-4889-b689-de1c63493243#ID0EAABAAA=Contact_Support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Unfortunately Doug lots of problems with this build and lots of Insiders have problems. All I can suggest is read the posts in the forum and try things yourself. Or wait for a new build and update to that if you can.&nbsp;

<p>The error itself points to</p>

What this error means is, your Windows 10 installation folder is unfinished and/or corrupted. Now, how do you fix that?</p>
<ol>
<li>
Go into "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download" and delete everything in that folder.</li><li>
Now, run the command prompt as an administrator. Type in "wuauclt.exe /updatenow".</li><li>
Go to your Control Panel &gt; Windows Update and your Windows 10 should start re-downloading from scratch, hopefully without flaws this time.</li></ol>

<h2>            Excluding Caption Labels</h2>
                    <p>When entering captions, I want to exclude my labels from being shown, and I found out that the Windows' version of Microsoft Word have an option box to do so when Mac's version simply don't have it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to make a list of all captions with the label "Equation" with "Insert table of figures", but I don't want the labels to be printed on the caption where the equations are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to do it?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
