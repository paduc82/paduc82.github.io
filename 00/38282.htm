<h2>            Surface Pro 4 - Can&#39;t open settings, reset didn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago I installed an HP printer driver from their website. It evidently didn't install correctly, and before I could uninstall it, Windows updated to the newest version of Windows 10. Things then went haywire. Apps wouldn't uninstall or install.
 Errors were being seen everywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally I decided to then go back to a previous point in time, but I had failed to turn that functionality on within Windows previously. To make sure it wasn't a virus or malware, I ran a full system scan with McAfee after updating that and no issues were
 found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consequently, I reset windows, opting to keep my files and have it reset everything else. The result has been disastrous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything dealing with the system will not open (Settings, notifications, etc.), which prevents me from resetting my Surface Pro 4 entirely. Microsoft Edge's startup icon comes up until it is time for the program to launch, and then it fails. When I press
 the reset command in the startup menu with shift held down, I navigate my way to have it do a clean reset. It then asks me to go to http:s//account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/n/#/devices, but when I go there on a separate device, it says that "This functionality
 is not enabled or not available." and will not let me reset my device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now stuck with a computer that won't function on a basic level and cannot be reset. Help!!</p>

    <title>Where to find audio track&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where to find audio track&#63;</h2>
                    I have read answers to questions which say "go to the audio track timeline." &nbsp;How do you do that?

            <p>Can you explain what it is you are trying to accomplish? Then I can give you a more comprehensive answer.&nbsp;Also, which specific version of Movie Maker are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the "classic" versions of Movie Maker (up through Windows Movie Maker 6.0) there were separate tracks for video, a sub-track for its audio and another track for added music. &nbsp;These all appeared in a timeline along the bottom of the Movie Maker window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the newer versions of Movie Maker (called Windows Live Movie Maker through 2011), you don't have a timeline. &nbsp;Instead you have a wrapped storyboard/project area to the right. &nbsp;The video track is shown as one strip (aka track) and below that you'll find
 the added captions as another strip and the added music as yet another thin strip. &nbsp;But you couldn't see the audio that was part of the video track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Movie Maker 2012 was released, it fixed this by showing the audio waveforms within the storyboard strip for your video. &nbsp;It appears as a squiggly line within that video track. &nbsp;You can't do much with that audio (except change the volume) since it is
 tied directly to the video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Movie Maker also added the ability to add another track of audio (in addition to the added music) in the form of added narration, added sound effects or even the sound from a video file. &nbsp;That appears as a separate strip below the others in the storyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that is enough to go by, &nbsp;but if you still need help, provide more details on what you are trying to do and why having access to the audio track is needed.</p>

<div>Start the computer with it connected to the new video card. The initialization screen should show because it is independent of Windows. The new card will or should install at first as a basic VGA card and then ask for drivers..
 Have them handy.. &nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi wildcat1337,</p>
<p>It's not required if your computer supports multiple video cards. Some computers allow you to plug in two or more video cards, each connected to its own monitor. Other computers allow you to pair video cards for display on a single monitor to increase performance,
 using technologies such as NVIDIA SLI or ATI CrossFire. Check with the manufacturer to see if your computer has the necessary hardware to support multiple video cards.</p>
<p>You can proceed with the installation of new video card. <br />
<strong>See</strong> <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/give-your-pc-some-graphics-muscle-by-installing-a-new-video-card" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Give your PC some graphics muscle by installing a new video card</a></p>
<p>You can manually disable the video card by following these steps<br />
a. Click Start, type devmgmt.msc and hit enter to open device manager.<br />
b. Expand Display adapters.<br />
c. Right click on the sub item and click Disable (video card that you want to disable)</p>

    <title>Managing backup disk space using File History - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gwmoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Managing backup disk space using File History</h2>
                    <p>Original title: File History &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a 500GB HD partitioned into two 250GB drives. One contains Windows 8.1, the other contains Windows 7. I recently ran File history on the 8.1 drive and it is now full. I also ran Backup on the Win 7 drive and it is also now full. Where can I locate
 these backups and delete the files? The most pressing concern is Win 8.1 since I had just added Update and was preparing to move everything over to the new OS and drive, which I am now unable to do. Look forward to getting some help soonest. Thanks

            Hi Seandrabelle, 
<br />
<br />Here is a step by step guide to transferring a license, if yours is eligible for transfer. 
<br />

<br />I don't want to lose anything in translation, so I figured giving you this link would be the best bet. GroovyPost is legit and can be trusted.

Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />With your PC being dead, not sure if this will be doable If you didn’t deactivate your old pc, and grab your license. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!

            Hi Seandrabelle,
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 Core licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />If it is based on a Retail licence, have your product key at hand and contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Choose a local Phone Number:

            Core Single Language licenses are tied to the motherboard and usually are not transferable. However, there are always exceptions.
<br />Run the activation troubleshooter and select I recently changed hardware on this device and see if it activates(Provided you are using the same MS account on old and new PCs)

            It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	Learn more about transferring your license: 
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-windows-10-license-new-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-window...</a>
<br />
<br />If its a retail license, learn how to reactivate:
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-windows-10-license-microsoft-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-window...</a>
<br />
<br />You could try chatting with support agent and explain the situation in detail and they might be able to activate it. We were able to confirm with Microsoft under some circumstances, OEM licenses can be reactivated even under the free upgrade offer. Its not guaranteed every support agent will do it though, but you can try your luck.
<br />
<br />Microsoft's view is, as long as you are not abusing the license, you should get a pass.

<p>Hola a todos y buenas tardes.</p>

<p>Hoy he hecho una transferencia de licencias ( no es la primera vez que lo hago ) y algunas cosas se me han descargado y otras no. Por ejemplo: Los DLC's del Gears Of War 3 se me han pasado con exito, en cambio los del Battlefield 3, Skins del Minecraft etcétera
 no se me ha pasado bien ¿ Alguien tiene alguna solución ?</p>

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Edition still in trial</h2>
                    Hi, I recently bought a new laptop and i want to download Minecraft Windows 10 Edition but it says that i have a trial version but i have bought it 2 years ago with my old system and played minecraft windows 10 on it. i purchased minecraft windows 10 edition
 by using a gift code and the gift code i got is when you buy minecraft java edition and you can get windows 10 edition for free 2 years ago. so anyone can solve the problem? there are images below so you can believe me.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f23cef1f-4099-4a6b-904d-90cc6084fe6a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f23cef1f-4099-4a6b-904d-90cc6084fe6a?upload=true" /></a>

<p>I did already redeemed it when i bought Minecraft: Java Editon ( May 27, 2017) and immediately redeemed it by clicking the redeem button. So the question is,&nbsp; is the code only for one device or for the account so you can download it on any device but right
 now i can't seem to get it properly say that i have bought it.</p>

            Don't install the software from the CD that came with the scanner - that software is not supported on Windows 10. Instead, install the software

<h2>            Windows 10 Hard Drive Light On and Stops Windows Shutting Down</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem, my laptop has 2 hard drives, an ssd for Windows and Software and a 1tb Hard drive for data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately, sometimes the hard drive light is on constantly, I check task manager to find what is accessing my hard drive(s) and in the processes tab disk access is at 0% even though light is on all the time, also, in the performance tab the 2 hard drives do
 not appear at all ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested both drives and they are healthy - both are less than 1 year old</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to shut down Windows 10, the screen goes blank after 2 seconds as usual but the hard drive and power lights stay on and I have to press and hold the power button for 5 seconds to shut the laptop down, I am afraid if I keep doing this I will lose
 data or mess up my windows installation</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I had this problem in build 1511 (education and am still having it after installing the Anniversary Update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Help . . .</p>

            <p><span>Hi Dave,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could be either due to some issues with the power settings or corrupted system files on the computer or even a device driver that
 is keeping the hard drive awake.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the below methods and check if that helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Method 1: Run the Power Troubleshooter

</p><ol>
<li><span>Open Control Panel.</span></li><li><span>Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Ente</em></strong></span></li><li><span>Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></li><li><span>In the “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View All</em></strong>” on the left pane.</span></li><li><span>Click on “<strong><em>Power</em></strong>”.</span></li><li><span>Click on “<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong>”.</span></li><li><span>Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>It could be a compatibility issue with the new
<strong>Fast Startup component</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the below steps and check:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open <strong>

<p><strong><span>Shut Down</span></strong><span> the computer, wait a couple of minutes and
 then use the <strong>Power Button</strong> to start the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:
</span></strong><span>I would suggest you to restore default settings of power plan and check if it helps.</span><span>&nbsp;

<p>Press and hold Volume Up + Power button</p>

 down the power button otherwise it is a solid light. &nbsp;Is this an indication of something I should know of? &nbsp;I've found no references to it online but unless someone has any advice I suspect my Surface is dead...</p>

            Hi G, the new Skype does have many problems and lacks the functionality of the Classic version of Skype
<br />
<br />I worked in the pre-press industry for a long time and understand the importance of Hi-res images
<br />
<br />A workaround for the moment until Microsoft bring the new Skype App up to date would be to upload the hi-res images to the cloud (OneDrive,iCloud, DropBox . . . etc.) and then provide your customers with a shared link through Skype while providing them with the low-res previews on Skype . . .

            My assumption is, Microsoft assumes nobody cares. Your best option is to file a bug report then use alternatives such as hosing the image on OneDrive, then sending your recipient the short link.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, i just zip my images now and then send it. It slows down my workflow but it works.</p>
<p>It's kind of frustrating that there are no settings for this.</p>

I asked if there was a solution for this, before giving feedback i'd like to check if there isn't a solution already ;)

<p>Done that so many times. A messenger that boasts of sharing files up to 300MB; which then compresses a picture, without users consent, and changes a 8mb file to 243kb, your developers need a smack up their backside if they can let such a major error go unnoticed
 through their tests .. How's that for a feedback???&nbsp;</p>

            Hi thunderfoot7,
<br />
<br />Is that what you meant? That you checked if Skype has permission to use your microphone on your computer?
<br />
<br />Click on Windows Start, then Settings. Under Privacy, select Microphone on the left and then check if Skype has permission to use the microphone.

<p>Yes/No. Skype asked me through a popup that it needed permission to use the microphone so I could access Skype. I had already gone into permissions and allowed it acces to the microphone. This situation is puzzling because I can use Skype on this account
 from another computer in the house.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Skype call ended, missed call &#38; voice message column errors</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I never see&nbsp; any "real" missed calls in column on the left when using my computer (windows 8.1). I do see missed call sometimes after I place a call regardless of how long of short it was.&nbsp;I would like to call back some of the "real" missed calls that
 I used to get before I updated Skype to the latest version. How can I get them to appear again? I still get the "real" missed calls&nbsp;on&nbsp;the Skype set up&nbsp;on my Android telephone, but would rather have them appear in my computer since I use&nbsp;it far more often
 than my phone. Thanks</p>

<h2>            How to correct a Windows 7 conflict on a cold boot after installation of new HDD controller&#63;</h2>
                    How do I correct a Windows 7 Pro 64 conflict on a cold boot after installation of a new HDD controller?&nbsp; I am using a pc that seems to work fine after a warm boot or a cold boot when the&nbsp;pc is off for a brief period.&nbsp; Originally, the pc used a motherboard&nbsp;SATA
 controller in Raid Mode (Bios) with a single hard drive.&nbsp; The new configuration is a&nbsp;Startech PEXSAT34rh controller with&nbsp;one hard&nbsp;drive and two SSDs in a virtual drive configuration.&nbsp; The Startech controller is using&nbsp;a driver downloaded from Startech.&nbsp; The
 controller can use a native Windows driver.&nbsp; The pc bios currently has the motherboard SATA controller disabled and the issue seems to still exist.

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. This issue can be caused due to third-party application conflict or driver corruption. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please check the cable connection with the motherboard as there might be loose connection in it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1:</span> </strong><strong>Boot the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue persists.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.<br />
<strong><br />
</strong>Refer to the link below on instructions to get In Safe Mode.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:</span> If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode then perform a
<strong>clean boot</strong> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong>: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting’.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 3:</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue still persists, I would suggest you to update the device drivers (for e.g.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Display card, hard disk, BIOS &amp; chipset drivers). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the link:</p>
<p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Startech PEXSAT34rh download driver</strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.startech.com/Cards-Adapters/HDD-Controllers/SATA-Cards/4-Port-PCI-Express-SATA-6Gbps-RAID-Controller-Card~PEXSAT34RH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.startech.com/Cards-Adapters/HDD-Controllers/SATA-Cards/4-Port-PCI-Express-SATA-6Gbps-RAID-Controller-Card~PEXSAT34RH</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
 configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            The pc seems to cold boot after a long duration of no power.&nbsp; The change made to allow the pc to cold boot after powered off for a long duration was to move the cable connected to the SSD containing the OS from the controller card back to the motherboard
 SATA port.&nbsp; The performance of the OS SSD was only slightly degraded using the SATA II connection of the motherboard.&nbsp; For the OS to find itself, the device seems to have to be connected to the motherboard.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.

<h2>            I have had big fish games on my computer for some time now. I played one of the games last week and it worked fine. Now I get the error message. drmactivator application has stopped working.</h2>
                    &nbsp;when I close the window and try to reclick the game it comes back with a message that another game is running and I need to close it. However there are no other games running. I noticed that the last message for this problem was back in November of 09.
 Has there been any advancements in finding the problem or do I need to uninstall the games and redownload them.

<h2>            Microsoft Antimalware Error Code 0x80090008</h2>
                    I've been having issues manually trying to update Microsoft Security Essentials. Not only that, but Windows Update also doesn't seem to be functional.<br />
<br />
I followed what looked like a promising lead with renaming the DataStore folder located under
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">c:\windows\SoftwareDistribution</span> which later updated MSE and got rid of the ESENT errors (ID 623) that were showing up in the Event Log. But the next day I tried to manually update MSE
 and still I get an error message w/ code 0x80090008. When I go to Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Windows Update and choose to do an Express install I receive an error stating "The website has encountered a problem and cannot display the page you are trying to view." Error
 number: </strong>0x80090008.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any assistance. I'm running Windows XP SP 3. MSE is my anti-virus and my firewall is the Microsoft Windows Firewall.<br />
