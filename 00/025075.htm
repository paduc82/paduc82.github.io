<h2>            Error 85050025 on windows phone 8.1 and 10 after changed external public certificate</h2>
                    <p>Hello support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we changed&nbsp;external public certificate&nbsp;on our external mail server and users with windows phone 8.1 and 10&nbsp;can not sync email anymore and get error 0x85050025 "We're having&nbsp; a problem syncing mail.company.com at the moment. Wait a little while, then try
 again".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our external certificate is from GoDaddy public provider&nbsp;which should be&nbsp;supported in windows phone devices.</p>
<p>Users can access owa via windows phone devices without any&nbsp;certificate errors, which means that&nbsp;certificate&nbsp;is&nbsp;trusted.</p>
<p>Also users with iphone and android can sync mail without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try adding intermediate godaddy cert and root cert in windows phone but is not helping much.</p>
<p>The only way to make it working againg is to recreate email profile in windows phone devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can we make email sync working again witout recreating each email profile, becouse we have a lot of users on windows phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is apprecieated,</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Kristjan&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>we solved it by recreating a mail profile on all windows phone devices.</p>
<p>For future activites will be great to know if there is a way to make it working without recreating a profile.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            2010 Project Professional download won&#39;t install on Win7 64 bit</h2>
                    Purchased and Downloaded , MS Projects Professional 2010 and it won't install on Windows 7 64 or 32 bit platforms. I have the code, could it be a bad download? It will install on Vista Home 32 bit platform, just not Win 7 anything.... Is there a patch?
 It starts to install, but immediately terminates when it begins to extract the files. I have ran through the compatibility modes to no avail...What's next, just want my software to work...Thanks..

            Ok, so I solved my own issue...First I downloaded the trial version from MS downloads for Projects Pro 2010 32 bit and 64 bit. 64 bit version will not install if you have 32 bit version of Office Pro installed. However I downloaded the 32 bit version as
 well and it started right up with no issues and excepted my code in the trial version. So now everything works.... Must of lost a couple of bits in translation somewhere...who knows, it works, and that's it...moving on to other issues.

<h2>            just left microsoft store and told they will no longer sale windows phones. there werent any in the store.</h2>
                    I must say I'm really pissed off. I invested hundreds of dollars in windows phones. 1520, 2 635s, 2 640's and others. I'm watching the blogs daily for the surface phone. its bad enough I return band 1 and band 2 for a full refund. I own a surface 3 and
 many Microsoft lap tops. I worked for Grumman data systems for 10 years running main frames. my 1st laptop was a dual disk 286. its very upsetting to hear Microsoft left us phone users with products they created and sold us in the wind. you guys SUCK! for
 someone like me which a music artist Em Kruz/ upwordspiral always using Microsoft cutting edge products to create and record my music and have you guys screw us over like this is bull ****. I hate apple and android but&nbsp;now it seems that all we have left in
 phone os and handsets is them. &nbsp;Microsoft better get there **** together otherwise your going to lose end users like me to apple. your track record proves your R/D sucks . look at the watch band 1 and 2. I spend about $400.00

    <title>Problems when using contractions such as I&#39;m, I&#39;ll, etc. Any - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems when using contractions such as I&#39;m, I&#39;ll, etc. Any help&#63;</h2>
                    I'm having a problem whenever I try to use contractions that begin with "I" - such as I'm, I'll, etc. When I type "I'm", I get "I'&nbsp; M" followed by a beep. Same thing with "I'll" - Outlook will type it as "I' L" and beep, not allowing me to enter any new
 characters until I delete the old and I have to type "I am" or "I will". "I've" is also a problem. It's seems as if the auto spell checker is just choking on any contraction beginning with "I"?<br />
<br />
Yes, I am running the latest developer version of Mountain Lion but I've been running it for months with no problems in any Office app. This is something new and totally off the wall.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            Final update:
<div><br />
<div>Update to Mavericks to resolve this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem is related to webkit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Webkit is a component of OS X (it is the HTML rendering engine behind Safari).&nbsp;&nbsp;The bug was reported to Apple shortly after this thread started. &nbsp;The fix was released recently in the version of webkit included with Mavericks.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>
<div>
<p>===</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As a temporary workaround please turn off the "Capitalize first letter of sentences" autocorrect setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the menu Outlook, Preferences, Autocorrect and uncheck "Capitalize first letter of sentences".
</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>The recent Mac Office 14.2.5 release did not contain a fix for this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is related to webkit.<span>&nbsp; </span>Webkit is a component of OS X (it is the HTML rendering engine behind Safari).<span>&nbsp;
</span>The bug was reported to Apple shortly after this thread started and we are eagerly waiting on a fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple released version 6.0.2 of Safari early November 2012, including a webkit update.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is that update which is causing people to see changed, but not fixed, behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The particular test case I have been using to reproduce the problem still fails with Safari 6.0.2.&nbsp; Other uses are reporting that situations which were broken before now work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no benefit in trying new identities or new user accounts.<span>&nbsp; </span>
The issue is well understood as being a webkit regression from when Mountain Lion was released.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is not related to any problem with your identity, account or installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above temporary workaround is still the only solution to suppress the problem until a complete webkit fix is released.&nbsp; Updating to Safari 6.0.2 through Apple Software update may address some situations.</p>

                    <p>This doesn't make sense. I am trying to sign in using my MAIN personal email login on the web based Outlook.com... this is NOT an alias, like the 2015 similar errors were talking about.&nbsp; This is not an organization or anything like that, and I don't have
 or want to log in to an organization's email, it's my personal email account that I use every day.&nbsp; And my account has nothing to do with 365 mail or whatever.&nbsp; It was originally created using Hotmail.com.&nbsp; All of a sudden, today, I can't log in. I've tried
 on both Firefox and Safari (on my Macbook Air, latest/updated everything) and I also attempted to check my email on my iPhone as well, using the Outlook app, and it won't load there either, no error messages it just won't load anything recent!</p>
<p>Is this a coincidence that it's happening on April Fools day?&nbsp; Or is this some horrible joke?&nbsp; My son is able to log into his hotmail/outlook account without issue, and so far I can't find any similar issues with others recently, everything in search is

<h2>            Access 2010 Word Automation Library not registered</h2>
                    <p>Our organisation has commenced rollout of Lync 2013 to replace Lync 2010. Following this rollout, our team databases using VBA automation to load and populate Word templates have stopped working with the error that the library is not registered.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the references, the Word 14 object library is still present and selectable (no Word 15 object library as we're still using Office 2010 for the majority of applications). I've tried everything to solve this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Sounds like you need to have a chat with the IT department. Clearly each of you holds part of the solution.

            Thanks Tom,
<div><br />
<div>I have logged the issue with them. Unfortunately, as a government department with 34000 people, getting the query to the right people is somewhat difficult.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Logging it through our IT helpdesk means that Level 1 support will sit there for a few days trying to figure out what I mean, before scratching their heads and moving it to level 2, who'll do the same before level 3 etc. Eventually, it may make it to the
 people who organised the rollout (why they didn't rollout the rest of Office 2013, I'll never know)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Last time I spoke to one of them about a networking issue and mentioned TCPIP they didn't even know what it was (slammed my head against the desk with that).</div>

            I would go to whoever is responsible for rolling out Lync and complain to them that their rollout has broken your Access apps.

<h2>            Sum specific cells based on cell colour.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a table with 2 columns</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Column A: date - format 11-Jan-18</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Column B: value - format 1.25</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>These are items that I ship out of a location.&nbsp; Once the item is shipped I format that cell in blue in column A - date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several tabs like this and I need to scan each tab and calculate the sum of column B - value for each tab on the dates that are blue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do this manual at this time and input these values to create a burndown chart to show the progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know is there a way to do this in excel via formulas? So once I set a cell in blue it is automatically calculated for the chart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>TK</p>

<p>Hi TK,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my search, you may need to use VBA code to achieve your requirement. Below are two articles for your reference. In the VBA code, we add a function colorfuction. It will add or count cells with the same color.

<h2>            Blocking e-mails sent to &#34;Undisclosed recipients&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep receiving spam e-mails and they even manage to end up under "Focused" e-mails. Honestly, spam algorithm of outlook sucks. I use outlook.com and I want to block emails which are sent "<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>To: Undisclosed recipients:;</strong></span>"
 How can I do that?</p>
<p>

            Dear iplikci52,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users.
<br />
<br />Please note that Postmaster ( <a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a> ) is actually blocking lots of spammers ( and I quote ):
<br />For example, we've implemented a number of mechanisms to reduce the burden of junk email which currently prevents nearly 4.5 billion email messages from reaching Outlook.com users every day!
<br />
<br />There are couple of ways to deal with scammers and unwanted emails and improve how your anty filter will work (I am sure that you are aware of some and you are using them, but maybe additional information in support articles will help you):
<br />
<br />1. First of all check your spam filters and see suggestions on how to keep spam out of your inbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a>
<br />2. Report the phishing, spam and unwanted emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />3. Add emails or domains to block sender (those that were actually used to send emails - see #5) list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />4. Create specific rules for subjects or common phrases that are present in those emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a> and add conditions, that are common for those emails, for example additional keywords, recipient address includes etc.
<br />5. Nowadays some scammers have learned how to mask their emails addresses that you can see in the emails. However, in the message source you will find the real one (and the real domain) In order to view message source please check this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiving-email-from-blocked-senders-in-outlook-com-265923a0-b52c-4157-92c8-370385215da1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiv...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also check tips on how to stay safe online from Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/online-safety-resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this will help your email free from Junk!

            Dear iplikci52,
<br />
<br />First of all this is not automatic reply. Second of all I have tested this myself and I got rid of spam following those suggestions.
<br />
<br />Antispam filter in Outlook.com works, but needs to be taught. So user should report abuse, mark as spam and block correct email addresses. As a matter of fact blocking feature maybe confusing in a name, as you will still receive emails from that sender, but they should go to Junk folder and after 30 days they will be permanently deleted.
<br />
<br />Also i would like to remind that filter prevents nearly 4.5 billion email messages from reaching Outlook.com users every day       
        </p>

<p>Dear LA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think I don't report spam or wouldn't block the "correct" email address? Those will work only if the spammers were stupid enough to send spam emails from the same email address. But, unfortunately they are not that stupid. Let me share the sender
 field of spam emails I received just <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">today</span></strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>From:</strong> *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; on behalf of Congratulations! &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>From:</strong> Pure CBD &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>From:</strong> *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; on behalf of CaÍnÍnÍaÍbÍlÍiÍsÍs &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;<br />
<strong>From:</strong> Choice Home Warranty &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>From:</strong> *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; on behalf of Cannabliss CBD &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>From:</strong> *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; on behalf of HealthInsurance.net &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</span></span></p>
<p>When I look at the message source pretty much everything is different in those e-mails. There are just two things in common. One is To: field. All of email has that field as below:
</p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<br />
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
To: Undisclosed recipients:;<br />
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<br />
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
The second common thing is the banner picture under email.</div>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/29ba9496-73fb-4f41-99dd-b0cc9d014e58?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/29ba9496-73fb-4f41-99dd-b0cc9d014e58?upload=true" /></a><br />
And to antispam filter in Outlook.com, I didn't say it doesn't work. I said it sucks. That filter may prevent 10 billion messages and this could be a great success for Microsoft. But on my end, I receive 5-10 spam email right into "Focused" tab in Outlook.com
 every single day, while I receive almost none (0) to my Gmail. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm asking very simple question: How can I block emails sent to "Undisclosed recipients"?</p>

            Dear iplikci52,
<br />
<br />You can either block the domains from which those emails are sent, or you can create conditional rules that will move those emails to Junk folder ( and after 30 days they will be deleted automatically ) As you already mentioned that you have analyzed those emails and have noticed pattern. Now you can use it against those spammers. As example please see the screenshot.
<br />
<br />Please note that you may need to create several rules, as some things may change in the other emails and there will be another pattern.
<br />
<br />As for spam filter I can only suggest to leave feedback to developers here <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/</a><br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab7aa3e5-8499-454c-85c0-dd3354336bd0?upload=true" />

            Hello iplikci52,
<br />
<br />I am sorry to hear that your Outlook.com is flooded with junk emails in your Focused Inbox and the anti-spam algorithm seems to be useless for you. I know how disruptive this can be, rest assured, I am committed to help you with this issue.
<br />
<br />Based on your communications above, I understand that you have already tried all conventional methods to deal with spam so the anti-algorithms is supposed to sort this out for you.
<br />
<br />In order for me to help you properly, I have a few clarifications to make:
<br />
<br />1. Are you an Outlook.com, Outlook on the Web or Outlook Web App user?
<br />2. How long has this been an issue?
<br />3. Do you recall undertaking any change that could possibly result in this?
<br />4. Do you have your email account setup on any devices/email clients?
<br />
<br />Can you please check if anti-spam algorithm is enabled for you? If you are a non-personal user, see: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/anti-spam-protection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/secu...</a>

<br />Hope to hear from you soon,

            Hello iplikci52, <br />
<br />
If that is the case, I am afraid we cannot help you with this. Although I am an Independent Advisor for MS Community, I regret to inform you that most of us here do not have access to user account information.
<br />
<br />
I suspect that the anti-spam algorithms may not be working correctly as expected for you. You need to reach out to Outlook.com engineers to get this resolved. You may link them this thread so that you do not have to go through the same ordeal again.
<br />
<br />
Microsoft Community brings together consumers and expert users in product-focused online communities, so they can post questions, share answers, and solve technical problems. However, inquiries that involve privacy, user data or otherwise require a technical
 action has to be reached with Microsoft Support directly. <br />
<br />
You can contact <strong>Outlook.com Support</strong> here: <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853938</a> <em>(their response time quite fast :P )</em>
<br />
<br />
You may also make a suggestion to Outlook.com engineers here: <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/284136-outlook-com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/284136-out...</a> <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I have some remedies for you to temporarily subdue this. <br />
<br />
1. Use <strong>Microsoft Outlook</strong> with <strong>Junk Mail Filtering</strong> enabled.
<br />
2. Connect your Outlook.com email account to Gmail and Gmail anti-spam algorithms will get the job done for you.
<br />
<br />
If you are an <strong>Office 365 subscription user,</strong> you can enjoy enhanced spam filtering. See:

I am sorry that I cannot resolve your issue, but I hope I have pointed you the right direction.
<br />

    <title>Moving Folders, Folders Disappearing. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasminaflower  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving Folders, Folders Disappearing.</h2>
                    On Outlook, on the left you have your Inbox, and then below that a list of folders, you can make new ones etc.<br />
However, I accidentally dragged one of my folders into Inbox itself, and now it shows up on a dropdown of Inbox.
<br />
I can't drag it out, I can only drag it into other folders, rather than making it its own folder again.
<br />
I can't select 'move' and move it out, So Folder 1 is now in my inbox and I can't move it out.
<br />
I dragged another of my folders, lets call it Folder 2, Into Folder 1, but there's no dropdown for it and it's nowhere in sight.
<br />
I can't find Folder 2 anywhere now because I dragged it into Folder 1, Which is in Inbox.
<br />
<br />
How do I fix this?<br />
<br />
example:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/708460cb-5642-40c2-8c8a-c18cc92c40a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/708460cb-5642-40c2-8c8a-c18cc92c40a3" /><br />
<br />
Edit: I eventually managed to dig out the contents of each folder and had to manually move everything to a new folder, so I suppose this is more of a bug report than anything else, the bug being once you drag a folder into another you can't make it into it's
 own individual folder again.&nbsp;</a>

    <title>Excel Online Not handling shapes or objects - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scott r1939  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Online Not handling shapes or objects</h2>
                    <p>I create an Excel 2010 document using my desktop version, then upload it to a SharePoint Team Site.&nbsp; When it is&nbsp;viewed or edited using Excel online, the formatting is different.&nbsp; It is a five-sheet workbook.&nbsp; Some of the sheets look perfect while another
 sheet is missing&nbsp;three entire rows of data.&nbsp; When you view the page that is missing rows, it says it could not download the shape.&nbsp; But, there is another sheet that is formatted exactly the same, and it displays it perfectly.&nbsp; I don't know what shape it is
 referring to.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the three&nbsp;rows that are missing, two are headers and shaded in color, while the third is&nbsp;normal text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, one of the sheets does not display all of the text in certain cells.&nbsp; There are several large cells each with a full paragraph of text, and it chops off the last line or two of the text in each of these cells.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to edit the workbook in the browser (Excel Online), it says a copy of the file will be created without the following features:&nbsp; Shapes or other objects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really like to use Excel On-line because it is primarily a read-only document for the other members of the team, but when they try to view it with online Excel, they don't see the whole workbook.&nbsp; If they choose to open in Excel, it won't let them
 because they are using Excel 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I try to print the online version, it only asks if I want to print the current selection or the entire sheet.&nbsp; There is no option to print the entire workbook.&nbsp; I have to print each of the five sheets separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for such a large laundry list.&nbsp; Any insight is appreciated.&nbsp; By the way, we are very new to SharePoint/Excel Online.&nbsp; We are all using Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, you encountered error when you try opening an Excel workbook or editing it in Excel Online. It seems that the workbook contains features that are not supported by Excel Online. Unsupported features are contents or functionality
 in a workbook that prevents the workbook from being opened for editing or, in some cases, viewing in the browser. Here is
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Edit-a-workbook-that-contains-features-unsupported-by-Excel-Online-7220105d-97ad-4c35-95c8-58d4bbfd14af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
an article</a> providing steps to edit the workbook, depending on the nature of the unsupported features in the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, although Excel on your desktop and online with Office 365 share a lot of common features, there are some differences such as shapes can't be edited in a browser window. This article about

            NO, that will brick your phone.<br />
<br />
I have no idea why Nokia even made new firmware for this phone... unless your network supports it AND its virtually new and in warranty you can't update, period. If it does fall within the above conditions you still have to sacrifice it to the Nokia god (i.e.
 Nokia care point) and hope to God it ever comes back. Not bricked, either.

<h3> audiobahn1000  say:</h3>
<h2>            This site is not secure.... How to bypass&#63;</h2>
                    I visit a lot of company websites that require logging in with a common access card. These websites do not provide any type of certificate information for security reasons so the browser always thinks the website is not secure. IE10 used to allow me to
 bypass the message by clicking "continue to this website anyway" but that's not an option in IE11. How do I bypass this error? The websites are secure. I get this same error on all the company websites, all 20+ of them. I am able to access them on a different
 computer which runs IE11 though.<br />

    <title>Batch picture import and numeration of pictures in PP for mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ðñ€ð¼ðµð½ñƒð¸ð¥ð»ðµñ‡ñð½  say:</h3>
<h2>            Batch picture import and numeration of pictures in PP for mac</h2>
                    I just got my mac a several weeks ago and one of the first things to do was to buy MS Office for it. But I see that the PP for Mac has a big bug that I have no idea how to solve. It is the well known problem of the batch pictures import. I have seen a
 lot of forums discussing the problem, having said that, a lot of discussion took place several years ago, so my point is, is there probably any new way to do it, that not so many people know about?
<div>The main issue is that I need to frequently add 5-10 pictures on 1 slide and there is no way I can do that one by one, because the overall amount of pictures in 1 booklet can be up to 100 and also I can not put the ones I will use in a separate folder,
 because the timing is always crazy when it comes to this. As I said, I need to add 5-10 pictures on a single slide, so this way of doing this task through Automator PP slide show creation is not working for me unfortunately.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And if there is still no solution for this (I mean real solution, not buying some app, nor additional program), how can I and other people who face this problem every day tell this to Microsoft in a united way. I personally see no reason for this problem
 even to appear.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The other question might sound a bit crazy, but still!) Quit often I need to add a bunch of pictures to a booklet and give most of them numbers under them. Knowing all the magical features of Excel for example, I believe that PP can have some amazing way

            I'm having a but of trouble understanding your workflow.
<div><br />
<div>Somehow, you're going to have to tell PowerPoint where the pictures are that you want to import. The Insert Picture from File dialog can select only one at a time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You say that the Automator action isn't working for you, but you don't say which Automator action you are using or what steps you are taking. Some Automator actions were disabled by PowerPoint updates, so this isn't terribly surprising to me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is it that you would like to choose various picture files from different folders all in a single dialog? If that's what you are asking for, it would be possible, but it would involve quite a bit of advanced programming in VBA and AppleScript.</div>

            Dear Jim,
<div>what I would like to do, is to choose several files from one folder, but not all of them, select the ones I need pressing shift button and then importing them to one single power point slide. So basically it is when you import 1 file, instead of choosing
 one, you press shift and point at several ones in the same folder.</div>
<div>When it comes to Automator, I now can choose pictures from a folder and then using Automator I can create a slide show - 1 pic at a slide, but this is not what I need, because several pictures should be on 1 slide, not one picture on a separate slide.</div>

            There is also another way on PC, which is choosing several pictures in a folder pressing shift and then dragging them on a slide of Power point.

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>You are correct that the built-in Automator actions put each picture onto a new slide. If you wanted to change this behavior, you could
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/AutomatorConcepts/Automator.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>build yourself a new automator action</b></a>, but that is not a trivial task.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The <a href="http://www.agentjim.com/MVP/PowerPoint/InsertPicturePowerPoint2011HowToUse.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>add-in that I sell</b></a> allows you to put all the pictures onto a single slide, but you canâ€™t pick and choose from more than one folder. The add-in imports all the pictures from a single folder, and it doesnâ€™t tolerate having other kinds of files in that
 folder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>How about making an Automator action that imports the pictures into iPhoto? Then you can drag the pictures (one by one unfortunately) into your slides. I think that might be the fastest solution to the problem.</div>

<h2>            Howto Show Mailbox Status in Recycle Bin for Users with Revoked License</h2>
                    <p>Is there a view in the Admin Portal or via PowerShell that will show the status of a mailbox removed for an active user because the Exchange Online license was revoked?&nbsp; Without re-assigning the license, we'd like to confirm a mailbox is recoverable and
 how long it has remaining in the O365 Recycle Bin before being permanently removed. Exact scenario below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. UserA left the company.</p>
<p>2. UserA's Office 365 Exchange Online mailbox license was revoked per deprovisioning processes on July 1 but the Active Directory account is still&nbsp;online - it was disabled and&nbsp;has no licenses applied, but it is still present.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;On July 15, UserA contacts us to ask if we can temporarily re-activate the account so the user can&nbsp;access&nbsp;the mailbox to retrieve important e-mail.</p>
<p>4. While we're waiting on approval to re-activate the account, it&nbsp;would be nice to confirm the mailbox is intact and can be re-activated. We expect this to be the case because it's within the 30 day window but would like assurance that the mailbox exists
 and it would also be nice to know when it will be permanently removed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a command or view that will show the above?&nbsp; I'm aware of the "Deleted Users" container/search in the Admin Portal but that doesn't help in this case because the user account wasn't actually deleted yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I thought it was going to answer my question but in practice it did not. Here's what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Per the link you included, I executed the following commands and expected to see UserA listed in one or both:</p>
<p>Get-Mailbox -SoftDeletedMailbox</p>
<p>Get-Mailbox UserA -SoftDeletedMailbox</p>
<p>2. A few mailboxes were returned (at least&nbsp;by the first command above)&nbsp;but not UserA.</p>
<p>3. As a test, I temporarily re-assigned the Exchange Online license to UserA.</p>
<p>4. After waiting a bit, I ran the following command and verified that the mailbox for UserA was once again online and that it was not a new mailbox - i.e. it had a thousands of items just as it had when the license was revoked approx. 20 days ago.</p>
<p>get-mailbox usera | Get-MailboxStatistics</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question back to you/Microsoft: Why did UserA not appear as a mailbox when I used the -SoftDeletedMailbox switch - or did I mess something up?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have done some tests, and find if a new user has a name (email address) matching an old user, or this mailbox has been inactive for some long time, we cannot get outputs from Get-Mailbox â€“SoftDeletedMailbox. You can use PowerShell with Office 365 to achieve
 this goal:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Connect to Office 365 PowerShell:&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn975125.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn975125.aspx</a>; (Given that you are using Office 365 pure online, just
 type: </p>
<pre>$UserCredential = Get-Credential
Connect-MsolService -Credential $UserCredential</pre>
<p>The other commands don't need)</p>
<p>2. Run:&nbsp;Get-MsolUser â€“ReturnDeletedUsers | fl</p>

<h2>            VBA EXCEL&#58; HIGHLIGHTING ACTIVE ROW IN PROTECTED SHEETS</h2>
                    <p>I have an EXCEL 2016 sheet, and I need, when an EXCEL user is at any cell in this sheet, the entire row becomes highlighted. I have 2 problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">I need to add the restriction that says: highlighting be "DEactivated" for Cells "S3 to AB8"? NOTE: I want the restriction
 to apply ONLY to these cells not the entire rows that these cells are located in?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)"><span>Second, I will need to Protect my "EXCEL sheet" which locks and hides&nbsp;certain&nbsp;columns. I need the VBA code to work under both "protected" and "UNprotected"&nbsp;modes.</span></span></span></p>
