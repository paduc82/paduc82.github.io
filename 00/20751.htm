<p>just a brief sanity check that you mention the .accdb file format, yet of course 2002 and 2003 don't support that.&nbsp; So are you running 2010 in the .mdb format?</p>
<p>If there was a compelling reason to convert to .accdb - did you do then in 2010? or in 2007?</p>

<p>Hi Peter:</p>
<p>Thanks for the info! Although we do need those references, I did try to remove those and decompiles and compacted and repaired. &nbsp;It appeared it worked the first time. &nbsp;But then when i reopen it again it came back with the same issues if i encounter errors
 opening recordsets for some reason. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end what i did is i kept all the references the same and tested it. Whenever the database encounters an error opening a record set it errors out every time you open it. &nbsp;It will go away after you do a compact and repair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take note that i have a couple other applications like this with the same issue. &nbsp;I know its not my machine since i've tested this in other machines and i get the same issue. This is probably something with Access 2010. What else could be causing this issue??
 Its just a lousy solution that i must tell my clients that they need to do a compact and repair everytime they encounter an error.</p>
<p>I wonder when they will get a service pack out for 2010. Maybe that will fix some problems.</p>
        </p>

            No. &nbsp;I got multiple applications on multiple versions of access. The problem is the 2010 versions.

<h3> gehm  say:</h3>
<h2>            ellipses changed to midline</h2>
                    In Outlook 2011 for Mac (and only in Outlook - I don't have this problem in Word!), when I type an ellipses (...), it is automatically changed to midline (⋯). How can I switch off this annoying feature?
<br />
N.B.: In Preferences/Autocorrect is an option "replace as you type: ... with ellipses". I've tried both to tick this box and not to tick it - it does not make a difference to my problem! Thanks for any help!

            Hi Cody,&nbsp;
<div>yes, I had Outlook completely closed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, I wanted to try it again but I just "accidentally" solved the problem while writing an email! ;-) No idea why, but it seems that the standard font for emails in my Outlook is set to SimSun, an Asian font. I am typing Chinese quite regularly, but
 my system is set to English and my Office is also an English version with English as the standard language for new word documents as well as the standard input language. So I really hadn't noticed that emails open with this font! When I change the font to
 i.e. Arial, my ellipses are okay! &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just wanted to say thanks for your willingness to help and post the "answer" to my problem in case someone else has a similar one!&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 doesn&#39;t show&#47;receive unread mails</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>I have a problem with an outlook IMAP account: even if mail can be sent and received from that account, it only happens if I open one of the folders (inbox, sent etc).<br />
If I simply click the "send/recieve", no new mail appears in that account's inbox (but does in the others).<br />
I've tried many possible solutions such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-rebuilding the profile BUT this solution only lasted for a week before getting back to not showing anything on that inbox, again<br />
-scan/correct problems on the *.pst (nothing changed)<br />
-disabled the accelerated graphics (nothing changed)<br />
-use the /cleanips switch (nothing changed).<br />
<br />
To get it worse, the same account is linked and viewed by another user that doesn' seem to have the same issue: he can see the new emails without selecting any folder of that account.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance<br />
D.R.</p>

<p>Hello Lawrence,</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that I've already performed a .pst and .ost repair: as for recreating the account, this workaround only works for a week (even less) but then the issue comes back.<br />
<br />
Two things are rather weird in this:<br />
-the account DOES send and receive mails (and its .pst is quite small, around 2GB)<br />
-the issue only affects ONE user: the other, with the same account but configured as POP3, isn't affected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That could be one of the differences between IMAP and POP. For reference, you may refer to this

<p>For "repairing" the office application, I tried:<br />
<br />
-ost/pst scan (that didn't find anything and didn't solve the problem)<br />
-new account (worked for a week)<br />
-recreating the outlook profile (again: worked for some days but, eventually, the issue got back)</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the looks of it, seems that Outlook doesn't sync that inbox at the same time as the others UNLESS the user opens it. Everything is working fine but that address (and its inbox) must be checked by clicking the inbox folder or it simply sits there, without
 receiving emails.</p>

<p>Hi Lawrence,</p>
<p>sorry for such a late answer but I tried to remove every account from the client's outlook and configure them back again (using new .pst files). Unfortunately, this solution lasted only a few days.<br />
<br />
To answer to your previous question: no, it only happens on one account (the one configured in POP on one pc and in IMAP on one another).</p>

            <p>Hello Jennifer_Schmidt:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding your issues with Find My Phone.&nbsp; We do have a couple of things you can try to resolve this issue.&nbsp; Before trying the below steps, review this article that describes Find My Phone in greater detail,
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp7/basics/find-a-lost-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp7/basics/find-a-lost-phone</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is to verify your phone is listed to your account.&nbsp; Go to the phone and tap settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; verify the first email listed as Windows Live.&nbsp; Now, go to
<a href="http://windowsphone.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsphone.com</a> and sign into that account.&nbsp; Once signed in, go to MY PHONE.&nbsp; On this page you should see the name you gave your phone and the make and model of the phone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the phone is listed go to Find My Phone and try to use the service.&nbsp; If you have issues using the service, review this article,
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2446873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2446873</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the phone is not associated with your account you have a few things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may take 24-72 hours for the phone to be associated with your account.&nbsp; If you just recently set this phone up, wait a bit longer.</li><li>Try to download an application to your phone.&nbsp; I would suggest trying this directly to the phone and via the website.&nbsp; If the application installation works, sign out of the website and then back into the website to see if the phone is now listed.</li><li>If you still do not see the phone listed on the website, you will want to hard reset the phone.&nbsp; Keep in mind that this will set the phone back to it's factory settings.&nbsp; Media can be backed up to your PC,
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/syncing-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/syncing-media</a>.&nbsp; Contacts and calendar events should be backed up to the cloud.&nbsp; You can verify this by going to
<a href="http://contacts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://contacts.live.com</a> and <a href="http://calendars.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://calendars.live.com</a>.&nbsp; The information on your phone should be listed here.&nbsp; Text message history and game progress will be reset.</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any&nbsp;other questions or concerns.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />The answer to the issue is in the very next tool, "Borders and Shading".
<br />
<br />From the drop-down menu choose "Borders and Shading..."
<br />Click the "Shading" tab
<br />Choose the desired "Fill color"
<br />Check the following image link

<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.
<br />

            Select the portion of paragraph where you have problem
<br />Right Click &gt; Adjust list indents
<br />Adjust Bullet position and Text indent as per your requirement
<br />Further adjustment can be done by tabs appearing in the ruler.

            So your saying that I have to change the bullets and formatting the entire document just to have bullets where they are set.&nbsp; Seems like a really dumb thing to have to do.&nbsp; The client has everything set for bullets are the same in the normal document and
 the shaded areas like the one shown.&nbsp; Why would I have to change the rest of the formatting just so something can get shaded?? This seems like a bug in Word.<br />

            Shading is a paragraph attribute.  The only fix I know of is not elegant 
<br />
<br />To get the shading to work the way you want you will have to revert to manual bullets. 
<br />
<br />Customize the QAT
<br />find the "Convert List to Text" command (in the all commands list)
<br />after you finish the list click on the "convert list to text" button
<br />apply shading
<br />then add spaces to create the indent
<br />Adjust the hanging portion of the indent  
<br />Now you can create a style to apply the text formatting
<br />
<br />NOTE: this command will convert ALL number and bullet lists in document to text
<br />
<br />You can still automate new or existing lists.

<p>Hey Charles, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, I got that. The issue is that it is a problem in Word not us mortals. I have used word processors for decades and as you know Word is not perfect. It actually creates a gape of white above, below, and in front of sentences converted to bullets in a
 shaded paragraph. I have to work with a clients wishes and this is a problem.&nbsp; Word shouldn't determine a changing paragraph style just because you make something a list.&nbsp; There should be an option. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fudged and inserted a square filled with the same color as the shading and placed it into the gap.&nbsp; I know it is there they won't. It is just dumb programing that Word assumes you want it like this.</p>

<p>Here is a single-cell table (with a border which can be turned off). The shading is applied to the

                    <p>I have called Microsoft and the assistant was unable to help me turn off two step verification on my hotmail account.</p>
<p>I cannot receive mail on my iphone. There is no option to turn if off either. Apple has checked and the problem lies with Microsoft. I have read old messages related to this issue however they have not helped me! Please help me turn this off!!!!!!!!! &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Change zoom level of Styles and Formatting pane and Document Map pane - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul domaskis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change zoom level of Styles and Formatting pane and Document Map pane</h2>
                    
<p>My corporate template uses styles with very long names.&nbsp; I have to widen the Styles and Formatting pane quite a bit to see what the styles are.&nbsp; Is there a way to change the zoom level of the Styles and Formatting pane?</p>
<p>Same question applies the Document Map pane.&nbsp; For this, I know I can change the font style for the document map, but that's quite a bit of buttonology to control the size of the letters.&nbsp; Way nicer to be able to hold Ctrl and scroll up/down for zooming.&nbsp;
 While I don't expect something quite that easy for the Document Map pane, perhaps something less tedious than redefining the font?</p>

<p>I have always been able to upload photos and videos to any website on the internet, but as of late I am getting a runtime error!&nbsp; I will log in to the site wheter it be Facebook, YouTube or Snapfish and bring up the uploading option.&nbsp; The upload will bring

<p><span>Hello Fetz76,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try running Internet Explorer without add-ons then retest the upload feature to see if one of the add-ons is causing a problem. To run IE without add-ons
 click Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;System Tools then select Internet Explorer (no add-ons). Try uploading again and let us know if this helps correct the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try resetting IE to the defaults to see if this will solve the issue. To reset IE to the defaults click Tools&gt; Internet Options then go to the
 Advanced tab. Click on the reset button at the bottom of the Advanced tab and select the options you would like to keep from the list.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if this helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 920 no longer able to sync after Windows 8.1 update</h2>
                    Hi, first post ever here, so please bear with me. I've had a Nokia Lumia 920 since last year. Just bought a Surface RT a few months ago, and was able to plug it in via USB and sync all my files, videos, pictures, etc. using the desktop mode and locating
 the phone under "devices". Now, after updating the Surface RT last week to 8.1, I plug the Nokia Lumia 920 into the USB port, the Surface recognizes that it is there, but places the phone under an "unspecified" section, calling it "RM-820 Nokia Lumia 920",
 there is also the yellow triangle with an exclamation point in it. &nbsp;When I click on the device, it has Code 31 "The device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for the device." When I try to update the driver software, it
 searches, then comes back with the message "The best driver software for your device is already installed" "Windows has determined that the driver software for your device is up to date." I've tried uninstalling the device, updating drivers, uninstalling drivers,
 to no avail. I am at my wits end. Please help!&nbsp;

            <p>Try this. Connect the phone and go to the device manager, right click the RM-820 device and uninstall it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Disconnect the phone. Shutdown and restart the Surface.&nbsp; No lock code on the phone.</p>
<p>With the phone turned off connect it to the Surface. It will turn on, being charged and drivers will reload. It should come up in the device manager in potrable devices.</p>

<p>Hi PikaJ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you mean you set the office 365 account as connected account for outlook.com account on Outlook.com?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, I suggest you to send emails from Office 365 directly, it is not encouraged to set Office 365 account on Outlook.com. You can set outlook.com account as connected account on Outlook on the Web:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for replying back. No, considering your situation, I have double-checked this issue and the error messages you posted above, it is most likely related to Outlook.com server side. To better help you,
 I will move this thread to Outlook.com category, our dedicated team support will further focus on this issue.</p>

                    <p>I can't get any newly created notebooks to sync with the online server; I started another new one to see if that would fix the problem but now I just have two notebooks that are constantly syncing. All of the troubleshooting suggestions say to close the
 notebook and open in from online, but the notebooks also won't close; when I try to do that, OneNote goes into panic mode and just shuts down. I'm running OneNote 15.16 on OSX 10.10. Does anyone have suggestions?</p>

<h3> tony_fish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 freezes when opening a file from a share drive</h2>
                    <p>Issue:&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our office, one user who is opening up a document from a share folder will experience Microsoft word freezing.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't display a not responding message</li><li>It doesn't lock up and close out automatically</li><li>It doesn't show any behavior typical of an issue, however doesn't allow any user input.
</li><li>Can not type, select anything on menu bar, can not minimize, or close out without using task manager.</li><li>You can move the mouse around, however it appears to be frozen.&nbsp;</li><li>Everything else works, and nothing shows up in event viewer.&nbsp;</li><li>Issue is intermittent</li></ul>
<p>I have been able to duplicate it with one document, multiple times, and the only variable I can determine is that the file opens in Compatibility mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For troubleshooting currently I've:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repaired Office</li><li>Deleted the Word Data Registry Key</li><li>Deleted the Word Options Registry Key</li><li>Deleted the Normal.dot file&nbsp;</li><li>Restarted the Computer</li></ul>
<p>Next step was going to try to disable all add-ons, however, this issue only happened once today for the user and she is working so wasn't able to try that yet, however was hoping I might have overlooked something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some additional information:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 2010 32-bit</p>
<p>Windows 7 32-bit</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>Also provide us the event viewer logs which will display the application name which is causing the issue.

            <p>I meant to stated Word, this isn't with Outlook, my fault. </p>
<p>
</p><p>By not locking up, I meant freezing windows explorer as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no event logs because it doesn't crash or send a report or anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word just opens and doesn't do anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't type or click on any active buttons in Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't freeze or respond to anything. It doesn't display the Not responding message and close itself. It lets you move your mouse and use keyboard shortcuts for Windows (for example, I could use ctrl+shift+esc to monitor the processes).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't give you any information on why it's causing an error or not responding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling and installing Office 2010 recently and disabling all plugins.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t mobile 6.1 send a site password&#63;</h2>

                    <span>I have a subscription site that I access through my smartphone (htc p4000).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This was easy to set up and completely reliable with Windows Mobile 6.0 professional from the original installation.<br />
<br />
Last week, I upgraded the phone to Windows Mobile 6.1 with the file provided by my supplier (Telus). While I had moved all the files I new how to, this, of course, blew away things like saved passwords in Internet Explorer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Now when I try to log in to the site, I get blocked because the site either does not receive or does not understand the password.<br />
<br />
The web site recommends copy and paste to make sure that the username and password are exact.&nbsp; This works for the username but IE does not allow pasting the password.&nbsp; I do know that I am typing the password in correctly, but I include this info for possible
 diagnostic.<br />
<br />
It will not work whether or not I click to save my password.<br />
<br />
How do I get this working again?<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>With Windows Mobile 6.1 Microsoft made changes to Pocket Internet Explorer.&nbsp; So the website may no longer be accessible even if the password is typed correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To confirm that you type your password correctly, I suggest that you use the on screen keyboard to enter the password.&nbsp; You can see what keys you press for each stroke.</p>

            <span>Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I had used the onscreen keyboard and often enough to get locked out a couple of times without success.<br />
<br />
I had queried the web site and they have provided a new user name and password which work.<br />

            How are you doing the starter "re-install"?&nbsp; Are you using the "Office Program Manager"?&nbsp; Your other "re-install" option is to completely re-install Windows using the "recovery partition". That will wipe all of your personal data files, so make sure you
 have good backups before you do that .&nbsp; Your only remaining option may be to contact your computer builder. They are the ones who are supposed to support Starter.<br />
<br />
<b><span>Re-install Office Starter</span></b>
<p><span><a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=e9a78c332557256f&amp;resid=E9A78C332557256F%21212&amp;parid=E9A78C332557256F%21132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=e9a78c332557256f&amp;resid=E9A78C332557256F!212&amp;parid=E9A78C332557256F!132</a>
</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>Office 2010 Starter is only officially installed by computer builders. If you google skillfully, there are a few links to the installation files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Home users do not have access to the installation file so there are only 3 options for “re-installing” it.</span></p>
<p><span>This document outlines the 3 options you have to “re-isntall” Office 2010 Starter:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Office Program Manager</span></li><li><span>Recovery Partition</span></li><li><span>Image Copy Backup</span></li></ol>
<p>There is an option that allows users to re-install Office Starter without using the recovery partition.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It requires that you have the “Microsoft Office 2010 Program Manager” installed. If you go into Programs and Features dialog, look for the “Microsoft Office 2010” entry.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The link above shows how this entry appears in Programs and Features, and how to use it to re-install Office Starter.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b><span>Starter is Part of the Recovery Partition</span></b>

</span></p>
<p>Hard drive recovery is a requirement for distributing Office Starter 2010 . A hard-disk-based recovery solution enables Windows 7 to automatically recover from most known causes for unbootable systems as a result of loss or corruption of files.
</p>
<p>This type of recovery will wipe out all of your installed programs and personal data files. Therefore, before starting this type of “repair” you should make a backup of your disk and make sure that you have the installation files and product keys for all
 of your applications.</p>

<h2>            Using Word Mail Merge to print a list with different Font sizes</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to print a simple list of two columns having different fonts for labels using MS Word Mail Merge.&nbsp; I have prepared the list in Excel as I want it printed; the first column contains numbers with a font of 36 and the second column contains a descriptive
 phrase having a font of 12 which is identified by the large, number in the first column.&nbsp; The 8160 mailing labels I have chosen are large enough to handle the large number 36 font easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I follow the procedure for using Mail Merge easily, but when done, the printed label sheet comes out with a font of 12 for both the number and the descriptive phrase, even though in the Excel list, has been prepared correctly.&nbsp; Obviously I'm missing some
 critical step in the Word Mail Merge process which will allow the Excel list to transfer as already prepared.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi Jeremiah, if you mean Outlook Contacts:
<br />
<br />To enable Show Outlook contacts, in the menu bar click Contacts - Show Outlook Contacts. 
<br />
<br />Once you have done this, your Outlook contacts will be shown in your contact list       
        </p>

            <p>Hi BarryKress,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what&nbsp;I understand you are unable to receive emails that were sent to you recently. Let me help you with that. It is possible that your account's filter settings are affecting the delivery of incoming messages to your mailbox. Please check out the article
 below for the instructions on how to check and modify your email settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To view the <strong>Options</strong> page in Outlook.com, just click on the
<strong>gear icon</strong> (located in the upper right corner beside your name) and go to
<strong>More mail settings</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/hotmail-email/i-am-not-receiving-email-sent-by-friends-or-family/377a9bf3-7975-4d76-a6eb-04dcc6d68097">I'm not receiving emails sent by my family or friends</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I have created a private message area where you can provide the affected email address for us to determine the cause of the issue. Just click on the "<strong>You have a private reply to this message</strong>" link above your post to view the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that you are signed in to the forum to view the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, it would be better if you can provide us more information to better understand the issue by answering the questions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the same issue occur when accessing your account on a different browser/computer?
</li><li>Does the same issue occur when using a different Outlook.com account on the same browser/computer?
</li><li>Are you unable to receive emails from a particular contact or from all your contacts?<br />
Do the emails sent to you contain any file&nbsp;attachments? </li><li>Did you receive any error message? If yes, please include the exact error message in your reply.</li></ul>
<p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
