<br />
What is the complete model number of HP laptop?<br />
<br />
The issue might be like the webcam not getting detected. <br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: <span>Run the Hardware and device troubleshooter.</span></strong></span></p>
b. Click Control panel.<br />
c. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting.<br />
d. Under Hardware and Sound, click Configure a device.<br />
e. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong>If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to check if there are Windows 8.1 compatible drivers for the webcam in the HP website by selecting the model number of your laptop. If there are no window 8.1 drivers, then install
 the webcam drivers in compatibility mode foe Windows 8.<br />

<p>I can't be the first to see this, however I opted in to the new dashboard. I think today I realized it is a system trying to mesh 360 with ONE :) maybe? Anyways I have lost contacting with my daughter. We only talk through Xbox and I need to OPT OUT! I can
 see the voice equalizer of her msg when she sends them but hear nothing. I get NOTHING when in a private party/game with her EVERYONE else can hear her. I can hear other people when playing with other friends. I would like to opt out of this please, gratholio
 is my handle. I called and spoke to XBOX they told me to ask here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>P.S. I am a computer science graduate and am looking for a job besides the one I have cleaning pools and hacking clear net channels. :) I'm serious about my problem please devolve my account. If you see this I just changed my # on live to 252-***-5*5* please
 talk to me. I would rather this be fixed sooner than later.poice!</p>

<h2>            Can Microsoft please stop with the forced windows 10 reboots&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Today I woke up again to find my Windows 10 PC in a rebooted state. Gone are my opened notepad documents. Gone are my browser sessions. The VirtualBox virtualmachine killed. Yes, killed, not cleanly shut down. Booting it up again reveals all kinds of errors
 (such as MySQL crashed tables). What makes Microsoft think it is a perfectly fine idea to simply pull the plug on a running machine?</div>
<div>This irritates me to no end. This is my PC. I paid for this Windows 10 license. I am perfectly capable of deciding for myself when I want to update, and when to reboot. What makes Microsoft decide that my running VM is not important, that my notepad documents
 contain no important information, and that whatever is open in the browser is just ****?</div>
<div>Microsoft is perfectly capable of preserving the state of a full desktop. After upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 10 on another computer, the whole desktop including opened documents and browsers was restored when the upgrade completed. Microsoft just
 chooses it's not important for regular updates?</div>

<p>This is a PC which is always on (hence the 24/7 running VM), and is actively used by myself in non regular intervals during the day, so I have no fixed times where i'm not at the PC. I do set active hours when an update/reboot notification pops up. But when
 i'm not at the PC, and this update/reboot notification pops up, and I do not react quick enough (since i'm not looking at it), it will decide for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the very least it should wait a full 24 hours before deciding for me what to do. Preferrably it would not decide for me at all. Operating systems used to do what I wanted them to do, but with Windows 10 it seems that the user has to do whatever the OS
 wants.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This forced reboot/application killing process can damage all kind of things (crypto wallets as another example).</p>

<p>"Active hours" means the period during which you are or may be actively using the computer. In Settings you can pre-set a schedule of up to 18 hours (perhaps longer in 1709) during which the computer will not restart to install an update. If the computer
 needs to re-start outside Active Hours and it detects that you are still using the computer then you are prompted and can delay the restart. You need to be present to see the prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how Windows 10 is designed to work. There may be Enterprise versions that work differently, but these are generally not available to individuals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A VM can run on just about any operating system (or no operating system.) If you need your VM to run 24/7 you're looking at a different operating system. Windows 10 can delay restarts for a long time, but eventually your computer needs to restart.</p>

<p>"This is how Windows 10 is designed to work."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I call that a design flaw. An OS should work with the user, not against the user. Killing applications while you leave your PC on overnight (either for VM's, blockchain synchronisation, 3D modelling, code compiling, etc) is bad design. And causes frustration
 to the max. I had to spend 2 hours today fixing the mess this forced reboot left me with. And this was nowhere near the first time either.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can't really be suggesting I buy a separate computer for every task I do on a computer? That is what I have linux VM's for.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I'm away for a couple of days, and leave the computer performing the tasks I want it to perform. Imagine the utmost frustration when I arrive home to find the computer uselessly consuming electricity in a rebooted state?</p>

    <title>Unable to access shared folders on Drive connected via USB to Linksys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slc electric ensemble  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to access shared folders on Drive connected via USB to Linksys E3000 router. Unable to change permissions.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I recently set up a home network using the new Linksys E3000 router, which provides a USB port for drive sharing, backup, and media streaming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm getting a message that says the folder access is denied, and I should contact the administrator for access.After spending several hours with linksys support, I was unable to solve the initial problem, which is to get full control over the files and
 folders on this drive.</p>
<p>We did the following without success:</p>
<p>Remapped the drive</p>
<p>Made sure I was logged in as administrator</p>
<p>Made sure the workgroup name was consistent.</p>
<p>Attempted to assign full control with permissions. This was particularly strange. When I set permissions to full control for any group or user, after clicking apply Windows would attempt to set new permissions, but then the folder would go right back to
 having limited permissions. I was unable to edit. I'm assuming this is where the problem is.</p>
<p>Any idea why I can't change the permissions on these network folders?</p>

<span>Hi Matt,</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>First,</span> &nbsp;<span>take ownership of the drive, and then give sharing permissions.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span>To do this, follow these steps:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Right-click the drive that you want to take ownership of, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>Properties</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the<strong><span>&nbsp; Security</span></strong>tab, and then click<strong><span>OK</span></strong>on
 the Security message (if one appears).</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click&nbsp;<strong><span>Advanced</span></strong>, and then click the<strong><span>Owner</span></strong>tab.</span></p>
<p><span>4. In the<strong><span>&nbsp; Name</span> &nbsp;</strong>list, click your<strong><span>user
 name</span></strong>, or click<strong><span>Administrator</span> &nbsp;</strong> if you are logged in as Administrator, or click the<strong><span>Administrators</span>
 &nbsp;</strong>group. If you want to take ownership of the contents of the folder, select the&nbsp;<strong><span>Replace owner on subcontainers and objects</span> &nbsp;</strong>check box.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click<strong><span>&nbsp; OK</span></strong>, and then click<strong><span>Yes</span></strong>when
 you receive the following message:</span></p>
<p><span>You do not have permission to read the contents of directory<span>folder name</span> . Do you want to replace the directory permissions with permissions
 granting you Full Control?</span></p>
<p><span>All permissions will be replaced if you click&nbsp;<strong><span>Yes</span></strong>.<br />
<br />
Note <span>folder name</span> is the name of the folder that you want to take ownership of.</span></p>
<p><span>Click<strong><span>&nbsp; OK</span></strong>, and then reapply the permissions and security settings that you want for the folder and
 its contents<span>.</span></span></p>
<div>
<p><span>Refer:</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/What-are-permissions</a></span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>If that does not work, temporarily disable the router's firewall settings and all other security software and check.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>Enable all security software after the test.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If nothing works in your favor, start your computer with&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>safe
 mode with networking</span> </a>and check if you are able to access the shared folder.</span></p>

            <p>The problem is with all MS windows&nbsp;ISO&nbsp;copies you down load from MS&nbsp;web site.</p>
<p>The real problem is with all folders with yourOS drive will be set with a read only attribute that causes the error 1317. For some reason it also&nbsp;effects a higher level and sets permissions out of whack that is not causing&nbsp;error 1317. Just ask a friend for
 a non down loaded copy with a hallow on it and&nbsp;reinstall.</p>

<p>Hi Theilog, </p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that you can't do this and that it downloads for the region your console is in or the disc is native too. It's been a issue for sometime, you maybe able to contact customer support to see if they can amend or credit your account with
 the German version.</p>

<h2>            Random BSoDs &#40;nt&#33;KxWaitForLockOwnerShip&#43;14&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had BSoD for a long time now, that are completely random in interval (sometimes multiple crashes a day, other times none for a week). Also they can't be tied to any specific activity, many happened during me being AFK.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things I already tried:</strong></p>
<p>Malwarebytes, sfc scannow, DISM, memtest (only 2 passes, will do more later), migrating the OS to an other device, putting the GPU in a different slot, using a different GPU, installing all drivers listed on the motherboard's manufacturer's support site,
 reinstalling GPU driver with DDU, and finally: reinstalling windows (last time in january). After doing the latter things look fine for a few months, then the crashes start again (Maybe I make the same mistakes after every installation?).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The dump files:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aqi1ujmNGp_rc88xi8LjALN9ybw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aqi1ujmNGp_rc88xi8LjALN9ybw</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few (all from a single day), so here is an excerpt of the contents (I was experimenting with verifier, but some "natural" BSoD-s got in the mix:</p>
<p>
</p><p>040618-5953-01<span> </span>I used the verifier for this one. Says: unable to verify timestamp for vmulti.sys, VerifierExt.sys<br />
IO_violation_type: 22e The caller has completed a successful IRP_MJ_PNP instead of passing it down.<br />
during the BSOD it also mentioned wdf01000.sys<br />
<br />

probably caused by ntkrnlmp.exe (nt!KxWaitForLockOwnerShip+14)<br />

process_name: chrome.exe<br />
exception code ffffffffc0000005<br />
<br />
040618-6000-01<span> </span>I used the verifier for this one. says: vmulti.sys<br />
probably caused by ntkrnlmp.exe<br />
iomanager violation (c9), type: 22e<br />
<br />
040618-7203-01<span> </span>sys thread exc not handled_M (1000007e)<br />
unable to verify checksum for win32k.sys<br />
exc code: c0000005 access violation<br />
(nt!KxWaitForLockOwnerShipWithIrql+12)<br />
<br />
Found out that vmulti is the driver for my graphics tablet. According to InstalledDriverList, error control is set to "ignore" for this driver.<br />
Unticked vmulti, ran verifier again, to see what changes:<br />
<br />
040618-6031-01<span> </span>driver verifier detected violation (c4)<br />
probably caused by: ntkrnlmp.exe (nt!VerifierBugCheckIfAppropriate+df)<br />
default_bucket_id: verifier_enabled_vista_minidump<br />
process name: system<br />
<br />
Ran verifier with only null.sys checked, to see what happens. I didn't have a specific reason to pick null.sys, verifier didn't let<br />
me start it with nothing being selected.<br />
Checked verifier in cmd with querysettings, and it also checked ndis.sys and wdiwifi.sys without my consent<br />
This, again resulted in a BSoD:<br />
<br />
040618-7218-01<span> </span>driver_irql_not_less_or_equal (d1)<br />
probably caused by: NTFS.sys (NTFS!NtfsFsdDispatchSwitch$filt$0+0)<br />
default_bucket_id: verifier_enabled_vista_minidump<br />
process_name: MsMpEng.exe<br />

<p>
</p><p>Please help diagnosing this problem, I feel like I reached a dead end. The results seem completely random to me, and I have no idea what to make of all of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind thanks,</p>
<p>Peter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: While I did not overclock anything, it seems like my CPU was running 100 MHz faster than specified. Strange. Prime 95 showed workers failing, so I disabled turbo, forcing the CPU to run at 4 GHz max, instead of 4.3 (The official boost speed was 4.2).&nbsp;
 Now I see no workers failing, and I haven't crashed since then, but we'll see if that changes or not.</p>

<li>Version 1709, build 16299.309</li><li>PC</li><li>Windows 10 Pro</li><li>The issue started roughly around the time I switched graphics cards, but switching back to my old GPU did not solve the problem, and the new graphics card did not cause any problems in a different build, so it was just coincidental.</li><li>Answered in the original post above. In addition I underclocked my CPU yesterday (and disabled turbo) to make it run at 3.8 GHz.</li><li>I use the defender bulilt in Windows</li><li>Yes, as mentioned above, using Malwarebytes. No threats found.</li><li>The partiton containing the OS have 83GB left</li><li>0, as none of the applications run outside of the OS (I probably misunderstood this question)</li><li>Certainly, the next time I see one.</li><li>Here is the picture requested:&nbsp;<a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aqi1ujmNGp_rdfgRBXM8YlBbafw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aqi1ujmNGp_rdfgRBXM8YlBbafw</a>&nbsp;<br />
Please note that I already included a report above with much greater detail</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Since I underclocked my CPU I haven't had any&nbsp; BSoDs. If their absence continues for more than 2-4 weeks, I'd consider this case to be closed.</p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC crashed a total of 4 times since the 8th of April, so the problem has not been resolved. But the crashes seem to be less frequent now. Sadly no crash dumps were made, as there were no BSoDs. The entire system just froze. This isn't new, many of the
 crashes I had before the 8th of April were like this, so this isn't a new sympthom. Therefore all the lead we have is what I provided above in the main post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I ran memtest for 6 more passes, no errors were found.</p>

                    The screen reverts to the previous screen with the cursor repositioned in the top left corner of the screen. No idea why this happens &amp; is very frustrating when using the internet.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
First, it would really appreciated if you could kindly provide the information as to where exactly are you trying to change the font size?<br />
Is the Windows Font Size or in dependent application like Microsoft Office, Wordpad, Notepad etc. Also please post as to which Windows are you currently using.<br />

Change The Windows XP Font Size
If your Windows XP computer's default font size seems a little small for comfortable viewing, you can easily make the font larger.<br />
<br />
<strong>Here's how:</strong><br />
<ol>
<li>Right-click an open area of the Windows Desktop and then click "Properties" to open the "Display Properties" window.<br />
</li><li>Click the "Appearance" tab.<br />
</li><li>In the drop down list labelled "Font Size", select the desired size.<br />
</li><li>Click "OK" to save the change and exit the "Display Properties" window.<br />
&lt;!-- End Screenshot --&gt;&lt;!-- End XP Unit --&gt;<br />
<br />
There are three font sizes to choose from, these being, "Normal", "Large Fonts" and "Extra Large Fonts". As the name implies, "Normal" is the Windows XP default size. To return to the default font size, follow the procedure outlined above and choose "Normal"
 in the "Font Size" list.<br />
<br />
The change will alter the font display in Windows title bars, dialogs and menus. It will not normally alter the font in documents such as word processor files or web pages.<br />

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest to update the Killer driver from the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.killernetworking.com/driver-downloads/category/killer-suite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.killernetworking.com/driver-downloads/category/killer-suite</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And uninstall and reinstall the ESET security software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And uninstall, at least temporarily, any MSI utilities that may be installed as the
<a href="https://www.sysnative.com/drivers/driver.php?id=NTIOLib_X64.sys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
NTIOLib_X64.sys</a> is showing up as an "unloaded module".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists try uninstalling ESET and use Windows built-in antivirus (Windows Defender) and firewall.</p>

Eset has been reinstalled also.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sysnative.com/drivers/driver.php?id=NTIOLib_X64.sys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NTIOLib_X64.sys</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;was pointed to MSI Super Charger application

<p>seems it's problem with one of my 3 Displays (BenQ Zowie XL2720), which after 15min inactivity (power plans) should be turned off, instead of this it just show black screen and LED's still shine.<br />
Sorry for my bad English, and thanks for help anyway. Regards Michał</p>

                    <p>Origianal Title: Connect a camera??!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried to use the camera app on my laptop but it said I needed to connect it to a camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY??</p>
<p>
</p><p>See, I haven't done&nbsp;<em>any </em>changes or updates on my laptop <em>at all </em>
recently, and then out of the blue, my webcam isn't working? Ugh. It's just really frustrating considering I got brand-new only&nbsp;two months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's an Acer Aspire V5-122P-0889.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips/suggestions/<strong>instructions</strong></p>
<p>would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player 11. Way to change the l order Library album art stacks in artist view mode&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>(A purely aesthetic&nbsp;problem here)</p>
<p>In windows media player, when viewing library in the artist view mode, my albums are shown as "stacks" under each respective artist name. What determines the order of these stacks? Is there a way to choose the order yourself?</p>
<p>I want to be able to choose because i don't like the look of a few of my album covers, and i'd prefer to have my favourites at the top.</p>
<p>Many Thanks</p>
<p>Adam</p>

    <title>Xbox update error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nebruchadnezzar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox update error</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever i try to install the recent update I get a message saying that my xbox cannot process the update and then the following status code:&nbsp;4174-417f-1380-267f-c000-007f. I've seen multiple other posts about this and it seems the only way to get it fixed
 is to send it in to get repaired, are there any fixes anyone knows to work that could help in saving some time and money?</p>

            <p>Hey there, Nebruchadnezzar! This seems in relation to the most recent update, and it's a known issue. We've seen that doing the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/system/system-updates-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">offline update</a> has worked for most users.<br /><br />Give that a shot and let us know how it works! If it doesn't, we may want to set your console up for repair, but we'll explore that if it comes to it.</p>

            <p>Yep, that's exactly what I was talking about! Sorry for not being clear on that.<br /><br />Before you installed the new update, did you remove the previous one first? You'll want to go to your storage and do this button sequence:<br /><br /><strong>LB RB X LB RB X</strong><br /><br />It will pop up saying that it's going to remove any system update currently on there. Then you will want to update via USB after that. Also make sure that your USB is formatted the way listed on our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox 360 USB Flash Drive support</a> page. :)<br /><br />Hopefully doing it in that order will help you out! Please keep me updated on how it works out. :D</p>

<h2>            Hard drive completely full on Dell Venue 8 Pro running Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I gave up on resolving this issue quite some time ago and am revisiting it.&nbsp; The issue is that my hard drive on my Dell Venue 8 Pro is completely filled when I don't have any personal content loaded.&nbsp; The only app I have on there is Office 2010.&nbsp; It has
 a 32GB hard drive and shows a capacity of 23.1GB.&nbsp; Checking with File Explorer, the Documents, Pictures, Music and Video folders are all empty.&nbsp; I have a 128GB microSD card I use for storage, yet the hard drive shows only 13MB free.&nbsp; I checked other folders
 on the hard drive and Windows had 15.4GB on it which I thought was a lot.&nbsp; the Program Files folder had 2.41GB and the Users folder had 1.83GB.&nbsp; I have no clue as to what content is filling up the rest of the hard drive.&nbsp; Any advice on where to find this content
 and/or what I can delete from the Windows folder would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Mike, to clarify you can always reinstall Office as often as you want.  Microsoft is only interested in knowing that it isn't installed on more than the allowed number of devices at the same time.  Hence it may send you to phone activation to trade information that confirms or updates the device's hardware ID.  But this has no bearing on how many times you install.  What if someone's PC crashes and they must reinstall.  A software maker isn't going steal your property from your rightful use, and that includes today being able to reinstall the software as often as you want.  
<br />
<br />If there are temporary files or appdata from old programs or that is outdated, this should be cleared if you choose System Files during Disk Cleanup.  
<br />
<br />There are some other steps here:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-free-up-disk-space-in-windows/2458cc31-bd19-482f-ace5-7e3bd9da8098">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you reinstall there are special steps here in addition to following the Clean Install tutorial which assures the best possible install:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-install-windows-10-on-devices-with-limited/d933c129-c54b-4e40-aa4e-9813c59814af">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            unable to get windows xp to find available wireless networks using airlink 101 golden 150 wireless usb adapter</h2>
                    I have installed the airlink 101 golden wireless usb adapter in my windows XP. It worked for approx 5 minutes when I first installed it, had access to internet and e-mail etc. then it just lost the signal and it finds no available networks. I uninstalled
 and reinstalled with no success. I believe the problem is with the computer as I exchanged the product and still get the same results. Wondering how or what needs to be done so the adpater is able to pick up any available wireless&nbsp; networks so can secure my
 home modem/router to it, THX

In the future, please start your own thread. <br />
<br />
If by "revert to XP" you mean that you reinstalled Windows XP on a computer that had a different operating system installed, you almost certainly need to reinstall the drivers for your computer's hardware.&nbsp; This includes (but is not limited to) a driver for
 your wireless network adapter.<br />
<br />
If you have a brand name computer (e.g., Dell, HP, Lenovo), you should be able to find all of the necessary drivers on the web site of the computer manufacturer.&nbsp; For other machines, you will have to identify the manufacturer of the various hardware devices
 (motherboard, audio card, video card, network adapters) and get the appropriate drivers from the respective hardware manufacturers.<br />
<br />
If you need help in identifying internal hardware, post back with the make and model of your computer<br />

    <title>Bug in the Bulgarian Traditional phonetic keyboard when using special - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> venelin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug in the Bulgarian Traditional phonetic keyboard when using special Russian characters&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am using the Bulgarian traditional phonetic keyboard that Windows 7 provides by default. It works perfectly, but from time to time I also need to write in Russian, which contains two additional letters that do not exist in Bulgarian, namely Э and Ы. Very
 conveniently, the Bulgarian keyboard layout allows you to write them, by holding SHIFT+ALTright and the two keys to the right of the P in a standard QWERTY keyboard. But the two letters only appear as capitals. I also tried CapsLock, but I still only get them
 in uppercase. They are definitely used in lowercase, too, and the standard Russian keyboards have them.<br />
<br />
Is this a bug or there is another combination to type these symbols? If a bug, is it possible to signal it somehow to the developers and maybe have it fixed with some new Windows update?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for the tips<br />
Venelin<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to add Russian input language and change the keyboard layout to Russian language and check if you’re able you’re able to type the characters in lowercase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the following link to add the Russian input language in ‘Keyboards and Languages’.</p>

            Yes, I did that already before asking the question; maybe I was not clear enough about it. The Russian layout has both uppercase and lowercase, as it should.<br />
<br />
Could somebody check whether they get the same result with these key combinations?<br />
<br />
I do think there is a bug in the layout, which nobody has brought up to the developers, because these characters are not in any way needed to write Bulgarian. However, seeing that half of the work is done and the uppercase is already in the layout, it would
 be great to simply enable the lowercase, too. Just like the hyper-useful Word shortcuts for writing German umlauts or French/Italian accents using an US layout, for example.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />

<p><br />
All Marketplace content is tied to two things:</p>
<div>1) The console ID from the console on which you purchased the DLC and<br />
2) Your gamertag.<br />
<div>You can use your content on any profile on the console that you first bought the content on. But there is no way to change the ownership of the content to the new profile.

It would seem this is what needs to be resolved. What do you mean by -&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic">
my profile wont join parties </span>- <br />
and are you aware of a reason for this ?&nbsp; Have you been banned for cheating,&nbsp; bad or inappropriate behavior ?<br />
<br />
I do know you can change your login name (if I am using the correct term) but will loose save games with some games. This happened to me when I inadvertently used a different name when installing DIRT 3.
<br />
GFWL can be Draconian system in many ways (and for my purposes useless as well ),&nbsp; but it's no good complaining.
<br />
To complain is&nbsp; the sound of one hand clapping, and nobody from Monopoly$oft or the game publishers can hear, and would not care if they could.<br />
I've never bought DLC of any sort.&nbsp; imo - DLC is a huge marketing scam that&nbsp; would go away if people resisted buying them. Resistance is not in most gamers vocabulary, unfortunately.<span style="font-style: italic"><br />
