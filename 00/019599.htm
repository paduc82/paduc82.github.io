            <p>Hi Shreeyas,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community. As per the description you are facing issues in inserting the Pivot table in Excel. Let me help you with this issue.</p>
<p>Before troubleshooting on the issue, I need more information:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does this issue occur with specific Excel file or all the files?</span>
</li><li><span>Is the ‘</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Pivot</span><span> </span>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">out</span><span> or </span><span style="font-weight: bold">missing</span><span> in the insert tab of the ribbon?</span>
</li></ol>
<p>In order to troubleshoot the issue related to inserting pivot table in Excel, let us try the below steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the <font><span style="font-weight: bold">pivot</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">
table</span></font> option is greyed out then possible cause is that the Worksheet would be protected or grouped.</p>
<p>Verify if the Worksheets are grouped, if so you may ungroup the Worksheets and check it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When multiple worksheets are selected, <font><span style="font-weight: bold">[Group]</span> appears in the title bar at the top of the worksheet. To cancel a selection of multiple worksheets in a workbook, click any unselected worksheet. If no unselected
 sheet is visible, right-click the tab of a selected sheet, and then click <span style="font-weight: bold">
Ungroup Sheets</span></font> on the shortcut menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also verify if the Workbook is shared. If the workbook is shared then uncheck the option.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Open your Excel workbook. </span></li><li><span>Click on Review tab &gt; Unprotect sheet.</span> </li><li><span>Type the password and click Ok.</span> </li></ul>
<p>I hope the above steps helps. If you need further assistance on this particular issue or any other Office related issues let us know and we will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Lumia 1520 - Project My Screen Works - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chucke2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 1520 - Project My Screen Works</h2>
                    
<p>I've been able to successfully use the Project My Screen feature (halfway down the list on the Settings menu) of my Lumia 1520, with Windows Phone 8.1, to mirror phone contents (e.g., Photos) and stream videos (e.g., Xbox Video, Hulu Plus, Netflix) to my
 TV using the Netgear Push2TV (PTV3000) plugged into an HDMI port on the TV.&nbsp; Important: To get it to work, I first had to update the firmware of the PTV3000.&nbsp; Out of the box, the PTV3000 firmware version was 1.0.13, and Project My Screen on my 1520 searched
 but couldn't find the PTV3000.&nbsp; However, after updating the firmware of the PTV3000 to version 2.4.46, the 1520 found the PTV3000 and allowed me to send phone content to the TV to which the PTV3000 is connected.&nbsp; (P.S.&nbsp; Unlike Google Chromecast, the PTV3000
 sends out its own WiFi signal that the 1520 has to detect.&nbsp; Chromecast requires the Google dongle and your laptop/Android phone share the same WiFi network.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updating the firmware of the PTV3000:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Before doing anything else, use your laptop to&nbsp;go to the Netgear support site and download the latest firmware for the PTV3000.&nbsp; (I saved the file to my laptop's desktop.)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Connect the PTV3000 to an HDMI port on your television, using your own HDMI cable (it's not supplied by Netgear).&nbsp; You'll also have to attach the PTV3000 to a USB port for power, or use the adapter Netgear supplies to plug it into a power outlet.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Turn on the TV and change the input to the HDMI port where you attached the PTV3000.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Press and hold the "Mode" button on the side of the PTV3000 so that it's now in a mode that allows your laptop to connect to it to update its software.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Use your laptop's wifi to connect to the PTV3000's wifi signal.&nbsp; (I.E., in Windows 8.1, swipe to open the&nbsp;Charms menu --&gt; tap Settings --&gt; tap the Wifi icon --&gt; connect to the "Push2TV" signal.)</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Your TV screen will display some instructions, including the IP address of the PTV3000.&nbsp; Open a web browser on your laptop and type in the IP address of the PTV3000 and press Enter.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; This takes you to a screen where you should click the Browse button to find the firmware update file you saved on your desktop.&nbsp; Then click Upload.&nbsp; This uploads the new firmware to the PTV3000.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The PTV3000 will reboot, and now can be found by your Nokia Lumia 1520.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connecting the 1520 to the PTV3000:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Make sure your TV input is set to the HDMI port where the PTV3000 is attached.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; On your 1520, tap your Settings tile, then tap Project My Screen.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; "Push2TV...." (the adapter name)-PTV3000 should be listed.&nbsp; Tap this to connect.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Connection should occur within about 5 seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; When your phone is "vertical," the display on your TV is a narrow vertical display showing what's your phone.&nbsp; However, rotate your phone to "horizontal" and the display will fill the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall Impressions:</p>
<p>I found Project My Screen to be a super-easy way to project my photos and other content to my much larger TV screen.&nbsp; (If the Photos tile had a built in slide show, I'd be even happier.&nbsp; Does anyone know if it has one?)&nbsp; I was happily surprised (okay, shocked)
 that I was able to stream video content from Hulu Plus, Netflix, Xbox Video, etc., to my TV screen (including the audio).&nbsp; I've paid for these services, but we've all seen how sometimes some arcane DRM restrictions prevent us from watching stuff we've already
 paid for.&nbsp; (P.S.&nbsp; The streaming was occasionally choppy when I had the PTV3000 behind the TV, but it smoothed out when I moved it so there was a clear line of sight between the 1520 and the PTV3000.)&nbsp; Also, FYI, for me at least, the connection between phone
 and Push2TV seems to drop out if it's unused for a couple of minutes.&nbsp; And, to be honest, I haven't watched any long videos yet, so I don't know how stable the connection is.&nbsp; Plus, I'm unclear whether I'm using my home WiFi or cellular data plan when my phone
 is sending video to the PTV3000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a Nutshell:</p>
<p>My Droid-envy is now over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(By the way, Project My Screen also allows you to connect your phone to your laptop via USB, so that phone contents are displayed on the laptop screen.&nbsp; You first have to download the Project My Screen App from Microsoft and install it onto your desktop
 (there isn't a Metro/Modern/Whatever-they're-calling-it app).&nbsp; When you connect the phone and laptop, on the Project My Screen setting on your phone you'll get a message asking whether you want to connect to the laptop.&nbsp; Click OK.&nbsp; An outline of your phone
 will appear on your laptop screen, mirroring the contents of your phone.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when you turn the phone horizontal, the outline doesn't go away -- so photos from your phone will always appear within the confines of the outline; i.e., they'll never
 go full-screen.&nbsp; The main use of the USB version of Project My Screen may be for situations where you want to quickly copy/crop an image from your phone to use it in a document you're composing on your laptop.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I forget:</p>
<p>I was also able to mirror my Lumia 2520 tablet screen to my TV via the PTV3000.</p>

<p>I'm still using Project My Screen on my Lumia 1520, through the Netgear PTV3000, attached to a 6-year-old Vizio flatscreen.&nbsp; I mention the TV because I've also taken the 1520 and&nbsp;PTV3000 with me to hotels and sometimes had the "black screen." So, I suspect
 that something about the&nbsp;"recipient" TV affects whether or not Project My Screen is successful.&nbsp; I suspect HDMI specifications vary, but I'm not techie enough to figure out what's compatible and what's not.</p>

<h2>            trouble with comments in Word app for iPad</h2>
                    When using track changes in the Word app for ipad, it's always been super easy to add a comment: just highlight the text, click on the comment icon, and a bubble appears in the margin to type a comment. Lately, when I highlight the text and then try to
 comment, the app opens a bar that contains every comment in the entire document. This bar covers the text, is slow to open and close, and is unwieldy to work with. What happened to the easy-to-add bubbles? Is there a setting to change this back?

<p>I'll do my best to answer your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* The version of the Word app seems to be 2.24 (190410)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* iOS version is 11.4.1 (15G77)</p>
<p>* See below for screen shots</p>
<p>* I use an Office 365 subscription. I have one for work, as well as a personal one.</p>
<p>* This is the only device I use, other than a standard desktop computer and a laptop, where it's not an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

    <title>Integrated camera works in all applications except Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avrental1212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Integrated camera works in all applications except Skype</h2>
                    <p>Lenovo Thinkpad has integrated Ricoh camera.&nbsp; Camera is recognized by other applications but not by Skype.&nbsp; I have the most current driver.&nbsp; The camera stopped working with Skype after doing a windows 10 upgrade about 1 week ago.&nbsp; I can see the person I
 am calling in Skype but they cannot see me.&nbsp; I have run through all the Skype suggestions for this problem and nothing has fixed the issue.&nbsp; I really need to figure this out if anyone has any suggestions.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I highly doubt the issue is with Skype itself.&nbsp; If not blocked by a 3rd party application, it is more than likely an OS or driver/hardware issue even if it appears to work elsewhere.&nbsp; Your camera might not function in Apps but work fine in Desktop applications
 or the exact opposite.&nbsp; Answering the exact questions I asked help narrow down the problem.&nbsp; Many people have told me their camera works everywhere else, when testing proved that to be false since their testing was limited in scope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the camera does not work in the Skype App but works in the Desktop application, then the issue exists with the camera drivers or that portion of the OS.&nbsp; If it works in the Skype App but not the Desktop application, then the issue can still be with the
 drivers and that other portion of the OS.&nbsp; If it works in the Camera App but not the Skype App, then that might point to a Skype problem or an OS issue.&nbsp; If it does not work in the Camera App then that points to a driver limitation or OS issue.&nbsp; If you camera
 does not work in the Camera App, even if it works elsewhere, it will never work in the Skype App (in that current state).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one simple test to help narrow down the problem to an OS or driver/hardware issue.&nbsp; Try another external USB webcam.&nbsp; See if it works in Skype for Window Desktop, the Windows Camera App, and the Skype (UWP) App.&nbsp; If it works in all three, that generally
 points to a camera driver/hardware issue with the internal camera.&nbsp; If the USB camera fails to function in any one of them, that may point to a consistent OS issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to continue troubleshooting your camera issue you would need to provide some information to help diagnosis this issue.<br />

I suggest you leave it . If you forget it then its a hell of problem getting it back. If you punch the code wrongly 10 times in succession your phone will get locked and you will need PUK to unlock

    <title>Windows Phone losing old calendar appointments - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eve22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone losing old calendar appointments</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my outlook.com email and calendar synced to my windows phone (Nokia Lumia 520), so if I put something in my calendar on my phone, it syncs across so that I can see it on my calendar when I log into my outlook.com account on my computer (and vice versa).
 Recently, I've noticed that some old appointments are no longer showing up on my calendar on my phone (though if I log into outlook.com on my computer and look at my calendar, they are all still there). It seems entirely random, as some old appointments are
 still there (for example, all of January's show up on my phone still, but none for the first three weeks of February). I can still see old appointments from last year on my phone, but as I say, some have just disappeared.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts why this might be happening and how to stop it? It's not like all old appointments older than, say, one month are disappearing from my phone: I can't see why my phone's losing some and not others. Secondly, as all my old appointments are still
 showing up in my calendar when I log into outlook via my computer, is there anyway to re-sync them all back to my phone?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Just to be clear: the outlook I use isn't the downloadable program, it's just the web-based email and calendar.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            It is unusual for past appointments to be retained on a windows phone for more than a few weeks, so the appointments you are seeing in January or earlier are an anomaly. There isn't a way to force the native calendar app to sync past appointments. Since
 I need to refer to my past appointments on my phone, I use a third party app called Chronos Calendar, which allows me to sync a year's worth of past appointments to the phone.

<p>which tones are u referring to exactly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>are they ones that came preinstalled in the phone and confirmed as ring tones or ones that u downloaded or transferred into the phone on ur own?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it coud be a licensing issue, so depending on how and where u got the song from, u might not be able to use it for any other purposes other than&nbsp;to listen to it as a song</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Forms</h2>
                    <p>When embedding Microsoft Forms in classic SharePoint -- is there&nbsp; a way to display the results after submit?&nbsp; I'd like to use it as a poll but rather than displaying the Thank you message, display the results instead.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can add a 'page viewer' web part
 to display the results using the summary link but I don't really want to display 2 separate web parts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to figure out how to use Javascript to show/hide the appropriate web part on submit.&nbsp; For example: By default, show the Poll question (i.e. CEWP web part with embed code) and hide the Poll results (page viewer web part).&nbsp; Then when user clicks
 the submit button, reverse the show/hide property. But still no success.</p>

            Hello Tamras,
<br />
<br />my name is Manuel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />As far as I know there currently is no function available to customize the "thank you" page.
<br />There already a uservoice feedback post with 800 votes about making custom submission pages possible.
<br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://microsoftforms.uservoice.com/forums/386451-welcome-to-microsoft-forms-suggestion-box/suggestions/17207825-custom-submission-thank-you-message" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://microsoftforms.uservoice.com/forums/386...</a>
<br />
<br />Additionally there is an announcement about branding of the thank you page:
<br /><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Forms-Blog/Announcing-new-Microsoft-Forms-features-at-Microsoft-Ignite/ba-p/263007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsof...</a>
<br />
<br />For javascript:
<br />I'm sure there is a way to use javascript to prevent the embedded form from either redirecting to the thank you page or loading it via javascript but this should be rather complicated (for me at least :D)
<br />
<br />Greetings,
<br />Manuel

            Javascript has a function to wait for page load. But I'm not sure if it has one for page reload? Perhaps you could wait for the exact element to load?

            Forms is Msft's rather weak copy of google Forms and has very limited useful functionality. It would be much easier to capture the responses in a SP list and redirect to the results page using the built in ?Source=url url parameter.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Deleting individual messages sent by a contact is not possible, you can only remove what you sent (<em><strong>Note</strong>: the option to delete or remove the message you sent is only possible for a short period of time after it has been sent</em>).&nbsp;You
 can delete the copy of your conversation with that contact but <em>it will delete your entire conversation with him</em>. To do this, please follow the below steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Skype for Windows 10.</li><li>Right-click on the chat you want to delete.</li><li>Select <strong>Delete conversation</strong>.</li></ol>

<h3> jstregger  say:</h3>
<h2>            ms access invalid procedure call or argument &#38; button applications</h2>
                    <p>I am creating a HR database for our personnel department for our organization. I am using Access 2007-2010. I have made a form that lists the employee's name and employee number, etc. with a sub-form that lists their passport information. I did it this way
 because there are some employee's that have more than one passport due to dual citizenship and we want to be able to see all their passports on one screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to put buttons on the master form that will allow the user to browse and find the scan of their passport and insert the link to its file location in a text box in the sub form and a second one to do the same for their visa into the country.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have made a button that works perfectly for the passport field but the visa one comes up with the error:&nbsp;ms access invalid procedure call or argument.</p>
<p>The codes I used are:</p>
<p>Option Compare Database<br />
Private Sub Command56_Click()<br />
&nbsp;' This is the Link Passport button</p>
<p>' Note that your text box must be linked to a field in a table if you want the value to remain after closing the form.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; On Error GoTo Err_Handler<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim strPassportScan As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim strFolder As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim strFile As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim intPos As Integer<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; strPassportScan = BrowseFile<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If strPassportScan &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ' get folder and file names<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; intPos = InStrRev(strPassportScan, "\")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; strFolder = Left(strPassportScan, intPos - 1)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; strFile = Mid(strPassportScan, intPos + 1)<br />
<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim strVisaScan As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim strFolder1 As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim strFile1 As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim intPos1 As Integer<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; strVisaScan = BrowseFile<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If strVisaScan &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ' get folder and file names<br />

<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; MsgBox Err.Description<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Resume Exit_Here<br />
<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So why does one button work and not the other?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Having made the buttons, i then remembered that for a person with more than one passport I would need the button to know the difference between boxes in the sub-form...would I have to make another button for each time that that field came up? How can
 i do this? I have included a screen capture of my form to help you visualize what I am working with. The Visa Scan link is to the right of the passport one. I am hoping to make it possible to double click on the link in the text box to open the scans later,
 which is why I am not doing a click option on the text boxes themselves.</p>

                    I need help with keeping track of who modifies and prints an excel workseet. The current worksheet should be modified by only one user, but&nbsp;it has to&nbsp;be accessible to many. To avoid users from modifying the file and replacing the printed copy with their
 version I was hoping that I could imbed (and show their name on the printed copy) the user name of the individual who last opened, modified, printed, BUT didn't save the file. Is there a way to do that? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

</p><p>There is no built-in option available within Excel to achieve this action. </p>

    <title>Autosave feature on Microsoft Word Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt zager  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autosave feature on Microsoft Word Online</h2>
                    With the Autosave feature on Microsoft Word it is very difficult to work on assignments. Recently every time it attempts to autosave it freezes the browser and the round color wheel appears. Not sure if there is a way to remove autosave or an update to
 fix. The Word is online in a browser since it is through Office 365 as I am a student. Thank you.

<p>It's on Word online. I am using Safari, but I have also used google Chrome and the same issue occurs. This is the Word build, (<strong>16.0.9330.2652).
</strong>I have never worked with powerpoint or excel for the work I do so I have Never experienced issues with those other applications. &nbsp;It would be great if there was an option to turn off Autosave because its unnecessary to save after any little keystroke.

<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Word Online automatically saves your document when you make changes and there’s no way to turn autosave off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I tested on my end and I didn’t encounter any issue. Word online saved changes while I edited the document and it didn’t freeze the browser. I tested with Safari.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Please try editing the document in inPrivate browser. For this, right click Safari/Chrome browser icon on dock and select inPrivate.</li><li>Is it a large document?</li><li>Do you see this behavior when editing every Word document?</li><li>Where do you store the document in OneDrive for business or SharePoint online?</li><li>If possible, please create documents in Excel online or PowerPoint, check if you see the same behavior.</li></ol>

<p>Hi, Techliker. Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions! Are you referring to the pre-installed apps of the phone? If you are, these apps are integrated with the software of the phone thus cannot be deleted.
<br />
<br />
To address the low storage issue on your phone, you can try the following:<br />

<h2>            Conference Call - Dial in number</h2>
                    I no longer get a dial in number when setting up a conference call.&nbsp; I don't understand why this has occurred, and have not found any options for restoring this functionality.&nbsp; can someone assist?&nbsp; I've had to reschedule 3 conference calls until I could
 get a colleague to create them with a Dial in number that I could also access.

<p>Yes, Our company chose to use Skype as a conference call provider rather than supporting individual conference call line for each of us individually.&nbsp; the first time that I used it, I had no issues, but since then, I have been unable to obtain a dial in
 number.&nbsp; I ma using Outlook to book the calls.</p>

<p>No:&nbsp; The issue remains.&nbsp; I get a link for the conference call that can be accessed from a computer or through the mobile SKYPE app, but not a dial in number for someone looking to join via phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue does occur every time I attempt to create a meeting.</p>

<p>Yes, same results at the <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office.com/owa</a> link</p>
<p>I believe that it is the server, but do know that we have recently transitioned a number of servers to cloud based.</p>

<h2>            Telephone and zip code input masks in Access 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to format my telephone number and zip code fields in an Access 2013 table with input masks.</p>
<p>Some of my telephone numbers have area codes; some don't. &nbsp;Currently, I am using !\(999") "999\-9999;;_ as the mask. &nbsp;If a phone number doesn't have an area code, I would like the parentheses to disappear.</p>
<p>Similarly, some of my zip codes have nine (9) digits; some have five (5). &nbsp;Currently, I am using 00000\-9999;;_ as the mask. &nbsp;If a zip code only has five digits, I would like the dash to disappear.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

    <title>Can I Copy and Paste Offline OneNote Files Between Computers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wmsrandy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I Copy and Paste Offline OneNote Files Between Computers</h2>
                    <p>In addition to my ordinary OneNote notebook on SkyDrive, I also have a private OneNote file which is not on SkyDrive, and is saved in my Documents/OneNote Notebooks folder. This "offline notebook" is not sync'd to SkyDrive and is only on my new PC, with
 Windows 8.1.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I would like to put this "offline notebook" on another PC which also has Office 365 (2013), but Windows 7. These PCs are not on a network. I see two files in the folder. One is the name of the Notebook.one. The other is called OpenNotebook.onetoc2. (FYI, the
 SkyDrive notebook works fine between the two PCs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I copy these two "offline notebook" files from the folder on my Windows 8.1 PC, and paste them into the same folder in my Windows 7 PC, and have OneNote work effectively, without any issues?&nbsp; If not, how do I manually copy an offline notebook and put
 it on another PC that is not on a network?</p>

<p>I occasionally get this error when following links on the Insider site. The most I've ever had to is stop and restart my browser (Chrome). I suppose you could also try to access it using a different browser - Edge or IE as appropriate too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you talking about the main link (<a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/community-contests-women-in-computing-about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://insider.windows.com/en-us/community-contests-women-in-computing-about/</a>) or one of the
 other links contained on that page? I had no problem accessing the main link.</p>

            What version of Office do you have? It has been mentioned that users are having problems with version 16.9 and above of Office. 
<br />
<br />There may be a fix coming soon. I’d suggest checking for updates - it make take several tries for Office to recognize that there is an update, so try checking a few times. 
<br />
<br />In the meantime, I you could use a previous version until it is fixed. 
<br />
<br />You’ll need to uninstall the current version, download the older version, and install it. 
<br />
<br />Here are the instructions on how to uninstall for Mac:

            I had a similar issue of having the font change after choosing File &gt; Save As &gt; PDF. I needed to use the "Save As" option in order to preserve accessibility for my hyperlinks. Since the font choice was not critical to me I changed it to Arial and that
 resolved the problem. I am using version 15.3.9.
