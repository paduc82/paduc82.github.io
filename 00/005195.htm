<h2>            Getting rid of Strikethrough, Sub and Superscript HELP</h2>
                    Somehow my font options on Microsoft word starter 2010 has changed and no matter what I do I can't fix it.&nbsp; Next to where you would select Bold, Underlined and Italic it has strikethrough text and sub and superscript.&nbsp; I go in and uncheck the boxed for
 them but that is not getting rid of them.&nbsp; I've been typing documents all night and somehow this changed and won't go away.&nbsp; Please help :)

<h2>            Server to server communication problem</h2>
                    <p>I have visited with my internet provider and with several Apple tech support reps to resolve email problem. I am not receiving email timely with Apple devices, and unable to open or download attachments like photos. When using my PC, I have immediate updates
 with all emails. I can open all emails and photos load and I have been able to download into PC. However, this is not th case when using Mac.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been advised that it is a Outlook server to Apple server communication issue, and that Outlook needs to resolve. Who can I get to resolve this issue or does anyone have advice?</p>

<p>I have all the lasted updates on PC, Mac and iPad. I installed malware protection and have Norton on PC. I downloaded newest version of Adobe on Mac.
</p>
<p>It would appear that my iPad is behaving better today as I am now getting emails and some of my attachments are now opening. Still unable to open/load email attactments on Mac. The attactments just spin and try to load.</p>
<p>We (Apple techs and internet provider) concluded that it was an Outlook problem because I opened a gmail account and evrything works fine on Mac when I send myself an email with an attached photo on the Mac.</p>
<p>The. Iewing of attachments was the same weather I used Apple's mail app or went to MSN/MSOutlook web page to view emails. Outlook email account was installed to Mac with IMAP. I do not use iCloud or one drive.</p>

<p>You can delete your Outlook account from the Mail app and then add it back in. That will refresh your Outlook account and your device's connection.

</p><p>If the issue still persists, check with your device manufacturer for the update they have released last February to fix this bug.

<p>I did delete outlook account on Ipad and Mac. I spent hrs on the phone with internet provider who assured me that my connection, download/upload speeds was good. Apple was so very kind and spent hrs helping me fix this problem. I have read the thread and
 it seems like this bug has not been fixed as others as well are having this problem with MS Outlook to Apple devices, and not when using other email accounts that are not MS. Again, I do not have this problem sending or recieving email attatchments with PC.
 Again, like others, I didnthave these problems until recently with the same devices. So, Im to conclude that this started following an update or because MS have something against Mac users.</p>
<p>It sure would be nice if MS Outlook had an actual coustomer service department. Let &nbsp;alone, one as helpful as Apple has been 24/7.</p>

            <p>Hello Ken -- Thank you for the sample survey database. I navigated through the sample you created and its extremely user friendly (thank you). However, I understand this is only to be used as a "sample" only so I'm trying to create my own from scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, I'm trying to create a database where I can maintain survey responses. The recipients will receive a paper survey and&nbsp;I will enter the data myself and manage the database. All questions will have a multiple choice response such as "Agree,
 disagree, etc). Once again - the survey sample you created fit perfectly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please advise how&nbsp;I could create my own from&nbsp;scratch&nbsp;using Access 2010.&nbsp;Where your sample "home page" says Questionnaire Demo, I'd like to create one for us here and will have options such as 1) Create New questionnaire database 2) Edit Questionnaiare
 3) Enter employee responses 4) Open the Survey Analysis Report. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you GREATLY. </p>

            If the functionality of my demo suits your purposes it sounds like it's really just a question of amending the design of the forms to fit your 'house style', changing the layout, colour scheme and button captions etc.&nbsp; Unwanted objects like the picture
 (from Google Images) can be deleted, and any new objects of your own added to the form.<br />
<br />
You could probably do most of what you want by amending a copy of my file, but if you want to build your own from scratch then you should be able to copy and paste my code into the relevant event procedures for the objects, making any amendments as necessary
 to&nbsp; cater for any different object names you've used.<br />
<br />
Even if you copy my code and amend it try and understand how it works.&nbsp; Most of the code is pretty standard so it should be relatively easy to see what it's doing, and I'd be happy to clarify any details.&nbsp; More important is to understand the logical model of
 the database in terms of what each table represents and how they are related, so study the relationships window with some care to get a grasp of how it all fits together to model the underlying real world entity types and relationships.<br />

<br />
That's a bit like saying "Doctor, I don't feel well. What should I take?"<br />
<br />
I don't think there is anything I can usefully add to what I said in my last post.&nbsp; If there are any
<i>specific</i> points on which you need clarification as you adapt my file to your own purposes I'll attempt to address them, but it's really a question of your studying my demo and then either adapting it to suit your requirements, or basing your application
 on the way my demo is built.&nbsp; Any points of detail on which you require clarification I'll try and answer.<br />

            <p>Ah yes indeed. My apologies. one specific question I have is: I started to create a survey and now I need to either delete it (so I can start over with a new one) - or I'd like to go back in and complete it. I was just playing with the database and so&nbsp;I
 only entered and saved the first 3 questions of my questionnaire, but I need to go back and enter al 24 questions. &nbsp;I would prefer to delete so I could use the same survey name and so in the future only one survey name comes up as an option to 'fill in" by
 the the administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a relatively simple task? I hope I'm making sense. </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            To enable you to delete a questionnaire and all data associated with it you just need to edit each of the relevant relationships and enforce 'cascade deletes' in each.&nbsp; This will delete the questionnaire and all answer and response data associated with
 it when a row is deleted from the Questionnaires table.&nbsp; It will not delete the set of available questions in the Questions table or the answers associated with the questions; for that you'd need to delete the rows in the Questions table also.&nbsp; Similarly the
 respondents and associated response sessions won't automatically be deleted; for that you'd need to delete the rows in the Respondents table also.<br />
<br />
An improvement to the database would be to create an enforced relationship between Questionnaires and ResponseSessions.&nbsp; This would allow all response data relating to a questionnaire to be automatically deleted if a questionnaire is deleted.<br />
<br />
I will update the file in my SkyDrive folder to incorporate these changes.<br />
<br />
So to wipe the database completely clean of all data you'd execute the following three queries:<br />
<br />
DELETE * FROM Questionnaires;<br />
DELETE * FROM Questions;<br />
DELETE * FROM Respondents;<br />
<br />
which you could easily do from a simple little function, procedure, or macro, though these sort of global set operations should be handled with extreme care, and it is absolutely imperative that the database be backed up before doing so.<br />

    <title>Why are emails in public folders being marked as read when viewed in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melchiorstander  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are emails in public folders being marked as read when viewed in the viewing pane when I have disabled this in settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using office 2010 on a windows 7 PC. In outlook I have changed the settings for the reading pane so that emails are not marked as read unless I actually open them. This is working for emails in my inbox and outbox but not for emails in public folders.
 Emails in public folders are marked as read as soon as I click on them. Do public folders have a different setting for marking email as read in the reading pane?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is important for me that emails in the public folders are not marked as read when i click on them as I need to read through hundreds of project emails in these folders and need to be able to distinguish between emails I have read and actioned and emails
 I have just clicked on while searching for an email I need. This folder serves as an archive for my emails so i cant delete them once I have read them. I also don't have permission to label them or create tasks from them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> w. joycesmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you delete an E-Mail account on Windows 8 &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I need help folks - I asked Microsoft help how to delete an account from my Windows 8 . They wrote back and said - Go to the " start" button, click on "All Programs", ( WELL, I have NO " All Programs " ), then click on Windows Mail,- click on " tools"&nbsp;menu,
 and click "accounts", if you want to remove, click "remove". Since I had NO All Programs, I tried going to computer, and in "search", I typed in " all programs", I got nothing. So in the same search, I tried "programs" - still nothing. So I went back to "start",
 and tried the "apps" and searched the same things, STILL nothing. I even tried "E-Mail" in the computer area, - ZILTCH !! So how do you delete an E-Mail account out of Windows 8 folks ?? I have 2 accounts, and I only want one. The E-Mail account is a gmail&nbsp;
 account. Right now I'm using a Hotmail account. Thanks

            <p><span>Hi Mariusnit,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview is much appreciated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in development stage (testing environment), certain features might not work in the usual manner. Hence you may face some issue with Windows 10.We are looking forward
 to improve it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The 0xc0000017 error message is usually brought on by Microsoft Windows system file corruption. Corrupted system entries are often a substantial risk to the health and wellbeing of any laptop or computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to boot to recovery mode and perform System restore. Try removing any external devices connected to the computer and check if you can boot to the computer. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Boot into the Recovery mode using Windows 10 recovery/installation disc.</span></li><li><span>Once selecting your language, time and keyboard settings, click Next to load the next window, then click on the
<strong>Repair your computer</strong> link on the bottom left corner of the window.</span></li><li><span>You should then be presented with a Choose an Option screen, with<span>&nbsp;
</span><strong>Troubleshoot</strong> as an option to select.</span></li><li><span>In the Troubleshoot screen, select
<strong>Advanced </strong>options.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>System Restore</strong> from the
<strong>Advanced</strong> options screen and follow the instruction.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I would suggest you to reset the Windows Update components and check.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important: </span></strong><span>Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify
 it, back up the registry for restoration <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            &#34;Not a valid Office key&#34;</h2>
                    I just bought Microsoft Office, and am trying to install it. It prompted me to type the product key. I typed it, but it says that the key is not valid. I've retried numerous times, so I can't possibly just be mistyping it. How can I install Office? I need
 it ASAP.

<h2>            Word Mail Merge - Letter Creation Date Issue</h2>
                    <p>Good Afternoon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently trying to set up a merge field which will display the date of when a document was created. While I can make the document display the date from which the document was created, it appears to leave behind some form of timer or time created field.
 This field just says 00:00:00 and I can't find a way to get rid of it without taking the date out as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this issue in the past? I cannot find any information on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now in regards to your question, please know that the Band/Microsoft health app syncs to the cloud using a Microsoft account. Therefore it should not be an issue when going from Band 1 to Band 2, so long as you are using the same Microsoft account when setting
 up the Microsoft Health app. (Blue color for Band 2 and purple color for Band 1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us/support/hardware/install-the-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
install the Microsoft Health app on any compatible phone</a>&nbsp; and make sure to setup the Microsoft Health app with the same Microsoft account as stated above.</p>

<p>SO , as I wrote, problem is just with one file (file that I was forced to use with libre, and then saved). There is no such problem with other excel files. And in this particular file when I make new comment, it dos not have the same problem.</p>
<p>And problem is not that excel dos not show comments, it does, but they are transparent, (I checked, in comment formatting, transparency is 0%) whe I do comment editing, every thing is ok, It is not transparent anymore. but after editing transparent again.(
 and in these "broken comments" is one more new thing, rotation option. In new comments rotation is 0 and i can't change it)</p>
<p>I understand it is strange problem, but it is very important excel file for work , and it has a lot of comments.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to help</p>

<h2>            Office 2013 won&#39;t upgrade to SP1 &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Windows Update is giving me updates to OS, etc. but I cannot find a way to get Office 2013 Pro Plus up to SP1.&nbsp; Installed from CD just fine on Win10 two days ago and have used Excel &amp; Word a few times without issue.&nbsp; I have 15.0.4420.1017 so it certainly
 needs updating!</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have looked at Update options on Excel's "Account" screen.&nbsp; I disabled updates and then re-enabled Updates but found the advice until I get this to SP1, Windows updates will not resume for Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I checked on the Win10 box for WinUpdate to update other Microsoft s/w on this PC before any of this became an issue.&nbsp; I have checked some Services but see none that appear to be at fault.&nbsp; Windows Update shows running when it is searching or processing
 updates.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I download the 32 bit SP1 KB2760311.&nbsp; It executes but says there is nothing here for it to update (I dont have the exact message).</p>
</div>
<p>Help please...</p>

Thank you, I looked for this first and forgot to mention that entry is missing from listed choices.&nbsp; I may try the app repair option if nothing below solves.

            <p>Yes, sorry about the Windows 7 bit.&nbsp; The Quick repair process should fix things for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; If not you can do a clean up-to-date install of Office 2013 from&nbsp;your Office Account. Check to make sure that you can sign into your Office 2013 Office Account at:
<span>
<a href="https://www.office.com/Myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.office.com/Myaccount</span></a>&nbsp; You will need to sign in with the email address and password for the Microsoft Account&nbsp;that you used when you first installed your Office 2013.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If&nbsp; you can sign in I suggest you uninstall your Office 2013 with the Microsoft uninstall tool.&nbsp; Use:
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-Office-2013-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-GB&amp;ad=GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Option 2 - Completely uninstall Office with the
 easy fix tool&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now you can use the repair process but instead of choosing Quick Repair choose Online Repair.&nbsp; During the process you will need to sign in with your email address and password
 for the Microsoft Account that you used when you first installed your Office.</span></p>

<p>(tells me&nbsp;I am up to date)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows the latest version using the About... but doesn't show SP1 on that display.</p>

            <blockquote>You are great. One more question I noticed that by eye I can not drag the image it should be in the center is there a way or an other program that would automatically center it?<br />
</blockquote>
======================================<br />
When you begin dragging the overlay...if you notice <br />
the very bottom right of your screen you should see <br />
some numbers changing. They represent the pixels.<br />
<br />
It can be somewhat tedious but if you can drag the <br />
overlay until the numbers are 250.250...the overlay <br />
will be dead center in the 500x500 background.<br />
<br />
Also, you can apply a color to the background if <br />
you wish.<br />
<br />
Left click the "Fill With Color" button in the left pane.<br />
(looks like paint pouring from a can)<br />
<br />
Select (left click) a color at the bottom of the screen...<br />
<br />
Left click anywhere inside the background.<br />
<br />
Cheers...<br />

<p>Hi LeslieO'Neill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this happening to a specific contact? If so, possibly, the issue might be on your contact's end. But if you're not seeing all your contacts at all, most likely, you're signed into a different account. Try logging out and sign in again - make sure to use
 the correct Skype account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It'll also be helpful to uninstall Skype &gt; reboot your device &gt; reinstall Skype. In the event that the issue persists, let us know.</p>

    <title>Merge Microsoft account with Xbox Live account - different emails. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Merge Microsoft account with Xbox Live account - different emails.</h2>
                    <p>I started my Xbox Live account many years ago. I recently finished building my computer and now have a Microsoft account with&nbsp; different email from the one I used to make the Xbox Live account. I attempt to add my Microsoft account as an alias but it will
 not let me because it exist as a Microsoft account, which doesn't make sense. Both accounts send emails to the same email address, but have different log-in emails.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Currently, we do not have an option to merge the two accounts. We have an article that you can use as a reference<br />
to answer your concern. Check out this<br />
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12407/microsoft-account-manage-aliases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. To add or suggest the merge feature between Microsoft accounts, we recommend sending feedback using the Feedback
 Hub on your Windows 10 computer. Just type Feedback Hub in the search box and open the application. This will ensure that our Microsoft account team will be able to consider adding merge option in the future.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have other questions.
        </p>

            <p>You have to reinstall it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you purchased it originally, you'll need both the installation media or download, plus the 25-character Product Key to reinstall.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had 2011 through the Office 365 subscription plan, you can no longer reinstall if from your Office 365 account page. Instead, you'll have to install Office 2016 for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have custom toolbars, macros, autotext or styles stored in your Normal.dotm template, you'll want to save that file to copy to your new computer. If you have custom dictionaries or lots of autocorrect entries, you should also save those files as well.
 Here are their default locations on your old computer:</p>
<p><strong>Normal.dotm</strong> - <strong>Users/ YourUserName/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/</strong></p>
<p><strong>AutoCorrect (ACL)</strong> and <strong>Custom Dictionary (DIC)</strong> files -
<strong>Users/ YourUserName/Library/Preferences/Microsoft/Office 2011</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Library folder is normally hidden. Hold down the <strong>Alt</strong> key while clicking on the
<strong>Go</strong> menu and choosing <strong>Library</strong> to make it visible.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The performance for running Excel 2016 is based on several conditions. For us to isolate the issue, we suggest that you follow these methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Open Excel 2016 in safe mode, and then check if the issue persists. Follow the given steps on this link:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Open Office apps in safe mode on a Windows PC</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>If the issue persists, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
perform a clean boot</a>. <span>This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows<span>
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>Please go through the section:
</em></span></span><em><strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong><span><span>of the article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I forgot to state that the Excel files open instantly if Excel is already open. Only when Excel is not open and I double click on any Excel file to open it, the slowness occurs. Therefore, safe mode will not help with the troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot has been performed several times with the same results.</p>
