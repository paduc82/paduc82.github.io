            <p><span>Hello Vito, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The desktop.ini file is a <span>hidden file&nbsp; </span></span><span><span><span>used to store information about the arrangement of a<span> Windows
</span></span></span><span><span>folder. Essentially, if the layout or settings for a folder are changed, a desktop.ini file is automatically generated to save those changes.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Technically it can be deleted from any directory, although it's not advised. It should be noted that because the file saves settings associated with the folder in which it is contained, deleting it changes the settings back to default. To delete the
 file, right-click </span><span><span><span>the file icon and select<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Delete</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>from the<span> drop-down menu</span></span></span><span><span>. You can also select the desktop.ini file and press<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Delete</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>on
 your keyboard.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also hide it, simply go into <strong>Control Panel</strong>&gt;<strong>File Explorer Options</strong>&gt;<strong>View</strong>&gt;
<strong>don‚Äôt show hidden files and folders</strong></span><strong>.</strong></p>

            <p>Actually desktop.ini is a hidden system file and you should not be able to see it even if you have hidden files showing, there has been a bug reported in Windows 10 where these files show up even when your folder options are set correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Windows File Explorer, on the View Ribbon, click Options, check the option marked 'Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)'. Click Apply and OK</p>

</p><p>If you can still see the file, right click the file choose properties check the hidden box and click OK</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Receiving error "<strong>Driver unavailable.</strong>" is self-explanatory. Usually, a driver is built-in when using plug and play devices such as flash drives. To address the issue, I suggest that you reinstall the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+X</strong>, and then select <strong>Device </strong><strong>Manager</strong>.</li><li>Locate the flash drive's driver, right-click, and then select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Restart your PC.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the above solution doesn't help, you may need to download and install the needed software from the flash drive manufacturer's website or better yet, contact the manufacturer for assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>Other than going into the server browser and joining a game with really low population, you can't. &nbsp;This was never a problem in BC2, and shouldn't be now, especially 4 months after release.</p>

<p><span>Ok.. you seem legit... so I am willing to give you some tips.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Use the Server Browser when you have your party (*squad) &nbsp;of 4 players ready to go.</span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Find a game with 18 or below player count out of 24 players. I have even joined games with 0 player count&nbsp;as the games seem to fill fast.</span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">If your squad is still split up after joining game then try to get player or players to switch sides.</span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">If&nbsp;player(s) who wants to switch sides &nbsp;gets error saying something like server will be unbalanced....wait about 2 mins and try again.</span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">If the player or players still can't switch sides, get them to leave the game and come back in by joining game from server browser using the friends tab or join on friend.</span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Server Browser is your best friend. :)</span>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">You can try these methods. If you are in the Xbox Live Pary Chat, one person joins a half empty game. Then when that person gets in, everyone else in the party uses "Join Session
 In Progress" option from someone's gamercard or the party chat window(hit X). Then when you get in the game. If you are not on the same team or squad. DO NOT SPAWN YET. Press the Y button for teams and squad menu. You will see a bunch of squads named and those
 people in each sqaud. You can join any squad from Alpha to Hotel, pick one and tell everyone to join that squad. If you are on different teams, use the same directions as above with changing squads. Except go down to the option to change team, and hit A. Only
 press A once and it is sensitive to how many times you press A. And when you press A, watch the RU-&gt;US or US-&gt;RU.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">I play every night with at least 5-6 people every night and sometimes on the weekend we almost have a full team. Secondly, if everyone that says that eventually you will be
 switched to the other side at some point. If you are running with a bunch of your friends(and you guys are GODS at BF games) then you should never have less people than the other team. If you are playing like you should and winning/destroying the other team.
 They should be leaving and finding other servers. And the people on your team will notice that there is a group on one team and stay to play with you.</span></p>

<p>Yeah but.....wouldnt it be nice if it worked?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dont really think it can. Unless you join a&nbsp;server that is perfectly unbalanced so that your squad can jump on the same team. 4 people joining a game with 18 people in it..Good luck getting everyone in and on the same team... Joining a server with 0 in
 it is the best way I guess. Plenty of time to switch over and such. Plus playing against your friends can be more fun sometimes.</p>

<p>One time at a nice club in Cherry Hill, NJ I met this pretty gal who went to college in Trenton. So, I'm hitting it off with her great and it looks like a sure thing. She gets up with her friend to go to the bathroom while I remained seated at the bar. When
 she left the bartender came over and gave me a drink. Puzzled I looked at him and said "I didn't order a drink" to which he replied "it's from the young lady over there" as he pointed in the direction of this stunningly beautiful girl. I accepted the drink
 and gave her a nod and nice smile. Moments later Mary (that other chick I was already working on that looked like a sure thing) returned. I deliberated and chose to stick with the sure thing. I ended up tagging Mary for about 4 months and I finally broke it
 off with her.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The moral of this story is this. In retrospect, years later I wish I had taken my chances with the super hot chick that night. Always remember this; roll the dice on the super hot chick because if you don't, you'll probably regret it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>p.s. I promise that story is entirely true.</p>

<h2>            when i turn off my Elite Controller my Mouse breaks.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p><br />
I have a really strange Problem with my PC / Xbox Elite Controller. Im using the Wireless Adapter and anything works fine, until i Turn the Controller off or disconect the Adapter. If that happens my Mouse breaks somehow. If i move my mouse every move gives
 an strange beep sound and clicking doesnt work anymore.</p>
<p>If i disconect my Mouse (Razer Naga) and Plug it in again it doesnt connect it. If i use a cable insted of the adapter the same happens too. I can use my Keyboard to shut my PC down but it wont turn off completly until i cut the Power off.</p>
<p>I have no Idea why that happens. It begun a week ago and before that anything worked fine (same Mouse/Controller/Adapter).</p>
<p>Can someone help me?</p>

<p>I have the exat same problem with the normal PC / Xbox One Wireless Controller and my mouse Logitech G502. If i use cable instend of the adapter nothing happens, i can use the controller normal and after is turn off no strange bug with the mouse.</p>
<p>For testing i have deactivated in the device manager under network the energy-saving option for the adapter and it works fine, is the energy-saving option on and the adapter is turns off the exact same failor with the mouse is happing again. But is the energy-saving
 option deactivatet after a restart of the pc the adapter won't start, so its useless.</p>
<p>I think a update of win 10 is going a little bit wrong?</p>

<p>Same here guys. Was posting and scrolling through the forums and cussing out Microsofts outsourced tech support for telling me to pay 150 bucks for him to do remote access. BS. If you restart your PC btw it keeps this from happening. Its definitely a windows
 10 bug. I'm just glad I'm not the only one. Made no *** sense. Worked flawlessly for the last two months since I bought it with the wireless adapter.</p>

<p>All I can tell you guys is that if you have your device manager open with the Human interface devices tab expanded you can see a random HID show up on the list labeled XINPUT and its from Microsoft. It has a yellow exclamation point over the icon indicating
 an error of some kind. This happens the moment I turn off the controller. Saw somewhere else that there can be some HID interference from the controller but never imagined this *** with one bad update. BTW, about my previous post, you have to restart your
 PC before the controller turns off on its own.</p>

<p>YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I JUST FIGURED IT OUT. Ok so in my previous post I mentioned how the XINPUT compatible HID device shows up in the device manager with the Metal Gear Solid exclamation point over the icon when you turn off the controller. Well, I did
 some digging on steam and found in another post from last year where they had a similar issue with Xbox one and 360 controllers during an update last year and they said that the XINPUT compatible HID needs to be changed to compliant HID. The steps to do so
 are as follows:</p>
<p>*from your desktop, press windows button + x to open the controller menu.</p>
<p>*Select device manager.</p>
<p>*On the list of devices, expand the Human interface device section.</p>
<p>*If the icon XINPUT compatible HID or something similar isnt listed, plug in the adapter and controller and just turn the controller off to instigate the mouse freezing. If you had to make the mouse freeze again, make sure you enable the device in the HID
 list before you restart your computer. Youll have to user the keyboard because that should still work. If not the device may still be there after a hard reset, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>*After restarting your PC, reopen the device manager and check the HID section again</p>
<p>*This time, right click the XINPUT device and select Update driver</p>
<p>*Select browse my computer files for the driver after which select "Let me pick from a list of drivers on my computer"</p>
<p>*A menu should pop up and near the top of the list it should show the HID compliant device. Make sure to select compliant device and not compliant system controller or something else.</p>
<p>*This should fix the issue for the most recent driver updates or windows updates or whatever *** it up in the first place. Just remember that the controller does emit HID interference if something is wrong with it (like a bad update), so if this event or
 something similar happens again try these steps and see if you notice anything weird.</p>

<p>i found a temporary way to undo this problem.</p>
<p>If u want to turn the Controller off then just deactivate the XINPUT Device in the Devicemanager before turning it off.</p>
<p>I will stick that way until they fix the Problem with an Update.</p>

<p>You can downgrade to the older XINPUT drivers. Here's a link how <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/49753p/mouse_stops_working_suddenly_usually_after/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>As I understand it there isn't currently a version of this tool that is designed for Windows 10. As you may have noticed in your report that it does not recognise which Windows version you are running. The current version does not appear to be fully compatible
 but it does work to some extent. F<span>rom what I gather scanning TechNet articles about this tool it could be incompatible with newer versions of MS Office and other software, so that could also limit its usefulness to you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the scanner twice on my own computer, the second time after making changes based on the results of the first scan. The second scan results did reflect the changes that I made, so to that extent it does work. However the scanner gave inconsistent results
 in the passwords section which didn't have any changes done between scans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I printed these reports into .XLS files for this screen capture and that is what caused some of the tested items to be expanded. The actual on-screen scanner reports looked just like yours.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro desktop converted to VM, License now &#34;not genuine&#34;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard"><span>Hi all, I have converted my Windows 10 Pro desktop to a virtual machine running in VMware (which is now hosted on the very same hardware as the original desktop), but the copy of windows now reports its not genuine? I have
 tried using the tools under "settings, activation", but they fail todo anything. The machine was upgraded from Windows 7 to 10 when it was free todo so, am getting the following error</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>"we can't activate windows on this device because you don't have a valid digital licence or key, select troubleshoot below. Error code 0x803F7001"&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span><span>I ran the troubleshooter, which didn't work, I then clicked on "I recently changed hardware on this device", which then just&nbsp;comes up and says "Unable&nbsp;to activate windows, we can't reactivate windows because our servers
 aren't available at the moment. Wait for a few minutes or try added your Microsoft&nbsp;account again". Its worth adding that my Microsoft account is signed into my user account.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span><span>Any help greatly appreciated. :) Not sure where to go from here, and really don't fancy shelling out ¬£200 on a new license :(</span></span></p>

<p>The virtual machine would be considered as a separate computer, so, a separate instance would require a separate license. You could try your luck by reactivating using the Windows 7 product key, but in truth, you need to purchase an entirely new Windows
 10 license.</p>

<p>I went ahead and got the update for Windows 10.&nbsp; The information provided said that I wouldn't loose any of my save items.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; I hate Bing, I can't find any of my saved web-addresses and I'm so sorry that I made the stupid decision to "upgrade".&nbsp; It

<p>&nbsp;Anyone know when there will be a strictly Kinect Horror game or even an adventure 'Indiana Jones' type game coming out?</p>

<p>I highly doubt there will be any...Maybe an adventure one, but most likely a no to the horror genre. Kinect was made to appeal to more of the the Family/kid environment.

<p>What a shame only for the Family/Kid environment.</p>
<p>Imagine how great it would of been if they did made a horror game strictly on the Kinect? Even an adventure game like Indiana Jones :-)</p>
<p>I hope the Xbox team read this because I think its an awesome idea :-)</p>

<p>they tried a horror game for kinect. nobody played it. the best you can hope for is maybe a kinect feature on a normal game that doesn't suck...the kinect feature, i mean, since most of the time they're usually under utilized and lackluster.
</p>
<p>kinda sad so many people hate the kinect, i hear it's alot better on the one...though i guess we'll never find out what it can really do now that it been unbundled with the one and relegated to being just another expensive peripheral no one will buy...maybe
 if skylanders or disney did something with it, but i doubt it'd ever happen.</p>

<p>You mean the horror Xbox 360 game Rise of Nightmares? I liked that game, but now i have the Xbox One now and yes the kinect is definitely better.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say the Kinect was mainly for families. The original unit needed to be sold as that, just like the internet, TV's, beds, car's, etc etc. The hardware sale is to aim for families due to them having the money and better word of mouth advertising.
 The software units are then created by third party companies who then open up the range of what the hardware is capable of.</p>
<p>I think its more a case that Kinect pretty much failed and so no one made many games for it. They even had to start selling the X-ONE without it, and not just because people didn't want Ms watching you in your undercrackers.</p>
<p>Playstation Move, Kinect. They weren't needed as the wii was too dominant over that market for rivals to just bring out a novelty bit of kit.</p>
<p>I've just had four coffees and now I'm waffling. Apologies.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>These are my usual troubleshooters for the BCCode: 8E issue and they may help you. However<br />
because of the processor frequency fluctuation I would contact the System Maker or if a custom<br />
system the motherboard maker. Try updating the BIOS and if not help take to a real computer<br />
shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox stores) or the System maker's Support.</p>

Two primary causes of this blue screen are&nbsp;video drivers and BIOS - Check with System Maker's<br />
Site for Display Adapter (Video) and BIOS and then Device Maker's site for latest Video. It can be<br />
other drivers so check those also.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs are other possibilities.<br />

<strong>BCCode: 8E&nbsp; 0x0000008E is same as 0x1000008E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The KERNEL_MODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates that a memory access violation occurred.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.</li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p>If you plan to debug this problem, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2 (the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware installed is listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.</li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</li></ul>
<p>If the bug check message lists a driver by name , disable or remove that driver. Also, disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file
 system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you have to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the system by using the Recovery Console and then deleting
 the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. You can disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve the error. You should also run
 hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows
 installation that are associated with lack of disk space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and<em>.chk</em>files
 that contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more free space for the installation.</p>
<p>You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version</p>

<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

<p>That the computer powers off during the memory diagnostic is troubling, and is likely an indication of a hardware problem.</p>
<p>The verifier bugcheck was caused by NTIDrvr.sys from Dec 21, 2004 incorrectly processing an IRP.</p>
<p>The other dumps showed the&nbsp;&nbsp;KERNEL_MODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M bugcheck seemed to be caused by some kind of memory corruption, and a&nbsp;THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER_M bugcheck that seems attributable to a stale video driver,&nbsp;atikmdag.sys from July 29, 2009.
 &nbsp;(You commented on this, and it seems you are aware of an updated driver for it.)</p>
<p>In addition to the above, you have stale drivers that should be updated, or uninstalled, or the software that they came with should be uninstalled:</p>
<p>Aspi32.SYS<span> </span>9/10/1999 (more than 10 years old)</p>
<p>NTIDrvr.sys<span> </span>12/21/2004 <span>
</span></p>
<p>lmimirr.sys<span> </span>4/10/2007&nbsp;</p>
<p>RaInfo.sys<span> </span>1/4/2008&nbsp;</p>
<p>ahcix86s.sys<span> </span>5/27/2008&nbsp;</p>
<p>windrvr6.sys<span> </span>7/3/2008&nbsp;</p>
<p>LMIRfsDriver.sys<span> </span>7/14/2008&nbsp;</p>
<p>tos_sps32.sys<span> </span>6/24/2009&nbsp;</p>
<p>FwLnk.sys<span> </span>7/6/2009&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, given the problems you're having, I'd suggest trying the memory test again - test one RAM module at a time - and see if you can get each tested. &nbsp;Run with a subset of RAM modules installed, to try to identify/isolate one that may be involved in the behavior.</p>
<p>Also check into updating or removing the stale drivers, including updated ATI drivers.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe if you take your "cursor" and hover it over on the line of your desk top and the black area the cursor will take a "horizontal" shape and when you accomplish this left click(hold it down while moving the horizontal cursor)&nbsp;and drag the desk top
 (with the cursor in horizontal shape)&nbsp;to the right to fill in black area.&nbsp; This will widen the screen to the right. Now....if you can do the same on the left side and drag it to the&nbsp;left, you should see the words or whatever you are looking for to reappear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All you are basically doing is stretching the screen to the left or the right using your cursor and left clicking and holding the left side down while moving the cursor to widen or shorten the screen etc.</p>
<p>Hope this is what u needed help with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers/Sandra</p>

<h3> nickiglahn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Netflix Error Code&#58; W8156-80040153</h2>
                    <p>When I got my Windows 8 laptop last year, one of the first apps I installed was the Netflix app. It worked flawlessly for over a year. Then in September (The 16th I believe) I logged on to my laptop to attempt to watch a movie. I couldn't I kept receiving
 error code W8156-80040153.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the message:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ca1105f-974a-4906-8ea9-8684a0388372" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Netflix's solution was to log in as another user to check to see if my account had user permission to access the app. As my account was the only one on the computer I humored them and made another account (also an administrator) and surprisingly it worked.
 Until today. Now I am getting this on both accounts. I have triple checked my updates and drivers and everything is up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Netflix this is what I am told:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6425b65-c676-4ee2-bc72-5001707232ed" /></p>
&nbsp;How is it possible to be the sole administrator and not have administrative privileges? Has anyone found a solution to this besides constantly making new users on my laptop?

<h2>            Windows Security Centre Won&#39;t start - Error 1075</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to fix a problem on my son's pc - after him getting a few trojans, and some nasty malware, the Windows Security Centre failed to start. So he had no firewall, no windows security at all.
<br />
<br />
He is running Vista 32bit SP2. He also runs AVG Anti-virus free edition, that still seems to be functioning fine. This was updated and then a full scan was completed, with nothing particularly alarming highlighted.<br />
<br />
To begin with the clearup, I have installed, and run all of the following:<br />
<br />
Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy<br />
MalwareBytes - Anti-Malware<br />
Super Anti-Spyware<br />
Windows malicious software removal tool<br />
PC Tools Registry Mechanic<br />
<br />
The first three removed some trojans, lots of tracking cookies, and some registry edits that referred to infected files, and a bunch of other adware stuff. The microsoft malicious removal tool found nothing (but that was after the first three had run, and cleaned
 up any problems). System was rebooted between each step.<br />
<br />
Windows update service was also not running as well as the security centre, either and manual attempts to force them to start within SERVICES.MCS proved fruitless.<br />
<br />
I found this thread:<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-networking/error-1075-the-dependency-service-does-not-exist/39ec4b3e-8a6d-48d1-bf52-25fe7c47b3de?page=1<br />
<br />
<br />
So went thru that &amp; tried all the solutions there, including this:<br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following registry subkey:
<div><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dhcp</strong></div>
</li><li>Right-click the&nbsp;<strong>DependOnService</strong>&nbsp;entry, and then click&nbsp;<b>delete instead of modify</b></li></ol>
</div>
Then rebooted (again).<br />
<br />
I also tried to do a system restore - but there are no available restore points prior to having this problem.<br />
<br />
I also tried the sfc scan within a cmnd prompt (as administrator) twice, and both times it came back saying:<br />
<br />
"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them. Details are included in the CBS.log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log"<br />
<br />
I then also tried to "<strong>Verify that the Dependency Service / components are running"
</strong>by typing CMD /K SC QC DHCP into a cmnd prompt, and it came back successful. I then went tried to do this:<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Click <strong>Start</strong>, <strong>Run</strong> and type <strong>DEVMGMT</strong>.<strong>MSC</strong><br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;In the <strong>View</strong> menu, click <strong>Show hidden devices</strong><br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Double-click Non-Plug and Play drivers section<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Double-click the entry <strong>AFD</strong>, and click the <strong>Driver</strong> tab<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Set the <strong>Startup</strong> type to <strong>System</strong>.<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Start the <strong>service</strong>. Note down the error message if any.<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Similarly start the two other drivers namely:<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;TCP/IP Protocol Driver<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;<strong>NetBios over Tcpip</strong><br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Close Device Manager and <strong>restart</strong> Windows.<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Now check if you can start the DHCP service.<br />
<br />
But i can not find the entry AFD or NetBios over Tcpip?<br />
I did find the TCP/IP Protocol driver and changed the startup type from "boot" to "system". the device was reported as working correctly.<br />
<br />
Somewhere along the line, Windows update has started working, and I tried updating and all seems fine there with no outstanding updates, but still I have no windows security centre, and under SERVICES.MCS, my SB SD Security Service Centre still won't start,
 and is "stopped", again any manual attempts just get the "error 1075" message again.<br />
The "Windows Management Instrumentation" under SERVICES.MCS is running fine, and is on automatic already.<br />
<br />
I'm at a loss! Any help would be appreciated, before i pull all of my hair out!!!<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>The storyline is pretty awesome, combine that with the fact that you can alter it (somewhat) by your decisions and you've won me over.</p>
<p>The combat isn't my favorite, but I'm much more attracted to the fact that after every mission I can spend about thirty minutes walking around the ship and talking to my crew, finding out more and more about them with every encounter.</p>
<p>Somtimes, it's not about killing.</p>

<p>[/quote]The first one I found the combat satisfying, ME2 and ME3, not at all, in fact I am seriously considering playing it on story mode if I get it so I can avoid the tedium of the combat. It all depends on if they have another achievement for completing
 it on insane difficulty.</p>

<p>@Tataki -- They do.</p>
<p>@OP -- To me, a good story/concept trumps gameplay mechanics.. unless they are completely broken, which they are not. &nbsp;Those types of games appeal to me much more than say, running around shooting terrorists which got old in about 2007. &nbsp;I've gravitated
 away from the FPS genre onto other things. (Or at least try to)</p>

Once again you show your ignorance, The story is a Babylon 5 rip off and a war of the worlds rip off. And just want to ask how do you justify calling it a gears rip off when many people have already told you Gears itself ripped off RE4. Hell, even Cliffy B
 has gone on the record stating where he got the ideas for combat from.</p>

<p>The difference is Gears completely improved on RE4. Bioware is on their 3rd attempt with ME and judging from the demo they still can't come close to matching what Epic was able to do their first attempt. And for people that say ME is about the story well
 if you like stories where every character cries over their personal life because literally every single squad member in ME2 did.</p>

<p>The issue is that some games, select themselves the refresh rate (i can't change it in the game's settings), and they apply a higher rate than the one my monitor is able to handle, so the screen gets blank.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I'm sometimes able to correct that with <a href="http://downloads.guru3d.com/RefreshLock-download-354.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Refreshlock </a>but sometimes not, and i'm forced to play at a lower resolution.<br />
</p>
<p>I've searched the Web for solutions, but found nothing. I uninstalled the drivers, reinstalled them, no change.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Maybe there is some settings in the registry that I can edit ?</p>

            Nope, not going to be in the registry.&nbsp; This is entirely up to the monitor driver, so make sure you're getting that specifically and not the one for your graphics card solely.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Shawn.<br />
<br />
I noticed that changing the monitor's driver is not doing anything: when I list all modes, they are still the same, even if I use a 15" monitor driver, for instance.<br />
<br />
So I think that Windows is using the generic non plug-and-play driver, and is allowing any modes supported by the graphic card to be used, even if the monitor can't handle them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the monitor's driver seems to be installed and loaded, but it is not.&nbsp; </p>
<p />

            <p>- What games ?<br />
</p>
<p>- What are your other system specs - cpu, RAM, &amp; power supply, make and model ?
<br />
</p>
<p>- Was your previous graphics card also Nvidia ?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- It shouldn't really matter if the tick box is greyed out. It is with my GTX770 with a 120Hz LCD monitor as well (and the box is clear, not ticked).
<br />
</p>
<p>The refresh rates listed for my monitor are 60, 100, 110 and 120. If Windows monitor&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>settings, or Nvidia control panel settings are not holding the refresh rate you choose from<br />
</p>
<p>the drop down list (and clicking on Apply),&nbsp; something is interfering. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>"The issue is that some games, select themselves the refresh rate"</em><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe, but I've never seen a game that defaults above 60Hz, even when there are
<br />
</p>
<p>refresh rate options in the game.<br />
</p>
<p>However, there would be plenty of games that can run well over 60fps with your GTX760.<br />
</p>
<br />
<p>- Programs such as Refreshlock can cause problems of their own (possibly this).<br />
</p>
<p>btw - Why are you using this low resolution ? Why not 1600x1200, or say, 1280x1024 ?
<br />
</p>
<p>I don't see 120Hz in the article below. Preset is 85Hz tops (as with DELL/Sony Trinitron 21" monitors). Did you force 120Hz using Refreshloc, because of this line from your monitors spec sheet ?&nbsp;
</p>
<p><em>"Horizontal Refresh Rate</em><em> 107 kHz</em>"....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>[<em> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">EDIT:</span> </em>Thinking about it some more... V-sync will set the frame rate of the game, but does not affect<br />
</p>
<p>the refresh rate of the monitor, so what follows may not apply.... ]<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Are you using V-Sync ?&nbsp;&nbsp; V-sync should cap the games fps to whatever your monitors
<br />
</p>
<p>preset refresh rate is, if not overridden by something else.<br />
</p>
<p>If you have enabled V-Sync,&nbsp; try uninstalling and reinstalling the Nvidia drivers. Re-boot after uninstalling, and again after reinstalling the drivers. Best to download the drivers directly from the<br />
Nvidia site - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
NVIDIA Driver Downloads - Advanced Search</a> <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- If you have not already tried using V-Sync - <br />
</p>
<p>If the games in question don't have an option for V-sync in the games settings you can make
<br />
</p>
<p>a profile for those games in Nvidia Control Panel &gt; 3D settings, and enable V-Sync there.<br />

            <p>I'm glad you're having a LCD monitor and do not have any issue, but I'm using a CRT monitor, and as you know
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">it's quite different,</a> and in this case refresh rate matters A LOT.&nbsp; For instance, 60 Hz is way too low on a CRT, the screen is flickering, and it can even damage your
<span><em>eyesight</em>.</span>, and this rate is ok with a LCD. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sorry to say that, but I found nothing useful in your response.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Yes, I know where to find Nvidia drivers, thanks. </p>
<p>- It does not matter what games, nor my detailed system specs nor my previous graphic board.
</p>
<p>- I have no issue with Vsync.<br />
</p>
<p>- I manually cap the FPS in all games to 40, 'cause that's way enough to play confortably, and it's reducing GPU usage .
<br />
</p>
<p>- You're mixing refresh rate, in-game fps, screen resolution, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_scan_rate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
horizontal scan rate</a> (Khz).<br />
</p>
<p>- I dont' know what are the preset refresh rates, but yes, my monitor handles 120 Hz.
<br />
</p>
<p>- yes, some games I'm playing set the refresh rate accordingly to the values they find in the system, and maybe it's the highest refresh rate available. (I can't know as the monitor stops responding, and it can't display the actual refresh rate as I can
 do when I tick the appropriate button). </p>
<p>- Refreshlock has been very useful to me to solve many of these issues with games not running at the required refresh rate, and it's easy to disable if necessary.</p>
<p>- Furmark ? What's that and how that is supposed to help me resolve my issue ?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Yes, I did reference an LCD refresh rate of 60Hz, as this is standard with LCD, and refresh rate</p>
<p>also matters with LCD. They won't run at an incorrect refresh rate either.</p>
<p>I should have extrapolated to CRT for you, but I did mentioned the DELL/Sony CRT.
</p>
<p>That is the last CRT I used, and while it also made reference to 120Hz in its stats , 85Hz was the highest it would run @ 1600X1200, or 1280x1024. It's been a while, so I don't recall if it would handle 120Hz at a lower res. The link I gave to the specs
 for your monitor showed the same max refresh rates, 75 &amp; 85HZ </p>
<p>for all resolutions except 640x480 (60Hz).</p>
<p>Anyway - I always set the refresh rate in the CRT's&nbsp; OSD.&nbsp; Never needed to use Windows monitor
</p>
<p>setting, and the refresh rate always stayed on 85Hz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also edited the V-sync comments, because they did confuse the issue regarding fps vs refresh rate,</p>
<p>and yes, I did muddle the two terms before editing.</p>
<p>The main reason for mentioning fps in conjunction with refresh rate was to point out the connection should you have been confusing a high fps with the monitors refresh rate, as V-sync</p>
<p>would bring down the fps, should they be what was actually running over 120.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What method do you use to cap fps at 40 ? Nvidia Inspector, or another software ?
</p>
<p>Manually changing the .cfg,&nbsp; file ?</p>
<p>Obviously no need for V-sync if the frame rates are capped. </p>
<p>I suppose there could be some current games that want to lock in a 60Hz, but what title would</p>
<p>be forcing your monitor to run over 120Hz ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Refreshlock log the refresh rate while gaming, or do you monitor it some other way ?
</p>
<p>As far as I know the refresh rate has always been static. Fixed to whatever I choose in</p>
<p>Windows monitor settings, or Nvidia Control Panel, except when I change to Intel HD4000 graphics,</p>
<p>when it switches to Intels&nbsp; max of 60Hz (on LCD. With a CRT it may go higher ? ).</p>
<p>The games, other than those with a refresh rate option, should not normally be involved in the
</p>
<p>monitors refresh rate. </p>
<p>btw - It was your link to Guru3D that led me to leaving the link to Nvidia, as I thought you may</p>
<p>also be downloading the drivers via Guru3D, as there are download links to Nvidia drivers on that page.</p>
<p>There was nothing in your post that specified you downloading the drivers from Nvidia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The comment on furmark, and most of the confused body of my OP regarding V-sync, was edited after
</p>
<p>my OP (A preview option on these forums would be helpful for me).</p>
<p>The furmark comment was meant for another thread that I'd read before replying to either.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Does the issue occur when you open any particular website or all the websites?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<br />
If Internet<span>&nbsp; </span>Explorer runs with firewall disabled, then you will need to configure certain firewall settings. Please contact the software publisher for support.<br />
<br />
For windows firewall settings, see:<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Windows Firewall from start to finish<br />
</span></strong></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Method 1: Reset security settings for Internet Explorer</span></strong><b><br />
<br />
</b>If you configure security settings to be too restrictive, you may prevent Internet Explorer from displaying certain Web sites. To determine whether an issue is caused by overly restrictive security settings, revert to default security settings. To do this,
 follow these steps: <br />
<br />
1. Open Internet Explorer. <br />
2. Click Tools, and then click Internet Options. <br />
3. Click the Security tab. <br />
4. Click Reset all zones to default level, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2: <span>&nbsp;</span></b>If the issue occurs with any particular website, then check if the issue persists in compatibility mode.<br />
<br />
</span></span><span>a. Open Internet Explorer.<br />
b. Press F12 key on the keyboard.<br />
c. Click on browser mode and select different version of Internet Explorer and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Do get back and let us know the status of the issue, I will be glad to help you further. We, at Microsoft strive towards excellence.</span>

            <p>hi Vijay</p>
<p>unfortunately this does not help.</p>
<p>1) the "application firewall alert" problem seems to occur only with internet-web-stores-sites.</p>
<p>2) Norton360 disables window's firewall. however, disabling norton360 firewall does not make a difference.</p>
<p>3) resetting security-settings does not help. it runs with Enable-protected-mode on.</p>
<p>4) cannot run browser in older ie versions with windows8.1 and ie11 (this feature seems to have been taken off).</p>
<p>5) the problem might have began after I added to ie11&nbsp;security restricted-zones the site:
 results.</span></p>

            <p>thanks Vijay.</p>
<p>this DOES do the trick.</p>
<p>it seems that there is some basic compatibility issue that runs as a thread in many site (maybe they are all using a similar code). As this has happened in the last few days - maybe it is related to the latest monthly ms update.</p>

<h2>            HP laptop running Windows 8 suddenly started displaying strange symbols.  Can anyone help&#63;</h2>
                    I am having the same issue described here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-desktop/windows-8-wingdings-on-logon-screen/9fea772e-2648-4393-938b-20e7b1e27008">

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not sure what happened. &nbsp;Put laptop to sleep and everything was normal. &nbsp;Woke it up the next day and, at the login screen, noticed these strange characters. &nbsp;They affect every program running on my computer. &nbsp;Reading the thread referred to, above, it sounds
 like my virus scan may have corrupted my Windows fonts. &nbsp;If this is the case, there is no good solution for this in that thread. &nbsp;Does Microsoft have any response for this issue? &nbsp;I am using McAfee Total Protection on this laptop.</div>

            I am now having the same issue. Two days ago, I started up my laptop and saw nothing but wingdings. No programs or browsers worked, but I was able to locate some of my important files by memory. I opted to do a system restore yesterday and spent the whole
 day waiting for the windows 8.1 and subsequent 95 updates to be downloaded, then downloaded all of my software programs and re-set-up my computer. This morning, I booted up my laptop to the exact same story - nothing but unreadable hieroglyphs. What could
 be going on with my computer??

                    <p>I've been using Skype voicemail which I understand has changed from custom message to default message. I've turned it off and back on twice now and I still don't get a voicemail prompt when I call my Skype Number (or SkypeID) even though it's set to forward
 to voicemail after 45 seconds.</p>
