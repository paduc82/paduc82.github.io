            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can easily resolve this through the following troubleshooting steps: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign in <strong><a href="https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=13&amp;ct=1479420529&amp;rver=6.5.6510.0&amp;wp=SA_20MIN&amp;wreply=https%3a%2f%2faccount.live.com%2fproofs%2fManage&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=38936&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;uaid=dffb5a66a14f4e48848ece6f0540b330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>,
 and change the two step verification temporary off, and try again.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>If the problem perists whether your phone is on WiFi or cellular data, check the service status page:
<strong><a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://status.live.com/</a></strong></li><li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>backup</strong> &gt; <strong>text messages</strong> and slide the

            This did not help. It cannot be that a phone leaves us suddenly without mail connectivity. Guess it is time to move on with Android.

<h2>            Calls are silent</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Skype on my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 9), the app version is 8.31.0.92. When I try to call anyone I can't hear anything. I tried both with real telephone numbers and with skype contacts (with or without headphones). The people I call
 are able to hear me though. I also tried to call the Echo / Sound Test Service: I can hear the automated voice for exactly 5 seconds and then it gets muted as well while it is still talking. Are you aware of anyone else having the same issue? Is there a way
 I can fix it? I subscribed to a 15 euro monthly plan and I cannot use it if this issue doesn't get sorted...</p>

            I forgot to mention that I noticed that when I try with the Echo / Sound Test service the call gets silent when the call screen looses the focus (when the red hang up button goes away), if it can be of any help...

<h3> zenmasta  say:</h3>
<h2>            16299.15 breaks microphone input on Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Since this last build, microphone input does not work for dictation or cortana. If I press the microphone icone when the softkeyboard is up it says&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something went wrong. Try again in a little while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I press the microphone button from Cortana, nothing will happen except the the cortana icon will animate briefly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From there, if you press start you can't use the start screen anymore because a cortana window will popup stealing focus and says "Tap here to make sure cortana can hear you." which brings up a speech detecting problems dialogue window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choosing Cortana can't here me runs a diagnostic and I choose setup the mic.</p>
<p>It says it will give me some words to repeat and when I click next it just says problem found, your microphone might need to be setup and then it says fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it's not fixed. This is with my bluetooth speaker (which has no issues working on windows 10 mobile or android).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I disconnect th bt speaker and just use the mic on my surface pro I get the same problem. Except after diagnosing the mic it will actually let me say the words/phrases and you can see the meter as if it can hear me voice. But cortana or dictation still
 will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth the bt speaker I'm using is a Sony SRS XB3 and again, microphone input seems to work when it is paired to android or windows 10 mobile, although I guess I can't be certain if the microphone from the speaker is being used on mobile or
 if it's just using the mic from my phones, but I am fairly certain it's from the speaker because I pressed the phone assistant button on both android and windows 10 mobile in order to bring up cortana and google assistant.</p>

<h2>            Excel File being corrupted after being saved on a MAC</h2>
                    <p>i am using Windows 7, office 365, excel 2016 and have been working in a large file. &nbsp;this file is also used by other people without any issues on Windows, but as soon as a MAC users edits and savs the file, it corrupts it. &nbsp;i am in a very difficult situation
 as this is a confidential finanicial file and i need to submit the numbers, but now i will have to re-do all of the work that the MAC user did on a backed up copy. &nbsp;When i try and open the file after the MAC user has saved it, i get the following:</p>
<p>We found a problem with some content in 'FILENAME.xlsx'. &nbsp;Do you want to try to recover as much as we can? If you trust of this workbook, click yes.</p>
<p>when i click YES, i then get this:&nbsp;</p>
Removed Part: /xl/printerSettings/printerSettings31.bin part. &nbsp;(Print options)<br />
<p>
</p><p>it opens the file but the formatting is all over the place and unworkable.. &nbsp;it has happened before and only with the MAC user.. Any ideas please???<br />

            <p>Hi Tony,<br />
<br />
Please perform the following steps to check the outcome:<br />
1. Deleting the 2.0 folder from <strong>%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Apps</strong>.<br />
2. Perform a clean boot to determine whether background programs are interfering with the installation.<br />
</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I would like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. A screenshot of the error message.</p>
<p>2. Where did you download the office 365 support and recovery Assistant. Did you download it from here?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Linda</p>

            When you're in the section where you want to create the new page click the menu button at the bottom and choose "New Page". If you use the "Quick Note" button at the top it'll put your note in the Unfiled Notes section.

            It's not just using the wrong section, it uses wrong notebook entirely! On Windows 8 and RT and even Office 2013, OneNote defaults to "&lt;User name&gt;'s Notebook" and uses the "Quick Notes" section by default. In the Android app it uses the "Personal (Web)"
 notebook and the "Unfiled notes" section.<br />

            Yes, I know. That's the default location for Quick Notes. Don't use the Quick Note button if you want the note to go in a specific section. Go to that section and use the "New Page" button as I said above.
<div><br />
<div>Otherwise you can create Quick Notes and then file them in specific sections/notebooks with the OneNote desktop client.</div>

            That's not a solution. The Android app needs to be updated to behave like EVERY OTHER VERSION ON EVERY OTHER PLATFORM (Windows 8, RT, Office 2013, Windows Phone 7, Windows Phone 8). They all use "&lt;User name&gt;'s Notebook" and "Quick Notes".<br />
<br />
On every other platform "Personal (Web)" is no longer the default notebook and "Unfiled Notes" is no longer the default section for quick notes.<br />

            It probably will eventually be updated that way - but it's not going to be updated that way by you or me.<br />
<br />
I gave you the way the program is currently intended to be used and it's the solution that you can implement today.<br />
<br />
If you want to shout at the wind about the way it should be that's fine...but it doesn't change where your notes get saved.<br />
<br />
Using the "New Page" button instead of "Quick Notes" does change where your notes get saved. &nbsp;:-)

<p>
</p><p>To make default, open the appropriate Notebook, press and hold on the section until a ticked box appears. Use the top-right-hand gizmo (3 squares in a row) to "Set as default". Once that's done, the wholr Notebook should be shown as default next time you
 go into OneNote.</p>

            <p>Its Dec of 2016 and no change. It seems like things have gotten worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Android app creates a Quick Notes in the My Notebook.</p>
<p>OneNote 2016 creates a Quick Note file outside of any notebook (root of OneNote Notebooks). So if you wanted to view it in OneNote online you cannot. With the changes that came with OneNote online the notebooks no longer have a folder structure; at least
 not visible to the naked&nbsp;eye. It use to be you had the main folder (name of the notebook) then subfolders to distinguish section groups. Now they appear both online and locally as a single file. If you right click the file locally it acts like a shortcut.
 Once loaded however the folder structure view is obtainable in the cache directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you had several quick notes in the \OneNotes Notebook\One Notes.one you will now have to load OneNote desktop then move them all to the One Notes section of My Notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did someone at Microsoft who develops OneNote neglect to see this? I would almost want to presume they don't even use it or at least the quick notes part or just don't care and feel the rest of us should just figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There needs to be some kind of uniformity.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 810 not found on my Windows 7 PC</h2>
                    Just got my Lumia 810 and very disappointed to find out that Zune doesn't work.&nbsp; When I plug my phone into my Windows 7 PC, I get a device with no drivers available.&nbsp; Really Microsoft/Nokia?&nbsp; I've tried the WindowsPhone application on my PC and it doesn't
 do anything (probably because of the missing driver).<br />
<br />
Anybody have any suggestions on what I can do?&nbsp; This is really frustrating.&nbsp; I've been waiting a long time for this phone and now my expectations have been deflated.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi DavidZangger,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zune software is only compatible for Windows Phone 7.x devices and will not work with WP8 devices.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your Nokia Lumia 810 you will need to use the Windows Phone desktop app. Please take a look at the following article for some troubleshooting steps you can try:</p>

            <p>David, when you attach your device to your PC via cable, are you using the USB cable that came with the phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you hear a sound when you attach your device?</p>
<p>If you look at Computer you should see the following:</p>

            Hi Jack and thanks for the response.&nbsp; I'm running Windows 7; on Windows 8, it works just fine.&nbsp; But my main PC is Windows 7.&nbsp; If I go into the Device Manager, my phone shows up in Other Devices.&nbsp; If I remove it, use the plug that came with my phone, and
 plug it back in, I get the same messages.&nbsp; There are no drivers.&nbsp; Same with the WindowsPhoneApp.&nbsp; Uninstall it and reinstall it... Same results.&nbsp; No phone.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Why aren't there any drivers for this phone?&nbsp; Didn't anybody test this using Windows 7 x64?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Very frustrating.<br />

<p><br />
So it should load the drivers automatically David.&nbsp; I'm not sure why it is not but I would (if it were mine) try to connect to a different Windows 7 PC and see if it works.&nbsp; That would at least tell you that it is not the device and is related to your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also make sure that your Win7 PC has all of its updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I might consider removing the devices as you did in Device Manager, reboot the PC and turn off (so you see the Goodbye message) your device.&nbsp; Then restart and re-attach to see if that works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that fails, I might consider performing a hard reset on the device and start fresh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure what else to offer but I would definitely see if you can connect to a different Win7 PC if possible just to make sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you install the Windows Phone app for syncing?</p>

            Thanks for the help Jack.&nbsp; Nothing works (and this is the last of the Windows 7 PC's in my house - my main one though).&nbsp; I've tried what you suggested and it's still not working.&nbsp; Microsoft really screwed this up - no offense to anybody here.&nbsp; My system
 is always up to date with patches and my Windows 7 phone never had these issues.&nbsp; Like others have said, it's going to be really hard to recommend these phones if you have to run Windows 8.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
As a side note, my battery charging icon on my phone doesn't even show it charging - where the plug blinks on and off to indicate it's charging.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I guess for now, I'll have to use my Windows 8 laptop to transfer files.&nbsp; <br />

            Just so you know David, the same thing's happening with me; nokia lumia 810 phone, using the cable that came with the phone to connect to a windows 7 computer. It sometimes seems like microsoft goes out of there way to make their products unwieldy. I want
 to like it, but this isn't a good start.

    <title>SharePoint Lists and Conditional Formatting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Lists and Conditional Formatting</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to resolve this and have followed several online articles, but for some reason my implementation seems to fail. I am trying to add conditional formatting to my SharePoint list so that if the text "red" or "green" appears in a column, the row
 associated with such field will change color. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had several recommendations before, such as using a<strong> Content Editor Web Part</strong> and a
<strong>Script Editor</strong>, but both of those never did anything towards my goal. The Script editor just displayed the java-script on the SharePoint page where the script editor was zoned to. I heard rumors that Microsoft changed how java-script is read
 in the sites; but I have no confirmation of this whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem too? I double checked that the script was linked in the list; and the list still didn't render color. I have since then deleted that script since it didn't work.</p>

            <p>No, Excel does not provide a way to print a custom view directly - you have to show the view first, then print.</p>
<p>If you would like to be able to print a specific view quickly, you could create a macro, for example</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub PrintMyView()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWorkbook.CustomViews("MyView").Show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWorkbook.PrintOut<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when you run the macro, the custom view is shown and the workbook is printed.</p>

            That's not much information for us to go on. Display property might mean a format or input mask in the table. But I'm only guessing. If you have any field formatting or input masks in the field properties remove them and try again.

<h2>            Outlook email preview now showing long links in body of emails</h2>
                    Restarted today and now most of my emails in Outlook have long URLs instead of hyperlinks, for images too, in them....How can I get back to those being hidden? Also, emails no longer ask whether to load pictures or not. I use 365, and is updated. Please
 help.

            Hi Justin,
<br />This is a known issue in the most recent build and microsoft is investigating. It only affects POP accounts - or more specifically, ANSI PST files. 
<br />
<br />An update was released to fix it - go to File, Office account and check for updates. 
<br />
<br />See <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_win10-mso_2019/outlook-2019-unfriendly-url-links/8b701f03-feb2-4c49-aa32-5b849affe1f9">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/fo...</a>  for the main thread.

<h2>            Error message in Office Apps</h2>
                    <p>I keep getting this error mesage every time I open an Office App. It started happening when I upgraded my HUP subscription to Office 2016. It is making the software 100% worthless. I have tried to get Microsoft to fix it, but they have been unsuccessful
 Can I get my money back or is there a way to fix it?</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you perform a repair of your Office 2016.</p>
<p>You may refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Not locked out, but still getting the error every time I attempt to us Microsoft Office. I have tried everything Microsoft has suggested and none of it works. No worries though, I am done with Microsoft Office software. It is junk and costs way too much.
 My paper and pencil works 100% of the time and is much much faster and more accurate.

<h2>            Render issue on latest fast ring</h2>
                    17133 version. Happens quite often when using browser-like apps(Chrome, VS code),&nbsp;in a sudden the whole UI just stopped rendering. The system is still responding to mouse and keyboard inputs, but won't get out of this. A hack solution is to sleep the system
 and wake it up. Latest GeForce drivers installed.

            From my current knowledge I can't judge weather it's a dwm issue, a chrome issue or a nvidia driver issue, or a conflict between these. The UI freezes almost every time when I switch between my chrome and vscode, but this does not happen when switching
 between ms edge and vscode

<p>If you are not running AIDA64 in the background, then the problem is likely different.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />
<br />
Did the issue started only after upgrading to the latest Build 10159?<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices except mouse and keyboard and check if you are able to access the start menu, Cortana, the Task View or the Action Center/Notifications icons from the task bar.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong>The issue seems be due to the Build corrupted. I would suggest you to press the Shift key and hold the power button so that it will go to the recovery options. Select the option restore to the previous Build. Once you restore to the
 previous Build you can try upgrading to the Build 10159 and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

    <title>How to edit OUTLOOK Rules - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to edit OUTLOOK Rules</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">
I was hoping to find some means of easily editing Outlook Rules.<br />
I can export to a .rwz file but can not read this file so it's only purpose would appear to be a backup or to enable the same rules to be copied elsewhere.<br />
I have seen something by Sperry Software but is $40 and probably does far more than I need.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">
Just being able to SORT the rules easily would be great - rather than just having to move rules up or down. If the rules list is long this process is very time consuming.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">
I have seen similar requests going back 10+ years and I am sort of hoping that Microsoft perhaps had some simple (and positive ) answer<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">
Put simple EXPORT rules - to txt or csv say - edit the rules - then import back into OUTLOOK would do nicely</p>
<p style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">
PS I use Outlook 2016 (Office Pro) and Windows 10 Pro</p>

            Hi Peter, 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br /> I am sort of hoping that Microsoft perhaps had some simple (and positive ) answer
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />I hate to be the bearer of bad news but no, Microsoft hasn't done anything to make editing rules easier.  
<br />
<br />Rules can't be exported to text, they can't be sorted (this was never added to outlook because rules run in the order they are arranged). 
<br />
<br />The RWZ file is binary code and not readable - Sperry was able to figure it out but his is the only utility available. Sorry. :(  As much as people want it, you'd think other developers would have done something - it should be a good seller.

<p>Diane,</p>
<p>Many thanks (as always) for a prompt and meaningful response.</p>
<p>Sort of figured this was the case.</p>
<p>As&nbsp; you say would be a good seller - but perhaps even more relevant - a real great idea for Microsoft to include (it has been a subject of interest / request to 10+ years).</p>
<p>I have a 'modest' 100+ rules to sort by supplier (eBay, Amazon etc) , utilities (Gas, Electricity. Broadband etc) and I am sure then many people with many more rules.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook Error Message &#34;cannot start microsoft outlook. cannot open the outlook window. the set of folders cannot be opened. the attempt to log on to microsoft exchange failed.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've tried looking at help pages and previous questions similar to this but they all have guidance for office 2010 or windows 8 and so aren't any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I had an issue with outlook 2013 since upgrading to windows 10; it kept saying "trying to connect" or "disconnected" in the bottom right corner. I now think it might have been as simple as an incorrect password, but at the time, I tried turning
 off "cached exchange mode" as I read online this could help. When i then restarted outlook, it wouldn't open at all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now get the error message "cannot start microsoft outlook. cannot open the outlook window. the set of folders cannot be opened. the attempt to log on to microsoft exchange failed." And yes, I do have an exchange account on there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the resetnavpane thing in the run application, and uninstalled and reinstalled office! Any further help would be much appreciated as microsoft hung up on me while I was on hold when I rang them and recommenced I call back later as they were too
 busy!</p>

<p>hi yugandharsingh,<br />
<br />
for narrowing down the issue, i’d like to confirm the following things:<br />
1.for “opening the office files from one drive”, do you open files in the synced folder or from the onedrive library in the office portal? could you provide us with the detailed steps?<br />
2.share with us a screenshot for “stuck on processing”. if there are some error messages, please also capture a screenshot about them. to post pictures, click<strong> use rich formatting&gt;insert/edit media</strong> in the tread page.<br />
3.what is the version of your office? is it installed from the office 365 portal or a standalone version? to check the version, open one of the office applications and click
<strong>file&gt;account</strong>. you can see the information under <strong>product information</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a3b4d06c-fa4c-4767-b332-9dc2f1a1937e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da3b4d06c-fa4c-4767-b332-9dc2f1a1937e" /></a><br />
4.can you open other office files on your local disk?<br />
<br />
moreover, could you try the following and let us know the outcome?<br />
1.<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">repair the office applications</a> and try again.<br />
2.you can sign in to the office portal and navigate to the files. choose open in office applications to check if it can be opened.
<br />

    <title>How can MS Access 2013 Runtime access the spell checker of the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can MS Access 2013 Runtime access the spell checker of the installed MS Office 2013&#63;</h2>
                    <p>1) Installed MS Office 365 Business (most current, Version 15.0.4727.1003, which excludes&nbsp;MS Access 2013)&nbsp;on all our Windows 7 office computers, and spell checking works in those MS&nbsp;Word installations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Then installed MS Access 2013 Runtime application (most current, Version 15.0.4569.1506), and successfully ran our home-grown application without using spell checking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) BUT, when attempting to check spelling (using F7 key), Access Runtime&nbsp;returns the error:</p>
<p>"XXXXX can't&nbsp;start the&nbsp;spelling checker because it&nbsp;isn't installed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>???) What must I do (from my development license of Access 2013, or&nbsp;on the Office clients) for my Access Runtime app to&nbsp;invoke the spelling checker installed&nbsp;with the licensed Office clients?</p>

            <p>Maybe run the Repair option of the Office setup program? If it's not installed or broken, that may help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Programmatically you invoke the spell checker using:<br />
RunCommand acCmdSpelling</p>

            <p>Thank you for your suggestion, but the problem remains.</p>
<p>1) I ran the Repair option on the Office and the Access setup programs.</p>
<p>2) Coded the RunCommand acCmdSpelling.</p>
<p>Access runtime still complains that "the spelling checker... isn't installed."</p>

            <p>Problem SOLVED!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following a tip originally posted by "epiek" on <a href="http://www.access-programmers.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.access-programmers.co.uk</a> on 6/19/2014, I downloaded and installed the free Microsoft software called:&nbsp; SharePoint Designer 2013 (sharepointdesigner_32.exe).&nbsp; SharePoint Designer is apparently the missing component that provides the sharing of Spell
 Checking between Access 2013 Runtime and MS Office 2013 Business.&nbsp; The "F7" key remains inoperative, but my button that invokes
<strong>DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdSpelling </strong>now works as intended.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/906c25bf-752f-4806-b729-da0b1d5d57a0" title="Allan_903">
<p>
</p><p>To pin&nbsp;your Skype app to the taskbar, simply launch the app and right click on the Skype icon on the task bar and select
<strong>pin to task bar.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To create a Skype desktop shortcut, open your <strong>
file explorer </strong>icon from the taskbar. Click <strong>this PC</strong>, then select your C: drive and open program files then look for the Skype file. Right click on the Skype file and send to desktop (create a shortcut). Take note that this will not
 work if you are referring to the built-in Skype for Windows 10 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Skype for Windows 10 (<em>built-in Skype application for Windows 10 OS</em>), create a desktop shortcut by dragging the Skype icon from the<strong> Apps list</strong> to your desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further questions.</p>
