    <title>5500 Sport Keypad - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            5500 Sport Keypad</h2>
                    Hi to everybody, my 5500 keypad unglued a couple weeks ago...<br />
<br />
I'd like to hear from you about the keypad problem many of us are having from this otherwise amazing cellphone.<br />
<br />
Mine is still away for repairs, the service people didnt' tell me how they're gonna fix it. How did Nokia fix yours? Do they just put on a new keypad, or worse glue back the old one?<br />
<br />
If so, it'll take just a couple months to come off again...<br />
<br />
Is Nokia planning a long term solution? What is Nokia's official position on this problem?<br />
<br />
It seems like it's affecting all 5500s out there, Nokia must do something about this!

<br />
My 5500 will be away for one more week, at least... Still wondering why Nokia didn't keep the awesome 5210 - 5100 - 5140 shell system!

            Two months ago, I received a Nokia 5500 Sport as a birthday gift from my girlfriend. A month into using it, I noticed that the keypads were already stripping off. The loose rubber keypads really annoys me whenever I send text messages, which I always do.
 On November 27, the phone suddenly wasn't able to get signal. I transferred my sim card to my old phone and discovered that my line was perfectly fine. I went to the Nokia Care service department at SM Mall of Asia, I'm from the Philippines by the way, on
 November 30 and instructed them that there were two things I wanted fixed on the phone, the Keypads and the no signal issue.<br />
<br />
I kept on calling them about the status of my phone every other day, but I kept on hearing the same statements that my phone is still in the backroom office undergoing repair. Finally on December 14, I asked for the manager because I was already tired of their
 canned responses. I was informed that they replaced something in the phone to fix the no signal issue, but to my disappointment they were unable to document the keypad problem. That really sent me through the roof! Two days later, the same manager called me
 up and informed me that my phone is already fixed and I can pick it up. So, I decided to brave the christmas rush traffic and go to the Mall to claim my phone. Upon checking the phone, the major problem was definitely fixed, but the keypad issue was still
 there which sent my blood pressure soaring once again. The guy that I talked informed me that they were still waiting for the parts to fix the keypads, and they will call me (which I highly doubt) once it is available. What's frustrating about this whole situation
 was the expectation that set that phone has been fixed.<br />
<br />
Now I'm using a phone that is half fixed and upon checking the camera it's giving me the error message "General: Feature not supported"! Argh!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
For future buyers of this phone, I suggest that you look at other models, or better yet look at another brand. Nokia after sales service sucks big time, they don't even have the basics of customer service skills like active listening and setting the proper
 expactations to customers like us who pay for their salaries.

            I bought 5500 Sport Music edition(salmon pink colour ) on Dec.16th. My keypad is still intact.But it has been only 4 days! I'am regretting buying it now, I didn't do some research on this mobile phone on the Internet before I bought it, just been attracted
 by its damn good appearance and the so-called three-preventive feature. At the begining, I thought the keypad unglued problem happens only in China, now it comes out a world-wide problem. What a stupid design defect! Happend in the largest mobile development
 company in the world. Nokia makes a lot of money in China recent years. Many people around me are using NOKIA phones, so I discard my old SIEMENS phone and decide to be a NOKIA customer, but unfortunely, Nokia betrayed my trust.<br />
I know my keypad will finally strip, it is just like a timing-bomb to me. I called the after sale service here in GuangZhou, China. They told me they can replace it with a new keypad for free when the thing happens. Damn! they already knew the problem! and
 they said they don't know if the new keypad can last for longer time. Haven't got any information from NOKIA yet.<br />
I still have aleatory thought, Is there any one who are using the new 5500 music edition(nor yellow or grey) and the keypad has unglued?

            Same problem here.<br />
Bought my phone from AELIOTES (cyprus). The seller recommended the nokia 5500 sport as the best choice for outdoor use. My keypad is peeling off for the second time now. I hope my warranty still covers the repair.<br />
Nokia should definetely make an official statement for this default of their product.<br />
Next time i am going for japanese. Sorry nokia, you used to be trustworhty!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why <strong>Microsoft Word</strong> text won't format correctly is a misbehaving add-on.&nbsp; For us to determine what's really causing this issue, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which <strong>Office </strong>subscription do you have?</li><li>Is this happening when you're editing an old document or on a new document?</li><li>Which device are you using in accessing Word?</li><li>Are there any changes made on your device aside from upgrading to Windows 10?</li></ul>
<p>

<p>The problem is undoubtedly that the apostrophe is being inserted in a different font. Selecting the apostrophe (or the entire block of text) and pressing
<strong>Ctrl+Spacebar</strong> might correct the problem, or it may be necessary to select the apostrophe and apply the correct font manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But of course what you really need is to figure out why this is happening in the first place. What version of Word are you using and what font? Does the problem still occur if you start in Office Safe Mode (press
<strong>Ctrl</strong> while Word is loading and answer yes at the prompt)?</p>

            <p>You turned on the narrator in ease of access. Many people use it everyday. It did not high jack your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Narrator is a screen reader that reads text aloud to allow users who are visually impaired, blind, or otherwise have trouble reading to use a Windows Phone. Once Narrator is turned on, you'll need to use Narrator-specific gestures to navigate your phone.
 See the full list of gestures in the following table. </p>
<p>

<h2>            Lumia 640 &#40;W10M&#41; Can Only Install Western European Keyboard Packs</h2>
                    So, I am someone who enjoys speaking in multiple languages, but the newest builds of Windows 10 Mobile have prevented me from doing that. I could install the Spanish and French keyboards just fine on my Lumia 640, but I can't install the Russian, Chinese
 QWERTY, and Japanese QWERTY keyboards. I get an error telling me that text suggestions could not be downloaded.&nbsp;

<h2>            How do I set reminders automatically&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 8.1 pro and when writing in an appointment it's necessary to go to options and set a reminder (if required) every time you do this –
<br />
is there a default setting for reminder so that every appointment <br />
has a reminder automatically set? i.e. I need a reminder for every appointment but I don't always remember to set them.
<br />
I was previously told "This will set reminder by default for all the appointments.<br />
‘Default Reminders’ for the appointment, verify if you checked the option ‘Default Reminders’ under File &gt; Option
<br />
&gt; Calendar &gt; Calendar Options".<br />
&nbsp;I've tried this but it&nbsp;doesn't set a reminder automatically when I add an appointment</p>

 insight as to how to stop this from happening.&nbsp; It's quite annoying.

<p>This issue is probably caused by an add-in crashing Outlook upon closing. When Outlook crashes, it will automatically restart.</p>
<p>Can you repro this issue in Outlook Safe Mode?<br />
Start-&gt; Run; outlook.exe /safe<br />
(note the space in the command)</p>
<p>If it works now, your issue is most likely indeed caused by an add-in.<br />
Which add-ins do you have installed?</p>
<p>Disable them all and see if the issue still occurs. If not, you can enable them one-by-one to find the culprit. For details see;<br />

    <title>High Fidelity option missing from compression options in PPT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markphillipswsc  say:</h3>
<h2>            High Fidelity option missing from compression options in PPT &#40;Office 2016 Pro Plus&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>I work in a school that is currently re-branding. We have noticed that the hi-res images of the school crest (for example) are showing as very low-res in PPT slides (they print fine) on screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my research I believe there should be an option to choose High Fidelity from the resolution options under options, advanced, image size and quality. The only options available to any school computer/user are 96, 220 or 330 ppi. This is proving to be
 insufficient quality for presentations on screen etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Headmaster's personal Mac at home has the option. I'm just wanting to confirm whether or not it should be present in our version and if it should how to get it there? Our default installation includes all PPT options available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Mark P.</p>

            I believe High Fidelity is a 365 subscription only option but having said that 220 or 330 are more than enough for good quality on screen or projected assuming the screen or projector is of high enough resolution. Are you projecting or viewing on screen?
 The Mac may have a higher resolution screen that your school PCs and very few projectors work at more than 1920 x 1080.

            The High fidelity option should appear in current versions of PowerPoint 2016. I have 1 installation still on version 1904 and it's displaying there. However, if you check
<strong>Do not compress images in file</strong>, it doesn't matter what d.p.i. setting you choose, images will not be downsampled.

<p>Thanks for the replies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bit odd then that the versions installed on all of our computers (which are click to run O365 versions for education) don't have the HiFi option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However - More information has come to light and the issue has been resolved.</p>
<p>It turns out the users were importing an EPS file as a picture&nbsp; - I had assumed they were actually using picture files. If I use a JPG taken from my DSLR the quality is fine regardless of the setting in PPT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution was simple - convert the EPS files to PNG in Paintshop&nbsp; - the users can then import the files as pictures that are hi-res and fully scalable...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been in IT long enough now to know better than to assume stuff - at least I should have!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Odd thing is that when I try to import the same EPS files to PPT they cannot be displayed and I've found that EPS files shouldn't work in PPT anymore (at least that's what Google told me). Still learning after all these years....</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            What kind of network are you on? If a corporate network, see your IT Dept. The website loads fine from here (and it is quite an amazing building). If this is a home computer without any Internet filtering, do you have Java installed? What happens if you
 try with an alternate browser like Firefox?

<h2>            Stuck in a Sign In loop to activate office on a Mac &#38; Never asked for a password.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a college Office account that I'm trying to activate on a Mac but when I enter my college email to activate the license and press "Next" I'm brought back to Sign in. I never get asked for my password it seems to be stuck in a loop. This only seems
 to happen on the Mac as I was able to login and activate Office&nbsp;with the college email on a Windows device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to log in successfully with a non college account.</p>
<p>I've reinstalled Office twice and even reset the computer back to factory settings and it's still happening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Eva18O,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could first try the following steps:</p>
<p>Make sure there is no account signed into Office apps. If there is account already signed in,
<span>sign out the existing account, quit Office apps, access <strong>
Keychain Access</strong> application, remove </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft Office Identities Cache 2</span><span> |
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft Office Identities Settings 2</span><span> and any
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">ADAL</span><span> entries that are listed within the "Name" or "Kind" columns, restart your Mac, reopen one of the Office apps, check if you are able to activate it.
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: search for 'microsoft' and 'adal' within the keychain application and delete all returned results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work, try
<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25796?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
creating a new Mac account</a>, sign into Mac with the new account, check if you are able to activate Office suite.

<h2>            Importing Excel List to Create an Org Chart in Visio 2016</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to use the Organization Chart Wizard to import an Excel file into Visio.</p>
<p>Click: I want to create my organization chart from:&nbsp; Information that is already stored in a file or database.</p>
<p>Choose:&nbsp; A text, Org plus, or Excel File</p>
<p>Select:&nbsp; The Location of my file</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Excel fields are the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>Employee Name:&nbsp; Unique Identifier</p>
<p>Email:&nbsp; Unique Identifier</p>
<p>Reports To:&nbsp; Supervisor&nbsp; (This is what is causing the problem, as many Employees report to the same supervisor)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After progressing through a few wizard screens I get the following Error:</p>
<p>Organizational Chart Wizard Error</p>
<p>Invalid Data:</p>
<p>Eliminate duplicates in the column (Field) that uniquely identifies each record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to I get around this error.&nbsp; If I do not include the reports to, then how does Visio know what the org chart should look like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is normal that multiple employees have a same Reports To manager in the Organization and Visio 2016 can import the data properly to Org Chart.<br />
<br />
In your scenario, please confirm if there are other duplicated items in your Excel file. For example, one employee reports to multiple supervisors. If you only have three columns in your Excel file, please check the Employee Name and Email column, make sure
 they are not duplicated in EXCEL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Winni Liang</p>

    <title>Stop Save Prompt Showing Up For Macros - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bradhalliday  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop Save Prompt Showing Up For Macros</h2>
                    <p>Here's an overview of what I'm trying to do and what I've accomplished:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A client of ours has a letterhead macro that they need to change every once in a while. What I would like to do is have one version that I can change centrally and then share with everyone else. Clients are not technology oriented so automated is a must.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've done:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a blank document, applied the required macro to the document, saved it as a .DOTM (macro-enabled template) and popped it into the %appdata%\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP folder. When I open up Word, this automatically makes the macro available
 and everything works properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to close word, it asks me if I want to save changes to the macro .DOTM. I need this pop-up to go away so that clients aren't confused by it (trust me, they will be).</p>

            <p>That message should not appear unless the macro is doing something that modifies the template (not just the documents that the macro worked on). The most likely way that could happen is if the macro refers to "ThisDocument" when it should refer to "ActiveDocument"
 -- the keyword ThisDocument always returns the template or document that contains the running macro code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails, you could try putting this statement at the end of the macro:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ThisDocument.Saved = True</p>
<p>
</p><p>which tells Word that the template is not "dirty" so no save is needed.</p>

            Since you're new here I advise you to go to the connectivity page. You will find a lot of topics there about your problem.

</p><p>Does anybody know how can I send an email from a shared mailbox so that external recipients will see a display name?</p>
<p>I tried creating a shared mailbox with the same user ID as a primary SMTP address, for that mailbox a gave a desired display name in exchange online, but still when I send email to external recipients, they only see primary smtp, no display name.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
</span>Please provide more information before we proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-When you say 'back-up drive' does it network location or local drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>-What type of email account is configured in Outlook? Is it POP3, IMAP, Exchange Active Sync or Microsoft Exchange Server email account?</span></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>This message could occur if The .pst file where Outlook delivers your e-mail messages is located on a server that is unavailable or PST file is corrupted. If you are working on domain network and PST file is saved on sever or network drive this issue could
 arise.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope the above information helps. Try the suggestions and let me know the result at your earliest convenience.<br />

            <p>If the archive pst's are connected to MS Outlook, when you start MS Outlook at some other location and these Archive file are not then connected Outlook will threw up that error.</p>
<p>The Only way round it is either remove the archive files from MS Outlook, or create a second Outlook Profile in which the Archives are not connected, and set prompt for Profile so the correct profile is loaded depending on location.</p>
<p>Of course it depends on whether your contacts/calendar etc are stored in the IMAP data file, as to whether you will lose these when you switch profiles</p>
<p>PS Its not a terribly good idea to have a backup usb drive connected during any win boot or shutdown</p>

            Again - this exact condition has been used for over three years with Outlook 2010 and it did not throw the error. &nbsp;There has to be a way to correct.

            You are mistaken, if an Archive or any data file is connected in any version of Outlook, if outlook is started and it cannot locate the path to that data file outlook will threw an error and will not start.<br />

            Yes. This is a bug in Word and Outlook 2016. In 2013 version, it works perfectly all right.
<br />
<br />On this below thread, one user João PauloMoraes has posted a solution which may work or may not work. Since the work around is long, hence you have to decide whether it is worth doing it or not.

            Just to be clear, import into a new&nbsp;Identity. Account is the email account.&nbsp;Identity stores all your accounts and data.
<div><br />
<div>Open&nbsp;Outlook with the Option key held down. This open the Database Utility.</div>
<div>Create &nbsp;a new&nbsp;Identity and set as default under the gear in the bottom of the window.</div>
<div>Import the .olm file into the new&nbsp;Identity.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If this works, see this article on moving your other data into the new&nbsp;Identity.</div>

            And after you reinstalled Office 2011 (which shouldn't have been necessary and Diane emphasized), you need to make sure you re-update all the way to 14.3.8.

            <p>Exporting and importing your pst-file isn't the way to backup and restore your pst-file. You should take the original pst-file and copy it&nbsp;to a safe location. To restore it, copy it back and&nbsp;reconnect it via; File-&gt; Open-&gt; Open Outlook Data File...</p>
<p>If you do not have the original pst-file and reconnecting to your exported pst-file doesn't show you Contacts in any of the Contacts folder, then you did not include them in your export.</p>

<h2>            Problems displaying text in Excel Web App</h2>
                    <br />
I am working in the Excel web app.&nbsp; I get inconsistent results with text cells: some display normally, while in others the text is too tiny to read.&nbsp; The cells appear to be formatted the same (Wrap Text).&nbsp; If I double-click on the tiny cells I can read the
 text.&nbsp; In yet other text cells, the text runs into the next cell to the right (even though it is formatted as wrap text).<br />

            I found this problem as well and could only get contents to reappear if &nbsp;I removed the text wrap on the particular cell. &nbsp;Like circus magic, it brought everything back into view. &nbsp;If I find more on the cause, I'll post here.
