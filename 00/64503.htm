<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this to our attention and we appreciate the efforts made to resolve your camera issue with Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you considered performing a system restore? This option takes your Surface back to an earlier point in time. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a restore point manually</a></strong>. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers,
 and updates installed after the restore point was made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press and hold (or right-click) the <strong>Start</strong>&nbsp; button, and then select
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
2. Search <strong>Control Panel</strong> for <strong>Recovery</strong>.<br />
3. Select <strong>Recovery</strong> &gt; <strong>Open System Restore</strong> &gt;<strong> Next</strong>.<br />
4. Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select
<strong>Next</strong> &gt;<strong> Finish</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this workaround resolves the issue. Cheers.</p>
        </p>

<p>For whatever reason, system restore was off so no restore points.&nbsp; I never turned it off, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it has NEVER WORKED since purchase, I'm not sure restoring would have fixed the problem.</p>

    <title>1 email account and 2 computers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terry_tj  say:</h3>
<h2>            1 email account and 2 computers</h2>
                    <p>
Let me explain my situation. I have an 86 year old uncle who knows Vista. I got him another computer for the upstairs with Win 7 since they look pretty much alike. He has Windows Mail on his Vista machine set up as POP3 - Gmail &amp; Roadrunner. He wants to be
 able to look at his email also on the 7 machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Here is my problem. If I switch it to IMAP, he will have 2 different inboxes and that will confuse him. I tried to get him to use the web interface for Gmail but he only got confused. And having them both on POP3, he will have different emails on different
 systems because they will be marked read and the other computer will not download them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Here is what I would like to do but I don't know if it is possible or if it will l work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I would like to have his Win 7 machine network into his Vista Windows Mail file. The problem I see with this is I don't know if the file can handle 2 programs reading and writing from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If it isn't the same as what he already knows, I am going to have to be remoting in to both computers all the time, try to show him what to do. I live about 1/2 hour away from him, so it isn't like I can just run over there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I am asking this for my sanity, he can't learn anything new, so I am trying to make the best out of the situation and not jump off a roof.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thanks</p>

            <p>You need to install Windows Live Mail (WLM) 2012 in both computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WLM is no longer supported by Microsoft, but that is actually good in some ways.&nbsp; You can still find it at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_windows_live_mail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_windows_live_mail/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; WLM is part of something called Windows Live Essentials.&nbsp; Installing WLM 2012 in the Vista machine will automatically port his Windows
 Live Mail data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WLM has its roots in Outlook Express (XP).&nbsp; Outlook Express was revised and improved to become Windows Mail in Vista.&nbsp; Windows Mail was revised and improved to become WLM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gmail will require you to drop two-factor authentication to allow imap or pop3.</p>

            <p>Here's an easy solution for him. Install the free TeamViewer </p>
<p>(https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/) for him on both computers. Have him continue to use the downstairs computer to run Windows Mail and have the upstairs computer&nbsp; run the downstairs computer's Windows Mail using TeamViewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also want to install TeamViewer on your own computer, so if he has any problems (with this or anything else) you can show him what to do while on a voice telephone call with you. I do this with several friends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And by the way, 86 isn't that old. He's just a few years older than me. I'm 79.</p>

            <p>I have Teamviewer on all of his machines so I can log in to them when he is having a problem. I tried to show him it but he got confused. He doesn't want anything changed at all, he wants everything the way it was. That's the hard part.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know age doesn't matter but how the mind works does. And the fun thing is he wanted another TV and the stupid cable company gave him a Roku, not a converter box. He can't figure out Gmail's web interface, how is he going to understand a Roku.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi.&nbsp; I am an IT guy too. Or, I should say was.&nbsp; That was years ago.&nbsp; I share your dislike for networking stuff.&nbsp; By coincidence, like Ken, I am 79 too.&nbsp;
<em><strong>Hi Ken</strong></em>!&nbsp; A lot of my clients are elderly like your dad, so I do this for them just like you do for your dad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WLM is not drastically different from Outlook, but simpler to use.&nbsp; One of the principle reasons a lot of my elderly clients use WLM is because they found webmail too confusing and it keeps changing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ken has a good idea.&nbsp; Take a look at Teamviewer first.&nbsp; Read about it.&nbsp; Teamviewer is a remote control technology.&nbsp; You can login to the other computer and operate it as if you were sitting in front of it.&nbsp; I do
<strong>not </strong>use Teamviewer, but I use Logmein which is a great program, but not free.&nbsp; I use it to look after my 150 client computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last I heard, for just one or two computers, Teamviewer was free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Ken said, it would also allow <strong>you </strong>to remotely look into the systems and make changes/updates as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the great things about Logmein, and I presume Teamviewer as well, is that when a person has a question or cannot understand something, you can speak to them on the phone while you watch them operate the computer and then explain the mistake or the
 message or even show him how.&nbsp; It is actually a great way to train.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can call the folks at Teamviewer and they will likely help you, but you will find loads of stuff on Google too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no networking stuff to worry about. You install a program on the two computers, then you can remotely login.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You make one of the computers the main one which has Windows Live Mail, then the other needs nothing much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need detailed help on WLM, I can provide that for you.&nbsp; About half my clients use it and so do I.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to summarize, </p>
<ul>
<li>choose one computer as the main.&nbsp; </li><li>Install WLM on it.&nbsp; You only need the mail program on the main computer.</li><li>Install Teamviewer on it</li><li>I don't know if you need to install anything on the remote computer.&nbsp; With Logmein, I use a Internet Explorer-based program that is simply online.</li><li>Your dad will need to learn how to use WLM, but that should be quite easy because it is very much like Windows Mail.&nbsp; He will also need to learn how to remotely login to the main computer.</li></ul>

            Terry, you could make this really simple for him.&nbsp; You could simply have him use the Win7 machine as a Team Viewer remote to the Vista machine.&nbsp; The only thing he would have to learn is how to use Team Viewer to log in from the new Win7 machine to the
 Vista one.

            <p>How much email does he get?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you can do with POP3 accounts is configure the client to leave the mail on the server (at least, you can do this in Thunderbird and I assume that all POP3 clients provide a similar option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This way, each computer will download all the mail that has been received at the server since the last login by that computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only downside to this is that if a lot of email is coming in and the account doesn't have a large maximum for the server's Inbox, the server's Inbox will fill up and start bouncing incoming mail.&nbsp; You could deal with that by periodically logging in to
 each computer, downloading email on both machines to sync them, and then deleting everything from the server.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was pretty standard behavior for people with multiple computers before IMAP became popular.&nbsp; See, e.g.,

</p><p>I use TB on 3 computers with five Pop3 accounts. No need to logon to the mail server, just set each on to keep the mail for X days and then delete from the server. WLMail has that feature too, just worded a little different.</p>

</blockquote>
==================================<br />
If you are having a problem viewing an AVI file...<br />
converting to the WMV format might be worth <br />
a try:<br />
<br />
There are many converters available on the net...<br />
some free, some retail...the following freeware&nbsp; <br />
is just one example:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Freemake Free Video Converter (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 )<br />
(***Carefully read *all* the install screens...there <br />
may be some items you want to uncheck***)<br />
<br />
When you have Freemake installed...open Freemake <br />
and drag/drop your video files on the main screen. <br />
<br />
Or...Left click the Video button and Browse to the <br />
folder your video files are saved in. <br />
<br />
Select (highlight) the files you wish to import into <br />
Freemake and left click the "Open" button.<br />
<br />
When your video files are imported into Freemake,<br />
Left click the WMV icon at the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
The "WMV Output Parameters" screen will open.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Choose a "Save To" folder so you can find the <br />
converted files.<br />
<br />
Left click the "Convert" button and wait for the files <br />
to be converted.<br />
<br />
That should do it...<br />
<br />

<h2>            windows installer box keeps popping up and then disappearing</h2>
                    <p>I have recently noticed that a windows installer box keeps popping up with "preparing to install"&nbsp;and then disappearing suddenly every five minutes or so on my laptop. I am unsure whether this is linked to my laptop installing windows updates the other day
 -&nbsp;&nbsp;the power ran out just before all of the relevant updates were installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been to my control panel and have tried to click on the icon "windows update" however it does not come up with anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as it is starting to get very annoying whilst trying to write an essay!</p>

    <title>Issues with Windows Explorer search for filenames, not sure what&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom cramer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Windows Explorer search for filenames, not sure what&#39;s wrong</h2>
                    <p>Can't figure this one out, and running the Windows search troubleshooter found no issues.<br />
<br />
Network share \\server\share\archive has a folder hierarchy like so:<br />
<br />
2014<br />
2015<br />
2016<br />
<br />
Inside each folder is more folders, say 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004 etc.<br />
<br />
Inside those folders are files, and here's two examples:<br />
0001_2016-02-12 XXX 01 Thing.pdf<br />
0009_2015-12-31 XXX 02 2016 Something.pdf<br />
<br />
If I open Windows Explorer, go to the path \\server\share\archive, and search for "2016-02-12" in the search box in the upper right, guess which file shows up.<br />
</p>
<p>Only "0009_2015-12-31 XXX 02 2016 Something.pdf" shows up.<br />
<br />
Now if I search for "_2016-02-12", both the above named files show in the search results.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get search to work properly here? It seems to be finding the second file because it contains 12, 02, and 2016, but yet it's not finding the filename that has 2016-02-12 all inline in the name.</p>

            <p>As a followup, I copied all the files to my local C:\ drive, and tried the search again.&nbsp; Same issue as above.&nbsp; Also verified a coworkers Windows 7 machine had the same issue, which it did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have access to a personal Windows 10 machine, and found that it searches and finds the expected files. Where do I need to go to report this as a bug and hope for an update to Windows 7 to fix this issue?</p>

            <p>Try specifying the property being searched (the file name) with the word "file" or "filename".&nbsp; Those will enforce order of search text, while "name" does not, regardless of quoting the search text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>file:"_2016-02-12"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that on my Windows 7 machine, searching with quotes only and not specifying "file" will fail to search for hyphens as&nbsp;specific symbols (rather than as equivalent to&nbsp;mere spaces) when the files that would be found are in non-indexed areas.&nbsp; Files
 in indexed areas are successfully searched, regarding&nbsp;the hyphens, no matter if "file" is specified or not.</p>

            <p>It looks like prepending "2016-02-12" with file: or filename: still won;t find the files with that exact text in their filename. It does properly exclude the 2015 file though. Using the "_2016-02-12" with file: or filename: works to find the desired files,
 so it looks like the modifier isn't impacting this much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still having a hard time finding where I can file a bug about this issue. This site: http://connect.microsoft.com/directory/windows/ appears to indicate only Windows Server, Media Center, and Powershell groups are accepting bugs.</p>

<p>file:~="2016-02-12"</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for reporting bugs, I don't know if MS have ever changed anything about the Windows 7 search function ever. (Heck, there is a Notepad word wrap bug that hasn't been fixed since it first showed up in&nbsp;Windows XP.)&nbsp; I've read that MS are only sending security
 updates now, in addition to weird mysterious&nbsp;telemetry software and Windows 10 files, for Windows 7.&nbsp; I'll leave it to others who know better to respond.</p>

<h2>            Error 7 Windows error 193 when installing iTunes</h2>
                    I have windows 7 on a 64 bit computer.&nbsp; The Apple Mobile Device service won't start and it reports error 1053.&nbsp; I've run all the diagnostic scans I can find and remember and downloaded all the updates.&nbsp; My computer reports that there are no more updates.&nbsp;
 The problem seems to be with Microsoft .Net Framework.&nbsp; The current version is 4.5 and iTunes wants 4.0.&nbsp; The problems seems to have occurred with the latest update to iTunes because the program ran fine with the 4.5 version of .Net but came up short with
 4.5.&nbsp; Anyone figure out what to do?<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Step-by-Step:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Hit Win-R to open a "Run" input, and type "shell:Appsfolder"</p>
<p>
</p><p>- When in that, hit F-10 to get a menu bar, and from that menu bar select "View / Choose Details"</p>
<p>- Select the radio box for "AppUserModelID". That ID is what you are going to want to execute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Select "Details" from the little "View" gadget" on the right hand side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"shell:Appsfolder\"+AppUserModelID found in the right column&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So for my application the result is "shell:Appsfolder\Microsoft.MicrosoftMinesweeper_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App"</p>

<p><span>Bingo!!! Shawn "Cmdr" Keene, this is absolutely the solution I have been searching for for hours and days. If anyone with Windows 10 Home and maybe other versions follows these 5 steps, you will have
 success. Granted, after step 5 is done there are still some things to do on the computer to activate all the features of OneDrive. But, this is the only solution I know of.</span></p>
<p>I judge that the biggest roadblock for me was that I could not get a successful uninstall of OneDrive program from the Control Panel | Programs and Features. Because of that, a new download of
 OneDrive set up worked fine BUT there was always an error in installing a new OneDrive setup......something like, "you already have a new version of OneDrive installed". For some reason, the 1st two steps above and specifically using appwiz.cpl location to
 uninstall OneDrive vs. using the Programs and Features location of the OneDrive program listing......was the ticket! Within seconds, I had OneDrive uninstalled and was on the way to reinstalling the new OneDrive download.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you a thousand times!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Can someone tell me where I can download&nbsp; Windows Essentials 2009.&nbsp; I do not like any of the later version, which&nbsp;do not allow&nbsp;forwarding embedded photos.&nbsp; Ihave downloaded and reinstalled Windows Essentials 2009 on my laptop which uses Windows 7 64 bit
 OS.&nbsp; But when I attempt to download Windows Essentials 2009, and install it on my desktop computer, I get a message telling me that the file contained a virus and was deleted by m Norton Security Suite Virus protection program.&nbsp; This happens even when I download
 from the Microsoft site.&nbsp; I need help from someone who can tell m where I can get a clean copy of Windows Essentials 2009.&nbsp; Can anyone who may be monitoring this give me some guidance?</p>

I had Windows Esentials 2012 installed (which was the version I uninstalled to try to find and locate, and install&nbsp;2009), and uninstalled it because when I attempted to forward emails with an embedded photos, the program could not locate the photos.&nbsp; This never
 happened to me &nbsp;with 2009.<br />

            Are you quite sure of both those things - that you downloaded from the Microsoft site, and that it was Norton that deleted the file you downloaded?<br />
<br />
You can download the full installer (for XP) from this page: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-install-offline-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How do I install Windows Essentials while offline?</a>&nbsp;The file is called <strong>
wlsetup-all.exe.<br />
<br />
There are nasty viruses around that block downloads and report that 'the file contained a virus and was deleted'. This effectively prevents the affected user from downloading the disinfectant he needs to use.

            OK. I find it exceedingly unlikely that there was in fact anything malicious in the download, and I'm sure Microsoft would want to know about it. Does Norton give you the opportunity of reporting such events?
<br />
<br />
Can you share the URL of the site you downloaded from? If you use Internet Explorer, Ctrl-J will show you your latest downloads unless you've cleared the list. Right-click on the file name to copy the download link.

This is the site that I went to to download Windows Live Essentials 2009 (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx</a>,) but received the&nbsp; message that the file contained a virus and was deleted.&nbsp; I also
 went to that site to attempt to reinstall Windows Live Essentials 2012, which I had previously uninstalled in my attempt to revert to&nbsp;the 2009 version 14.&nbsp; But when downloading version 2012, I also received the message that the file contained a virus and was
 deleted.

            <p>Right. It's looking more and more as if you have caught a bad infection. Please try downloading again, and this time write down exactly what the window looks like with the message about the file containing a virus. Better still, capture a screenshot of the
 message and post it in your reply. Let's get this out of the way before facing the WLE challenge again.

<div>I've had 16 calls from tech support over 6 days.&nbsp; I've reinstalled, reset, rebooted many many times.</div>

            <p>No need to buy Windows 10 if you already have it installed. A couple of questions+advices:</p>
<ul>
<li>You said&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><em>&gt;I can't access the internet without logging in to my pc laptop.</em></p>
<p>You need to log in to your account to get to the desktop and then use Edge/IE/Chrome etc to access the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Then coming to the first one:</li></ul>
<div><em>&gt;I can't login to windows 10 without accessing the internet.</em></div>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Is your account an MS account?</li><li>You said you have reinstalled windows, so did you do a clean Install?&nbsp;</li><li>Can you access the desktop with Internet?</li></ol>

            <p>Hi, thanks,</p>
<p>No, I can't access the desktop.&nbsp; When I try to log in to my laptop I get the message “this device is offline.&nbsp; Please login using the last password used on this device”</p>
<p>I have been told to fix this I need to log in while connected to the internet...but they don't seem to understand I need to log in to access the internet.</p>
<p>Everything was fine until I made the mistake of installing the anniversary update.&nbsp; To be honest, I don’t even know what version I have now, it's been reinstalled so many times.<br />

            Hi Bettina.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Check for a newer Display driver on the HP Support Downloads webpage for your model.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to update, including BIOS, Chipset, Sound, Network, USB3, Bluetooth and all others.  Compare to the one present installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu..  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Usually this happens if its display ribbon thats damaged. You can try connecting an external monitor to see if it goes away 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.

    <title>All my files and folders have become read-only and cannot be changed. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris-park  say:</h3>
<h2>            All my files and folders have become read-only and cannot be changed.</h2>
                    
<p>All of a sudden all my files have become read-only.&nbsp; I discovered the problem when trying to rotate a picture in photo gallery or through exploere.&nbsp; I received the message "Couldn't rotate ...... it might be read-only or in a location that is unavailable"
 OR "You cannot rotate this image. The file might be in use or open in another program, or the file or folder might be read-only".&nbsp; I have checked the permissions and the read-only box is ticked, but if I untick this and apply (to either the file or folder)
 then it does its business but automatically defaults back to read-only.&nbsp; I have run a virus scan (Kaspersky) and ran Malwarebytes and both are clean.</p>
<p>Please can someone help me.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<span><span><span>Chris-Park,</span></span></span>
<p><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Answers Community. Let’s try a couple of different things:</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the file or folder, and then click
<span><strong>Properties</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<span><strong>Security</strong></span> tab.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click a user name or group under
<span><strong>Group or user names</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>The permissions for the selected user or group are shown in the lower portion of the properties dialog box.</span></span></p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>To view or to remove the Read-only or the System attributes of folders in Windows Vista or Windows 7</strong></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>cmd</strong>, and then press ENTER..
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>To view the syntax for the
<strong>Attrib</strong> command, type <strong>attrib /?</strong> at the command prompt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To remove the Read-only attribute and to set the System attribute, use the following command:<strong>
</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>attrib -r +s drive:\&lt;path&gt;\&lt;foldername&gt;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>For example, to remove the Read-only attribute and to set the System attribute for the C:\Test folder, use the following
 command: </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>attrib -r +s c:\test</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Be aware that some programs may not operate correctly with folders for which the System attribute and the Read-only
 attribute are set. Therefore, use the following command to remove these attributes:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>attrib -r -s drive:\&lt;path&gt;\&lt;foldername&gt;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>For example, to remove both the Read-only and the System attributes from the C:\Test folder, use the following command:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>attrib -r -s c:\test</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the
<strong>Run</strong> command is not listed on the <strong>Start</strong> menu, do the following:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, and then click
<strong>Run</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please let me know if you continue to experience the problem. *more information is included in

    <title>Windows 10 Professional Sound Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevemongkut  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Professional Sound Problem</h2>
                    <p>I have a new computer running Windows 10 Professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 Pro 64Bit Eng Intl 1pk DSP OEI DVD</p>
<p>Build Date 09/22/15</p>
<p>(More data available from package if anyone is interested)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has received automatic updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a Realtek sound system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was working well yesterday morning, then it fell silent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the various solutions on the internet and and am currently staring at</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-sound-problems#v1h=tab01</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done all the things recommended and checked the connections and looked at the drivers. &nbsp;Troubleshooter reports 'issue not present' in all cases. &nbsp;First, I would like confirmation that 'issue not present' means 'no problem found' in international English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, what is the use of providing help for sound videos with audio content? &nbsp;Yes, I went to another computer - but this is a case of the deaf speaking to the deaf from behind a blue screen. &nbsp;Spell it out in written words and sign language if need be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do next? &nbsp;I could write a haiku about silence but that won't get my sound back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help, please, would be most gratefully appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Work through either the POP or the&nbsp;IMAP section at <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/troubleshooter/1668960?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.google.com/mail/troubleshooter/1668960?hl=en</a></p>
<p>to verify that your settings are correct. Specific instructions for Windows Live Mail are not provided, but the instructions for Windows Mail will work.</p>
<p>(Note:&nbsp;I prefer POP over IMAP, but not everyone does.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another note: I just helped someone setup POP Gmail with Windows Live Mail in Windows 10 and had to use the "Allow less secure apps to access your account" option.</p>

<p>I did ask to see the entire error message - it includes valuable clues to what might be wrong as well as telling us which account settings you're using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, that error code usually indicates a DNS fault. When you've been through the business of allowing less secure apps as Don suggested, please compose a new test message with a unique subject and use the Gmail account to send it to the same address.
 When you see the error message, can click on it to select it, then use right-click to copy it and paste it into your reply.

    <title>Cannot delete old user folders - Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> perplexed user99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot delete old user folders - Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I realise many questions on this theme have been asked, but none have been answered, so here goes nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To send my computer away for a hardware fix, I backed up my profile and deleted it from the computer using the user account tool.&nbsp; I was logged in as the administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my computer came back, I recreated my profile and copied all my documents and settings over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because my old profile folder was emptied, not deleted, the new profile has a different name.&nbsp; Let's call them Michelle and MichelleNew.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set my default file location to c://users/michellenew/documents (if the slashes are the wrong way around forgive me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I open or save as in Office (2010), I get an error message saying the file location cannot be found:</p>
<p>c://users/michelle/skydrive blah blah</p>
<p>
</p><p>hm, I thought this stupid thing is still looking at my old profile and I can't see how to change it.&nbsp; Perhaps someone knows how to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what I tried was deleting my profile with the user account tool and deleting both folders ie michelle and michellenew.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am logged in as the administrator, but the clever little machine says I need permission from someone called Administrators - there isn't and have never been such a profile on the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read a million sites, including this one and spoke to a Microsoft Live Helper (who thought it was helpful to sell me a 'plan' so I can pay MS to fix the problem they caused) - no one has an answer.&nbsp; I have tried the things that I can understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have tried to stop sharing, but it won't let me (it says that administrators own the folder and I can't change that)</li><li>I have added the correct administrator profile with full control to the security tab of the users properties dialogue</li><li>I have removed 'administrators' from the same tab</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I still get the same error message:</p>
<p>You'll need to provide administrator permission to delete this folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hit continue with the little shield, it doesn't ask for my details, it briefly shows the funky little deleting chart and then says</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need permission to perform this action</p>
<p>
</p><p>You require permission from Administrators to make changes to this folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>help, I can't keep having the stupid skydrive error message every time I open or save as a document (word, excel and powerpoint).&nbsp; This also affects my partner and if you think I am being grumpy about it, you should hear the ear ache I am getting from him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michelle</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Problem reinstalling a yahoo email to Windows 8 mail</h2>
                    For the past week I have not received any yahoo emails on windows 8 mail.&nbsp; It wanted me to update settings and password. I reset and changed password and verified IMAP data. I then deleted the yahoo email and am now not able to reinstall it back to the
 mail app.&nbsp; I also deleted the windows 8 mail app and reinstall it hoping that might solve the problem. I still get the same error telling me that it can't find the settings for the email account and I am unable to install yahoo mail. Any ideas? The yahoo email
 account&nbsp; works find in my iphone and signing on direct with internet.

<br />
To get better clarity on the issue, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where did you get the server settings for your Yahoo account?</li><li>Have you tried to set up a different account on the Mail app? Did you get the same error?</li></ul>
<p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            I got the server info from the offical Yahoo website but check a few other sites and all verify the same information. I only have one email I use so I did not try another email account.

                    <p>I just purchased this on the Windows store to play on my Xbox One.&nbsp; I was hoping to play it while my kid is in school tomorrow but I saw after purchasing that the release date and time states September 29, 2017 2pm. Is that on Windows or on the Xbox One too? I am in Ireland so 2pm&nbsp;will be 6am PT I guess.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Login - Endless Loop after Password&#47;Passcode Entered from Lock Screen</h2>
                    <p>For a couple of weeks now, and after the computer has been unused for a period of time and is has been locked, on re-entering either the&nbsp;password (Live account) or passcode, the credentials are accepted but I just get the spinning graphic on the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to reset the computer&nbsp;is to do a hard reboot in which case everything works fine until I lock the computer again.</p>

            <p>Hi Sharon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to ask for some more information, so we can properly isolate the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you also having an issue in printing out your Office documents (e.g. Word, Excel, Powerpoint)?</li><li>Or, is the issue isolated on Adobe InDesign only?</li></ul>
<p>We will wait for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

            <p>It seems to only be InDesign that has the printing issue. I haven't noticed it otherwise. I don't do lots of printing so I don't know about ALL my other apps. &nbsp;I just did a retest and: Word DOES work fine (I got an update so things may have changed. I rechecked
 InDesign with the new update and everything SEEMS to be fine now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>

            BUT, it never clears out the last doc from the print queue. It still says "Printing" after the print job is finished. THEN it hangs after I close and restart InDesign. Now I have two jobs in the print queue, the first one (on the top of the list) is the
 latest one that didn't print and the bottom one is the last successful print job is still there with a status of "Printing". And at this point, nothing (Word) doesn't print either. I am also unable to clear the print queue. I can kill the two unsuccessful
 jobs, but the last job that printed won't clear.&nbsp;

            ...Then, about five minutes later, a third, new InDesign doc prints but not the last doc (Word), and the second InDesign job from the first go-around is still there saying "Error - Sent to printer" and the job that printed after 5 minutes still says "Printing".

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Praashant,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fix this problem yourself, remove the download directory, and then visit the update locations again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. - Stop the Automatic Updates service. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>a.Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>Run</b>, type <b><i>services.msc</i></b>, and then click
<b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>b.Right-click the <b>Automatic Updates</b> service, and then click <b>Stop</b>.</p>
<p>c.Minimize the Services snap-in.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. - Rename the SoftwareDistribution directory. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>a.Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>Run</b>, type <b><i>cmd</i></b>, and then click
<b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>b.Type <b><i>cd %windir%</i></b>, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>c.Type <b><i>ren SoftwareDistribution SDTemp</i></b>, and then press ENTER</p>
<p>d.Type <b><i>exit</i></b>, and then press ENTER . </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Note</b> When you remove the %windir%\softwaredistribution folder, the history list is erased from the "Review your Updates" section of the Windows Update Web site. This action will not affect the currently installed updates on your computer. Subsequent
 updates will appear in the history list. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. - Start the Automatic Updates service. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>a.Maximize the Services snap-in.</p>
<p>b.Right-click the <b>Automatic Updates</b> service, and then click <b>Start</b>.</p>
<p>c.Close the Services snap-in window.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. - Visit the Windows Update Web site, the Microsoft Update Web site, or the WSUS server again, and then download an update.</p>
<p>5. - If you still receive the same errors, verify that you have correctly performed steps 1 through 3.</p>
<p>6. - If you still cannot install the update, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
