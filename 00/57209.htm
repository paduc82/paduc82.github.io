<h2>            My computer&#39;s volume gets quiet even at max volume for no apparent reason.</h2>
                    Sometimes for no reason my computer's volume tanks and I can't figure out why. I'll turn the main volume up but nothing changes, and I'll turn up the volume of what I'm listening to (It's more than one program this happens to so it's not the program's
 issue but I mostly listen to Netflix or talk on Skype).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Eventually it corrects itself but it's very, very quiet to the point where I can't hear who I'm talking to, and have to turn on subtitles on Netflix.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't know anything about computers, could this be my sound card going bad or something?</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Trying to download update DTMB Software - Streaming Media and Broadcast Devices - DTMB BDA TV USB Error code 800F020B</h2>
                    <p>Just bought a Rabbit TV to see how it would work finding internet tv content. When I inserted the key into the USB port mircrosoft errored out and wouldn't allow the download form Rabbit. Microsoft Updater showed an optional update file a few days later.
 I tried twice to install update, but above error code showed up. After two times Microsoft updater moved the file to faile to install and will not allow me to try again. I would appreciate any answer to the error code or similiar issues with Rabbit TV. I have
 a ROKU box that works perfectly so imagine its an issue with using the key in the USB port.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I connected the device to the USB port and rebooted the computer after downloading the file. When I click on the Rabbit TV start the following comes up. I submitted this to Microsoft and that is when I was sent the driver update for DTMB. Not sure how to
 fix this problem. Rabbit TV customer service is no help, blaiming it on my security software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Xbox Security</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so I did a stupid thing not to long ago and used the same password on another site as my xbox, it got hacked, they got my password, then they used it to login to my xbox. (everything there has been taken care of)<br />
<br />
I know, I know...laziness getting the best of me.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I want to beef up my security, I have second sign-in on my gmail, steam is now linked to my machine, I have facebook on the same way...pretty much every site I could I made it so that even if I did get a keylogger and someone has my password that they can't
 get on it.<br />
<br />
I have looked through the security features for xbox, but there is nothing that links an account to a specific xbox only, or a way (that I can tell) to use SMS verification.<br />
so even with the new password, if I login and I have a keylogger, they can still get on my account and try to do things.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>they can't verify any changes as my gmail would require them to have the password and sms verification.</p>
<p>now, for my questions.</p>

<p>does xbox offer ANYTHING to prevent people from logging onto my xbox live profile on anything but my Xbox and or registered xbox's?<br />
also is there a SMS verification feature for &nbsp;live.com as well?<br />
another option, would is to have verification required for any purchase, because I can always recover my account, the only thing I want to do is secure my credit card.&nbsp;</p>

<p>no ther eisn't sms login thats impossible as sms doesn't allow for interactive login where it asks you questions and you answer immediately</p>
<p>SMS is not an app nor can it login into servers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is however secure mobile phone and secure pc options</p>
<p>with those 2 enabled &nbsp;you can only reset your password via the specific pc (hopefully if you sell it you know to erase all personal data and update your reset settings at live.com)</p>
<p>and also by mobile phone via sms</p>

<p>I know there isn't SMS login, but there is indeed SMS verification, where they send you a text with a unique ID for that time to verify that the person logging in has that phone in their possession, much like an email verifies that you have the email account
 in your possession.</p>
<p>I have considered the secure PC, but I really don't want to install the microsoft Essentials or whatever it requires you to have, no biggie, just thought I'd ask.</p>

<p>not ms essentials</p>
<p>if i were you</p>
<p>a 2 way firewall like ms firewall or zonealarm and a good free antivirus like adaware and avast</p>
<p>btw JAVA is the worst security hole ever</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>make sure you update it</p>
<p>thats how most worms and malware get installed and yes i got infected after clicking no no update and i had a funny security essentials replaced by some pc security program</p>
<p>luckily i restored</p>
<p>and yes you can never be too careful</p>

<p>I already have zone alarm and ESET NOD32, I am well aware of those, but nothing is 100% I update regularly and I am very computer savvy, but as a programmer I know programs have holes and a keylogger only needs one exploit, but it would be a nice security
 feature to have sms verification, I just feel all warm and cozy inside when I know they need my phone to even login.</p>
<p>I pretty much have my answer, I am not missing anything they don't have SMS verification, nor do they have the option to verify payments via email.</p>
<p>thanks, I asked because I want to be more careful than I already trying to be :-)</p>

<p>yea, all of this is pretty standard, don't be dumb on the net, I only used the same pass for my game consoles, not thinking about people using my card to buy points and transfer it, my questions wasn't how to be secure, but if certain security features existed.</p>
<p>all good suggestions.</p>

<h2>            Trying to downgrade Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    Hey guys I had Windows 7 and went through the Microsoft site to upgrade to Windows 10. It gave me Windows 10 Pro edition and had some activation issues. I bought Windows 10 home from a retail store and have tried to downgrade the pro to home edition and
 no matter what I do it just keeps installing the pro version through the usb. How do I change it to home edition?

 happen and I just don't have time to spend hours on the phone with Tech Support... Thanks!

            <p>I can't answer a question about "each app developer" but I know that CCleaner has the setting that determines whether it starts with Windows. If you can't find that setting on your own, Piriform's technical support can show you where to find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apps decide whether they start with Windows. Windows doesn't make that decision for third-party apps. It's one of the increasingly fewer instances where Windows
<em>does</em> mind its own business.</p>

<h2>            Play and Charge Kit - Orange LED not working&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I just bought one of these and plugged it in and noticed that the orange LED light is not working as it should. However, when I check the battery icon in the bottom right corner of the home page it shows that it is charging. Any ideas as to why the orange
 LED is not working? All cables are plugged in, and like I said, when I look at the battery icon it's showing the charging indicator so I'm confused.... I've read other posts to try and "press down" on the battery to see if that worked, but no, the light is
 not coming on. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I feel like it is charging though, since the indicator is showing me that. Help?</p>

 only a couple months.) &nbsp;After that, I bought the Energizer Charging Stand and the batteries lasted well over a couple years and they were still going even after I bought my Xbox One. &nbsp;I now have the Energizer stand for the XB1 and it is awesome. &nbsp;Comes with
 two rechargable batteries as well. &nbsp;It's only $30-35. &nbsp;Totally worth it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Crashes when playing FPS games</h2>
                    My current build is Windows 7 ultimate 64-bit<br />
<br />
whenever i play any FPS games online such as Alliance of Valiant arms, Combat Arms or Wolfteam the computer will crash after about 5-10 minutes of game play. so far I've updated all my drivers, direct x, my mobo bios, and everything else i could think of. I've
 tried running compatibility mode, and running as administrator as well, my UAC is disabled. I've tried running the games without my anti-virus enabled as well nothing works. All other games that i play online like mmos however keep working, i also run them
 on high spec. these games include STO, SUN, and Allods and LoL &lt;-- i can play these for hours without crashing but whenever i play an FPS my computer just dies and forces a restart.<br />
<br />
Any solution would be great.<br />
<br />
MY SPECS ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br />
Asus Maximus Furmula III<br />
Intel i7 860<br />
4 gigs kingston hyperx<br />
ATI radeon 5850<br />
<br />

<h2>            Shared Folders Not Accessible on Home Network after Windows update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 4 PCs on my Home Network: a Laptop running under win10 (64), a desktop running under Win 10 (64), 2 desktops running under Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before updating my Laptop and Desktop Win10 PCs, every PC could share their shared folders. Since the last Win 10 update, my Win10 Laptop can access all PCs on the Home Network but no PCs can access my Win 10 Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to access the Laptop, I get a warning indicating: "Windows cannot access
\\Laptop. Check the spelling…" OR "Windows cannot access
\\Laptop. You do not have permissions…" If I reinstall an old image, everything works fine, every PCs can share folders on the Network. However, as soon Windows makes an update, no PCs can access the Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I receive 2 different notifications for the same task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone guide me? It is not the first time I experience such problem, updates corrupting my Network settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advanced.</p>

    <title>Cannot Open Multiple Tabs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> corymoore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Open Multiple Tabs</h2>
                    Hello all,<br />
<br />
I don't know what the problem is but it has become more noticeable the more Windows 8 has updated.
<br />
<br />
The thing is when I attempt to open say.. Steam which has multiple tabs open(The software + Friend list + chat etc) It will not let me select it, it would act as if I was pressing a button, I've taken apart my keyboard and gave it a full clean in which I know
 the keyboard isn't at fault. This means That I cannot leave my mouse on which will display what the tabs are then left clicking them as they too would do the same, again with Alt+Tab function it would keep happening, it's getting to the point where I am getting
 frustrated as I cannot get back into some games(which are running 2 tabs) in which I would then have to restart the program).
<br />
<br />
I have noticed though that when a game is running full screen I can alt tab out etc happily, but on the desktop I cannot.
<br />
<br />
Anyone experiencing this? Before it would just be until I've left the computer on for so long or have a bunch of tabs open and now it does it permanently.
<br />

    <title>USB ports do not recognize anything plugged in. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denny221  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB ports do not recognize anything plugged in.</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Slimline Desktop 410-010 running Windows 10. After the auto update ran the last time, I notice that the computer does not recognize any external hard drives plugged in to it. It is if there is none plugged in at all. When I pull up File Explorer
 if doesn't list anything connected to USB ports. I first thought it was a bad external hard drive but tried all 3 that I have and it recognizes none of them.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. Friends have advised me to reload the USB drivers but I haven't a clue how to do this. I am a 76 yr. old user who basically pays bills and surfs news articles so I guess I would qualify as computer illiterate.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any assistance.</p>

            You could try opening control panel then system devices and see if there is a mark against the universal serial bus controllers. click on the side chevron to open the list of controllers and right click the one with the mark and choose update drivers then
 search automatically to see if this helps. You could also download Iobit drive booster free and see if that picks up anything wrong with your drivers.

<br />
<br />If you already have done that and it is still not working then try resetting windows store.
<br />Go to search and type command prompt, right click and select run as administrator.
<br />Then type the following.

            I checked to make sure my account was connected to windows and everything was good there so I used the command prompt and waited for the store to reset. Once it reset I rebooted my pc and tried to use the store again, still no buy option, does my account
 need to be updated?&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67475c9c-9389-470a-803d-3a82dc784526?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67475c9c-9389-470a-803d-3a82dc784526?upload=true" /></a>

                    <p>Hi Folks:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for any help you may be able to give!!&nbsp; I'm a real novice at asking for this type of help, so please, I do need your understanding and patience.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have searched the windows.com site,&nbsp;forums, and the web.&nbsp; All I have gotten is, sorry, your search
 has not revealed an answer.&nbsp; This problem exists on my wife's laptop, but only after she has used it for a time, and then lets it sit unused, again for a time.&nbsp; How long before this happens I can't say, because I usually notice it after she has gone to work.&nbsp;
 This has happened for the fifth or sixth time now.&nbsp; If we shut the laptop down, and then restart it, it runs with&nbsp;no problem, until it sits again.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked her what she has installed lately, and she says nothing.&nbsp; I can usually fix our PC issues, and
 have fixed "the blue screen of death" before, by finding answers on&nbsp;line, but no this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OS is fully updated&nbsp;Windows XP Home that came on the Acer 2310 laptop,&nbsp;but I'd love to get rid of it and use XP Pro, but....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do hope somebody out there can send me a solution, to fix this blue screen issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again, and have&nbsp;a super day</p>
<p>Claude</p>

    <title>Bluetooth keyboard does not work after update to windows creators. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth keyboard does not work after update to windows creators. ASUS  T100CHI 2 in 1</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>As I stated, the Bluetooth keyboard which comes with the device from the same manufacturer is not recognized.
</p>
<p>This was after the upgrade to windows creators, previously it worked fine. It should connect automatically at startup through Bluetooth, but it doesn't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Bluetooth radio works fine. I have paired other devices, like a phone , and others that don't require&nbsp; pairing&nbsp; like a Bluetooth headset without a hitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest driver from the manufacturer for the Bluetooth; for the keyboard&nbsp; I also checked the drivers and windows said they were up to date and working. I also did a chdsk, which was ok.</p>
<p>I tried pairing the keyboard&nbsp; in Bluetooth as in " add another device", but a dialog box showed up asking for a PIN and the system gave none.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to Control Panel -&gt;Device manager and the keyboard does not show up. It disappeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote to Asus costumer&nbsp; support asking for the keyboard driver, but they assumed Bluetooth and sent me that one. I guess because there have been a lot of issues with Bluetooth after the upgrade.</p>
<p>After downloading the Bluetooth driver from Asus (btw the install wizard said it did not make changes since&nbsp; the latest version was already installed)&nbsp; the keyboard was there in the device manager, manually I paired it, it did not work, and after that it
 was gone. I have not uninstalled it, so I imagine the drivers are there&nbsp; but not retrievable ( to my knowledge). I was told to install the driver in compatible mode, which I did not, since I don't see that there is a problem with the Bluetooth radio. (Besides
 I don't know&nbsp; how , and if it isn't broken, don't fix it! :) )</p>
<p>I have read that a lot of people have had problems with&nbsp; Bluetooth keyboards and mice after the creators update.</p>
<p>Please help, I use the keyboard a lot for work, and really miss it.</p>

<p>Thank you Anthony. &nbsp; I had done what you suggested before I asked the forums. The problem was not with Bluetooth because it worked fine with other Bluetooth devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately it appears that my laptop is incompatible with windows creators since the problems have gone from bad to worse. Initially it was Bluetooth, afterwards it was with the keyboard drivers, which Asus send me to download, which I did after uninstalling
 the original ones. When I went to install them (2) , one went ok, the other one kept saying it was missing a file it needed to run to install it.
</p>
<p>After all these problems&nbsp; the last one is that it is not recognizing the battery. It is plugged in to charge but it does not register that it is connected to an energy source. Therefore once the battery ran out&nbsp; the laptop is dead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went into detail, for others to know what happened to me with the upgrade.</p>
<p>I contacted Asus and I have to send it to their technical center for a factory reset, which I can't do anymore.</p>

<p>I noticed that I appear with a different name, which is due to the fact that I&nbsp; am&nbsp; using a borrowed laptop.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>No wonder there! :) :)</p>

<h2>            Mystery file in recycle bin will not go away</h2>
                    <div>
<div>I need help with a recycler problem. If i right-click and Empty Recyle Bin i get an "acces is denied " message with a strange file name. I booted into safe mode, tried the "rd /s c:\recycler" command and i got the following:<br />
"acces is denied the file is being used by another process"<br />
I went into the recycler directory and there appear to be NO files, just 2 directories:<br />
C:\recycler\S-1-5-~1\Dc56"<br />
I cannot remove attributes or delete these directories because "the file is being used by another process"<br />
How can i terminate the process so i can get rid of this file? It's annoying to get the the access denied message EVERY TIME i clean the recycle bin.<br />
Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br />
Thanks in advance and best regards,</div>

            <p>OK, thanks to all for the replies.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Yes, I always logged in as administrator when attempting to clean it out.</p>
<p>I THINK i got it now...!</p>
<p>The trick that did it was to run Malwarebytes File Assasin in Safe Mode and clean out everything in the recycle bin. It APPEARS to be gone now, the Recycle Bin appears to be empty.&nbsp; Just to make sure i'm going to boot into safe mode and seem if it's still
 hiding in there.</p>
<p>The recycler does appear to be working properly. I will post back if necessary.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the help, much appreciated. Special thanks for the previously unknown to me command and switch ("dir&nbsp; /x")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<h2>            Mouse buttons&#40;left and right pointing stick button&#41;</h2>
                    <strong>Am using Hp probook G2 640. I was having a problem with the left and right pointing stick &nbsp;buttons after i changed my keyboard which was having a track pad and went in for one without a trackpad. And You know Hp probook g2 640 has four(4) mouse
 buttons. And so i wanted to ask if without the availability of the trackpad, can the first two(2) mouse buttons known as the left and right pointing stick buttons be affected?&nbsp;</strong>

<p><span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)">Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As you have replaced the keyboard of your laptop, with the one that does not have the pointing stick, there could be some limitations
 with the functionality of the trackpad buttons that may be associated with the pointing stick. However, I would recommend that you check with HP to make sure if there are any functionality changes/limitations to the trackpad buttons due to the replacement.</span></p>
