            I am having the same problem with three accounts that were automatically switched to Outlook. &nbsp;All I get is a page that doesn't seem to download properly with a bunch of commands on the left side and I can see the titles of the emails I have received,
 but when I try to open one it just goes back to the same page. &nbsp;When I try to hit one of the commands it doesn't do anything. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I have been searching for a solution everywhere in the web and have try all of the recommendations:</div>
<div>Clearing the cache and history</div>
<div>Upgrading Google Chrome and IE to the latest update&nbsp;</div>
<div>Trying to log in with another computer</div>
<div>Turning the browser's compability feature on</div>
<div>But all I get is the same result with every single one recommendation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This has to be something else. &nbsp;Anybody has an idea?????</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing your concern here in Community forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is your first time signing in to your email, please be informed that all Hotmail has upgraded to Outlook.com. Have you tried to clear your browser cache? If not, please try to do so. Sometimes the best solution is the easiest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are accessing your emails using Windows Internet Explorer, you can refer to this article below for your reference in
resetting </span>your IE.</p>

<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. <br />
<br />
We understand you are having some issue downloading apps with your Windows Phone, have you tried to perform soft reset?<br />
<br />
You may try to perform a phone soft reset. This method will not remove anything at all from your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situation.
<br />
<br />
To make a soft reset: <br />
1. Make sure your phone is turned on. <br />
2. Press and hold the volume down and Power buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts.
<br />
<br />
Take note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may visit this link for more information about the soft reset: &nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2003&#58; Cannot save unsent e-mails in DRAFTS folder</h2>
                    
<p>Outlook 2003 SP3: Cannot save unsent e-mails in DRAFTS folder.</p>
<p>MS Word used as editor</p>
<p>Problem: When wanting to save an unsent e-mail as a draft, Outlook brings up the SaveAs dialogue box instead of automatically saving the unsent e-mail to the DRAFTs folder.</p>
<p>But, reply e-mails save to the DRAFTS folder fine - no issues. This problem just appears when saving new unsent e-mails.</p>
<p>Turning off MS Word as the default editor fixes the problem. This isn't a solution as MS Word is the preferred editor due to the features and capabilities provided with test formatting etc.</p>
<p>Deleting the Registry setting for all of MS Office 2003 and then running the repair option in the Install/Uninstall app fixes the problem for about 3-4 weeks. Short of this brute-force action nothing else works. (tried the usual Outlook command line switches
 but to no success.)</p>
<p>Under advanced e-mail options the DRAFTs are set to save under the DRAFT folder - this hasn't changed.</p>
<p>Further: Even running the Install/Uninstall repair tool without deleting the registry settings for MS Office WILL NOT fix the problem - even though the tool runs with no errors. Also reinstalling the app without cleaning the registry is hit and miss, sometime
 fixes the problem other times not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issue seems to be between MS Word and Outlook somewhere.</p>
<p>It seems there is registry key that has become corrupt somewhere: not sure what registry key and where.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The thing is, if the message is new or not implies two possible answers. Why don't you give us the answer to both? How long do we need to wait for you to come back on the forum to answer the question?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, I took a short holiday and messages get lost too easily in these forums if i don't check in a couple of times a day.</p>
<p>A new message that is generated outside of outlook, ie, using the New message to command or Wordmail, comes into Outlook at a different point than a reply would (which is always in Outlook). This is why drafts of messages created using Send to menus ends
 up in the Inbox (and you can't do anything in Outlook until you send or save and close the message). I've never seen it bring up the Save as menu though, but anything is possible with Outlook.</p>
<p>I certainly would not reinstall office, make a new profile or run scanpst as the first troubleshooting step for this problem. I would try safe mode to rule out addins interfering. (Close Outlook. Hold Ctrl as you click on the Outlook icon to open in safe
 mode.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond that, i have no idea - problems like this that are rarely seen are also diffcult to diagnose. But its usually something on the computer causing it. (I wouldn't recommend reformatting to fix it either. :))</p>

<h2>            How to select Logarithmic Trend line.  Option is not selectable &#40;but I see it&#41; for my current file but was selectable from a previous excel file.</h2>
                    
<p>HI</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to add a trend line to my graph.&nbsp; I have the x axis set as logarithmic.&nbsp; The y scale is not logarithmic.&nbsp; I need to add a trend line to my graph to determine values of unknowns.&nbsp; The best type of trend line for me is the logarithmic trend line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, I can't select this option.&nbsp; The only trend line types which I can select are:&nbsp; Linear, polynomial, exponential and moving average.&nbsp; There is a logarithmic option, but I can't highlight it to use it.</p>
<p>In addition, I have a separate file which I was able to select get a log trend line (with that graph also being set to logarithmic and the y scale is not logarithmic.)</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Apparently Excel does not agree with you :-).</p>
<p>Seriously, I have had similar situations.&nbsp; Usually, it is because the range of X values exceed the computational limits of the desired trendline.&nbsp; Typically, it is because the X values are dates -- which are very large integers.</p>
<p>If you have a similar situation, try creating a helper column that "normalizes" X to a scale starting with zero.&nbsp; For example, =X1-$X$1 copied down, if X1:X100 contains dates.</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I open it with Excel there is an error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">The file format and extension of ... don't match. ... Do you want to open it anyway?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open it, the expected content is displayed. But there are two problems:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The text file uses points as decimal separators. My Excel uses commas as decimal separators. The values are displayed as text in Excel instead of numerical values.
</li><li>Some of the values are automatically converted to dates. </li></ol>
<p>There might be workarounds like editing the text files, but is there a direct solution to read these files into Excel? The first problem for me is that I do not know what the format of the text file above is called.

<p>Hi Tisky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<div><br />
<div>I just tried to import a .html file to Excel Workbook, but there seems no entry in Excel to do that:</div>
<div><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f6f78f9-975d-4700-95ed-f4d21345c952?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f6f78f9-975d-4700-95ed-f4d21345c952?upload=true" /></a><br />
<div><br />
<div>I think our solution would be editing the text files as you mentioned before. Like changing the "number/number" format to "space+number/number", or changing the commas into other symbol.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Alex</div>

    <title>Excel macro that will insert horizontal macros based on rules - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kara from sdc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel macro that will insert horizontal macros based on rules</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like help writing a macro to automatically insert page breaks only at certain locations within the worksheet. Ideally, the macro should determine where the page break should naturally occur and then move up to the nearest section break. In this example,
 I'd like the macro to move the page break at row 786 to the top of row 783:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c20ebd44-0a48-4c1e-9b63-124ed7def4f4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c20ebd44-0a48-4c1e-9b63-124ed7def4f4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The height, number, and visibility of rows in each section is dynamic, so I can't set the breaks based on row count or at each section break. The worksheet includes hidden rows, where I can add markers to indicate where a page break should go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help,</p>
<p>

<p>oAnast,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the page breaks are happening at each time the Column Q is 123. I want the break to only happen if the page is full, then the break should happen at the closest occasion to 123.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/37b35e41-f7f0-48b1-a992-a541e56991a8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/37b35e41-f7f0-48b1-a992-a541e56991a8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's that macro that I slightly modified for my worksheet:<br />
</p>
<p>Sub Set_HPageBreaks_If_ColumnQ_Is_123()</p>
<p>'Nov. 13, 2018<br />
On Error Resume Next<br />
Dim ws As Worksheet<br />
Set ws = ActiveSheet<br />
Dim rng As Range, r As Range<br />
Set rng = ws.Range("G1:Q207")<br />
ActiveWindow.View = xlPageBreakPreview<br />
ws.HPageBreaks(1).DragOff Direction:=xlDown, RegionIndex:=1<br />
With ws.PageSetup<br />
.PrintArea = rng.Address<br />
.PrintTitleRows = .Rows(1).Address<br />
End With<br />
For Each r In ws.Range("Q:Q").SpecialCells(xlCellTypeConstants)<br />
If r.Value = 123 Then<br />
ws.HPageBreaks.Add before:=ws.Cells(r.Row + 1, "A")<br />
</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p><br />
Next<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to find a macro that nearly works...</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>Sub Page_Breaks()</p>
<p>
</p><p>ActiveSheet.ResetAllPageBreaks</p>
<p>Dim Pdiv, PgCt, Pgs</p>
<p>PgCt = 1</p>
<p>Pgs = ActiveSheet.HPageBreaks.Count</p>
<p>Do</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If Pgs = 0 Then</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exit Do</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; End If</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Pdiv = ActiveSheet.HPageBreaks(PgCt).Location.Row</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If Not IsEmpty(Range("Q" &amp; Pdiv).Value) Then</p>
<p>'&nbsp; &nbsp;Cell is not empty therefore find the first occurrence of blank in Col Q above this row. Generally speaking, the blank in row Q will be on a hidden row.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do</p>
<p>'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Loopback until there is an empty cell in Col Q</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pdiv = Pdiv - 1</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Loop Until IsEmpty(Range("Q" &amp; Pdiv))</p>
<p>'&nbsp; &nbsp;Set the new Page break above the empty cell</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Range("Q" &amp; Pdiv + 1).Select</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveWindow.SelectedSheets.HPageBreaks.Add Before:=ActiveCell</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; End If</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; PgCt = PgCt + 1</p>
<p>Pgs = ActiveSheet.HPageBreaks.Count</p>
<p>Loop Until PgCt &gt; ActiveSheet.HPageBreaks.Count</p>
<p>
</p><p>End Sub</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/caef2912-2bb0-4ac4-baab-c4606a35cdd2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/caef2912-2bb0-4ac4-baab-c4606a35cdd2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>It's a little time consuming to run, but it (nearly) gets the job done, so I think it'll work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work property when rows are extra tall...</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e2ae9c4-997e-4f19-8389-b49d118ec014?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e2ae9c4-997e-4f19-8389-b49d118ec014?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Is there a way to modify the macro so page breaks are inserted correctly, regardless of the row height?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi oAnast,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, the page breaks should occur where the content is maximized on each page, but the actual break happens based on specific formatting rules. Ideally, I want the macro to work as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clear the existing page breaks</li><li>Determine where the first page break should occur naturally, and then move it up the spreadsheet until it reaches the first preferred location. As you can see from the top screenshot, the page break should only happen above a grey row.</li><li>Search for the next natural page break and locate it at the nearest preferred location. The macro should continue until all page breaks are located.</li></ol>
<p>Any thoughts on how to improve the macro that I'm currently using?<br />
</p>
<p>Kara</p>

<h3> erayh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onedrive Won&#39;t start</h2>
                    <p>I have now had this problem twice, but with the help of the Office 365 support team, I've got a resolution someone else might need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a Windows 10 desktop my Onedrive.exe&nbsp; sync app would not start.&nbsp; The first symptom was the cloud icons in the system tray disappeared. &nbsp;&nbsp; I first attempted to uninstall Onedrive through Settings/Apps and Features,&nbsp; but it complained saying "There is no
 app associated with this entry". &nbsp; I also learned through this incident that uninstalling an app through this interface and through the old control panel are not always the same.&nbsp; The control panel uninstall seems to be more thorough. &nbsp; The MS support tech
 had me to go to Control Panel and attempt to remove the app there. &nbsp; This also returned an error and would not remove. &nbsp; I also attempted to just install the new Onedrive over this one, but it failed because it said a newer version was already installed.</p>
<p>The version of onedrive I was running was:</p>
<p>18.091.0506.0006</p>
<p>
</p><p>The resolution was to use regedit to delete 2 registery hives.&nbsp; (Of course don't attempt this unless you're comfortable in regedit, and EXPORT to back it up before deleting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the entries for Onedrive under:</p>
<p>Computer\HKEY_USERS\…...\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then re-downloaded the latest Onedrive from:</p>
<p>oneclient.sfx.ms</p>
<p>
</p><p>That did it. &nbsp; I was able to log back into my onedrive account, everything synced up as expected.</p>
<p>Apparently a few other customers had started to hit this, but MS hasn't yet written up a knowledgebase article yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for what what its worth: &nbsp; Getting support through the business Office 365 is well worth it. &nbsp; It comes with the business Office 365 subscriptions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>wuapp is set to fast ring and loading updates from local and www sources. Apparently some other german users have the same issue with the feedback app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The feedback app stopped working after I completed the 'mail, calendar and messenger don't download' fix including a store reset. This was needed after a clean 10049 install to load and install apps. After that, I could reinstall the mail app. Works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--</p>
<p>
</p><p>Added a local user. Opened feedback. The app is OK, but search still has a problem.</p>

</p><p>Feedback locks me out for the first 5 minutes, it says I'm not in the insider program. Then the above message reappears. Could be server side..??</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 - Small Calendars When Printing Month View</h2>
                    <p>When I print the current month calendar in Outlook 2013, is it possible to change the smaller calendars that also print in the upper right side? It currently prints the current month and the next month. I'd like to have it print the past month and the next
 month. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a couple of other older posts that state it is not possible to change them, but was wondering if there have been any updates since then.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Grace </p>

<p>Hi hold down windows logo key- tap R type (shell:AppsFolder) This will open to all your apps. Right click Media Player and uninstall. You can also do other things there! Hope this helps!</p>

            Unfortunately that doesn't do it.&nbsp; When I right click on Windows Media Player and select Uninstall, it just brings up the Control Panel Programs and Features window, and Windows Media Player is not listed, so I can't uninstall it from there.

<p>For now Windows Media Player is still part of the operating system so it can't be removed. If it bothers you to look at it, you can disable it as follows: Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Turn Windows features on or off &gt; remove the check mark from
 Media features &gt; Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that Windows Media Player will eventually be removed by Windows Update in favor of the Groove app. But that's just my opinion, and 'Bull' is in my username.</p>

            This indicates you have the "windows Store" version of Office installed. unfortunately, you need to uninstall it and install the click to run version from office.com. you will need to rebuild your profile.

            There may be bits on the computer for it ( I suspect they use an image with the shortcuts to the apps deleted when customers ask not to have it preinstalled). Try this:
<br />Open PowerShell in run as admin mode then paste:
<br />Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online | where-object {$_.packagename –like "*Outlook*"} | Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online
<br />
<br />Then:
<br />Get-AppxPackage "*Outlook*" | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />Close the PowerShell window and open it without using run as admin. Run this command:
<br />Get-AppxPackage "*Outlook*" | Remove-AppxPackage

<p>1. Installed latest version of iTunes</p>
<p>2. Uninstalled the version of Microsoft office than came with the computer.</p>
<p>3. Uninstalled Microsoft Office 365</p>
<p>4. Uninstalled iCloud</p>
<p>5. Ran cCleaner registry scan several times until all entries were fixed.</p>
<p>6. Rebooted computer</p>
<p>7. Installed Microsoft Office 365</p>
<p>8. Installed iCloud and ran as administrator</p>
<p>9. iCloud installation causes a reboot, when icloud opened, checked outlook contacts and bookmarks and all is well!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save this for future use!</p>

            No you have not "run out" of installs. Since you have the Academic offer it is treated as a "retail" license. That allows you to install on 2 computers AT THE SAME TIME, and to transfer those installations to new computers. The only requirement to transfer
 an installation is to make it unusable on the old machine. A dead machine meets that requirement.<br />
<br />
Simply install on your new machine and activate using the product key. If it is rejected, do a phone activation. Do not enter anything, you already know it will fail. Just wait, a long while, until you are offered the option of speaking to a live 'service"
 rep. Explain the situation to them. They should enable you product key in the activation system. If they don't, politely ask to speak to a supervisor.<br />
<br />
PS: after the computer was stolen you should have contacted MS for a replacement key. If the thief was technologically sophisticated they would extract the key from your HD and resell it online. You may still want to try that:<br />

    <title>IE9 forgets last save location with &#34;save picture as...&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steveclarian  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE9 forgets last save location with &#34;save picture as...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>When I first started using IE9, when I right-clicked an image and clicked "save picture as...", the "save picture" window would open to the folder where I had last saved a picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, it started defaulting to the pictures library instead of my last save location.&nbsp; This is annoying, because it's an extra two clicks to then have to go to "recent places" and then find the folder I last saved to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I deleted temporary files, and this did not fix the issue; I also went to Internet Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Reset Internet Explorer Settings, and this did not fix it either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I restored my system back to a restore point before the issue began, that fixed it...but then it just happened again a few hours later.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

            <p>This link does not talk about the same issue. &nbsp;Lucian was talking about the download dialog that pops up at the bottom of the screen, as in this image: http://community.norton.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/16362i79214D0607710AAF/image-size/original?v=mpbl-1&amp;px=-1</p>
<p>I'm talking about the "save picture" window that opens when right-clicking an image and then clicking "save as..."</p>
<p>Later in that thread they talk about changing the default folder where downloads are saved. &nbsp;That isn't the issue here either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My issue is that the 'save picture' window is supposed to default to the same folder I most recently saved to (which is not a single set folder, but changes every time I save something to a different place than last time), and at first it does, but after
 only a few hours of normal surfing it always gets corrupted somehow and starts defaulting to the pictures library.</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>I also had the question once about IE8,&nbsp;then&nbsp;I did some search and found the solution.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p>go registry and find the following</p>
<p>Computer-&gt;HKEY_CURRENT_USER-&gt;Software-&gt;Microsoft-&gt;Internet Explorer-&gt;Main</p>
<p>in the right pane, creat a new DWORD entry and name it as "TabProcGrowth" and value as "1".</p>
<p>Log off and log on in case it doesn't take effect at once.</p>
<p>This actually make IE9 opens only 2 processes (one for main window, one for all the tabs in it )&nbsp;instead of bunch of them even more than the tabs it opens, and in fact, though the tabs appear in&nbsp;one main window, behind the window it may has several processes,
 each&nbsp;may handle one or more tabs and&nbsp;has its own session, cause you have to specify the save location for each of them. Using the registry tweak above to make IE use single process for all tabs should solve this.</p>
<p>Plus, you can set the value to 0, force IE9 use only one process as in IE7 and earlier. but doing&nbsp;this may cause IE more fragile if some stability issue occurs.</p>
<p>However you will need to specify the save location once again&nbsp;if you close and restarted the mian IE window/ whole application, and if the default is not where you want.</p>
<p>Or if you're using Windows 7 and its Library feature, you can simply specify the "default save location" for Pictures library.</p>
<p>For me, the really annoying thing is IE9 use the same location for all type of downloads in Vista, rather than use the different location for image and archive/all other file types like IE8 and ealier versions did, and I can't access "save as" through keyboard
 shortcut is also painful.</p>
<p>Hope this solve your problem, and sorry for my poor English.</p>

</p><p>Since you've mentioned that the issue only happens when you're using the mail account of your domain, it's possible that the issue lies on your client's side. The issue may also be caused by the security set up by your client where external mail accounts

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I have a similar problem as in the topic, but none of your solutions seem to work. I searched in the "Junk" Folder, checked filters and deleted about 50 emails to be sure that there is enough space available. I know that I should get 1 email because it
 was the reply to the email I sent before and I have phone conntact to that person. About a second email I get noticed by message on facebook. There were no problems with this sender before.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Few minutes ago I sent myself &nbsp;email from another account, not connected in any way with my outlook account and it was delivered&nbsp;immediatel.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can I somehow get those e-mails if maybe they were stopped by some server spam filters ? or what can be the problem ?<br />
<br />
None of these senders where in my contact list, but that was never a problem because I never added any and everything worked fine. Can that be a problem ?<br />
<br />
The email senders were <br />
....@wosp.org.pl</div>
<div>....@wp.pl</div>
<div><br />
<div>P.S. Sorry for possible mistakes in my english.<br />
<br />
Edit: Another friend sent me email to test the account, I didn't get it, don't know why :(</div>

            I made the test today.
<div><br />
<div>My friend sent me an email. I didn't get it. Then I added him to my contacts and he sent me message again. I received it. It means you're right but it means too that account is useless. For example if I give my CV when I search for job or just met someone
 and I gave him my e-mail without knowing his I won't get a message from him. It&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I didn't have that kind of problems earlier, where there any changes in spam filtering or something lately?</div>
<div><br />
<div>One way or another it means I just need to change the account because I never heard about so strange behavior.</div>
<div>Sorry for that, but thank you for the answer.</div>

            A. checked
<div>B. I deleted more than 50 messeges to be sure, some e-mails are recived, some are not. and because I still get some other e-mails it can't be the problem.</div>
<div>C. I created another mail account and recived e-mails from senders I couldn't get on this one so it looks like a problem directly with this account. ( Or maybe I don't understand this advice)</div>
<div><br />
<div>There where about 4-5 senders, who sent me the same e-mail, none of them was recived. (but on the other account no problem). I am sure that there is no vitus there. attachments were two images and .doc file. And the orginal sender of this e-mail was&nbsp;nongovernmental
 organization, that is trusted and sends emails to a lot of my friends, everyone had no problem reciving it. Other e-mails from this organization are recived, I got one today.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>One sender who sent me few (text only)e-mails during a few days.I didn't get any.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And the test &nbsp;that I mentioned before. Sender first was't and then was on the contact list, this fact was crucial for reciving or not recivinbg emai from the sender.</div>

<p>There isn't&nbsp;<strong>*a*</strong><strong> </strong>setting to do this. For <em>
texting, messaging, apps, email,</em> you will have to look through settings/options for the app or program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a webpage that's hard to read because of something stupid like medium grey text on a light grey background, hit Ctrl+a to select all/highlight the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Zooming in on the page will often help also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The high contrast theme will be useful on some, but not all webpages.</p>
<p>Right-click the Desktop &gt; Personalize &gt; Themes &gt; High contrast settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may make some webpages almost unreadable, but you can change Internet Explorer colors from Internet Options &gt; Accessibility &gt; Ignore colors specified on webpages. Then Fonts &gt; Arial black. Then Colors &gt; (I like use Windows colors) but you an select
 other colors.</p>
<p>Again these settings will make some webpages look very strange. I would use Ctrl+a instead.</p>
