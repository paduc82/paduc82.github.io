    <title>OPERATING PROGRAMS CODED ON MICROSOFT QUICK BASIC 4.5 ON MODERN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> notfinished  say:</h3>
<h2>            OPERATING PROGRAMS CODED ON MICROSOFT QUICK BASIC 4.5 ON MODERN COMPUTERS AND OPERATING SYSTEMS</h2>
                    <p>For years I have coded and operated programs using Microsoft Quick Basic 4.5,&nbsp; 5.25 disk version on a 286 desktop using a MS-D0S platform.&nbsp; I have a lot of coding stored on 5.25 disks.&nbsp; The Microsoft Quick Basic 4.5 is circa 1989/90.&nbsp; I still have the original
 manual and the 4 installation 5.25 disks</p>
<p>The Microsoft Quick Basic 4.5 was registered with Microsoft in October 1991.</p>
<p>The 286 desktop has been dedicated for a long time to coding with Microsoft Quick Basic 4.5 and both still work fine.</p>
<p>I also have another desktop with Windows XP and although it still works fine, I understand that it will have a limited life.&nbsp; This desktop does have a tray to insert 5.25 disks.&nbsp; This computer does not have Microsoft Quick Basic 4.5&nbsp; installed in it.In addition
 I have a laptop with Windows 7 that only has a cd tray.</p>
<p>I plan to purchase a new laptop later in the year with Windows 10.</p>
<p>Although the 286 still works fine,&nbsp; I recognize that it could break down or crash at any time and I doubt if parts are available to repair it.&nbsp; If this should happen,&nbsp; I will be facing the problem on how to operate the existing coded programs from Microsoft
 Quick Basic 4.5 stored in the 5.25&nbsp; disks and to create new coding.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any advice on how to operate these programs and create new ones using Microsoft Quick Basic 4.5 on the other two computers I own as described above. Recognizing that this may not be possible, are there other and better options available
 with new or used computers and Windows software including the new Windows 10?</p>
<p>Since the installation programs are on 5.25 disks, how could the Quick Basic 4.5 program be installed on computers that do not have a 5.25 tray?</p>
<p>Responses as detailed as possible would be appreciated.</p>
<p>If it is possible to install and use Microsoft Quick Basic 4.5 on a modern computer with a modern operating system, would it be wise to hire Microsoft to complete this job, recognizing that it could be complex in every way?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You might be able to copy the floppies to CD, DVD, or USB media.<br />
<br />
5 1/4 floppy drives (external) are still being sold on Amazon, eBay, and other<br />
sellers.<br />
<br />
No idea where you can install and run them that on modern OS. Check with<br />
those at MSDN to see if they have information. The Visual Basic Forums are<br />
the closest connection to Quick Basic there that I can find though it is not<br />
really that close.<br />
<br />
Modern Windows OS have XP compatibility mode which might work. So<br />
you would install it using XP Compatibility Mode.<br />

    <title>I also cannot send any pictures via email any more, from Photo Gallery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rensathome  say:</h3>
<h2>            I also cannot send any pictures via email any more, from Photo Gallery or from My Pics folder.</h2>
                    Am using Vista and MS Office 2007. it all worked fine...I got a new Sony Vaio 5 months ago and suddenly this does not work any more. Downloaded Picasa this morning...same story. Once I have selected the pics and selected a smaller size to send them, Outlook
 simply does not open at all, and then after aborting the picture sending, Outlook will not open until I have re-booted the comp. Have tried using different photos from different files, no go.I went to the Pt of uninstalling Office this morning and re-installing
 it, but still no different. Am at 14 lb hammer stage...can anyone help? Have also spent a total of 4 hrs on the ph with techs from Sony, and other than restoring my computer and using the repair option with my Office disc, they have no solution either. Wish
 one operating system would be made perfect before yet another one is launched. I don't like Vista...never, ever had a problem with XP and loading, or sending emails in Outlook. (With Picasa I was able to export and shrink the pics I wanted to mail, and then
 eventually get them off to their destination, but I should not have to do this. Is the problem thus with the shrinking of the pics before they get sent to Outlook???) Oh and I have followed the suggestion posted for this problem, and Outlook was set as my
 default mail program!!!<br />

<p><span><span>We would like to get more information from you, to help troubleshoot your issue. Please answer the
 following questions as best you can.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If you are able to open the outlook I would suggest that you try to drag and drop the pictures directly
 into an open e‑mail message, check if this method works.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Though Windows Mail is used as the default e‑mail program by web browsers and other programs that
 support sending e‑mail, you can choose a different e‑mail program as the default. If you decide you want to change the default e‑mail program back to Windows Mail, you can do so at any time.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something else you might want to try is removing any 3rd Party Anti Virus software (Especially AVG) and try and run the update checks again.</p>

            Hi Eeshwar, thank you for your reply. I thought the problem was resolved last night as later on the Update and Security page loaded and showed the last update was 29th November. However when turning on my PC this morning the blank page had returned. I
 tried running the Microsoft Account troubleshooter from the link you provided but got the following error message - Error Code: 0x8007041D, Source: System, User: USER-PC/user, Context: Restricted.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your reply. Apologize for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check if the issue occurs in a Clean Boot state. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

Bridge.sys is a Windows component which means something else caused it to Fault.<br />

</p><p>==================================================<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;<strong>set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers </strong>- update&nbsp;those without
<br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update<strong> BIOS </strong>and <strong>chipset</strong>).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<br />
Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can <br />
analyze it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Update April 2019</h2>
                    <p>I installed the update on my Dell Inspiron April 11th. When I turned on my laptop after installing the update, my laptop ran just fine for about twenty minutes. Then, it shut off and has been completely unresponsive since. I cannot get it to power on, nor
 does a light come on when I plug in the charger to the laptop (I checked to make sure, and the charging box itself still lights up to indicate it's working).&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  sherlockwolf282
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Can you try removing the battery if there is an option to do so then try powering on the laptop?
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />
<br />How do you do that?
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, it will then your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />
<br />You might be asked to sign in with your Microsoft Account or Local Account password. 
<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment again, then try performing a startup repair.
<br />
<br />Perform the startup repair a couple more times then restart again to see if you are able to boot to the desktop successfully. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, boot into the recovery environment, then click 'Go back to previous version of Windows'
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Reset this PC
<br />Click Keep my files
<br />Choose your account
<br />Enter your password
<br />Click Continue
<br />Click Reset
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to <strong>corrupt display driver</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try starting your computer in <strong>safe mode </strong>
from Windows recovery environment and check if it helps. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows, start your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>", do so. If you
 don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>" to start the
 Windows recovery environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the Windows recovery environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the Windows recovery environment, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Startup Settings</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. Click "<strong>Restart</strong>". After restart press either "<strong>4</strong>" or "<strong>F4</strong>" key to start safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>download Windows 10 files, create an installation media and then install Windows 10.</strong><br />
Refer:<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows starts in safe mode, then try to <strong>uninstall display driver</strong>. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows + X keys </strong>and click <strong>device manager</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Click to expand <strong>display adapters</strong>, right click the adapter and click
<strong>uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, you may try to start your computer in normal mode. If it boots properly, then you may
<strong>update display driver </strong>from the computer manufacturer's website and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
1.&nbsp;It’s possibly a corrupt download, have you tried downloading another copy and reattempt the installation again?<br />
2.&nbsp;Is it a 32 or a 64 bit operating system?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1</strong>:<br />
Check the developer’s website to find out about compatibility with Windows 7 and if there are any updates, patches or fixes that might enable compatibility.</div>
<div><strong>Windows 7 Compatibility Center<br />
</strong>Check to see if your software application or hardware is on the list<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</a></div>

<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2</strong>:<br />
You may also try to run Program Compatibility troubleshooter.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Solitaire Collection connection issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kiwi claire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection connection issues</h2>
                    <p>Up to a couple of days ago, the game was running fine on both PC and Android phone. Both connecting to internet via 802.11 g wifi. But all of a sudden the game on both say - unable to connect to internet so have to play offline.</p>
<p>Everything else on both devices still work on internet.</p>
<p>I plugged ethernet cable into PC - and the game worked fine - letting me connect to Events and Daily challenges - so correctly seeing the internet,&nbsp; but Events leaderboards no longer see any of my xbox friends scores.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried using a different wifi dongle - connecting using 802.11 ac &nbsp; - so a much faster connection... &nbsp; and the game connects fine... but same issue with Event Leaderboards.&nbsp; Change back to slower wifi - and offline play only possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the game on a 2nd pc - and am getting the same results when use those connections - not working on 802.11 g or slower but fine with faster wifi and ethernet connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly - phone does not have a faster connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>1 - Has the game been changed to require faster connections or has something else happened to both devices at the same time?</p>
<p>2 - Has the way it works with xbox friends changed?&nbsp; or are the 2 issues actually related?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Cortana and why cant I use it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gwayne38  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana and why cant I use it&#63;</h2>
                    So, I have a desktop that is running windows 10, it is completely up to date and I just checked again before posting this. &nbsp;Now my Issue is that I want to enable Cortana on my computer using voice, as opposed to just having the search bar like I do now.
 But here is the problem, when I go into my cortana search bar there is no notebook option below home, when I right click on my task bar there is no option to show cortana on the task bar. &nbsp;But Cortana is running in the background constantly and I am able to
 find the program files. &nbsp;I was able to use it when it first came out but for whatever reason I no longer can. &nbsp;Any help is appreciated.

<p>Hi Gwayne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's get Cortana working on your computer. Before performing any troubleshooting steps, kindly
<span><span>make sure your <em>Country or Region</em>,<em> Language</em>, and <em>
Speech Language</em> settings are all aligned with one of Cortana’s supported locale configurations. Cortana
</span></span><span><span>works best when your region and language settings are aligned. For more information, you may refer to the following link:
</span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/557b5e0e-0eb0-44db-87d6-5e5db6f9c5b0/cortana-s-regions-and-languages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Cortana's regions and languages</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corruption of system files related to Cortana can cause this issue. We suggest that you run
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the System File Checker tool</a>. This utility allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's also download and run <span>the <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_StartMenu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Start menu troubleshooter</a>. This troubleshooter finds and fixes </span>common problems with opening the Start menu or Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we recommend that you <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download any pending updates</a> that need to be installed through Windows Update and check if it helps resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated with the results, and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<p>Im having issues with Cortana no longer showing my Calendar events or their timelines.&nbsp; These are Bing provided sports and TV shows (sub calendars).&nbsp; It works fine with manually entered events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are Cortana system files that are related to BING.&nbsp; Can anyone help me locate these files to be sure the values are set correctly at 1, rather than 0?</p>

<h2>            Signtool fail &#40;-2146434967&#47;0x80100069&#41;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I've been trying to automate signing files with a token smart card.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I wrote a short script that copies an exe file from elsewhere and signs it, in an infinite loop.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
After a few hours of my script running successfully, the logging of the server that is executing this script shows the signtool failed with error (-2146434967/0x80100069).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I googled this and found that it means "The smart card has been removed, so that further communication is not possible."</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
The smart card was never removed, and I am clueless about the cause of this. I suspect it's something pre-defined in the windows registery. Help?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I set the token to be single sign-on so It's not supposed to ask a for a password after I enter it once until I log out of the computer.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Thanks.</p>

                    Since the last Windows update about a week or 2 ago, I've been experiencing many problems with Windows. 1st, it got "stuck" when it started to download. After figuring out how to stop it, when it did update the next time, it took several hours and since
 then, my laptop runs slow, whether on the internet or running a program, I get the "(not responding)" message at the top and have to wait for it to cycle thru, and now I can't get either of my wireless printers to print. After uninstalling and reinstalling
 several times, I get the "offline" message, yet I am able to print a test page, even though it Windows says it failed to print because the printer is offline. I've never had this many problems simultaneously, which makes me very hesitant to download Windows
 10. I need to get at least one printer working. What gives with these updates???

            <p>According to the update history, the last update was 9/22/15. </p>
<p>As for the Event Viewer, nothing shows up in this area. However, I continue getting the "not responding" message when I open pdf files; sometimes I can open a file and scroll thru it, but if I open more than a "few" (open, then close, then open another one)
 it quits and I have to hit Ctrl+Alt+Delete to close the program in Task Manager.
</p>
<p>Also...if I get try to get on the internet, it doesn't matter which ISP,frequently, it won't do anything. I may have to hit the icon several times before it opens, which causes it - sometimes, but not always - to open multiple screens. Other times I have
 to restart my system in order for it to work. Then there are other times when it comes up within 30 seconds or so. There is no definite pattern to it. Although the longer this continues the less frequently I'm able to connect quickly.
</p>
<p>I have 2 wireless printers that my laptop has stopped recognizing; one of them I can get to work if I use the USB plug. However, I am able to print wirelessly from my iPad, which doesn't help much, as my files are housed on my laptop. This tells me that
 the problem most likely isn't with the printer. </p>
<p>When I try to troubleshoot the problem from the printer program, I get a box that comes up and on the top it says: Network Connection Repair Tool 1.1.0.6 and the error message:
<em>an error has occurred and the program must close. </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>NONE of these problems occurred regularly before this last update. </p>

<h2>            Configuring Windows Updates stuck at 96&#37;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So I reseted my Windows 8.1 computer to factory settings. I begin to update as much as I can, but I'm now stuck at the configuring screen.</p>
<p>before when it did this, it reverted back. Now it stays at 96% complete. I can no longer get into my computer anymore.</p>
<p>I literally can't log into my computer. Windows, how did you mess up this bad!?</p>

            I did it a while ago, and it was just to start of fresh. But I got it to work, I just ignored the regular updates and just installed windows 8.1. Took all night to actually download, but it did it. And now the updates work regularly. I guess Window 8 had
 the worse problems during those updates.

    <title>Xbox Live Ban - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gwyn4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Ban</h2>
                    <p>I got an email this morning informing me of action taken against my account. I logged into my Xbox Live (or tried to) to verify that the email wasn't a scam. Same message on my Xbox. I checked my enforcement history, and my account page says I have a "Perfect
 Record." So, one, I have no idea how long the ban (suspension?) is going to last, and two, I have no idea what they're talking about. They don't have a place for me to ask about it. Is there anywhere that I can check for actions against my account? I went
 to&nbsp;https://enforcement.xbox.com and I'm not seeing anything.</p>

            It can take 24 hours for the information around your ban to show up on the enforcement portal. I'd review the

    <title>Extremely slow hard drive reads - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pinkerton academy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extremely slow hard drive reads</h2>
                    This issue only appears to be with windows 7 64bit (we don't use 32bit).&nbsp; Too often lately, we have hard drives that slow down to a crawl.&nbsp; Pulling the drive from the computer and testing it with HDTune shows the read speeds to be less than 5MB/s.&nbsp; The
 write speed seem okay though.&nbsp; The only fix that we've found it to format the drive and reinstall Windows (or clone it from another in the lab).&nbsp; HDTune does not give any other warnings or errors and there are no bad sectors on the drives.&nbsp; It seems like the
 file system is getting messed up and chkdsk doesn't fix it.&nbsp; Any thoughts on this?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The computers are fairly new with Dual-Core Xeon CPU's and 4GBs of RAM.&nbsp; The hard drives are from different manufacturers, but are all 160GB SATA drives.

            This ended up being a firmware issue.&nbsp; The HP11 firmware on this drive would cause it to go into a self-diagnostic mode, making the computer extremely slow.&nbsp; This would explain why chkdsk wouldn't find any errors, but the drive would be "fixed" afterwards
 (because it was allowed to run for hours).&nbsp; Thanks for everyone's help.&nbsp; <br />

<h2>            How can I suppress the IP Conflict warning pop-up box&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am getting this error message when changing from a Wired connection to a Wireless connection.&nbsp; This is due to the configuration of my network, which I cannot change.</p>
<p>I know why the error is happening, and it's not causing connectivity issues, I just want the pop-up warning to stop coming up.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how I can suppress this warning message?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you use or want to use Windows 7 Native Wireless utility, then disable the Intel Proset utility.</p>
<p>Two Wireless mangers working at the same time destabilize the Wireless system.</p>
<p>If you want to create a priority do not use the Intel option, instead configure the Wire and the Wireless card’s Metrics.</p>
<p>Here how, <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/metrics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/metrics.html</a></p>
<p>Using the metrics and only one Wireless manger, will make your problems Gone.</p>
<p>P.S. Make sure that the Router's DHCP range has enough IPs to provide to all your Network Devices.</p>
