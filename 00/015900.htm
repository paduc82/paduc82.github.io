<h2>            This server is requesting that your username and password be send in an insecure manner</h2>
                    I am trying to import data from the web using an XML feed in excel 2010.&nbsp; I am getting an error that reads "Warning: This server is requesting that your username and password be send in an insecure manner (basic authentication without a secure connection).
<br />
<br />
The strange thing is that same feed works fine in excel 2007.<br />

It shows the feed in preview, but when you go to Import, then get the propt "Where do you want to imput the data" and then click "OK" you get the message:&nbsp; "Unable to open http://myfeed.com/xxxxx The Internet site cannot return the object you request (HTTP/1.0

            I can import the data from the same link in a computer that has excel 2007.&nbsp; The problem is that this just occurs in excel 2010.&nbsp; This is what is so frustrating!!&nbsp; I works fine in 2007, but not in 2010.&nbsp; This makes me believe there is just some setting
 I need to change in Excel 2010.&nbsp; But I can't figure out what it is<br />

Issue could be with the conflict/access with the secured internet connection. You might have to check with your IT department to know the reason for the prompt or to grant access for you to access the

            <p>I am having the same issue in my Hotmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my Win7 PC I'm using a filtering program called MailWasherPro which deletes certain emails, but when my email program, called eM Client, goes to the Hotmail server, the emails deleted by MailWasher are still in the Hotmail Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also set up eM Client to delete from the Hotmail server all the emails it downloads to my PC.&nbsp; However, the e-mails remain in the Hotmail Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried cleaning my Delete folder in Hotmail, on the assumption that there was not enough space to move the emails from the Inbox to the Delete folder, but it did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting back. Let me further help you with your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com updates the system from time to time to enhance the services that we offer to customers. It is possible that there are updates rolled out that affected the way your third party apps behave when it comes to your Outlook.com account configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can opt to reconfigure all the settings that you have made with your account and on your apps to refresh it. You can also opt to consult the developer or support of the MailwasherPro for further assistance regarding this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also looking at the possibility that there is a problem with the email client &nbsp;that you are using but before we can conclude that we need to know the configuration settings that you have set up on your email client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Camera on new version of Skype</h2>
                    <p>Help!&nbsp; &nbsp;I installed the new version of Skype, and now, when I place or receive a call, I can see the other party but they cannot see me as the camera on my laptop doesn't come on. There is only a small picture of a camera on the corner of the screen. After
 I repeatedly, click on this picture, sometimes, the camera light finally come on and I can be seen on the other party's screen. What is going on?</p>

<p>Thank you Kenneth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately when I get to step 3 it only gives me the option of uninstalling the app. Maybe it's because it's the new version 8.31 ?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Pt can basically be done manually but still requires some attention.</p>
<p>For each one of the "subprojects, do the following:</p>
<p>Select all the tasks by their ID</p>
<p>Cut</p>
<p>Paste in a new project</p>
<p>Why does it require attention? Youwill automaticaly move resources, resource load and the dependencies of these tasks among them.</p>
<p>You will, unfortunately, lose the dependencies with the tasks in the other subprojects . You can add there manually later</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
        </p>

            <p>Daniel,</p>
<p>I'd like to add something to Jan's straightforward response. If you do have task dependencies that will be lost when you break of the file, create a couple of custom fields to hold link data. One field that identifies the task itself, (source identifier)
 and another field to hold the link destinations (destination identifiers). Then when you break everything up, you will have a convenient reference for establishing the cross-project links.</p>

            <p>Pardon me for bumping in......I'm guessing you are looking for the separate project files for reporting?&nbsp; Unless there is a person within each department who knows Project well, giving them a project file may be more of a burden than a help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider using filters to only show the tasks belonging to each department (or person) and saving as a PDF file.&nbsp; The calendar view (filtered) is popular for communicating with non-Project users.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2398596/how-to-use-a-clean-startup-to-determine-whether-background-programs-ar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use a "clean startup" to determine whether background programs are interfering with Office for Mac</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. Can you use the affected file normally before? Which operation have you taken before the issue occurred, such as updating Office?</p>
<p>2. Did the files create on the affected Mac?</p>
<p>3. The affected files. I will test it on our side.</p>

<p>Hi Olga,</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I am sorry for the misspelled word, I have edited it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As on our side, I didnâ€™t meet the issue, it may be related to the Office client.</p>
<p>I suggest you reinstall Office to check the result:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, can you provide a reproduce video which can show the issue to let us better understand the situation?</p>

                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I've been having trouble with my Lumia 820 for about 10 days. If I try to get the emails from my pop3-account nothing happens. Everything looks as if the system was trying to connect, but there aren't any emails coming in.<br />
Also, for the mean time the phone has not updated the pictures of my contacts that are on Facebook. Even my own picture is not updated.<br />
Is this some problem about amber?

    <title>Problems with macros and Normal.dotm - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob0025  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with macros and Normal.dotm</h2>
                    I recently formatted my computer and put a clean install of Windows XP Professional on it. &nbsp;I originally installed Open Office, but I uninstalled it when I learned that it could not do what I needed it to do. &nbsp;After uninstalling Open Office, I loaded Microsoft
 Office Home and Business 2010. &nbsp;Everything in Office functions normally except for Word. &nbsp;When I open Word, I get the following error message:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"The function you are attempting to run contains macros or content that requires macro language support. &nbsp;When this software was installed, you (or your administrator) chose not to install support for macros or controls."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I press OK, then the error message pops up again. &nbsp;I press OK, and it pops up for a third time. &nbsp;I press OK, and I am able to use Word normally. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I am finished with Word and try to close it, the same error message pops up again. &nbsp;I press OK, and it goes back to Word (with no document open). &nbsp;I go to close Word again, and I get the following error message:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Changes have been made that affect the global template, Normal.dotm. &nbsp;Do you want to save those changes?"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then get the option to Save, Don't Save or Cancel. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I click Save, I get the original error message again:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"The function you are attempting to run contains macros or content that requires macro language support. &nbsp;When this software was installed, you (or your administrator) chose not to install support for macros or controls."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I click Don't Save, then Word exits.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I click Cancel, then it goes back to Word (with no document open).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to Repair Office 2010, but that didn't have any effect. &nbsp;I have tried enabling and disabling macros to the fullest extent through the Trust Center, but that didn't have any effect. &nbsp;I can still use Word and all of its normal functions, but getting
 a total of 5 error messages every time you want to open and close it gets pretty annoying after a while.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any ideas?</div>

                    <p>After seven attempts now, although the Word update 15.31.0 downloads completely, it won't install completely,and stalls completely as soon as I receive the prompt to quit Word just past the midway point of the installation progress line. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;What can
 I do to complete this update installation?</p>

            Hi guys,<br />
I had also the same problem with my nokia X3-02 when i updated ovi store.<br />
What u have to do is to do hard reset<br />
1.dial *#7370# AND PRESS CALL BUTTON(green button)<br />
2.it will ask for security code,the default security code for nokia is 12345 ,type it and click ok<br />
3.do not try to remove ur battery or anything while doing hard reset<br />
<br />
Ps note:Battery should have enough charge<br />
<br />
For other phones just search for the hard reset codes and follow the same steps<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
sarath<br />

            Hi,<br />
Ok what u have to do is go to<br />
Apps&gt;Extras&gt;Collection<br />
there u will find nokia store click it and they will surely ask for update because its not updated before when the nokia store icon is gone..<br />
u can now update it<br />
&gt;&gt; after updation try soft reset using Key Code *#7780#<br />
&gt;&gt; now ur phone will be reset and restarted again<br />
&gt;&gt; now perform the hard reset using the steps i have given before<br />
<br />
Try it ,it will work<br />
<br />

            @memerik,<br />
<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your post. Doing a hard reset will erase all data on your device so please make sure you make a backup using Nokia Suite. If you haven't already downloaded it you can get it from the following link:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/nokia-ovi-suite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/nokia-ovi-suite</a><br />
<br />
Furthermore if you do not know how to backup your device please refer to the following link:<br />

            hi, pls i have problems with my nokia asha 201. I received a message which asked me if i wanted service provider to send me settings. I answered yes because my internet,calculator and others were all lost. Unfortunately, my phone is unable to restart to
 original factory settings too. Pls the yes responds has gotten rid of my store,themes,net and whatapp. I wanted to use the Nokia suite to restart it but someone said it will worsen the situation. What should i do?

            The conversation history on the classic Skype will not be carried over to the new Skype, you can only view the recent messages in the new Skype. This means that the old conversation history is saved in the classic Skype's folder specifically in the main.db.
<br />
<br />As long as this file is still saved on your device, you should still be able to recover the old messages.

<h2>            Mathematica equations written with MathType addin are not visible to other Word&#47;Powerpoint users</h2>
                    <p><span>Sent by: Prof. Vlado Malacic</span></p>
<p><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></p>
<p><span>At the National Institute of Biology (Marine Biology Station) in Slovenia we are using a licensed version 2016 Office Professional 2016 Plus, Word
 2016 MSO (16.0.4498.1000), 32-bit, Product ID: 00339-10000-00000-AA368. A few of researchers are writing many mathematical expressions and have to exchange our writing to other researchers that are rarely writing mathematical expressions (marine biologists).
 However, we have to write mutual reports and everyone has to see what others wrote.</span></p>
<p><span>We have been using also the 'Equation tool'. However, another 'Add-in', the MathType (ver 6.9b) of Design Science Inc. (now also WIRIS Science
 America) enabled writing math equations in a more elegant way, more 'acceptable' for the 'mathematical' community. One of the key additional features that Mathtype is offering and is missing in the Equation toll is the numbering of equations (it means relational
 indexing). Once the equations are numbered they could be moved around the text freely and with a simple command (F9) the equations are properly renumbered.</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft also recognizes the Mathtype product and is advertising it when user uses Word with a sentence:</span></p>
<p><span>Â»MathType is a powerful upgrade to Equation Editor with many additional features. Do you want to find out more about MathType?Â«</span></p>
<p><span>Clearly, Microsoft is â€˜advertisingâ€™ the use of Mathtype product. However, if another user (scientist, reviewer, journal editor) is looking at our
 .docx file, equations are blurred, symbols wrong. Could you please resolve the issue with the embeded fonts of MathType?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are trying to get a reliable way to write math formulas in Microsoft Word 2016 and then be able to share them with others&nbsp;<em>who do not have MathType</em>&nbsp;installed.
 As we were trying to write something with the already installed (default) tool Microsoft Equation 3.0 in Word without MathType.</span></p>
<p><span>We have been informed that others that did not have MathType could see MathType equations years ago in Word 2007. We have learned that activated
 option to embed fonts in Word 2016 means to embed fonts&nbsp;<em>only for text&nbsp;</em>in the document. The font embedding command in Word used to work for&nbsp;<em>embedded objects&nbsp;</em>like MathType equations up to Office 2007. However, this is not possible anymore.</span></p>
<p><span>This makes also Word 2016 a less efficient product from our point of view, as it was Word 2007. Could you improve Word 2016 to gain back this capacity
 of Word 2007 of font embedding also in embedded objects?</span></p>
<p><span>We know that in Office 306 there is Word with a tab of Latex. However, we are still uncertain about numbering many equations in the text with a
 proper reference to them. It also looks that Word 2016 will not have this ability to work with â€˜Latexâ€™.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Many thanks for your consideration and for your potential reply, in which we, unfortunately, do not believe.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I wish you pleasant Christmas and New year 2018.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vlado Malacic</span></p>

<p>Please note that MathType is a third party application developed by a company called Design Science, who have a support forum that may be able to help you.&nbsp; See&nbsp;http://www.dessci.com/en/support/mathtype/default.asp</p>
<p>
</p><p>While for backwards compatibility purposes, Microsoft Office does still included Microsoft Equation 3.0, which was a scaled down version of MathType, you should note that beginning several versions of Office ago, Microsoft stopped promoting the MathType
 application itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is however a possibility that the issue that you are facing may be caused by the presence of the McAfee AV utility.&nbsp; If you are using that utility, you should upgrade to
a version of WebAdvisor that's 4.0.7.148 or later&nbsp; This issue is described in more detail in this thread in the McAfee Community:&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://community.mcafee.com/message/473194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">https://community.mcafee.com/message/473194</span></a></span></p>

<p>Dear Mr. Robbins,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your reply - I did not expect it. I also admit that we felt quite down because we still do not see the way out using Word together with a 'good equation editor'.&nbsp; Here are a few thoughts about what you wrote:</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>'...Desig<span>n Science, who have a support forum that may be able to help you.&nbsp; See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/support/mathtype/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dessci.com/en/support/mathtype/default.asp</a>...'</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We have been in a direct contact with Design Science on over two occasions&nbsp; within last two months and they explained the situation. We would gladly send you full correspondence, but I do
 not know how to attach a file. We asked them to resolve the issue of 'embedded fonts in objects' and they suggested us to refer to you directly because&nbsp; they felt that a customer (unsatisfied one) is most likely having a larger influence on Microsoft decisions
 than a small developer. It looks from your reply that they have a 'good feeling' about the outcome.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2.</span></p>
<p><span>'...</span><span>Microsoft stopped promoting the MathType application itself.'</span></p>
<p><span>This is not completely true. We have seen on screen working with Word 2016 the text which I wrote in my previous message:
</span><span>Â»MathType is a powerful upgrade to Equation Editor with many additional features. Do you want to find out more about MathType?Â«</span>&nbsp;. We would be glad
 to send to the 'Print Screen image' of this text, just let us know how to send the attached file, if this is needed, of course. Therefore, if you are not promoting MathType anymore, then this message shows some floppynes and should be removed. It is also because
 of this message we turned directly to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'...<span>a possibility that the issue that you are facing may be caused by&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<span>caused by the presence of the McAfee AV utility.'</span></p>
<p>This is a constructive suggestion, linked to the Anti-Virus utility and we will most certainly explore it with the help of our software maintenance guys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply, once again, which positively surprised me. It is showing a good will of huge companies that can react to 'small people needs'...who are not handicapped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I sincerely apologize for not knowing 'who is who' and for thinking wrongly that 'Microsoft' replied me. I also deeply appreciate good will of unknown people that are trying to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks. I hope I could help someone else similarly. My concern right now is our new researcher who should write a lot of mathematical expressions and I am afraid that 'we will go away from Word', most likely turn to Latex (with which I started over
 30 years ago...). This means that others ('Word people without MathType) would have difficulties when they would be mixing 'our' product with their writing, when they would receive pdf files from us, or simple text file without visible equations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Company Design Science could point us to&nbsp;<span>McAfee AV utility, to verify it, when we were struggling with a question about what to do. I may only admit that an expert from this company published
 this potential source of difficulties, we are not following forums.</span></p>

<h2>            N86 - Outbox icon won&#39;t go away</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm turning to you guys for advice as I've tried for weeks and have not managed to solve this small but annoying problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Received my N86 from o2 two weeks ago, within hours of using it, the 'message sending' icon appeared in the top right of the screen next to the battery indicator.</p>
<p>Theres's nothing in the outbox, inbox, sent, drafts, reports. I deleted everything to ensure there was nothing trapped in the system. I've done a factory reset, tried removing the battery for hours, removing the sim, removing the memory card. I've looked
 through every menu in the phone and still havn't come up with a solution. It's like the phone is trapped in the middle of sending something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice or help would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>long shot here have you tried looking in the sim messages folder you could try the following codes and see if it remains</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>With all these operations I recommend you <strong>
<em>TAKE OUT MEMORY CARD</em></strong> and <em><strong>DO A BACK UP OF YOUR STUFF!!!
</strong></em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>NOTE: In front of the hash key ( #) there is also a STAR key that people often miss and state that the
<strong>code</strong> does not work.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><font color="#800080">1</font>.</span></strong>.<font color="#0000ff"><strong><span>
</span><span>*#7780#</span></strong></font> - <strong>
Restore factory settings</strong> - <strong>resets</strong> all the settings to the default ( you will not lose any data) Make sure you back up your data as you will lose all of it when you perform option 2 or 3 on this list. The default
<strong>code</strong> for ALL operations listed here is <strong><font color="#ff0000">12345</font><font color="#993300">.</font></strong><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><font color="#0000ff"><span><font color="#800080">2</font>.*#7370#
</span></font></strong>-<strong> Reformat </strong>your phone (out of the box, tho keep in mind that most newer
<strong>nokia</strong> phones at least n series, e series and s60 based phones have udp - user data preservation so not ALL data may be lost. still it is a good idea to always do a back up of your stuff.)3. This you perform as a last resort. Nothing else is
 working.If the phone is not showing any activity, proceed with hard formatting , turn off your phone, hold the following buttons while pressing the power button. (the default
<strong>code</strong> is <font color="#ff0000"><strong>12345</strong></font>)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span><font color="#800080">3</font></span>. hard
<strong>reset</strong></strong> - hold the following buttons</span><span><font color="#339966"><strong><span>
</span><span>* (star key),</span></strong></font></span><span><font color="#339966"><span><strong>
</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>3
</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>(number button) and
</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>talk/green</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong> key</strong></span></font>. turn on the phone and do not release those buttons
 until you see the <strong>Nokia</strong> boot up screen. once you feel the phone power up you can let go off the power button while still holding all three buttons ( for
<strong>Nokia</strong> 5800XM - use the following buttons to do a hard <strong>reset</strong>, /<span>GREEN/<span><span><font color="#993300">RED</font></span><span>/<font color="#0000ff">CA</font><font color="#0000ff">MERA</font><span>
 keys pressed all at once on power up. this will only work on 5800's that have firmware version 20... and up. ) For
<strong>Nokia</strong> N97 (unofficial version but works) is </span><font color="#0000ff">SHIFT /SPACE BAR / BACKSPACE</font><span> while holding the power button. Again do not let go until you see the handshake screen.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If these <strong>codes</strong> are not working the only thing for you to do is contact your
<strong>Nokia</strong> Care Center/Service for assistance.</span></p>

<p>urmmm...why dont you try to take your sim card out, and put in the phone you use before or other phone...</p>
<p>you might see the message that you cannot see in your N86, then you delete it, clear all your msg, then put your sim card back to N86, i think the problem will be solve.</p>

<p>firstly i am not familiar with the n86 so this may be useless, but if it was happening on my phone, i would try switching the message memory to internal memory,&nbsp;mass memory or memory card&nbsp;and checking if there is anything in the outbox in either of those,
 and then deleting it.&nbsp;as once you have&nbsp;changed to one, you can no longer see the messages in any box on&nbsp;the other memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>at least that's what I'd try with my N97, or n95. (s60v5 and s60v3)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But like i said i'm not sure if the n86 has the option&nbsp;to do that, but worth a look for you, right?</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, and i may be a million miles away on this but is the icon an arrow? this could be a missed call symbol that you have to flick through calls before it goes away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said I have a problem too and wondered if any one could help me out with it. I have an N86 which I have downloaded OVI maps 3.1, installed it, then had Conversations 9.20 downloaded and installed.</p>
<p>This is apparently a mind number, it has done somthing to my camera, eg: I cant view or take pic/vids, it has also messed up Real pplayer because it won't playback some vids on my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've seen in other forums that this software plays havoc with themes, but can't see any problems like mine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had this problem, and had the assumption it had to do with an email not being sent, though of course, it is not possible ot get into the email (hotmail in my case) outbox to delete it. I had my phone provider set up the email account in their store (Limassol,
 Cyprus) as well as MMS. Both seemed to work then, but have not worked since I walked out the door. Anyway, noticed the outbox icon always there. I today dleted my email account, and the icon went away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone, before the master reboot.</p>

<h2>            Word macros</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to record macros within a Word 2007 document. &nbsp;I can edit the document with no problems, but</p>
<p>as soon as I press "Record a Macro", a "cassette" icon appears, and I cannot do anything within the document.</p>
<p>Does Word 2007 actually allow recording macros (MS-Excel 2007 has deficiencies in macro recording), and
</p>
<p>if so, is there a parameter I need to set to allow the document to be edited?</p>

            Word 2007 allows recording macros. <br />
<br />
What do you mean "I cannot do anything within the document?" Please give examples of what you have tried to do. There are a number of actions the macro recorder has never been able to handle.<br />

            Before you start recording, you can make these changes?<br />
<br />
Test for me. <br />
Put your insertion point in the body of a blank document so you can type.<br />
Type "This is before recording." and press Enter.<br />
Then click on the record button and start recording (I'm assuming you put the record button on your status bar at the bottom.) Save the macro in the current document.<br />
Type "This is being recorded." and press Enter.<br />
Stop recording.<br />
<br />
Are you saying you can't type after you press the Record button?<br />

            The macro recorder has limited functionality and is incapable of recording all actions. It can sometimes be useful in identifying syntax for a particular task, but even then its constructions can be clumsy. For actions the recorder is incapable of you
 would have to code manually. e.g. for the sample code posted the following is simpler but cannot be created using the recorder.<br />
<br />
Dim oFooter As HeaderFooter<br />
Dim oRng As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oFooter = Selection.Sections(1).Footers(wdHeaderFooterPrimary)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oRng = oFooter.Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With oRng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .MoveStart wdCharacter, 35<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .End = oRng.Start + 10<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Text = "2012-11-06"<br />

This isn't the test I asked for, but it does tell me that the macro recorder is functioning. It is not preventing you from using Word. It may not be recording what you want recorded, but it never has recorded everything. It is not going to be useful for many
 functions.<br />

            <p>Sorry, it is whatever the current OSX version is - Office 2016. &nbsp;I am a tech writer and an expert Word user, it's just frustrating when you try and use these functions and they simply don't work. When you select the data file to generate labels, which was
 a simple .CSV file, the Select dialog box just sits there, and none of the buttons work. I left it for 20 minutes in case it was actually executing in the background, but nothing happened. I tried it on both the iMac (Yosemite) and a MacBook Pro which has
 an earlier OS, same result both times. That's when I googled the problem and found this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, I used the premium service in Eventbrite to generate name badges, it worked absolutely flawlessly and in about 5 minutes, after two hours of cursing at the screen (albeit for US$19.00).</p>
<p>

<br />
You should use the "contact us" link on the bottom of the page you bought the software from.<br />
<br />
Worst case, contact your credit card company and tell them to cancel the charge due to non-delivery. Another poster suggested that this might make MS "cranky" enough to cancel your email account.

    <title>duplicate skype accounts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            duplicate skype accounts</h2>
                    Hi - I have had a skype account with a user name for many years, but inadvertently (as I just bought a new laptop) have just created another one with my email that now is linked to my Microsoft account.&nbsp; How do I combine them (having seen a previous post
 it seems that I cannot delete the one I just created in error)?&nbsp; Can someone help please?&nbsp; Definitely a case of too much linked technology!

<p><span>Hello shep065,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, it is not possible to have the accounts merged.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To access the correct account,
<strong>sign in using the same credentials you have used in creating them</strong>. If you used a Skype name, sign in using your Skype name. If you have used an email address, log in using the same.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To view the accounts associated with your email address, click here:
