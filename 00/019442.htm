<h2>            Deleted a group - group name still exists</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I'm having some troubles with creating a group. I made one and deleted it because I couldn't change its status from internal to external group. Now I'd like to create it again with same name, but I can't because Yammer won't let me. It says:
<span>Name is in use by an existing group, user, or invited user.</span></p>
<span>Name is in use by an existing group, user, or invited user.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the group has been deleted by me, why it says that the name is taken? What should I do, I really need that name for my new external group.
</span></p>

</p><p>It takes normally 24-72 hours to get the data to sync with the Yammer database completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I hope that&nbsp;you are able to create the group with same name now, if you are unable to create the group with the same&nbsp;then please let&nbsp;us know.</p>

<p>Hello Maki,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting. I apologize for the delay in response. </p>
<p>Kindly confirm if the issue is resolved. If not then please take data export from Yammer admin center &gt; open group.csv file &gt; search for the group name &gt; pick the group id &gt; go to Yammer home page &gt; click on any other group &gt; In the URL replace the group
 id with the copied one &gt; take a screenshot &gt; if you see the group gear icon then open the settings &amp; delete it.</p>
<p>In case the issue persists I would suggest to create a service request with Yammer support team via Office 365 admin center &gt; Support &gt; create service request. We would require a Verified admin to work on the issue.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>How to move the location that Outlook 2007 looks for - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to move the location that Outlook 2007 looks for normalemail.dotm&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I have a user who's normalemail.dotm is on a network drive.&nbsp; Normally this isn't an issue, however his network drive is extremely cluttered and even browsing the folder in explorer can take 3-4 minutes to display all of the contents.&nbsp; The fact that his normalemail.dotm
 is stored there means the first time that he opens a new message can take 3-4 minutes while Outlook searches for the template.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my question is how do I force Outlook to look in a local location (or a different location at all) for the normalemail.dotm so I can move his template and avoid this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; My issue is nearly identical to this one:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/35425040/how-do-you-move-normalemaildotm-default-template.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/35425040/how-do-you-move-normalemaildotm-default-template.aspx</a>&nbsp; but he never seemed to get an answer (and posted to multiple forums out there in the process).</p>

<h2>            N70&#58; Tips and Tricks.</h2>
                    All,<br />
<br />
Thoughtit will be a great way to learn more tricks and tips about N70. So here is my contribution...Not all original but at one place nevertheless...please add on...<br />
<br />
1. To turn off the Nokia tune on switch on of N70 remember to press # key on keypad<br />
<br />
2. If you want to have autolock facility, download a small application from http://fuse.stc.cx/autolock/<br />
<br />
3. In case you have huge HTML files, its best to split them if you would like to read them on ur N70 as it does not seem to recognise format if size is huge.<br />
<br />
4. Check your firmware version by pressing *#0000#<br />
<br />
5. In all probability you should be able to get ur handset flashed free of cost. fonefix at york is where I got it done and yes it does improve response time.<br />
<br />
6. Beware: There seems to be something fishy with 3 and Nokia phones esp. N70 as people are finding it difficult to get it unlocked.(Source: some post on this forum)<br />
<br />
7. Remember you will be charged to get your phone flashed with generic version if it is locked to some service provider such as Orange, T-Mobile etc.<br />

            Hi Guys!<br />
<br />
Use those codes at your own risk! Not all of them are supported on every model, and if a problem occurs you may invalidate your warranty.<br />
<br />
Many of these features can be activated on the phone or by your network provider.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Please be wary of using the cancel all diverts GMS code. This will also remove some of the auto-divert functions on the network. I know that if you use the code while on the Orange network it screws up the Answerphone and also your video answerphone.<br />
<br />
"But I dont have a 3g phone" All Orange customers have the Orange Video answerphone, so that if someone makes a video call to you and you dont have 3G coverage it will send you the message as a MMS message.<br />
<br />
It can take quite a while for Tech support to spot what has happened and unless the right person picks up the action it will be weeks before things get put right.<br />
<br />
Please use these codes very wisely, if you are unsure DONT BOTHER!

Just wondering why people would use this rather than the built in verion on the N70?

<br />
hm...well I am not quite sure which built in function u r talking about as there isn't any autolock function in mine. Many others including the one who was source for this info have not found one either. It might be helpful if you write what steps you use to
 enable the preinstalled autolock facility you mentioned. It might add up as a useful tip altogether.<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

Ahh the keypad lock, left soft key and * (for which there is no auto function on the N70 unless you install a 3rd party application) and the security phone lock that you mention are two subtly different things.<br />
<br />
Most people prefer an auto keypad lock. I'm like you though, I prefer the auto phone lock so that no one apart from me can mess with my phone.<br />
<br />
Be warned, emergency numbers - 112 or 999 will always defeat both keypad lock and phone lock.<br />

<h2>            APP for Android - Microsoft Outlook - Need help.</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello everyone.<br />
<br />
I have two problems that I cant solve for 10 days.<br />
<br />
</span>With my Android SGS Edge 6:&nbsp;<span><br />
<br />
1. I want to sync my&nbsp;Outlook CONTACTS only from my MSN/LIVE account -&gt; (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)&nbsp;using
</span>"Microsoft Outllook for Android" application.<span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>2. I want to sync my email from my custom hosting company account -&gt; (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)&nbsp;
</span>using "Microsoft Outllook for Android" application.<span><br />
</span></p>
<div>
<p><br />
Before I continue I want&nbsp;to clarify:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>-Please have in mind that I am having problem with "Microsoft Outllook for Android" application only. Not with "Outlook.com" application.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- "Exchange-advanced-setup-steps" described at: </p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/to-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/to-go</a></span><span>&nbsp; were tried numerous times with the&nbsp;same "login error" problems.<br />
</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-The only application that I actually need is&nbsp;"<span>Microsoft Outlook for Android" that&nbsp;cant be&nbsp;c</span>onnected for some reasons&nbsp;to my MSN/Live account.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>-All other&nbsp;MS application like "OneDrive, MS Office and Outlook.com" worked fine. (All are uninstalled now.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I DISABLED two step verification and I am fine with that decision for now. (I also tried with and without app called "Microsoft Account for Android", without success.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Problems encountered and steps following:<br />
<br />
1. I installed Microsoft Outlook APP (not just Outlook.com application.)&nbsp;<br />
Wizard asks me to add an account.</p>
<p>I pick "Outlook.com"<br />
<span>-log in:&nbsp;</span><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span><br />
<span>-log in:&nbsp;</span><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span><br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t open Microsoft Word, Excel, etc except from Office app</h2>
                    <p>In summary:</p>
<p>1. The only way I can open Excel or Word is by launching from Office.</p>
<p>2. Once the application is opened, I can file&gt;open.</p>
<p>3. I&nbsp;<em>cannot</em> open Word or Excel files without first launching from Office, and even then, double-clicking/selecting "open with" doesn't work, it only works if I check "always use this app," and even then it only works for that particular instance.
 It does not stay checked and does not work for other files, or even the same file once closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked to see if I have multiple instances of Office installed, and I have Microsoft Office 365 - en-us and Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus - en-us. I don't want to uninstall without more info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the online repair on both of the Offices mentioned above, and nothing has changed. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            &#34;A Dialogue Box is Open. Close it and try again&#34; Error Message is preventing me from opening Outlook</h2>
                    I am currently using MS Outlook 2007 running on XP professional.&nbsp; A few days ago I started to get an error message "A dialogue box is open.&nbsp; Close it and try again" (but no dialogue box is visable or minimized) when trying to open Outlook. This does not
 occur when first opening outlook after booting up.&nbsp; It only occurs when you have opened Outlook once, closed outlook and are trying to open it again.&nbsp; When it is closed an outlook symbol with an "X" in a blue circle is shown in the task bar.&nbsp; I can use task
 manager to close outlook.exe (which still shows in the active processes") and then it will open.&nbsp; Any idea why this is happening and how I can fix it?

<p>Well I discovered the problem.&nbsp; I had been using a program called "Adware" which true to it's name scanned for various types of adware including scanning incoming email.&nbsp; I was going to update it today and noticed it would not open.&nbsp; After trying a few things
 I decided to delete and reinstall (it's a free program)&nbsp; As soon as I deleted it and tryed to reexecute the Outlook issue mentioned above it worked fine.&nbsp; Something about Adware was interfering with Outlook closing.&nbsp; Thanks for responding so quickly to my
 issue.&nbsp; Something to keep in mind if there are other Adware users out there.</p>

 available (which is not true!) and that the mail will be send once I refresh&nbsp;the account. Indeed, it tries to send the massage but fails with a communication error. I should try again later...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I basically tried everything: 2 different networks, 3 different mail providers, pop/imap, un/encrypted connection... &nbsp;I can only send mails using a Nokia Mail account, with which it works right away, i.e. no network-not-available-error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mail version: 1.0.28</p>
<p>Firmware: 04.51</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any solutions or ideas? Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Stud89,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Nokia Support Discussions!&nbsp;:smileyhappy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About your concern, have you tried checking what is the primary connection that you have on your phone? If not, you can go to Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Configuration &gt; Activate Configurat. &gt; Choose if you want to use Sim 1 or Sim 2 for the connection &gt; Select "Web"
 then it will ask for what internet access point you want to use. After that, try to go back to your Email and send an email to your own Email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know what will be the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for your reply! Unfortunately, this does not solve the problem (I am also only using one Sim). As already pointed out in my first post, there is NO general internet connection problem. It must be something about the mail app. Could someone please
 confirm that 1.0.28 is the latest mail version?! Does anybody else have similar problems?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Bullet Position in Powerpoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charpatton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bullet Position in Powerpoint</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a long talk that I made in Keynote, but I want to give it in Powerpoint. I use the Export feature in Keynote (v 6.6.2) and the talk is converted into a .pptx file and everything seems essentially the same, EXCEPT that the bullet position at the start
 of each sentence is too high. </p>
<p>
</p><p>That is, in Keynote the bullet is just to the left of the line of text and looks fine, but in .pptx the bullet is shifted up so that the top of the text is essentially alligned with the bottom of the bullet. It thus looks a bit funny.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to go into PPT and shift each bullet down a tad so that it is aligned with the middle of the text?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>

            Steve and Bob both have the right answer: PowerPoint bullets don't have an adjustable baseline or height, so increasing the bullet percentage also increases the height above the baseline. As a workaround, trying using a bullet from a different font. Different
 fonts have different size bullets, so if you find one that is the right size at a particular percentage, it may sit at a normal height. The Symbol font and the Wingdings or other dingbat fonts may have the bullet you're looking for.

            Have you checked the Bullets Inspector in Keynote to see whether the defaults have been modified? For example, the bullet elevation can be adjusted but I don't believe PowerPoint will recognize the deviation.<br />

            <p>Dear LazyH,</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your question in the forum.</p>
<p>Before we can start to look for any troubleshooting steps, I would need some further information.</p>
<p>First of all, could you please check which OS-Version you are currently running on your Windows Phone 7?</p>
<p>You can look that up in:</p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Settings</p>

</span></span></span>About</p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>More Information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to know if this is a Software Update or a Firmware Update.</p>
<p>If your current version is 7.0.7392.0 your software is up to date and you will need to contact the manufacturer, which is HTC in your case.</p>
<p>If your OS-Version is another, we know that it is an OS-Update and we can look for more steps.</p>
<p>Please make sure that the Operating System on your PC is running the latest updates as well.</p>
<p>You can check and download updates via</p>

</span></span></span>Control Panel</p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Windows Update</p>
<p>There you can check for the latest updates.</p>
<p>Please let me know if this was helpful and what you could find out about your OS-Version and the update.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your answer.</p>

<h3> cybersal  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do I delete all my contacts from a phone running windows mobile 5</h2>
                    I am disposing of an old mobile phone which runs Windows mobile 5<br />
<br />
For security reasons, I want to delete all the contacts. I've tried doing a full hardware reset but can't get this to work properly<br />
<br />
I have looked in the help documentation, but can't see any way of doing this.<br />
<br />
It's been quite tedious figuring out what to do to decommission the phone,<br />
&nbsp;making sure<br />
a) nothing important is lost<br />
b) nothing that compromises my security is passed on to the next owner<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could give this some thought as to how to make this easy when/if you produce the next version of the operating system?

            What device are you using?<br />
<br />
Some devices have a software program that will effectively do a hard reset for you.&nbsp; Usually it is called Clear Storage and often is found in Settings under the System Tab.<br />
<br />
I do not have a WM5 device with me so I can't check this but if you open Contacts, click on Menu there might be a menu tem that says "select Contacts".&nbsp; Choosing this will give an option to select several or all.&nbsp; Selecting all then you can delete.&nbsp; This s
 available on the device&nbsp; have wth me but I'm not sure f you have the same option.

                    I got a new iPhone 6 last night (iOS 9.1). &nbsp;I want to use Outlook - not Mail or Outlook.com - for my IMAP email account (@hawaii.rr.com). &nbsp;I keep geting an "unable to login" error message. &nbsp;I confirmed with my email service provider that the mail server

 of those are the problem. &nbsp;In the Outlook app's new account setup, under Advanced Settings, I noticed there is no place to enter the SSL/port info, nor to check whether authentication is req'd . The only fields available are email address, display name, description,
 IMAP host name, IMAP username, IMAP password, SMTP host name, SMTP username, SMTP password. &nbsp;There are no other fields &nbsp;below to scroll down to. &nbsp;I can't get to anything else in t

            This is a matter of bar styles. If you go to format, bar styles you will see a table which shows the colour and shape of each type or style of bar, and there is also a text tab which determines what text appears alongside what bar.<br />

<h2>            Powerpoint for Mac 2016 &#40;and 2011&#41; &#34;Some files may contain virus...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have Office 2016 for Mac, and when I add a link on Powerpoint, on opening it appears the message:<br />
<br />
"Opening path/filename.<br />
Some files can contain viruses or otherwise be harmful to your computer. <br />
It is important to be certain that this file is from a trustworthy source. <br />
Would you like to open this file?"<br />
<br />
Then you can give the approval to continue and it opens.<br />
<br />
This is happening when I add a hyperlink of a PDF file or video file that is saved on my Mac (El Capitan).<br />
<br />
On the other hand it works properly if I add a hyperlink of :<br />
1. The web<br />
2. Word file<br />
3, Picture <br />
<br />
I disabled Macros and turned down firewall but same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Any ideas? </p>

 my phone, with no luck.&nbsp; I have updated glance screen from the store.&nbsp; Still no options.&nbsp; Also the gadgets hub keeps telling my that it needs to reboot my phone before I can use it, but when I click ok, I just get the "waiting dots" flash across the screen

            Kindly use Windows Device Recovery Tool.. Some issues while updating your phone... This software would fix the issue...

            I have tried the Recovery Tool on two different computers, as well as a handful of different USB cables.&nbsp; Every time I plug it in, the phone complains about charging slowly, and the software will not detect the phone.&nbsp; The device will charge normally plugged
 into the wall plug&nbsp;using all of the cables that I have.

            BTW, this is a Lumia 1520.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have a 640 sitting around, and in thinking maybe I had a bunch of broken cables, I plugged it into the pc, and the recovery tool recognized it immediately..&nbsp; My 1520 still doesn't get recognized when plugged into the
 PC.

<h2>            Windows Mobile 2006 and Microsoft Reader</h2>
                    
<p>As an avid user of Microsoft Reader on Windows Mobile 2005, I'm wondering what the plans are for the support of this product on 2006. Also, I must say that the performance on MS Reader on my MDA for WM 2005 was not very good. The application would often
 hang requiring a reboot before I could access my books. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have thoughts, comments, suggestions?</p>

            Yes, I have one device with WM6 on it and Reader is working fine.&nbsp; Although it is not my primary device for reading ebooks ( I use my Palm 750 as my primary device), I am satisfied with it.&nbsp; I do wish books loaded a little quicker but once it is up, I
 enjoy reading with it.
