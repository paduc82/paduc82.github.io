<h2>            Lost Phone No Longer Being Tracked</h2>
                    My phone was stolen a during May 2016, The tracking/lost phone feature was enabled, and it reported the phone location up to the day it was stolen. I was monitoring the location with the hope that when the phone was back in use the location would be reported.
 The police could then use this to recover the phone for me. For some reason the device is no longer being reported in the devices section of OneDrive. Can anyone provide an answer that explains why the device is no longer being reported to my OneDrive?

<h2>            MS14-068 for Technical Preview&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the bulletin for MS14-068 (<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS14-068" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS14-068</a>) it says that an update to fix this issue will be available for the Technical Preview along with all
 the other versions. I see no such update on build 9879.</p>
<p>Also, I presume the rest of November's security updates are included in 9879, as it was published the day after the patches were made available. But clearer communication on this would be most welcome. I like to know whether I'm vulnerable to known issues,
 even when running pre-release software. Especially as some of the issue patched in the November updates were rather severe.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Display Resets</h2>
                    I just installed 9926 on my SP3 from 8.1. The display keeps resetting and I can't get much done. I did make it to the event viewer for a second to see a warning about the intel graphics driver.&nbsp; Any ideas on how to get this resolved - outside of rolling
 back?

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue with constant display driver crashes. The only way to get the January preview to a stable state is to uninstall the Intel graphics drivers. Windows then uses the basic drivers, which have much worse performance, but at least it works.
 I hope there will&nbsp;be a compatible version of the Intel drivers soon!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I ran Windows Update AFTER uninstalling the Intel graphics drivers and rebooting the system and it installed a compatible version of the Intel driver! It works :D</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>René</p>

            <p>It would be easier to say what I don't like. I&nbsp;don't I like the lack of international support. We don't have the music store, which makes us locked out of the podcast directory. Hello unstable, manual RSS feeds.</p>
<p>We also don't get features like Local Scout, even though there's entries for Canadian locations.&nbsp;No public transport in Bing Maps is difficult for me, but I manage since I know where I'm going 99% of the time. OH, and no app management.</p>
<p>I don't have time to say what i like about the phone. There's just too much to say on that front. It's a solid competitor in the mobile race and is pretty to boot.
</p>
<p>Since I was also replacing my iPod nano, I needed something with a strong media manager as well. WP7 allowed me to consolidate devices.</p>
<p>Online syncing of my important data has reduced my worried about copying and keeping backups. I just don't have to worry about that stuff anymore. Technology working for man.</p>

    <title>Automatic Replies to Every New Email - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Automatic Replies to Every New Email</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
I am using Outlook through Office 365 on a Windows 8 machine.<br />
<br />
My team and I have figured out how to set up an Automatic Reply for when we are out of the office, however, the option we found only allows for the Auto Response to be sent once to each contact. Since we receive orders from customers and may be out of the office
 for extended periods of time, we would prefer that an Automatic Response be sent to the sender each time a new email is received.<br />
<br />
Can someone provide step by step instructions on how we can make this work? I'm guessing this&nbsp;will have to be&nbsp;part of the "Rules and Alerts" system but I'm hoping these is something easier we can create through the Automatic Responses function&nbsp;instead.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks!</p>

            Outlook remembers which addresses receive an automatic reply and will not resend to that same address unless you close and reopen Outlook. If you are using an Exchange server for the reply, then the reply will go out only once per day.&nbsp; As far as I know,
 this is immutable and is true even for replies you send via rule.&nbsp; This is to prevent mail loops when both ends send autoreplies or one end sends a delivery report.

                    <p>Guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>for the last 8 months I have been locked out of my skype account. I have submitted around 4 or 5 forms which have all been denied for some reason. I have had around 5 online chats. still im locked out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>someone or possibly a corrupted new galaxy phone has changed my e mail address reg with skype to a friends e mail address as the reg e mail. it has or someone has changed my reg phone number to this friends aswell. I am unable to reset my passowrd as a result.
 There must be a way to verify me. can i send a scan of some ID or what? im not willing to open a new account as all my contacts are in there and I have no other way of contacting them to tell them. and without stating the obvious you guys are uncontactable.
 there is no phone number to call to speak with an human being.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We understand how frustrating it is to fill out the form multiple times and still not able to recover the account. But please be reminded that such form is established in the interest of data and account security. This means that the system will only grant
 access to the person who will be able to pass the verification process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, the best recourse I would strongly recommend you to do would be to revisit the answers you have provided on the form, change what you think may be inaccurate, and resubmit the form. Should that fail again, I suggest that you create a new account
 instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello Jamie, <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Broken components in the system files can be one of the factors why this issue occurs. To provide you the appropriate steps that can resolve your concern, I'd like to ask you a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you getting any error codes along with those error messages? If so, a screenshot of it is highly appreciated.</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far to resolve your concern?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting steps, I'd recommend running the <em><strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management</strong></em> (<strong><em>DISM</em></strong>) tool and
<em><strong>System File Checker </strong></em>(<strong><em>SFC</em></strong>) utility to find and fix corruptions on your device related to the broken entries. To do this, you can perform the. following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open an <em><strong>elevated command prompt</strong></em>. To do this, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<strong><em>Search</em></strong>. Or, if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then click
<strong><em>Search</em></strong>. Type <em><strong>Command Prompt</strong></em> in the
<strong><em>Search</em></strong> box, right-click <em><strong>Command Prompt</strong></em>, and then click
<em><strong>Run as administrator</strong></em>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the
<strong><em>password</em></strong>, or click <strong><em>Allow</em></strong>.</li><li>Type the following command, and then press <strong><em>Enter</em></strong>. It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<em><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></em></li><li>Once <strong><em>DISM</em></strong> is done, type the following command and press
<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>. It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<em><strong>sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
</strong></em></li></ol>
<em><strong>Note:</strong></em><em> Turn off the third-party antivirus that you're using before running the DISM tool and SFC utility.
</em><br />
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</p>

<p>-There is no particular error code accompanied the stop code shown on the 'green screen'</p>
<p>- I try to undo any recent change to the driver and doesn't find any. I still suspect it might be a driver problem, and try to reinstall the drivers.</p>
<p>- The stability of the system seems slightly improve after installing the <em>
cumulative update for Windows 10 version next,&nbsp;</em>Today it only crashed twice during the usage, compared with dozens in yesterday.</p>
<p>- During running the <strong><em>sfc</em></strong><em><strong>&nbsp;/</strong></em>&nbsp;<em><strong>scannow</strong></em> the
<strong>System Service Exception</strong> Immerged once again, without any particular error codes.
</p>
<p>- A check in the event log found that at the particular moment of crashed there seems to be a
<strong>volmgr</strong>&nbsp;error (id:161) and a <strong>nssm</strong> error (id:1018) occurred, don't know is the consequence or the reason for the error.(They seem to be occurring in every time I get a 'green screen' from yesterday.)</p>
<p>- SFC eventually return with a clean report, saying no conflict of completeness was detected.</p>

<p>Tried to find the DMP files when the system crashed a numerous time, but they don't show up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Event viewer, I still get the volmgr&nbsp;error even using the small memory dump option. It seems like for some reason the system is not creating dump files at all.</p>
<p>After update to 17134.1 the system temporarily gets better, but now the Unexpected Store Error come up again and the frequency can reach up to 1 hour intervals. Attempt to go back to 17133.73 but that doesn't change the situation</p>

                    We utilize a publication which is issued for a specific day of the week, but prepared in advance of that day. Is there a way to have the document insert the date for the specific upcoming day of the week. For example, prepare the document on Wednesday
 but have it insert the date for Friday?

<h2>            Why would Word not replace all occurrences&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently had a proposal that I needed to share &amp; wanted to remove all references of the client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked replace &amp; typed in the name, chose *** to go in place &amp; checked the first page - all references had been changed, so I shared the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was then surprised to hear the name of the client come back from people I'd shared the document with - so it appears Word has randomly selected about half of the names &amp; left the others - running exactly the same replace a second time changed the rest
 - why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is completely unacceptable that an action does not produce the same result each time - how are we meant to trust the product?</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Word will replace all instances <em>within the scope</em> of the replace. If you use Ctrl+A to select all text and then run the replace, areas not reached will include headers and footers and text boxes. Names in images will not be included. This is one reason
 that, as a lawyer, I use templates rather than documents as the basis for new documents. Many (most?) users are not aware of this scope limitation and in the case of headers/footers may not even see them since some headers/footers may not even display when
 a document is edited (i.e. even-page headers). <br />
<br />
Take a look at the document that you sent out, before and after the replace. Look in headers and footers.
<br />
<br />
For headers and footers, I seldom include client or sensitive information directly but rather use a StyeRef field to incorporate the information from the body of the document.
<br />
<br />
I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />
Regards
        </p>

            Are you sure that other words met the criterion actually? Can you go to second page and do the replacement and see whether they are getting replaced?

            Hi Rick,<br />
<br />
If two companies have different Office 365 tenants, the users in Company A can’t access Company B’s SharePoint site until the admin in Company B shares the files with them via external sharing. For example, user A in Company A has a Work/school account
<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***,com</em>, User B in Company B has a Work/school account
<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em>. Since they are in different Office 365 tenants, user A can’t access the team sites in Company B with his/her account
<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em> if the admin doesn’t share it with this account.<br />
<br />
Therefore, please check the permissions for these users from Company A who try to access Company B’s team site at the site level as below:
<br />
<br />
1. As a SharePoint admin in Company B, go to the team site. <br />
2. Click the settings icon like gear &gt; Site Settings &gt; Users and Permissions &gt; Site permissions &gt; Check Permissions.
<br />
3. Type the user’s account in Company A and click Check Now. <br />
4. If the user in Company A doesn’t have permission at Company B’s team site, please click Grant Permissions to invite him/her to the site.
<br />
<br />
If this is not your situation, to clarify the scenario, could you confirm the following details?
<br />
<br />
1. Do the users from Company A try to access the Company B’s team site with their account in Company A or B?
<br />
2. Does the issue occur when they access the teamsite with the Office client or when they log into the teamsite in the browser?
<br />
3. About” A couple of employees get a blank screen after selecting the URL for the SharePoint site”, could you share with us more detailed steps and a screenshot about the blank screen?
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shirley

<p>hi adom6800,</p>
<p>for outlook for ios related issues, we recommend you move forward to a dedicated support where you can use the in-app support.<br />
<strong>*note</strong> when using the in app support.<br />
1. it can take a while for a representative to get back to the user. it is recommended that the user turn on notifications for outlook in order to know when the technician is available.<br />
2. if you don’t have notifications turned on, then when the user opens the app again and goes to support, you should see a response from the technician.<br />
3. it is recommended that the user’s initial question be as fully descriptive as possible of the situation.<br />
example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4e55ed1-f892-4cea-ac5a-a4a3ca74b79a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4e55ed1-f892-4cea-ac5a-a4a3ca74b79a" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b1838749-140c-4239-9906-fb71f734b1bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b1838749-140c-4239-9906-fb71f734b1bb" /></a></p>

            <p>If you're dealing with a deeply nested multiple IIF construct, consider using the Switch() function instead; it takes arguments in pairs, evaluates them left to right, and when it first finds a pair with a TRUE value in the first element it returns the second
 element of that pair. This can make multiple comparisons more compact, more readable, and easier to maintain.</p>
<p>Often, though, you don't need any IIF or Switch or other code at all, if the problem can be recast into a query with a "translation table". Perhaps you could post an example of the kind of problem you're trying to solve, there may be a simpler alternative!</p>

            Hi Slandlord,
If logged into https://outlook.live.com/ To delete emails permanently select emails Select the Circle beside Deleted Items in the deleted Items folder Hold the shift Key and press delete. DELETE button on either your keyboard or your ribbon. You'll get a pop up Do you want to permanently delete selected items click ok. 
Or you can select emails in Application by:
On your keyboard hold the CTRL Key and the A if it highlights all the emails then hold shift and press delete. 
If the CTRL A doesn't work then use the CTRL and Shift. Highlight the first email hold the shift key on your keyboard and select the last email.  
The best way to permanently delete something is to hold the SHIFT key and press the DELETE button on either your keyboard or your ribbon this way the email does not go into the restore folder it is gone for good.
Also delete emails out of your Junk mail folder using the above directions. 

Then clear browser Cache and Cookies on your browser and Restart computer.&nbsp;

            Dear Bill,
<br />
<br />Do you get any error messages while deleting the emails ?
<br />If you have another device, try to log to your account there in Private browsing and delete the emails. If delete does not work try to use sweep to delete them <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/organize-your-inbox-with-archive-sweep-and-other-tools-in-outlook-com-19eee6b9-09a1-4db6-b5d6-37644190884f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/organi...</a>
<br />
<br />Also please go to Deleted Items and click on Recover items deleted from this folder, then click on any email there and press Ctrl+A and choose delete.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you were able to delete the emails.

            Hi 	Slandlord
<br />What browser are you using or application are you using to access your mail? Have you tried in a different browser?
<br />Are you on a PC or Mac
<br />What OS are you on example Windows 10? 
<br />When you try to delete using Shift delete do you get a pop up? 
<br />Let me know so I can further troubleshoot the problem with you.

<p>I am on a PC running Windows 7.&nbsp; My browser of choice is Chrome but after your suggestion I tried IE.&nbsp; It didn't work either and the&nbsp; emails are still stuck in the deleted folder.&nbsp; I was reading someone else on here who has the same problem.&nbsp; She thinks
 it has to do with the new version of Outlook.</p>

            If you think that is the case then log in to the classic version and try to delete from there. 
<br /><a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/classic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/classic</a>
<br />Lets give this a try 
<br />It may be a replication problem have you tried deleting just 1 to see if it works. 
<br />I mean broken is broken lets get it fixed. Delete 1 email highlight it hold the shift key on your keyboard and press delete. Do you get the pop up?
<br />If 1 works try deleting them by the method above but only 10 at a time if 10 works try 15. If 15 works try 20. I'm being approximate Do the Shift select and do about 10. 
<br />The fix may be setting Chrome back to default , You restore Chrome setting to default to see if it works if it is working then it could be an extension. Add them back one by one.
<br />Extensions found open a chrome browser and put ing the link below         chrome://extensions/  
<br />take a screenshot and save. 
<br />Open the Chrome browser, click on Hamburger (looks like 3 horizontal lines)  then Settings. Scroll  to the bottom and click on "Advanced Settings", then scroll all the way to the bottom of that page and click on "Restore settings to there original default". You can click on learn more. You may need to go back to your settings to enable some of your plug ins or browser extensions, 
<br />Reset Settings choose whether to Help Chrome. Then "Reset setting"  
<br />
<br />Let me know: 
<br />What version of Chrome do you have? Open up a Chrome browser and put in the link below:
<br />chrome://settings/help 
<br />
<br />Should say:
<br />Google Chrome is up to date
<br />Version 70.0.3538.110 (Official Build) (64-bit)
<br />What extensions do you have in Chrome?
<br />chrome://extensions/
<br />The problem may be they don't work together. It's application based it could be a security setting in your antivirus, it could be a firewall rule it could be a blocker you have set up on your browser. It could be many number of things. I know mine works on the version above so lets get yours working. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if it works if not we may have to find out what is causing the problems. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

            Dear whatsitschops,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products. Please note that I am a user like you.
<br />
<br />If you search for emails using the search function, it does not search in junk and in deleted items, so please check this manually. Also, you can search for all emails within a specific range. Click on search bar, it will expand, click on the symbol at the end of the bar, pop up menu will appear, select the range ( please see the screenshot ). After you will select it type all into the search bar and press enter. This should show all the emails within that specific time frame.
<br />
<br />If you will find emails in Deleted items, you can try to restore emails using suggestions in this support article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restore-deleted-email-messages-in-outlook-com-cf06ab1b-ae0b-418c-a4d9-4e895f83ed50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restor...</a>
<br />
<br />In order to retrieve the emails that were deleted more than 30 days you can use Email Recovery App <a href="https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104380447?tab=Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/o...</a> First insert the Microsoft Account from which you want to retrieve emails (These instructions better to perform on PC in browser)
<br />For the new Outlook.com
<br />1. Login to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a>
<br />2. Click the gear icon at the upper right side of the screens then click view full setting.
<br />3. Select Mail &amp;gt; Customize actions, then click “Get Add-ins” and hit save.
<br />4. In “Inbox” folder, click an email (if you don’t have an email, please try to send a test email to your own email account, then once you received the test email, please click on it.)
<br />5. Click the “Gift” icon (Get Add-ins)
<br />6. Type and enter “Email Recovery” (without quote symbol)
<br />7. In the search result, under the “Email Recovery”, click “Add” button.
<br />8. Click “X” icon to exit.
<br />9. Go back to “Customize actions” page, click “Email Recovery” and hit save.
<br />10. Again, in “Inbox” folder, click an email, then the “Email Recovery” icon will be visible now, and click on it.
<br />11. Recover both Recoverable Items and Purges.
<br />12. Please do not do anything while the recovery is in progress.
<br />13. Once it’s finished, a folder will appear on the left pane which contains the emails that you recovered.
<br />
<br />Please note that there is no guarantee that those emails will be restored as it depends on server status and what happened to the storage space where they were stored.
<br />
<br />Also I advise you to request the export of emails after you will (hopefully) recover emails <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/export" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/e...</a>

<h3> kjwathne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Margins in PowerPoint 2007</h2>
                    
<p>I want the pagesize to be A4 on all slides, and I want the outer margin on top, bottom, right, left to be 10 mm (1 cm). How can I set this as a custom size in PowerPoint? Then I want shapes etc to float exactly on to this margin, not below and not above
 - just excatly at 10 mm from the page edge.</p>
<p>Possible?</p>

<p>PowerPoint doesn't have margins as such, and at least in part the margins you get when you print are dependant on your printer; very few printers can print clear to the edge of the page.</p>
<p>Vinay has explained how to set a custom page size.</p>
<p>I would do something like this:</p>
<p>Set the page size to A4, assuming that's what you'll be printing on.&nbsp; Create a slide that's nothing but a colored background.&nbsp; Print it, making sure to REMOVE the check next to "Scale to fit paper".&nbsp; That will cause PPT to send the slide out to the printer
 at full size, not scaled down to accommodate the printer's margins.</p>
<p>The resulting page will likely have an unprinted margin.&nbsp; That'll tell you how close to the edge your printer is physically capable of printing.&nbsp; In all probability, the margin will be a bit less than 1cm, in which case you can do what you're after.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next step would be to define a custom page size that's A4 dimensions less 20mm in both directions (10 mm border on each side).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shapes will land where you put them, but PPT will snap them to the edges of the slide so it'll be fairly simple to ensure that they land where you want them to.&nbsp; There may be a few other tricks to get what you want but let's start with that and not try to
 solve problems that you don't have. ;-)</p>
<p>When you print, you'll need to make sure that "Scale to fit paper" remains unchecked.</p>

<h2>            Help connecting 6126 to PC Suite</h2>
                    I have a Nokia 6126 and have downloaded PC Suite onto my computer. I want to download pictures taken with the phone to my computer but am having much difficulty connecting. I'm using a CA-53 cable to connect the phone to the computer.<br />
<br />
I get a message that says:<br />
<br />
Port_#0001 Hub_#0001 connected in non-compatible mode, change it from phone UI<br />
<br />
I have no idea what this means.<br />
<br />
Does this mean I'm using the wrong type cable? If so what type cable do I need?<br />
